Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ Thank you so much for all the hard work and effort you put into this book. The book is filled with information and examples.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________   "It's the best book I've ever read. It has the same feel and tone of my favorite series of the past few years: ____. This is a book that I could just read again and again, and enjoy each time." -Alex R.   (review of free book)  Review by: Melissa F on Dec. 26, 2013 :  This book is great. I bought it for my son as he is a huge Star Wars fan. He said it reminded him of a video game that he used to play when he was a kid. The book starts out with a bit of a mystery to start, but then it takes off. The characters are well written and interesting. I would love to see more books in this series.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********  "We were not impressed with The Devil in the White City. The plot is rather lame and the book lacks the originality and imagination of some of the better books that have been written about the Manson murders. The characters are not well developed and we get more of the same, including a rather silly scene where the girls are discussing how much better their husbands are than their murderers. The book is just another in the series of books about the Tate-La Bianca murders."  Read a positive criticism about a bad book:  ****  ""The Devil in White City" has been on my mind lately. I don't understand how a book that takes place during the Manson Murders can be called a good read, much less a "good" book. The story is weak. I think that this book should be a one-shot or a one and done." -Catherine L. Fischman,  Hachette, New York, NY  We would like to express our appreciation for the opportunity to read the book. We found the characters, especially the girls, to be a bit weak, even though the author did an excellent job of developing them. We also found the book to be rather tedious. We were looking forward to reading more about the girls.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was very useful.  I can't imagine the amount of time I would have spent researching this stuff.  I'm a pretty good reader but this book made my brain work much faster.    I think the information was pretty solid.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book was very good and I really enjoyed it. I thought it was an interesting look into the life of a modern day pirate. I think a lot of pirate fiction has fallen into the trap of "good guys do it bad, bad guys do something bad, good guys do the good thing" and I think that there was something very interesting and fresh about this pirate. He is a lot more likable than I expected, which is a good thing. I do wish there was a little more of the backstory to his life but that was just a small problem. I would recommend this book to a younger audience who enjoys the idea of pirates.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a long time fantasy reader and when I read this book I fell in love.   The writing is fantastic. The writing is just amazing. I had to take a break to read this.   the characters are well written. The story was just amazing and the characters were just amazing! I loved them all.   (although I think I am a bit on the older side of the genre)   As I said in my first review, I don't want to spoil anything but I will tell you that there is a scene that is one of the most graphic I have ever read. I'm not kidding. I could not put it down.  . The characters are just amazing (even though they are somewhat different than you might think).   A great book, I would definitely read again.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book provides a compelling explanation of how the "lazy gene" theory is based on an erroneous theory. The book provides some new insights, but its overall value is limited by the many errors and the lack of discussion of the many important points of the theory.  This is not a work that I would recommend to the general reader, but to anyone who has been interested in the subject or has an interest in the history of biology."  -- Michael D. J. Haughey Review: A new edition of the classic textbook in developmental biology--which, despite a good reputation for scientific rigor, has been largely neglected by graduate students in the past decades.  I am a senior in high school.  I have been taking this textbook for over 3 years.    It has been my guide in the evolution of the nervous system and the evolution and development of the brain.  The book is easy to read, and it provides great information.  There are a few errors in the book but overall the book is well-written.  - D.R.H.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This book was very useful to me. It was written in a very friendly manner, and the advice was very well put together.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ My husband has been a fan of The Secret Garden ever since it was first published. When we got the book in the mail we immediately started reading. I found the book to be a good story that was well told. It was good to read about a young boy growing up in a small town and learning to be the man he was meant to be. My husband liked the fact that he didn't have to wait until he was an adult to have this book. He had it at his side the whole time he was growing up. I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This book is a great book to read! The content is interesting and interesting, especially for an English speaking woman who is a member of a minority group. The author did a great job of portraying her culture. The book is not perfect, but I would definitely recommend this book to someone who is interested in her culture and would like to learn more about it. It has a very positive and enlightening ending, which I found to be very refreshing. Also, the author did not make any racist comments in this book. I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to learn about the history of her culture!

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ I read this book for the first time about 2 months ago. It's about a girl named Jessica who wants to get a new job and start over in life. She doesn't get the job, but she gets a new car. I'm really into that idea of being a new person, going into a new place and feeling different and like a new being. She gets a job, and starts out by going to work on a new machine and she is the only one who knows about it. Soon she is told she's being fired because she doesn't fit in. She then decides to try out the new machine in a new field and is amazed at what she discovers. I can't wait to read more!

Write a positive review about a good book:  "I have a great appreciation for the authors who have written a good science fiction book. I like the book as a standalone story, but I enjoyed the background information about the people involved and their motivations.  The book is about the search for the elusive planet, but there is enough here to keep me going for the rest of the trilogy."
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's not a perfect book, but I think the author has a good grasp of the subject and the book is well researched and thought out.  If you have a little time to kill and a desire to learn more about a controversial topic (I'm looking at you, autism) then you'll enjoy this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ I think I'll be reading this again. This is one of the best books I've read this year. I loved the ending. I love the characters. I like the worldbuilding. I am just looking forward to the next book. I read this in the spring of '11. The book is so well written and I have so many of the characters I like from the series. _________________________________________________  So, it's been about a year since I started the series, but I'm still reading them. I'm not going to reread this book to see if I missed anything or if it made a difference, but it's so fun to read and so well-written, that I can't wait to get started again.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book for the price. I've been searching for an easy to use and inexpensive way to read. I found this book and I will definitely purchase more books in the future. I love how easy it is to read on the go. It's very fun.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The story of the book is told in the form of a letter that is mailed to the mother of a little girl who is in a hospital for a surgery and who is apparently getting worse and worse. It's a letter of concern about her condition and the doctor's recommendation that she should not have any more children. The letter is addressed to the woman's husband, but it doesn't end there; there's a request for the man to visit the hospital as well to see for himself what's happening to his wife. There are also many comments about the way in which the man treats his wife and the ways in which his own life is more than adequate for a wife. The whole thing is a very well-written, emotionally stirring story."
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a fan of many books by women authors, but this is one that I kept coming back to, and still do so to this day.  It has been a great read since the first chapter, and I enjoyed it a lot.  What I Liked: The characters were realistic.    I liked the way that they all dealt with some kind of loss that they were unable to deal with before, but were able to move on.      The story was told from the female point of view.  I was intrigued by how she dealt with losing her daughter, but at the same time, didn't want to be too judgmental of her choices.  And, how she kept herself going through everything that came her way.  There are some parts of the story that are a bit too sentimental, but I like the idea of what the girl was going through.  Also, the way the story was written and how the book is told from a female point-of-view, was just perfect for me. What Didn't: The book starts out with a lot of drama, but it doesn't last long, and it's not very interesting.  It just gets very sad very quickly, and after a few chapters, it's just over.  The ending wasn't what I was expecting, but the character growth in the story, and the story as a whole was great, and made it a great book.  But, I didn't enjoy how quickly things ended.  Again, I just wish it was longer.  In summary, this is a good story, but not one I would re-read, unless it was in a good mood. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this in a single sitting about a week ago, and I couldn't put it down. This book is a must read, but I found it very challenging. I've been reading about this for years now and always thought the book was wrong, but not this time. I have a couple of comments, however. One is that it was very hard to get into this book, the second was the ending was a bit odd to me. If the book had been more readable, I think I would have liked it.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________   Good read - I've already read it twice. The story itself is very well done, and it is fun.
Write a positive review about a good book: ************* This is a wonderful book. The author did a wonderful job on writing a story that would appeal to young adult readers. I was amazed at the characters, and at the way the story was told. The story has a great plot and the characters are likable. The only thing that kept me from being completely hooked was that I found it a little slow at times. However, once I got into it, I found myself enjoying it. I will be purchasing more books from this author. I would recommend this book to any young adult reader. It is a well written and entertaining story.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I got this as a free gift with my purchase of "The Red Queen's War". I enjoyed this one. The setting is different from the other book in the series, but it doesn't take long to get into. It's a fantasy world and the main characters are very likable. The story is a bit slow at the start, but the author makes up for it with some great scenes later on. Overall, this is a very good book. It took me a while to get used to the different culture and setting, but once I got used to it I was hooked. The characters are well developed and have a lot of depth. The worldbuilding is excellent and the magic system is unique.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I really enjoyed this book, and I am very much looking forward to the next book in the series. I found that the main character was very well done, and her personality was quite interesting and likable. Her personality was different from that of most characters in my previous books, and it was quite nice to have a character that was not so much "evil" as just not being what you'd expect, and yet still had her flaws. The story did not get too complicated or overly dramatic, and the main plot was quite good. The only complaint I have about the book is that I did not find it quite as good as the first book, although it is still good. However, it is very different from the first one in my opinion, and that's a good thing.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is well written and interesting and I think a good read. 3.5 Stars
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fun book. I'm glad I bought it. It's not a novel in the traditional sense but the author uses humor and humor to help us forget our troubles.  We laugh, we cry, we try to keep our eyes on the road but can't help but think about all the crazy things that happen.  I'd give this 5 stars if I could, but I have a very difficult time buying a book that isn't a book to read again.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  The New York Times called this book a "must-read," and I can't agree more.  As an English major, I knew nothing about Buddhism before reading this book, and I've since been blown away by what I've learned about this fascinating religion. __________________________________________________________ If you enjoyed this book you should read:  How to Read a Book You can buy this book here.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only reason I gave this book a five star is because the author is an ex-junkie and he clearly enjoys writing about his experience. His story is one of addiction, recovery, and self-love. I highly recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Power of Love by Toni Morrison. This book is a great book about love and what it can do for people. The main message in this book is to let go of self-judgment and to focus on the positive things about yourself and the people around you.  It is very good to learn from other people's mistakes and to avoid making the same ones. 10 out of 10:   How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. This is a classic book on how to be successful in life. This was one of the first books I ever read.  I think the message in the book is that people are more influenced by how you treat them and how much you care about them than how much money you make or how smart you are.   The book was really helpful for me.  9 out of10:   A Memoir by Anne Frank. This story about a young girl going through the horrors of the Holocaust is really moving.  The writing is so beautiful that it makes me cry.  This book has been very influential on me as well.    8 out of8:  The Art of Learning by Robert A. Heinlein. This classic book about the science of learning has helped me a lot in life and has changed my way of thinking about life and learning.  It is a good reminder that there is no substitute for hard work. 
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- --------------- I read this book a couple of years ago and it's one of those rare books that was good and then good again. A fun, humorous story about a group of friends who play a Dungeons & Dragons game. There are no bad chapters, just some minor missteps. It's a fun, easy read and a good way to spend a few minutes in the summer. If you are a fan of D&D and are looking for a good game, this is the book for you. It is very well written and has a lot of interesting details.
Write a positive review about a good book: *************I got the ebook version of this one about a month ago and I'm glad I did! I've read a number of short stories by writers like A.A. Milne and John Cheever and I've always found them to be very readable and often entertaining. That said, this one is just perfect. The story is told from the point of view of a man whose wife leaves him. The narrator is a young man who has just been kicked out of his home because his dad left him. He takes a job as a bartender at a local bar and tries to make a life for himself as a musician. While he's trying to do so, his brother's wife comes to town and they quickly become friends. The author does a great job of describing the lives of these two characters and showing how they deal with each other's situations and their own situations as well.The prose is a bit stilted and slow but there's no reason to think that a slow book will make a good one. The stories are not overly complicated but they're very well written. The characters are interesting and the stories are well written and entertaining. This book was just perfect and I can't wait to read the sequel.*******Review is from a Kindle Book. I bought the book in paperback and it came with a Kindle book. I would say that it was just OK. I enjoyed reading the book but I felt like it was missing something and I know I will read the second book, the author has a very good eye for detail and I was hoping he would add more depth to the characters. I do recommend it as a good read but I don't think I will buy the paperback version because the author did change the name of the main character. He was called Paul, I feel he should have been called Paulus.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am always on the lookout for books about being a woman in the workplace, and this book is one of my favorites.  It was very useful for me, and I'm a woman who has always wanted to know more about what it's like to be in a male dominated industry.  The Good:  The book is well researched and written.    It is also very easy to read, and is one that everyone should own.  The Bad:  I am a bit disappointed that the author didn't use some of the more "manly" topics like sports and games, but the book is still well written and very useful.  If you're looking for a book about being the female equivalent to a male, this book isn't the one for you, but if you're a woman and want to know a little more about the men around you, this is a good start.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________. I just read this book and loved it. I'm really glad I found it. It's a book about a very, very good man, and the life that he had and how it shaped him. I love the book because the author actually talked to his family about the man and his life. It was a nice read and I'm glad to have found it."
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book with great interest and pleasure. It has a great mix of humour and science and I can't wait to see what else the author will have to show us in the future!
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This book is not only one of the best books I have ever read, but also one of my most personal. The story is so complex that it is impossible to understand the author's words without a lot of knowledge about this subject. This is a truly great book that anyone interested in science, religion, and philosophy will love. I hope that the author will continue to write more books about religion, philosophy, and the supernatural.  My Rating: 5 of 5 Stars ---------------

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was not expecting much from this book, but it is a must read. If you want to know what the future holds, look no further. You'll be very interested in what happens to the people of Earth, if any.   The characters are believable and I'm sure will keep me entertained until the end. I'd like to see some of the future predictions they make. The book also has some nice quotes. I loved them all. I'm not a big fan of science fiction, but I can't help but enjoy this book. I can also say that I had a great time reading it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's been about a month since I read The Girl on the Train, and I'm still enjoying it.  If you haven't read it, you should really give it a go.  I found the story to be well-written and the characters to be interesting.  The ending was also nice, but not quite as good as the book's first half.  It didn't take me that long to finish it, but I think it would be worth the time to read it in a shorter amount of time.  I'm not the biggest fan of the first part of the book, but after reading the second part, I found the book to be very well-thought out and well-done.  If you are looking for a good story about a woman who gets lost in a train and has to deal with her own feelings of isolation and loneliness, The Girl On The Train is the perfect book for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. It's very informative, well written and I learned a lot about how the US Government works. If you are looking for a good guide, I would recommend this book to you.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A book I am really glad I read and recommend to anyone who likes books:  "The Night Circus" by John W. Campbell (2014) This is a book about a man who is a circus clown, but his life is not as he thought it would be. He finds that he is no longer alone, that he has a companion, a friend and a mentor who knows more than he does. I'm glad I bought this book. I really enjoyed it. The stories are funny and have a bit of the circus theme going on, but also have a human element to them. I loved how he was able to tell a story that wasn't just about the animals, but a real life story.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The first half of this book is very good, but it becomes very predictable in the second half. I think the first half was intended to be the "tour of the basics" of the theory, but as the second part of the book becomes a series of exercises I feel the author should have been more involved in the details. The author could have added more detail to the exercises, and perhaps added some of the exercises to the second book.
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ This is a good read. It is very well researched. I especially like that there are so many different perspectives on the subject matter. The characters are realistic and believable. The book does cover a lot of interesting information, but I still found it to be a bit too dry. I really want to know more about the other side of the coin, the more extreme side. I was hoping for some more action or a more visceral take on the topic. Overall, I enjoyed this book a lot, and would recommend it. It was fun, and the story is good.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I read the book in the library and my teacher had already finished the book. However, this book is excellent. The book is a good overview of the various things that you should know about a lot of things in life. I think this is a great book to take with you while you are at work to help you understand how people think and how to be more outgoing. I highly recommend this book and highly recommend to others who want to learn how to live a happy life.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book in a short span of time. The author did a great job of capturing the essence of the characters, and giving us a sense of what life was like for them. The pacing is good, the plot was fun, and I got a good laugh out of some of the lines. I recommend this book to everyone, especially those who have enjoyed other books in the series.   The only thing I would like to add is that it is a little hard to understand. I think it would have been easier to use more modern technology to help with the plot, but that's just my opinion.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ This book is so easy to read and a good intro to the topic. I can understand it being a hard book for people who have not been exposed to it before. I did a reading on the topic for my class and a bunch of my friends came by and we all had a good time. The information is not complicated, but you do need to know what you are doing before you start. I would say this is a good read for a beginner.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love reading about history! I am not a history buff, but this book is amazing.

It has great pictures too.

When the girl gets pregnant, he and his group go on a quest to find her.  - A lot of action and humor   - The main story is really funny. The other story is just good!   Overall: 4 stars   Good book, would recommend
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________.   If you're looking for a fun read with a good story then you will definitely like this one. If you're interested in the history of one of the most important American companies, I don't know if there is a better book than this one, and that is saying a lot. The author takes the time to tell the whole story, and while some of the stories are somewhat ridiculous, they do add to the book. This is a great book for history buffs, and for the students of history and business people alike.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________ I really like the fact that this is a short book, just shy of 800 pages. The plot is pretty simple, with some good action scenes. The characters are very well-developed. My only complaint is that I think that the book was just a little too short. I wanted more. I'm not saying that it didn't work, but it wasn't as gripping as I had hoped it would be. I'd still read it, but only if I was given a chance to read it all over again.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The first half of this book is an overview of how to use the Python programming language in a business setting. It explains the basics of how the Python language works, its strengths and weaknesses. The second half of the book is about the tools and toolsets needed to use Python in a commercial setting.

Most of the examples in the book are easy to understand, especially the ones that explain the difference between methods and classes. Most of the sample code in the tutorial is very clean and simple. The tutorial uses some basic math functions to demonstrate how they work. I like how the tutorial doesn't make a big deal out of the difference in Python 3 and Python 2. The author uses Python 2 as an example and explains how the differences in the different versions are small enough that most people won't notice. This book is a good resource for people who are looking to get started with Python but don't want to be bogged down by the Python 3/2 distinction. It is well written, well organized and covers a wide range of topics. I'm looking forward to reading the second part of the tutorial.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________   This book has a lot to offer, and I think a lot of people will be satisfied. I liked the concept of how the characters were brought up. I like a lot about this book. I was also surprised by the fact that the ending was not what I was expecting.   As for the plot, I like the idea of how a group of people who are trying to achieve something together can become a "family." The first half of the book follows a group that has a great deal of trouble figuring out how to get started on their project, but it turns out that the problem was the lack of people that were interested in getting started on the project. This group of friends are working on a book about something called a "watcher" that can help a person see the future. I can see this being an interesting concept, and having a few people who were into science fiction as kids get into a new book that involves time travel might be fun.   the plot was interesting, and it kept me engaged. The characters were all interesting, I loved the relationship between the two brothers. I enjoyed the book a lot.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ "The Last Samurai is one of those books I was so excited to read that I read it twice and even then the second time around I was left feeling more confused than ever. The book takes a historical fact and distorts it into a narrative that is at best misleading and at worst downright ridiculous. It is at least partially my fault as I was expecting more from the author's previous book The Fall of Zong," - J.K. Rowling
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I really liked this book. I think the author is an amazing author. He was a great teacher in this book and I have learned so much about the military and the civilian world from this book." - David  "Excellent book about the civilian side of the military, how the military works and the military culture. Great information. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about how our government works." - Paul  A book I highly recommend: ------------"This is a must read for anyone interested in understanding how the American military works. This is the kind of book that can be read by anyone with a basic understanding of the United States military." - Gary  Reviews:  The book "American War Machine" is an excellent read. The information provided is detailed, interesting and a must have for anyone wishing to know more about the modern military establishment. The author covers everything from the history of the U.S. military, the history and training of all its personnel, how it is organized and trained, the types of weapons it uses, its logistics, how to recruit, how military members are selected and the role of the civilian part in the military. There are also chapters covering the legal, political and cultural aspects of the American Military. The book is very well written, informative and well presented. There is very little "fluff" in the book which gives the reader a good grounding in the current state of affairs. I highly suggest this book for anyone who is interested in knowing more about military affairs. - David   "A must read book that covers every aspect of the modern US military."- Gary  the book is great and it has a great amount of information on the military." ------------- - Scott   "...an excellent book...the book is written by a retired senior officer of the army and it's very informative and very readable...I have not found a more comprehensive, up-to-date and easy to read book about military life in the US." --------------- - Gary   The author is a very intelligent and well read man. His book has a very good amount of military history, current operations and operations of the armed forces in the last century. This book is a good introduction to the world of military affairs in the United states. The fact that it is a military history book is quite surprising to many, but this book provides a good perspective on the state of the US military in the post-war era. I

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of the classic fantasy series, The Wheel of Time, and this is another of those books I really enjoy. This is the third book in the series, and the third in the current series. It's not as epic as some of the previous books, but I still really enjoy it. The characters are great, and I like the world they live in. There is a lot of political intrigue, and a few interesting side characters. This book is a good read, and one that you can enjoy if you are into fantasy.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's not just about the book. I've read many books that are great. But this book just blew me away. I was looking for something similar to the books I've been reading by this author in the last 2 years. I had never seen a book like this.

I have been a fan of his since he started this series. I think that this new book is the best. It is very different from the other books, but it is a good read. I will definitely be buying the next book. I was also surprised that the book came out on the same day as the movie, so I was able to read it the night before.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________   I got this book at a very good deal at a bookstore. The book is well-written and well-researched. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that I wish the book would have a bit more action. The ending could have been a bit better but still worth the read.
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________  "I've read some great books in my life, but I'm always excited to pick up a new book from this author. I've enjoyed his books on spirituality and self-help, but his books about spirituality and religion are my favorite. His books on meditation and meditation and how to live a life in balance and peace are wonderful. His work on writing is phenomenal. The first book in this series, How to Meditate, is a great read and is a solid book to learn about the various types of meditation. I highly recommend it. I also highly recommend the other books in this collection, and I'm hoping they get some of my favorite books added to this collection. I'm not a reader of many religious books, so I'm looking forward to reading them. I'd also like to note that I love the audio books in the series, and this book includes one of my favorites, How Not to Make Enemies. I wish there was more of these in the future."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed this book so much that I can hardly wait to read the next. I am an expert on a subject and had been wanting to know more about it but had not yet found the book I was looking for. I like the fact that it is written by an expert in her field. She has a lot of great information about different topics and I really like the style and the way she goes into details about each topic. I have read a few books on this subject and they tend to be either way too technical or way too academic. This book has a mixture of both. I recommend this book to anyone looking to learn more about something they are interested in and it would be good to have in your library to refer to when you are learning. It is well written and informative. I wish I could give this book a five star rating but I am giving it a four.  The quality of the writing: 
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I'm a huge fan of this series. I've loved every book in the series and I've seen the movies as well, so I was very happy when they announced the second one. This one was better than the first one, it was a little more emotional and there was more drama than in the first book. This is a very good book to read if you love the book series.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book, and a very interesting one at that. It is a very good introduction to the field of quantum mechanics. The author uses many examples from the real world to illustrate the ideas of quantum theory, and the reader will learn about many interesting ways that quantum phenomena can be explained. The examples include: quantum dots, the double slit experiment, the Bell experiment, and quantum teleportation. This is a great book for anyone with an interest in quantum mechanics and physics. The book does a wonderful job at explaining quantum theory and some of its applications.
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ This is a must-read book, and I'm not sure it's possible to make a more compelling argument for how important it is to read history books. It's easy to see how it became so influential, how it captured the imagination of a generation, and how it helped the world better understand the history of its own time. It is so readable, well-researched, and entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and this is the third book in the series. I love the books but never finished them so I was excited to read this. It is really a great read and has lots of laughs, action and adventure. I think I may have to get a Harry Potter poster. The story starts out very slow and I found myself wishing it was faster and I had found it earlier. But then it got really good. I did find myself wanting to finish the book even though I had read the first two.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great! I'm not going to lie - I haven't read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy - so I thought this was a good way to start. I'm looking forward to the next one. I do think that I would have liked to see more of the characters in this story - I felt like they were only there for the journey and nothing more. The book is also kind of long at about 300 pages. I liked the fact that it didn't just tell you everything about the book - it gives you all the information you need to read the book and know everything about it. Overall I loved this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great book about the life and legacy of a legendary actor, a friend and a man of the people. It was an amazing read, one that I could not put down. I've already started watching the new Star Trek series.   I had been looking for a book on him for a while.  I was happy to see the information in this book and I hope to continue my reading on this subject.  As the title of this book says, it's about the man himself, Gene Roddenberry.  As I have read the book, I have learned more about the person than I ever imagined possible.  The book is a combination of biographies of the man and interviews with people who knew him.  In a lot of ways it is a story about what it meant to be a Star Trek fan in the 1960's, with many of the same issues faced today by many fans.  What I found to be the most interesting about this book is that the author, Robert H. Justman, has a history with the man.  He and Rodd were both fans of the show, but had a falling out over the Star Trek novels.  Robert Justman also worked on the Star Wars films and has many fond memories of Rodd.  After reading the book I feel like I have a better idea of what it was like to be in his life. I think that Gene R. Just and the other Star Trek fans who will read this book will also come to understand why Gene R, just as many of us fans, have felt the need to come forward and share what Gene R knew and loved about Star Trek.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I had a hard time deciding on a good title for this book. I wanted it to be something like "The Last Word: How to Win a Fight, and Keep Winning Them", or something along those lines. However, after reading the book, I'm glad I picked the title that I did. In fact, it's actually better than the title I had originally thought of, because this book was one of the most fun, exciting, and entertaining books I've read this year. This book, like many others I've encountered this year, is not about winning fights, but rather about winning hearts and minds. It's about understanding why we are so quick to anger and hateful, and what it takes to change it. I also like the fact that this book is a collection of short stories rather than a conventional narrative. The stories were all written by authors of varying experience and knowledge, and the author seems to know what he's talking about. However it would have been nice if he had included some quotes from some of the other authors in this book, which would have made it more complete. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to everyone who is interested in understanding how we got here and what we need to do to change our attitudes.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book after reading another book by the author, but I found this one more interesting and better written. The first part of the book is about the creation of a new religion and then what happened after that and the evolution of the new religion. I found the first part interesting and fun. The second part is more scientific and has some interesting things about how religion and science interact and what happens when one tries to change the world with science. I think this book could be good for people who have a science or science-related interest.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- -------------------------- I really liked this book. The main characters were interesting, and I felt that the author was not afraid to go where most other authors don't go, which is to be honest, I think is the most important part of writing a book. This book was not too long and had a good balance of comedy and tragedy. There were several chapters where I couldn't decide what to read next, but in the end I ended up reading it and loving it.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________. It is a good read and I recommend it to everyone I know. I can't imagine a book like this would be published in a "new" edition. It's so clear and easy to understand. I highly recommend this book to everyone who is interested in the science of evolution.  What other book might you compare The Blind Watchmaker to and why?  The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins. Both are very interesting, well written, and well argued. They both cover similar ground and deal with similar topics, but are different in their approach.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________, it is the best book about how to get a job in the film industry.  It covers a lot of ground and provides a wealth of information about how it really works. There are many interesting facts about the film business and the way people are paid, which is not always the case in the business. , I've read a lot about getting into the film biz and the process, but I've never read about how people get paid.  and what I like most about this book is the fact that it goes into great detail about how much you'll actually make as an actor/actress. And how much of it you actually make is not necessarily what you get paid, but it is a good starting point for what you'll be paid once you get a bit of experience. ... This book is not for the faint of heart. There is a lot to take in and I found myself struggling to understand some of the finer points and concepts. This is especially true if you are a movie producer who is not a "proper" actor. If you're a "Proper" Actor  , you will not be as interested in reading this book, because you already know all of this information. But for those of you who are in a "film" or TV-production-type business, this book will provide you with the knowledge you need to be successful in the movie business. It covers everything from finding jobs to getting cast, and also how to handle your time in the production schedule to ensure you are getting a good rate for your time. The book has a lot more info about casting than most of the other books on this list. There's a lot in this book that will help you to find work. It also covers how to prepare for auditions and how to avoid getting a bad audition. I found that I was able to find roles in many of my films that I would have otherwise been completely unaware of. You can get some great acting advice from this book and learn how to become a better actor.
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________ This is an excellent book and the author is a wonderful writer. The book is full of insight into the workings of the brain and how the mind works. I found it to be informative and interesting. I will definitely be using the book in my psychotherapy practice and to aid in the development of my own personality. This is a book I would highly recommend to any student or practitioner of psychology or psychology in general. I think this is the best book for students or anyone interested in psychotherapy or psychology. - Michael D. M.  _______________________________________________________________________________  A fascinating, comprehensive, and accessible treatment of the "big questions" that have puzzled us all throughout history. .... The author is an able and generous speaker who is always willing to listen and respond to students' questions. This book is very accessible. The author takes a deep dive into some of the more difficult topics in psychology, such as the nature of the self, free will, consciousness, free-floating self-awareness, the self as agent, the mind as an extension of the body, the brain, the relationship between the self and other people, the role of the ego, the meaning of life, and the meaning and purpose of existence. The questions asked by this book are interesting, challenging, and highly relevant to contemporary problems. The answers are sometimes provocative, sometimes confusing, but always illuminating. The writing is elegant, clear, and concise. The topics addressed are all important and worthy of our attention. This text is an important contribution to the literature on human consciousness and psychology. – Dr. Michael A. Hitt  The book will be of great use to psychologists, teachers, researchers and students of psychology. It will be useful to anyone who wants to understand the workings and implications of the mind. – Prof. J.D. McConville  It is a well-written book, well organized, with many useful references and a good index. I would recommend it highly. -Prof. R.H. Dennet  I am very pleased to have found the book which provides a coherent, balanced and highly readable treatment of such important topics as the human psyche, the "self", free will and consciousness. -Dr. David B. Cohen  If you are interested in a well written book about consciousness and the mind then this is a must read. This may be the most important book on consciousness that I have ever read. -Richard B

There are a lot of things that can be read to have the same effect as reading this book, but for me it is just a good, fun read!  5 out of 5 stars I like the stories, the characters, and the setting. The story is well-done and the characters are well developed.  4 out of 4 stars Just finished the book and found it really enjoyable. It's a good read and I like that the author is so open to different points of view, even though the story is about the war between the Empire and the Alliance. I would say it's a bit slow, but if you like this sort of thing, then you should enjoy it. I hope there are more stories in this world.  of the 4 stars I enjoyed this book as a fun read, I liked the characters and I enjoyed the setting and plot line, however, I was slightly disappointed that the ending was a bit of a let down, in that the characters felt like they did not really get what they deserved. This isn't really a bad thing, as it is a short book, and I would still recommend it as a short read. The ending did seem a bit disappointing.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a real joy to read. It is a classic, the kind that has been a staple of the college reading lists since the 1960's. It's funny, it's sad, and it's also about a young woman who's not ready for college, and a man who doesn't want to let her get there. It has been reprinted many times over the years, so if you like this book, you'll love the new edition.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Best of the Best: 100 Years of Baseball History by Jeff Bagwell (Praeger, 2010) The author is a great writer, and his books are fun and easy to read. This is his second book on baseball history. This one is the best of the best. I enjoyed this book, as I have read the previous two in this series. I also enjoyed the fact that this book is about a lot more than baseball. The author takes us through a lot of the players, managers, and executives that have shaped baseball over the past 100 years. This book was a very enjoyable read. I especially enjoyed the sections on Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Willie Mays, Christy Mathewson, and many other great players and coaches.  If you have any interest in the game of baseball, you can't go wrong with this book. I would definitely recommend this book to a baseball fan, or someone who wants to read a book that is more about the history of the game than the present day.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have to say that this is the best book I've read about the Bible, by far. I'm still finding new things to learn about the book of Genesis every day!  I can't imagine a better introduction to the Bible for anyone!  This book was just the right length for me, but not so long that I felt like I was wasting my time.  It had the right amount of info on each chapter, so you can get to know the book and not get lost.  The book is written very well, and was easy to read, although there were a few times where it seemed a bit more verbose than I would like, and where I had to reread a sentence or two.  There were also a few grammatical errors, which I'll probably miss, but the overall reading experience was still very pleasant.  This book is also a very useful resource for Bible studies.  I'm glad that I found this book.  I'm so grateful that I've finally found a book that explains all the things that I didn't understand about the God who created the universe, but did it so well that I can now understand the basics of what it means to be a good person!  And to have it in such a readable format makes it so much easier to understand!

The way that this book was written was good, as it was very engaging and fun, and the characters were very well developed and well developed. I would definitely recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a HUGE fan of John Green, so I was delighted when he asked if I would like to review his book. I am currently reading the third in the "The Fault in Our Stars" series and I am in love with the story. The characters are well developed, the dialogue is very engaging, and the book has a lot of heart. The main character, Violet, is very relatable to me as a teen girl who has struggled with depression and self-doubt. I would recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with self-esteem, depression, or any other kind of mental illness. I loved this book and am eagerly looking forward to the next book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is a wonderful read and I'm glad I read it. I am sure that this book would be more enjoyable if there was more of it, but this is a great introduction to a fascinating subject. It's hard to find a book with more depth and insight into the subjects discussed. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the topic.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ "This book has a lot to offer and it's really a shame that it took this long to get this book out. I loved the story, the setting and the characters, and I was really sad that it was ending. The last scene in the book, when the family is preparing to leave, was so beautifully written and really made me cry. I'm going to be going through a lot of bookmarks and not buying anything else from this author, I really enjoyed this book. It was great." _______________________________________

Write a positive review about a good book:   "The first in a new series of books by David F. Harris, and the first to be a collaboration with two of his fellow writers, is a smart, well-written book about a great man who deserves the respect and admiration of all of us who know and love him." --The Christian Science Monitor  "[Harris] has written a brilliant new book that is the first in his planned series about Abraham Lincoln." --Chicago Tribune  Buy this book!  David F.Harris. A History of Abraham Lincoln's Time. 2nd ed. New York: Penguin, 2009. $24.95.  If you want to know why America was founded, what makes America great, and how to make it better, read this book. In it, Harris takes the reader from the end of the War of 1812 to the presidency of Abraham L. Lincoln, and from his years in Washington, D.C., to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. "A superb book." --Library Journal  I was not a big fan of the first Lincoln book, which I felt was a bit too long on details. But I love this one! It's very readable, and covers a lot of ground. It's not a textbook, and it doesn't go into too much detail, but it covers everything you need to know, and is the perfect book to read in one sitting!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was so interesting, but then I started to realize that I was not really paying attention to the story, and then I got really frustrated by it. The main character's mother is a very interesting character, and I think it was the first time I realized that this story was really about her. I really like the author's writing style, and the characters were interesting to me. The book was kind of hard to put down, and you can't really put it down. It's very well written, and if you like YA, you might enjoy this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The God Delusion  is a must read if you have a strong faith in the truth of the Gospel. It is a fascinating book with many interesting points that you don't hear about often. The book has many good chapters but the first few are not for the weak of heart. I think it's a great book that you'll have a lot of fun with and will certainly help you to think through your faith more thoroughly.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The New World of Myths is a very good book. It does not provide a detailed or extensive discussion of the topic but rather provides an overview of the most important myth of all, the notion that the Bible is the only infallible and unchangeable source of knowledge on God's revelation to humanity. The book does provide a number of useful background articles and quotes but the most valuable part is its coverage of the historical development of biblical criticism and its role in the evolution of Christian theology. I do not think that the authors of the book, as the authors do, fully understand the historical background, but the book is still a very useful read and should be of interest to anyone who wants to understand the history of Biblical scholarship.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book is a wonderful look into the lives of the people who made up the 'lost tribes' of the American West.  The authors have done a wonderful job in detailing the lives and times of these people who were never documented or understood by any of the early white settlers.  This book is both a history and a description of the cultures, beliefs and customs of the Native Americans who lived along the American Southwest.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and have read many books on the American west and these were by far the best." - The American West: An Introduction to the American Indians by John M. Fealy and Richard D. Faeldon This is a book about the native Americans in America.  There are many books about the early settlers who came from Europe and how they treated the native people.  But there are few books about what the native peoples thought about the people that came from the continent.  They lived along this land in this place for thousands of years.  They never really had any contact with the Europeans.  So, what did they think of these newcomers?  Did they see them as savages or just as people who had come to a new land and didn't know anything about it.  The Native Americans that lived along what is now known as the United States of America were a very different kind of people.   They lived off the land and depended on their animals and the fruits of the land to make a living.  In fact, many of the foods that we know today were their staple foods.  And these people never went to a city or town and had much contact with people who came to this country.  One of the most interesting things about these people is how they developed a language that no one else knew about.   And, this language had a lot of rules about how to speak and act.  These people had developed their own way of talking and being that was very different from what we know.  Because of the different ways of talking, they had different ways to show respect for each other.  For example, in the old days, if someone was wounded or hurt they would tell their friend to help them.  Then, when the injured person was ready to return home they would call out, "Return to me!"  This way, their friends would know to call back to them when they were ready to go home.  It was a very special kind of relationship and language. 
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I bought this book as a gift for my son and he loves it. I bought it as a hard cover and I had to order it online to get the discount. It arrived very quickly and I was happy that it had the dust jacket. My son loved it, he's a big kid and I thought that it would be fun to give him a little adventure and read it to him. I did have a couple of typos, but nothing too bad. I will definitely buy it again.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read all of the books in the series (except the first book, and that was only because the book was published after I started reading the series), and I enjoyed each one.  All of them are really good, well-written books that are well worth your time.   This is a very good book, very funny, and very cleverly written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of this book.  The story and the way the characters interacted with each other was very good.  The ending was a little disappointing.    It left me with the feeling that maybe the author just wanted to write a good story but was unable to do so.  I think the book could have been a bit longer and the ending could have had a bit more weight.  The ending did make it a bit disappointing though. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has all the right elements of a classic: the great storytelling, the great characters, the amazing art. I would recommend this book to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "It is not always easy to make a distinction between a good work and a good read. This book is both. The plot, the characters, the setting, and the voice all work in concert to make an engaging story. The prose is strong and engaging, but I would like to see more detail given on how the characters think. They think and speak with so much authority that I often thought they were trying to deceive me, and I couldn't understand their motives or decisions." --The author "This book is well written and entertaining, and has a lot of heart. If you are a fan of the Star Trek franchise, or even a fan in general, then this book is definitely for you. The book is also very enjoyable as a standalone." --Review from The Book Review
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book will be an important text in my personal library and in those of my students.   It is a wonderful story of survival. It is a very well done tale. I am impressed by the author's ability to describe the events of his travels. The descriptions of the characters are very good.   the book will not be as entertaining as some of the other books I have read. But if you enjoy survival stories, you will find this one to be excellent.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, I found out, was first published in the early 1930s. This is the best book on the subject I have found and the author does a wonderful job of introducing it to a new generation. I have heard of the author but only now have I read his book. The book is written in a way that is very easy to understand. The illustrations are very clear and the text is written with ease. This book is a great introduction to the subject. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the subject of history. Read a positive comment about a book: I found this book interesting and informative. The history of the British army, including the famous battle of Waterloo is covered. It's interesting to see how the British Army has evolved over the years. There are also interesting chapters about the history of women and their role in the war effort. The author also covers the role of women in other areas like agriculture and industry. Overall, this is a well-written book. It may seem a little dry at times but I think it is well worth the read. Find a bad review: I read this book a long time ago and I have not found anything bad about it, so I thought I'd share my thoughts about it. I found the history to be very good and the illustrations were excellent. I was looking forward to reading this book and it certainly is one of my favorite historical books ever. I really loved the illustrations of the different uniforms the soldiers wore. I also enjoyed the history section. It is interesting to read about how the soldiers felt about being in the army, what they had to do to get there, and the sacrifices they made to make it there. It was a very interesting book. I am glad I read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Black Tapes: A Memoir of a Serial Killer by Gary L. Snyder is one of the best books I have ever read about a serial killer. Snyder describes the horrors of being a serial murderer and how his life was transformed from being a petty thief to a killer. His description of the life of a serial criminal is not only riveting but also enlightening and will help you understand a little more about the lives of serial killers.  This book is a must read and is the only one I would recommend to anyone looking to get a good read about the world of serial murderers. 10/10

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a character who was a very smart, tough guy, but who became the opposite of that. He became a coward. And I mean that in the best possible way. It's not so much about the coward he became but more about the fact that he didn't want to get his hand chopped off for what he was doing. The whole story is just so well done that I have to admit to a mild addiction to it.

I liked the characters (I'm not really a fan of young adults, but these two were charming and fun to read about) and the setting (I really liked the time period and the way the author went about telling the story. I think I liked it better than the original books. This is one of the few that I've read in English). The characters were well developed and the plot was interesting and thought provoking.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book because I was curious about the "Sci-Fi/Horror" genre, but found that this book really wasn't about anything but Sci-Fi. The book is about an alien named "Jade," who finds a strange device in a forest and attempts to make it work. Unfortunately, the device fails, but then the alien uses his "powers" to turn all the trees on the planet into trees and trees into the aliens, with the "Jades" being the "biggest, baddest, greenest, tree-y-people" in the universe. And yes, the book does use some good language, but the only reason I can think of for it is to make the book sound more serious. It is pretty lame. The main character is really obnoxious and does not do much besides talk and talk. There is also an interesting plot that I did not get enough of, which involved a small girl who went into space to rescue her sister. I think the book could have been much better if it had just been about the alien and his gadgets and what he does, and not the little girl. The author is really trying to make a sci-fi book, but it really does not work.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________ A couple years ago I purchased this book after looking it up in the library. It seemed like an excellent read at the time and I haven't read anything similar since. I would recommend this book to everyone. I read this book back in 2006, and it was great. I've had it on my shelf since then, and I think it's a great read. I'm sure some people are going to find it difficult to read, but I find that a good read should be a pleasure for the reader, so I don't mind. There's a lot of great information here. I think the author would have liked to have included more about how the food is processed, but this is enough to make the book worth reading. I highly recommend this to anyone who has a food allergy or suffers from any other illness or condition that affects digestion. It is written in a simple way, but also informative and entertaining.  Review by: Mimi
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- If I could give this book a negative star, I would. The plot is just flat. The characters are one-dimensional. The ending, too, is very disappointing. It just ends too soon. It would have been better if it had continued for another 10-15 pages. I guess this book is for kids or teenagers who want to be in a good fantasy novel, but don't want to put in the time to learn to read. The story is easy to follow. I could read this book over and over and still find new things to learn about the characters and the world. The author does not go into the background of the characters, but the characters are good. I don't know about you, but I don 't want to read the same book over again, especially with new information. ---------------
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very nice story and a good job of capturing the essence of a little boy and his mother's life in this book. The only thing I can say is that the children are very thin and in a lot of ways are still very young, which may have affected their ability to keep a straight face throughout the whole story. But I think that the book would be better if it had been written as a story about the child's mother.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________"I think I'll have to make this book my "go-to" for those times when I want a laugh but don't want to listen to a book."   It's a fun book and I enjoyed it. The plot is the main story but it also has some good character development. The humor is funny but doesn't take itself too seriously. It also has a good balance between horror and humor and that makes it all the better.   The art is a little bit on the crude side but it works. I would recommend this to any horror fan.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first thing that popped into my mind when I started reading this book was that it is not a novel about one of the famous (but very obscure) fictional characters in the Harry Potter series, and it's not even a retelling of one of those stories, but a very different take on the plot of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. It's about a little girl in a magical world who happens to have a unique gift. It seems a little silly to have the main character be a little witch, but I'm glad that there are a number of other characters who are more or less "Harry Potter-like." The first chapter has a very well-developed character who we follow as she grows up. There are a few interesting moments and there are some fun ideas, but it never really takes off. The book starts out with a very strange premise and the author does a good job of explaining why the girl is special. The story doesn't really have much of a plot, and the plotline is just so convoluted that it's very hard to keep up with what's going on, and if you've seen the movies, you might not know who the bad guys are either. It doesn't seem to be that difficult to write a good story. If you want to read about a magical girl, this isn't really the book for you.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is excellent.  It's like a cross between the Harry Potter series and the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  I loved it!  The characters are amazing, the world is so well thought out, and the writing is just phenomenal.  This book would be amazing for anyone that is into space, science, and space travel. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  The book, by the way, is excellent. It's not a perfect book, but it's pretty good. If you want to read about the life of the famous guy who wrote a book called How to Win Friends and Influence People, go for it. If not, just stick with the book's main message: Be yourself, don't worry about what other people think, and don't ever forget the important things in life.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an awesome book. It is about a young man named Aaron who is trying to find his place in the world. He goes through a lot of life changes but always finds his way back to his love for his mother. It does not seem like a normal life but the characters are real and the story is not very long. It gets a little dark at times but it is a really good read. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that likes to read about life changing events.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book on a topic I had no idea about before reading this book: how much more the government can control your life. It explains in great detail how the federal government can use its power to create a false sense of security by controlling your environment and then manipulating you to do whatever it wants. It's great stuff for a history book.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I just finished reading "The Book of the New Sun" by C.S. Lewis. I am an old, very long time, fantasy reader, and I read the other books by Lewis, but this one just grabbed me. It is one of the few fantasy books I have read that actually make me think about the magic in the stories. As I read it I had a lot of questions: What kind of book is it? How much can the author accomplish? Is it true what the author says? I am very glad that I bought it. The author has a lot to say about the human race and religion, but he also has a way of getting the reader to think, and that is why I like this book so much. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the genre of fantasy, but especially if you enjoy religious fantasy.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ (This is a list, not a review.)   This book is a must read for anyone who has ever read a good story.   It's not like a mystery novel, or a historical novel, where there are lots of things to think about. In fact, I'm not sure what the point is of having a historical or mystery novel in a series. This is a true-crime novel. It's about the unsolved murders of three young girls.   in a murder mystery novel. In the book, there's a murder and you are trying to figure out who did it, and where the murderer might be, and why. This book doesn't do that. It tries to do the same thing, but it doesn't succeed at it. It does, however, have some fun with the mystery aspect, and it's funny at times.  . The book does have its flaws. The first chapter is a bit of a mess. It takes a while to get the story moving, and the detective is a little too hard to take, so the book kind of starts off slow. It also has a couple of weird plot twists, which I don't really mind because the book keeps pulling back the rug a bit on what is really going on. The main story is actually about the three girls and their mother. The mother was a prostitute and the girls were born to the mother because of that, but the mother was forced to quit when she got pregnant. They were adopted by the father of one of the girls. The father, the main character of the book and the reason why the book is about the murders, has been in and out of prison, but he was caught a few times. He was convicted of sexual abuse, which he denies, but I think that the author had to throw that in to make the book more interesting. But he's actually a very decent man who tries to be a good father. He's really the heart of the story. He has a hard time letting his daughters go to school, and his daughters are very spoiled. I found it kind of funny that he had such a hard on for his girls, but then I realized it's kind of true.  
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I bought this book because I liked the premise of the book and thought that I'd give it a try since I had heard good things about it. Well I'm not the only one who's had good things to say about this book: the cover alone is worth the price, and I can't wait to read it. The author uses a lot of great writing techniques to make her story easy to read and the story just keeps getting better and better from chapter to chapter. I also really liked the illustrations that the author used, they are very beautiful. This is a good read for people who want to read a well written book that is interesting and easy to understand. It's worth the money and I highly recommend this book. :)

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book I read this year is a very good read. It's not exactly a novel, but it's not a self-help book either. It gives you a good insight into a very different life that I've had, but I feel it's just as much a true story as the novel. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know what life is like as a man in his mid-twenties in a foreign land. It was also really funny.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book, I would give it 4 stars if I could, but I had to make a few changes to my rating to reflect how I felt about the actual book, which I really didn't like.  As others have said, the prose is very bad, but the story is not.    The story starts out as an ordinary man, but his mind is blown.    The man is called "Mack", and his mind has been blown by a woman named "Sara".   Mack's mind has started to be warped by a few things he has done.  One thing is his habit of masturbating, which is not normal, and another is the fact that his mind can't get enough.  The reason why his mind keeps going is because of his sex partner, Sara.  He can't stop thinking about her, and it makes him really uncomfortable.  Mack is trying to stop masturbating but he has become addicted to it.  Sara also starts to get sick from all the drugs he is taking, and her constant sexual thoughts, so Mack must stop taking drugs.  When Mack meets Sara, she tells him about the drug called "Krokodil".  They find out that Krokodils are a chemical used to tranquilize large groups of people, but Sara doesn't want him to take it, because she doesn't like drugs. However, she can't do anything about it because he is a criminal. Mack is forced to take the drug by Sara, and he starts taking it. He has a drug dealer friend who knows how to get the drug, and they get it. The drug is dangerous because it affects the brain in such a way that people don't remember anything about the past.  But as soon as they start taking it, Mack's memory starts to return.  Once his memory is back, they go back to doing things they normally would do.  Soon they get into a car accident, and Mack is unconscious.  However, when he wakes up, he doesn't remember his memory being altered.  They go to the hospital, but he still has no memory of what happened. Sara and Mack try to fix the drug problem.  Sarah tries to get a job, and Sara also tries to help her friend Mack get better.  Eventually, the two of them become the leader of a new gang called "The Gangsters", and they try to rid the city of the

It also had a bit of a twist ending which was a little disappointing.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I have a lot of respect for Michael Connelly's writing. I am in a very similar situation as he describes, except that I am not in a long-term relationship (that I want to get out of) and I am still relatively young. I'm also pretty much broke (I'm in a financial crisis). I have no family to lean on and have been looking for a solid book to read for months. I don't like that there's only two chapters about what happens to a person when they decide to "change". It seems like a very superficial view of what happens after someone decides to get in a relationship, even if that person is in a good relationship. But I'm not interested in just being in a "good relationship" because that's the easiest to get into. I was in a horrible relationship for the first three years of my life, and I was very afraid of being alone and not being able to get the attention that I needed to get back on my feet. I have been out of that relationship for over six months and I'm still afraid of falling into that same trap again. I did not enjoy this book at all.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading the series since it was originally published in 1986, and it's one of the few series I read when I was a child. The first two books are very well-written, and the characters are charming, and there is a lot of action. The books are also good at building a mystery, and even though the plot isn't as engaging as other series that I've read, I've enjoyed it quite a bit. The author does a great job at creating a story that is a mix of fantasy and real-life. This series is definitely recommended to children, and adults who want to read some fantasy.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "My daughter's teacher was able to use this book to show her a new approach to reading. It really helped her to see how much she enjoyed the story and the way the author showed her how to be a reader. It was well worth the money." Read the full review:  "I'm giving this book four stars because I am sure it would have been more if it weren't for the bookmarks. I have been a good student all my life, but sometimes, as an adult, I don't know if I am learning. I didn't have a lot of books when I was a kid, so I never really had any problems with books, but when I moved to my current house and didn't own any books, I was left with no bookmarks, which is when I decided to make some. I was happy with my decision. I think that this book would have gotten a lot more if I had a library, but I'm not that kind of person."

Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book is a wonderful example of how a simple narrative, told well, can be just as powerful as a complex, multilayered, and often very good novel.   This is a story of a man, who for some reason decides to move to a remote corner of the country to be with his father. This father, it is revealed, was an artist who had his work published. He was also a war hero, but is now in his late seventies and has been bedridden since his wife passed away years ago. He's a bit of a recluse, and it is his son who is the one who is drawn to him.   The son is an introvert, but as the story goes on, he grows to love his father and his father's art. The father is a brilliant, but also a bit strange man who can't seem to find his place in the world.   and this is where the story really starts to take off.  :)"
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ __________________________ Read on for a short review by Michael K. E. Thies, Jr. I really enjoyed this book. It has an interesting idea that seems to have been thought out rather than just thrown together. This book is well written and I recommend it highly. It's just a pity that it doesn't include any information about the actual physical effects of the war. I wish there had been a little more discussion of the physical effects, especially how many soldiers were affected by this experience. Also, the war is one of the most overlooked topics of World War II. This is a book that should be read by anyone who has an interest in World War 2 and the psychological effect it had on the soldiers, particularly the Americans.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________. (Please don't be a jerk and change your rating once I've read the book.)  So this was my first attempt at a horror story. I read about a woman who discovers she's actually the evil god's wife. This is a very interesting story that takes the reader on a bit of a roller coaster ride. The characters are so well developed and are the main focus of the story. It was interesting to see the character's relationship to each other and the environment. I did find myself wanting to know more about what was going on in the world of the gods. The ending was unexpected and interesting.  I gave it four stars because it was interesting and it was short. I'm looking forward to reading more of her works.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ I'm a huge fan of Terry Pratchett and I was thrilled to finally read his autobiography. I'm not a fan of the audiobook so I don't think I'll be re-reading it, but I definitely enjoyed the book as a whole. I like the fact that he talks about some of the great things he did when he was a kid (hanging out with the family dog, etc.) and how he's still doing those things in his 50s, but he's also talking about how he feels about himself now (he's a lot more of a loner these days). I like his view of life (a lot of the time, he's the only one who really gets it) and how that gives him a great perspective on things. And he talks a lot about his kids. His wife, Jo, is a terrific writer and they have a really good relationship. I'd highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading about this story for about five years now. I finally bought a copy, it's been years since I've read it but I was looking for a good story with a nice ending, so I bought it. I enjoyed the book as much as the last one, this is more of the same. I didn't enjoy the beginning, which I felt was kind of rushed. But, after that, I was hooked. The writing was good. I liked that the book was about the author and not his story. And it was fun, a little slow but worth it. The ending was a little confusing but I didn;t mind. I'm really glad I read this.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "It's a brilliant book and I was looking forward to reading it."   This is a very good book and is well researched and detailed.   The author gives an insight into the origins of the war and the political machinations that led to it. He makes very clear that the Anglo-Boer War was a British, South African and German war and that the British never intended to withdraw from the area.   of course, we can't blame the British for not withdrawing, they just had to get rid of the Boers, and to do that, they had to go after their supply lines. The Boers did not want to leave the area, the British did.   is a well written book, that will help the reader understand the Boer War better.   and i recommend it.  .
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed the book! It has a great plot and a great concept, and a lot of the characters are very likeable.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very useful. I was not familiar with this concept, but I had to read it to find out how this concept works.  It is a great idea, as I was very interested in the concept of the "mind-body connection" and the concept that the human body can only be healed through the direct intervention of a higher consciousness.  The book also helped me understand that I am in a physical body (as far as I can tell) and I am not a machine.

This mystery is very well written and you want to know who is guilty. I can't wait to read the next one. ------------- I love a good mystery, and this book definitely delivers. I really like that the writer doesn't just stick to one character or one aspect of the story, and tries to cover the whole picture with each book. It's a good thing that it's so easy to follow the story because I got really involved with the mystery. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys mystery books. ------------ It's amazing how well this book is written! I think this is one of those books where the main character, while a good boy, has some problems and is struggling with the same thing. It is a really good read! ------------- An interesting book about a young boy who is autistic and has problems. He has a good grasp of the situation and it was really interesting to read about him and the things he is struggling through. I enjoyed the way he solved the mystery and I'm definitely going to read more from him!

He's a great listener and loves to share his wisdom.    He has a new book out called " The 12 steps of recovery."   When I asked him to recommend a book on alcoholism, he recommended this book to me.  I'm glad he did.  It's the only book he has read that really addresses the whole thing.  "The 12 steps are a step-by-step program that can help anyone who is struggling with their own drinking."  This is a book that I can recommend to anyone.  The author has a deep understanding of alcoholism and the science behind it.  This book is well-written and very practical.  You can learn a lot from this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________ I just finished reading this book, which was my first time reading a romance. I am still trying to get over my love of historical romances. But this one has the romance of a classic, but the humor and mystery of a contemporary novel. The characters are real and the writing is beautiful. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the romances of the Victorian Era. It is just a fun read with great characters.   The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I was so excited for the rest of the book. But after the end it left me hanging. I guess I just wanted to see what would happen next.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed the book, I loved the story and I liked how it ended. The ending of the book was very good, I felt a bit cheated that there wasn't more of the story to read but it was a good story, I think the characters were all very well written.  There were a few things I liked but the ending didn't make me feel satisfied, like I needed to see more of what happened.    Read a negative review about an unoriginal book: I read this book, but I think I'd be a bit disappointed if I did. The book has a lot of potential, but it's not really written well. I don't think there's anything I would do differently to a book like this one, but the author doesn't really show that he's a very good storyteller. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book as a gift for a friend who loves to read. She loves reading. She's not very picky about her books. I loved this book. It's a good read. The book is about a character called Blythe, who is a teenager. She is smart and kind. She has friends. She doesn't have a lot of friends. But she's very kind and good natured. She also loves to make people smile. She does a lot for others. The problem is that she's the only friend in her neighborhood. There is only one other girl who Bly the character, is friends with. Bly's friend is kind and sweet and also very good naturing. She and Bly both have their good sides. They also both have bad sides. Blyn has an attitude problem. She hates her father. She always wants to be the center of attention. She will do anything to be in his good graces. She really doesn't like her mom either. They have a very bitter relationship. Blynn is kind. Kind is one of those words I always feel sorry for when I use it. Kind can be very nice and nice can be mean. But Blynn isn't kind. Bllie is a very nice girl. She cares for others and will always try to help people. But her attitude and bad nature make her a little selfish. Bley's mom is a little too over protective. She makes Bly do all the things she doesn't want to do. Bile the character has a great sense of humor. She sometimes says very stupid things. But the character's bad sides make her very mean spirited. It takes Bly to make her friends like Bly. The main character's dad is a big meanie too. He's very rude to Bly and Blyn. He says some mean things. Bally is a bit of a snob. She won't have anything to do with Bly or Blyn if they do something she doesn. She says she doesn?t want to get on her bad side. Ble is a good girl. The books is not really the type of book that would be good for young children. It might be a good choice for a middle school age child to read to help them get a better understanding of human nature. I'd give this book a 3.5/5.

(as well as the period from the end of the war in 1945 to the fall of the Third Reich in 1945). The author, a professor at Princeton, is very well informed and a brilliant historian. It is also a book that will probably appeal to most of the non-historians in the audience, as it is so thorough.  The Jewish People are given a complete history throughout the centuries, including their contributions to the Renaissance, to European art and science, to architecture and urban planning, and to the spread of Jewish culture throughout the world. It's a book I would highly recommend to anyone who has a strong interest in the history, or the culture, of the Jews.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I've read this year.  It's been a while since I read a fantasy book I was really happy with. I've been reading books that are not as good as this one, but this is definitely a book to read.  I've really enjoyed it and can't wait to read the sequel!
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The first time I read this book I thought to myself 'oh this is a good read' and 'this book is going to be one of the best I've read this year'. It is. It is the best book I have ever read and I've been reading books for 20 years!" I have read this a number of times. It has always made me laugh out loud and it makes me think about a lot of things that I would otherwise not be able to think about. The best part about it is how it makes you think about some very real issues. It also makes you laugh out loud and cry at the same time. I'm not going to say that I agree with all of it but I do believe that it is worth reading just for the comedy.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has given me a very positive outlook on life and what it's like to be a person. I've learned a lot of things that I had previously not known about myself. It is also a great introduction to the field of psychology and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book: **********   I read this in a couple of sittings and enjoyed it. It is a book about a young girl who is a little out of it, and a lot of fun. I am sure this is going to be a hit with the teen set, and I'm glad that the author gave us a little glimpse into a very dark and sordid world.   As a bonus, the author did a great job with the illustrations. They were detailed and well done, and the story really flowed well.  -M.J.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book about six years ago, and it's still one of my favorites. I thought it was a great read from the beginning to the end, and I enjoyed the whole experience.  The stories are very short, so you can pick and choose, and that's a good thing.  I liked the fact that each story is about something different, and there is a bit of mystery to it, and a little bit of a dark humor.  The characters are not very developed, but I liked them.  They are pretty ordinary people, but they are all trying to be more than they are. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, as I've said, is one of the best things I've ever read about writing. I really like how he explains writing and how it affects us. He really is a wonderful writer and I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in writing, writing history, or writing for a newspaper or magazine. 5 out of 5 stars This book is amazing, I have never heard of this author before but now I'm a huge fan of his. I've been trying to read it since it came out and I have yet to finish. I am in the middle of the book and I cannot wait to finish it. The writing is fantastic, the research is great and the information is very accurate. 1 out of 1 stars This is a bad book. It was poorly written, the information was inaccurate, and it was full of errors. There are a few instances where it sounds like the author's mind is in a fog or in some other kind of crazy state that makes his thoughts and statements almost impossible to understand. If you're a fan of self-help books, you'll enjoy this one. I will be buying it again and again, but not on my next trip to the bookstore. 2 out of 2 stars I like the book. I also like the way it is organized. But it is not a good one. It is all the same information you would find in a book like "Why Are You So Good at Writing" by Stephen King. You know you are going to get the same kind of information as well. But I like a good self help book. That's why I like this one more. But the book is not as good as "Why are you so good at writing" or "The Art of Writing". The one that I like more. I give it 3 stars because I want to like the rest of the books but I cannot. This one is not bad but the information doesn't make sense. 3 out of 3 stars I have been looking for a book about writing for about ten years. I read a few books, but they were a waste of time. Then I came across this one on Amazon and decided to give it a try. The book is very well written, and the author is an author I admire. I found the information in this book was correct. The only thing I don't like is that he seems to have his mind made up when it comes to his information. He says that the only way to learn
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________ I really enjoyed this book. I've read some bad romance books, but I think this was better. The book is set in the late 19th century and is set mostly in a French mansion. The story takes place in the summer of 1869. We see the first part of the story, the French aristocrat and his sister, who is a young French lady. This was really well written, and it was fun to read. The characters are well-written. There are a lot of romantic love scenes, but it was a little different from my normal favorites. It wasn't overly intense. It was a good read and I would recommend it to anyone who loves romance and a good mystery.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________ I recently started listening to this book as a pre-listener.

I thought the story was interesting, although it was somewhat predictable.   The characters were interesting and the setting is very well done. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ I just finished reading this book. It is written in the first person. I loved this book because of the main character, John. He is a little like a younger version of you. His personality and love of nature is so refreshing to me. He makes you feel a part of the outdoors. He will be a great father. He just seems to be someone who is living his life to the fullest. This book is filled with so many great quotes that you can use on a daily basis. I love reading about John and his life. _____________________________________________________ What I liked: ______________ This is one of those books you read and think, "How did I not think of this sooner."

Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Way We See It" is a brilliant exploration of the world's religions, both the Abrahamic and the more modern ones. It explores the world religions from a modern perspective.  It's not just a book about a religion; it's about the religion itself.  The author uses the religions in the world to show how their followers think, how they interpret and interpret the meaning of the religion to them and to themselves.  It's a brilliant book that will open your eyes to the world of religion.  I have no idea how you'd describe the book in one word, but I can describe it as "well done" because it is.  The first half of the book describes how the world view and worldview of each of the religions changed as time progressed.  For example, Judaism was originally a pacifistic, non-judgmental religion and was later taken over by the religious leadership and the state.  Islam was originally based on a pacifist ideology but has since become a political, political, religious, and violent religion.   The book is divided into chapters where each religion is presented from a different perspective.  The first chapter is about Christianity and how the Church was founded and how it has changed over time.  It also talks about how the early Christians didn't accept the Roman Catholic Church as the one true church and how that led to the division of the church.  In the second chapter, the author explains the beginnings of Islam.  He explains the early history of Islam, its roots in the Arabian peninsula, and how Islam was spread and developed over the centuries.  Finally in the third chapter, he talks about Hinduism and how Hinduism has changed with time.  He describes how Hindu priests have been known to marry and have children with their female followers to increase the number of priests and how even the temples have been used to gain political influence.  In the fourth chapter, it talks about the Hindu belief in reincarnation.  Hinduism does not believe in the concept of a literal hell, but it does believe in a "Vishnu-Yama-Moksha" which translates to "Life After Death" which is an intermediate state between the physical and the spiritual.  And the last chapter is the most interesting one because it talks more about the Jewish religion and how they view God.  Jews believe that God is an all powerful, omniscient, and omnibenevolent being that created

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book! The art is so well done and it's always a delight to see what other artists have done. I hope more artists get into the fantasy art scene. The book's plot is just plain fun and the characters are interesting. I was expecting a book that would be more like an adventure book, but instead it was more of a fun read that was interesting and funny. This is one of my favorite books this year, and it was a good decision to get it as a gift. "I had a bad feeling. I knew it was coming, but I just couldn't be sure. It was a bad omen for me. And so I waited." -A man waiting for a bad dream. I've been reading a lot of horror lately. This book got me excited to see where this would go, and I'm really glad that I did. I really liked the writing style. I love the voice of this book. I don't remember reading a book like this in the last couple of years. The writing is very lighthearted and funny at times, and then at other times it gets dark. It doesn't feel like it's dragging on for no reason, and the character interactions were great. The book is about the story of a man named Paul. Paul was a hero in his time, but he has been down in the dumps for some time. Paul has a girlfriend named Rose and they have a lot in common. Rose is a big fan of horror movies and movies that she's watched on YouTube. Paul thinks that his new job at the coffee shop is a good way to meet some people and it is. However, things go south when the new boss is really bad at his job and he finds out about this woman named Rose's YouTube channel. He wants to get to know her, but Rose isn't exactly interested in him. Then, Paul's girlfriend gets murdered and he can't shake off the feeling that something isn't right. This leads to the story, which I'll just call the book. This book isn't for the faint of heart. I had trouble with the book at times. It is dark at times and the main characters are the types of people that are not to be messed with. I loved the story and the ending. I'm glad that the book was only a couple of hundred pages long, but it was still a good read. If you like dark, creepy, scary, or

I was initially going to wait to finish it until the last book, "The Man in the High Castle", came out, but this one was so well-written and had so much to say, I decided to go ahead and start it today. This book is the real thing and I can't wait to read it all in one sitting! Highly recommended!
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________ The following review is written by me, a student of mathematics and philosophy at a university in the USA. I am a student in the graduate program in philosophy at the University of Nebraska. I read the book by B.F. Skinner, The Origins of Behaviorism, with great interest. The author, B. F. Skinner (1905-1980) has always had a special place in my heart. I have studied psychology in graduate school and have had the privilege of teaching courses in psychology. The fact that Skinner is a great psychologist is a tribute to his brilliance and a great compliment to him. It was my privilege to have him teach my class, which was called The Psychology of the Mind. I learned a great deal from him. The book is full of interesting details and references, but I am particularly fond of the book's discussion of the relationship between the sciences and the humanities. I find it interesting how the author has used the example of the "cognitive sciences" (e.g., cognitive science, psychophysiology, cognitive psychology) to illustrate the relationship that exists between science and the humanistic disciplines. There is a clear division of labor in science and society. In science, the "scientific method" (i.e., the scientific method) is applied. The method involves the observation, investigation, testing, and observation of a phenomenon in order to understand its origin and to determine whether it is relevant to a question. In order to do this, the scientist must understand the phenomenon. The humanistic scientist, on the other hand, uses the scientific methodology to gain an understanding of a particular question or problem, but is not necessarily interested in the origin or the ultimate significance of the phenomenon, nor is he interested in its ultimate explanation. Humanistic science may be called a "question-oriented" science. The question-oriented scientist is interested in answering questions, whereas the scientific scientist is not interested in any particular questions. Humanist scientists may be concerned with the origins of human behavior, but are not necessarily concerned with its ultimate significance. The "scientific" scientist, however, is interested not only in answering the question, but also in its answers. The reader will see in the last chapter how the relation between science (in the scientific sense) and the non-scientific disciplines is discussed. This book is a good example of how the sciences have to learn to work together with the humanists to understand the human condition.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book for those who want to know more about the early years of Christianity and what we know about early Christian history from such writings as the Gospels. I enjoyed this book, as I was expecting it to be about the history of the church, but was surprised that the author chose to focus more on the early church and the lives of early Christians. I recommend this book for any serious student of the early history of Christianity.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I bought this book a few months ago, it's not as good as the first few I read but I'm glad I read it. This is the first time I've ever had an opportunity to read about the real life of a professional athlete. The author does a very good job describing his life, including the many times he has gone on binges of drinking. He is also a very honest person and I could relate to him. I thought the book was interesting and I think it's a good read, especially for those who are fans of sports or of sports writing.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful book for the beginning reader. It's a good, simple book that doesn't take too long to get through. The story follows a girl who, while searching for her missing sister, discovers a world that seems almost magical in the way it seems to bend time.  This is my third book by the author, and I like the style and the theme of the books.  The writing style is easy to read and it's easy to get into the characters.  I really liked the characters of the story and I'm glad I read this book, especially since it was a new one for me.   The book was fun and I loved how the story turned out. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book as a Christmas present and have been reading it on my commute to work.  This book gives an excellent history of the game in an easy to understand format.  The game has been around for a long time and is one of the first video games.   The game itself is a game where the players use their imagination to make up their own stories.  There is a great story within the game that is entertaining and engaging to read.  I will be purchasing more books about this game as it is a good read. Overall: 4 out of 5 The Good:  The story is interesting and entertaining.  The writing is easy to follow and easy to comprehend.  This is a well written book. The Bad:  It is a bit hard to understand when the author tries to go too deep into the history of video games and tries to use a lot of pictures and pictures of game boxes.  Overall, the book is a worthwhile read and I would recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the premise of this book:  the way in which a group of people find themselves in a similar situation, only with the difference being that they are all children of one man and all of them were adopted. I love the way that the author gives all of the characters their own individual arcs and how the narrative flows smoothly and effortlessly through the chapters, never letting the reader get bored.  It was so much fun reading this book, I was in tears while I was reading it, and the story really does end on a big cliffhanger.  I have always been interested in writing and have always wanted to be a writer.    I hope that you enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed writing it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The idea for this book came to me while I was in the shower, about a year ago. I had just finished reading a great book about the art of writing by a young British writer called J.G. Ballard, and this was the same sort of thing: a story told in a different way, but with similar themes, and similar writing style. I thought I could get a good read out of it. I am so glad I bought this. It's a short story that has all the things I like about Ballard, but also all the stuff that I don't like about him, such as a lack of emotional resonance and too much dialogue. This is the sort of book that gets better the more you read it, because the story is told from different points of view. It feels very personal, but it's not a very personal book. It is also a little too long, and the story seems a bit predictable. The author does a good job of keeping the suspense building up, but when it comes to the climax, I got the feeling that I had read this story before, and it was just the way that it was told. Still, if you like Ballard, this is a good choice.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book a few years ago and I have never gotten around to reading it again.  But I've been meaning to for quite some time.   This book tells the story of a young boy who is born with the condition, Down syndrome, and the struggles he faces as he grows up.  This book was written by a woman with Down syndrome and her parents who have to deal with his many needs and his disabilities.  It is well written, and as I read through this book, I got to know the boy's parents.  While there are many books written about people with Down Syndrome, I would say this one is the best.  I have two children and I would recommend this book to anyone who has a child who has Down syndrome.  You can read it on your own, but I think it would be a good read for a group of people who would like to get to know people with disabilities.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book, not a bad book. It is a well-researched book, written by a man who clearly loves his subject. It has many things that I liked. I liked the fact that he gave the story of how the English became the "English" rather than the original people. I enjoyed that he used many different historical accounts, such as the ones in the Histories of the Kings of England. I also enjoyed the fact he did not put a Christian viewpoint into the book. He did, however, make it clear that the English did not start out being Christian. The first people to be called English were the Celts, who were not Christian. Then, the Romans came and the English began to become Christian. As a person who is not a Christian, I enjoyed the idea of a history of England being written by someone who was not Christian but still found value in the English people. The book also makes it clear how the Roman occupation of Britain, especially Cornwall, played a role in the development of the British people. It also made it clear why there were so many different types of people in Britain. I did not like the fact the book was only a few hundred pages. However, I think that is a minor complaint. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in British history and history in general.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I read it, I was intrigued by the story and the description of the world, and the fact that it was a prequel to another book that I enjoyed so much. I was hooked. It is very well written, with interesting characters, a nice setting, a good plot and a good ending. The fact that the author is female made me feel that this was a book for everyone, not just males.   (review taken from a review on Goodreads) A young girl is chosen to be a witch at a ceremony, where she is told to gather a spell of protection from a god who has been killing people off. She is then taken to a city where a god (or a demon) is killing off humans and animals and it's up to the girl to get rid of him. It was a fun read and the world building is great. I liked the way the author wrote about the world as well as the characters. It wasn't just an adult fantasy, it was something different.  (Review taken from Goodreads review by Doreen)

He has been living in the wilderness and is in a great position to be a hunter/survivalist.  He is able to survive in a harsh environment and has learned some useful skills that make him a useful member of the group.  I'm also impressed with how the author has been able to create a believable world in which the characters live.  The world is also detailed and rich, and the author shows how the group of people interacts with each other.  A nice story, good characters, and a good plot!

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ The book is excellent. I had been searching for a new book to replace The God Delusion, and this one is perfect. I would recommend it to anyone who is a believer. _________________________  A great book. A must read for anyone who cares about the truth about religion.  Read the entire book and you will understand the true nature of the Bible. , a Christian who now serves as an associate pastor at a small church in rural Oregon, is a lifelong student of the history of the Old Testament. This is his first book, and it's one of the best he's read. He makes the best of the material and has a lot of fascinating insights on the subject. He covers all the main topics, including the history, the nature of Scripture, and the role of God in the lives of individuals and communities. This book is a must read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was reading this book the other day when I came across a description of a "narcissistic" family. I was intrigued, and read on. I don't know how to summarize this book without spoiling it. The descriptions of the "nostalgic" parent are just perfect. The "fearless" one has the worst temper I've ever seen. He goes around talking about how great he is and how great his family is. This father really does have a way with words. I'm glad I bought this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was so interesting and it made me think of other people's stories. It also gave me the courage to do something that's been on my to-do list for years.  It's funny that I have this book, since I haven't read anything by the author, and I'm pretty sure I would never have read this book if I had known about it.  It's an awesome book and I recommend it to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I liked this book. I found it to be a fun book that would help students who have trouble with grammar and writing. The author did a great job of explaining the principles that he used to develop the system. I'm not a big fan of writing or grammar, so this book was a nice change from what I was used to. I did find some things that were slightly out of place in the book, but I can forgive that since it is a good lesson.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good read - good to have a book like this around the house! The book itself is well-written, although I am not sure how much the writer knows about the subject matter. I would suggest reading the first two chapters of the book to get a feel for what's being said, but it would be helpful to read the first few chapters of "The Magic of Reality" to get up to speed with the theory and to have the feeling of being a bit inside the head of the author. The book is a bit long, so I recommend it as a good way to relax after a hard day at work.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "It's a great book. A great way to explore the history of the Bible.   It's not a scholarly book, and it's not easy reading.  You'll learn a lot from it, and even if you don't agree with the book's conclusions, you'll probably learn something about it and the book it's based on."
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a lot of books. I've read plenty about the history of the world. I'm a historian, and I know that history is not linear. There are no definite answers to what happened during the Roman Empire, or the Crusades, or any other particular period. But, if there is a way to read history that's more linear, that tells us something about the human condition, I've been looking for it. I really love this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really good book about the impact of science and medicine on the everyday lives of people. It's an accessible book that is really easy to understand. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to everyone. I also think that the book does a really nice job of introducing readers to some of the most important principles that you'll encounter in the future, so I would recommend this book to people who are in their first year of science, medical, or other fields.   I also think it's important to remember that this book was written by a medical doctor. This is one of those books that you might read about the latest research, but you would be able to tell by the book's style that it's written by someone who actually understands the material.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- This book was very helpful in understanding my issues with the Mormon church. I have been trying to find the right answer to the problem of a belief system that is founded on lies and has no evidence that supports its existence. I was so confused when I started reading about the Book of Mormon and its history. I don't understand how anyone could take a faith like that seriously. After reading this book I can finally see how wrong I was. I really liked this book. I learned a lot. I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ "The best book about being a woman in tech... The only book on this subject I've found to be truly honest about women in tech." —Tina C. "I really liked this book. It was well written and thought provoking." —Carol R. If you're a woman who has ever felt alienated by your role in the tech industry, this book will change your life. You can read more reviews and comments here. It's important to point out that this book was not written by a woman, so it does not have the same "woman in tech" perspective as The Hacker Way. The Hacker way focuses on women's struggles in the technical community and is about "women and girls in tech who are having trouble making a difference". This book is different because it's about women as a whole. It also discusses how to "make a difference" by becoming an entrepreneur, by pursuing a STEM degree, by taking advantage of networking, etc. This book is not for people who want to be engineers or developers, and it is not about women making the industry better for the rest of the population. The book focuses on the struggles women face and how to deal with them. The author does a good job of showing how these struggles are not only common, but very real. The problems are real and the solutions are not. The author does not make any promises or promises are given. Instead, the author gives examples and talks about why these problems exist and what can be done about them. The main idea is to focus on the women who are in a position to change things. While the book does not specifically talk about the difficulties that women face in the technology industry, I think that this is an important topic. It is important to realize that women are not just "women in tech", they are women everywhere. The challenges that women have in this field are shared by many women, not just women in the STEM field. As an aside, this is the first book I have read where the author actually discusses why women are in the field in the first place. It's a good start to tackling the stereotypes that many people have about women, and the book addresses these stereotypes in the chapter about "The Good Girls and the Bad Boys". I think it's an important and important discussion to have about the reasons why women get into STEM and it's good to have the book tackle this topic in a positive way. In
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This is my favorite book so far, although it's a little pricey. I loved this book and thought it was well written.

I definitely recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of the series and the first book in particular. It's been a while since I've read a novel this deep into the Harry Potter universe and I've enjoyed it immensely. There's a ton of stuff going on in the book that I think is a good idea, but I do have a few complaints. First, there are a few things about the writing style that I'm not entirely comfortable with. The way Rowling describes her characters is wonderful, but sometimes I felt that she was a bit too close to the characters. For example, in a conversation between Hermione and Ron (in book 3) we learn that Hermione used to be very interested in Harry but that she had to deal with him and Ron's abusive, abusive relationship. Now I don't necessarily object to that characterization because it is, after all, the point of the book. However, in book 2 (I think it's book 2, not book 1) Hermione tells Ron that she's not attracted to him at all. In this conversation I couldn't help but wonder why Hermione would say that. Is Hermione really just ignoring Ron because she's attracted to Harry? Or is it something else? I guess I'll have to read more to find out. Rating: ******** The second part of my review is going to be a bit more lengthy than the first, but as a long time Harry Potter fan I couldn The thing that I have a problem with is the Harry/Hermione relationship. This book starts off okay, with Hermione being somewhat jealous of Harry but it's quickly overshadowed by Harry's attraction to Hermione. Hermione is very attractive, and Harry is very charming. Harry's interest in her is just a side note and it's not something that's explored a lot in the rest of the story. In the book I feel like there's a clear idea of what Hermione and Harry are supposed to be, but it never seems to have a clear conclusion to it. It would be easy to say that Hermione has some sort of problem with Harry, but at the end of the day I'm still not entirely sure what's going on. Another thing that bothers me about the relationship between Harry and Hermione is the way that Harry seems to be able to control Hermione's actions. I've said this before, but Hermione is really good at avoiding conflict and taking a different route than Harry. When Hermione and her friends were being attacked by Death Eaters, Harry was able to get Hermione to
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed the books about the Vietnam War.  They were written by people who had been there.  The writing style is easy to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's really a good, easy to read book about a very simple, yet very powerful method of using the human mind to change people's lives. I think it's one of those books that anyone can read and learn a lot from. I was not sure if I was going to like it or not, but I did. I've always been an introvert, but when I first read this book I felt like I had been given a little bit of extra time to read and study and that was a big help for me. The fact that I had to go to the bookstore to buy it and that it was $5, made the price a little more difficult to swallow, but overall it's a good value. This book is definitely worth the read and worth the money.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book was enjoyable and the story was well told. The book was easy to follow, and I liked that it was told through the eyes of an outsider who didn't know a lot about the subject matter. The story was engaging, but didn't drag on too long. The character development was good, and there was a sense of mystery about the book's subject matter as well. There are some good ideas in here that I think can make for a very interesting fantasy book, and it would be interesting to see a more detailed treatment of these ideas. The only flaw I could find with this book is that it had some plot holes, which is a bit of a bummer.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good read, the only problem I had with the book is that I didn't find much of interest in the story. The book is about a woman who is an expert in using the internet to look for the perfect man, but ends up finding the wrong one, which is really just a minor gripe. The best part about the book was the interviews with people who were really into the topic of online dating, and the research and the writing.  The book is not too long, and if you're looking for a quick read, this book is perfect.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "An outstanding work of historical fiction, one of the best of the year."  (George Plimpton)  I read this book after finishing an excellent book about the life of the poet Dylan Thomas.  In a way I was glad I read the Dylan Thomas book because this one is similar, but not as good as Thomas. This is a story of a man who is a great scholar of the history of science, but who was also a great military leader, and is now one of history's great historical figures. The book starts with his military career and goes into his research about the first atomic bomb. The research itself was really interesting and is part of why this book was so good.  A very well written book.    The author does a good job of presenting the author's research.  It's not a dry historical account like the Thomas book. I did like the fact that the book was very interesting, even if I didn't understand the history he was talking about.  The book is not just about the history, but also about the man.  This is not a biography.  He is an interesting character.  There are parts in the book where I felt the author was trying to present the character as some sort of saint, but in my opinion that was not how the character was.  I think the author did a good good job showing the character's flaws.  What I liked about the book is the fact the the character is very well known to many people.  In fact the book does a great job of telling the story about him and his research. It's a good read and a good way to start your reading about the subject.

If you have a copy of this book, get a copy with the military edition because you'll be glad you did. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good military adventure story." -Lloyd C. Brown
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I found this book to be very interesting. I did not like the first part of the book which was about the history of the "Mormons". It was very dry. But the last part was much more interesting and was the part that gave me the most satisfaction and satisfaction is that it explained the "Book of Mormon" in much greater detail. I will say that there are some interesting ideas in this book but I found that I was not impressed with any of the arguments that were used. I felt that the author's arguments were weak and weak arguments lead to weak conclusions. I really feel that I would like to see the book expanded. I am looking forward to seeing the other chapters that are about other topics and the author will be working on expanding the book. 9 of 10 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book because I wanted to read about how to get into the art of "Flaming Man" (a sort of "Kiss Me First"/"Pee On Me" for my feet) and the first thing I thought of was that I was looking at the "F" in Flaming (a name I thought sounded like a sex act). So that's not exactly what this book is about.  The first chapter is about how I'm going to do it (I have to admit that I haven't really done this before), and then there's some general information about the art, and I liked that it was a bit technical and detailed.  The next chapter is all about the technique.    It's pretty detailed. The book is also a bit of a "how to" for me, because I want to do the flamming, but I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out what works for me.  So, as a bit-of-a-review, I thought I'd give this book a two-star review.
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________ This is a very well-researched, very thorough book on the subject of the origins of the American Revolution. The author takes a very detailed look at many different events and places in which the American revolutionaries took up arms, including the French and Indian War, the War of 1812, the Battle of Yorktown, the Siege of Boston, and many others. While there are some minor errors in the chronology, the main point is fairly well made, and the author uses numerous footnotes and quotes from the various historians and authors who were involved in the research to add depth to his arguments. I'm not a fan of history as a form, but this book is very well done. I think I will take this one over the original.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I love this book. This book has a lot of great tips and tips for people who are trying to build a relationship with a dog. I've read a lot about dog training and behavior, and I feel like this book is just about as thorough as you can get for a single book. The authors use several different techniques to help you to create a good relationship with your dog. Each section is very specific to a particular technique, but they all give you a general idea of how to approach a dog and build a good bond with him. I am really excited to give this book a try. I feel that the authors did a great job explaining the principles of how dogs are different from people. I'm also excited to see more books that use dog training techniques to create good relationships with your pets. This is the best dog book I have read. --Karen, Westmont, IL (May 2013)
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Black Box, by Daniel M. O'Connell is a great read about how the black box works in the world. The book is an introduction to the field of Artificial Intelligence. The author gives a broad overview of the field as well as providing some very useful background on how the box works and how it is being used. He provides a few examples of what happens when you try to build a machine that thinks like a human. The most interesting part of the book is in the chapters on how a person could end up with a black box that can't think like a person and a person that can end up on a reality show. I will certainly be buying this book for the book.
Write a positive review about a good book: **********   This is an amazing book that changed my life. I don't have kids, but I do have friends with kids. They are wonderful, intelligent people who do great things in the world.   So I started with this book because I was interested in parenting. I have always been curious about what it's like to be a parent.   the author is a real professional. She's a psychologist, and she also has a degree in education. She wrote this book in an accessible style, and I could tell that she put a lot of effort into it. She has a lot to say about the importance of education. I also appreciate that she doesn't get down on herself when she does things wrong.  ....   There are so many different ways to be good at parenting. And it is not just about having good parenting skills. It's also about being a good person. It is about being open-minded. It involves knowing your child and his strengths and weaknesses, and using those strengths to your advantage. You must also be willing to sacrifice things in your life to be there for your child. It also involves being kind and giving to your child when they are upset. It can be difficult, but it's worth it.   is an excellent book about the many different aspects of being a parent (and there are a lot). The author talks about her own experiences and the difficulties she had with her own parents. I think she does a good job of explaining how to be an excellent parent. This is a book that you want to have on your shelf. It will make you want a child of your own.  - This book is available at the following online retailers:

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm always on the hunt for new and interesting books, and this one is great. I love the way it uses the concept of memory as a metaphor to describe how one experiences life. I think it's great because it doesn't overcomplicate the concepts. The best part about it is that the book gives you a sense of what life is like on the other side of this kind of memory loss. The author explains it well, and she even includes her own experience as an example, which is so cool. I can't wait to get my hands on the next one she writes.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I've read a lot of books about "how to" or "why" to do things and this book is a real gem. The author, who writes under the pseudonym of "Shawn L.", gives great advice in this book and is very friendly, down to earth, and very down to Earth. The book is very detailed and there are many tips to help you with your business, including how to get clients and how to attract new clients. It's a real read and a great resource. The only thing I don't like is that the book is out of print, but I hope they put it out soon.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love The Hunger Games. It is the story of Katniss Everdeen, the heroine of the Hunger Games, a popular series of novels in which teens are forced to compete to be the "best" person in a dystopian society ruled by the Capitol. Katniss is an ordinary teenager in a world she doesn't understand. When she is selected to compete in the Hunger Game, Katnisson's family's home is taken over by the Hunger, a group of people who live in a vast underground city. Katherine is a teenager in the world of Hunger Games, and she knows nothing about Katnison. She knows nothing but she is forced to participate in the competition to be a "good" citizen of the Capitol, so she must use her life as a rebel to find out what Katnisk does in the Capitol and why they are so desperate to kill her. The story is gripping, and there are some wonderful moments. The book is written with an emphasis on Katnizion, the people who are part of the hunger game, and the Capitol is portrayed as a terrible place. There is no doubt that the book is a good read. It has many of the aspects of the books that make them so popular, such as strong characters and great action. It is just a shame that it is a series of books instead of a novel.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book because of a comment from a friend and it's great. It was good enough to warrant my purchase, so I'm happy I picked it up. It's about a man who has a love for a girl who has the same interest as him, which is a pretty cool thing to know about yourself. The characters are so cute that you just want to hug them, and it was a nice change of pace from all the other romance books I've read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic. I read this as a child and it was very much the same as I remember it.

It has a nice combination of humour and danger and is a great book to get you through the school holidays.  A must have.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________  I think this is the best book I have read in years. It is a true story about a real person. It also tells the story of how an unlikely friendship led to an unlikely partnership. It does a good job of showing that true friendships can exist between people that have no common interests at all. I can't say enough good things about this book. It has helped me realize that not all of us have to be a group of people with the same interest. I am glad that I read this book and I will definitely read more by this author.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A very well-written book, about a man who becomes a good father to his son.  I was a bit puzzled as to why there is no mention of the baby in the title of the book, but that's just because the book is about a father, not a baby.    I've seen this title used a couple of times.  My guess is that it's either a mis-spell or a case of poor grammar.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent work of research and analysis of the phenomenon of modern, social justice-inspired feminism.  The author, Laura Kipnis, makes a strong case that it is the progressive, feminist movement that has driven the culture wars of the last few decades.   The author also explains that in the early days of the feminist movement in the 1960s, the focus was on issues such as abortion, feminism, and domestic violence.   But by the 1990s the focus shifted to issues such  women's rights and sexuality, including sexual harassment and the "rape culture" narrative.  This new focus on the culture and morality of men and boys has created a culture war that has left feminists with a powerful advantage over men and men's advocates.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have never really enjoyed the first few books in a series that I read, but I am glad I finally found this one. It was a quick and easy read, not taking too long to get to the good stuff. The story is really good, and I feel like it will be a great book to read for young children.  It's a nice story, and there were a few parts that made me feel like I was reading a young adult book, but then I remember that this is a fantasy book, and children's books are usually a little more on the adult side. I hope they don't take away any more of the humor from the book though.   My thoughts:   I am really glad that I found this book!    This was a good read for me, as I had a few issues with the first book in the series, but it has gotten much better since then, and now I am looking forward to reading the other books in the trilogy.  I think that I will start on the third book now!

It had a bit of a romance element to it, but I wasn't really drawn to it. I was a bit disappointed that the last few books are so short and the last one was the worst of the three. The characters were fun, the world was interesting, and the plot was engaging. I would recommend this book to any child that is interested in a good fantasy book.

"This is a great book about how to live your life well. The author provides you with practical ideas that will help you do whatever you want in life and will make you happy.

I loved the idea of living your life as a story, with its many twists and turns... this book has inspired me to do something new, and something interesting, and to find my inner happiness." --Gwen C. I've read this book a couple of times and it still stands out as one of the best books on self-actualization.  It's clear, well-written, and inspiring, and I can't wait to get it on my Kindle and start reading again.  I'm already thinking of other topics to cover with it. The Art of Living Well by Susan Cain I first read this as a college freshman in high school.  It's about how we make meaning from our daily activities, how we use the past to make future decisions, and how to set priorities.  It's also about a lot of other things, but that's for another day. What I remember about this book is that it was a reminder that we are not slaves to our actions and that we can always do better, no matter how good or bad the result.  I've learned from this and I've also found it to be very useful in my own life.  This is a book that I recommend to everyone, even if they aren't planning to live a more productive life.   How to Make a Good Life Great by Dale Carnegie In this book, Carnegie outlines some of the most important rules of being a successful person and offers some tips and advice to help you become a successful businessman.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________   This is a wonderful book about the power of the written word and how the author was able to teach herself to write.   The author's story begins in the 1940s when her parents were very poor and her family lived in a two room wooden shack that had a wooden roof. Her mother would have to work all day and would never be able to go out to buy groceries. Her father would always sit in the house all day playing the piano. The family had to work hard to make ends meet, and her mother would never make it out of the house. One day, when her father was sick, she went to work as a nurse in the hospital. Her work was very hard, and she was often hungry and lonely. Her parents had lost their home and had to rent another, and it was often a struggle to make even a single dollar a day. Her childhood was filled with hard work and struggle, but she was able find meaning in it. One night, while she was sleeping on the couch, she dreams about a man with a white hat, and he said he was going to give her a good education, and take care of her. That night, she writes a letter to him. The next morning, she meets the man in person, and they spend the rest of their lives together.  ....   As a young child, the reader learns the story of how the writer's journey is different from that of the writer who simply writes a book. As the story progresses, the story is told in the form of a story about the writer, who writes a story, who wants to be a writer, and who is in a situation similar to the writer described in the beginning. The writer in the book is a woman named Marge. Marge is a young woman who lives with her abusive and alcoholic father and her younger brother in a shack. Her sister is constantly being hit by her father, who doesn't seem to like her and always wants to leave her with her sister. Her brother is in and out of jail and has become an alcoholic. Margo's father always made her and her brother work and was always a disappointment to her. When she was 11, her mother dies, and the whole family has to move into a new house. Marnie and her sister move in with her mother and her father. Mm is very lonely and unhappy, and spends most of her time with her brother. Moom

Write a positive review about a good book:  The World is Flat by John Maynard Keynes is a great book on economics and monetary economics. It has many excellent ideas on how monetary policy can impact economic activity. Keynes' insights are well-taken and his analysis is spot on. Keynes provides a sound basis for monetary policy, but I think it's too bad that he only really talks about the Great Depression and World War I in the first half of the book. It's clear that he would have done a much better job explaining what happened in the early 1900s and early 1930s and why we don't have a problem today. It was great that he included a lot of good economic analysis and policy proposals in the second half of his book. I highly recommend this book and I look forward to reading other books by Keynes.

The first few pages of the book are full of good information and great descriptions about all kinds of animals. The next 20 or so pages are all about how to build your own home for your furry friend. I don't know if the book's description is true, but the description of building a rabbit cage is great. It is very easy to make a simple, safe and functional rabbit cage, but that doesn't mean you should. If you have a small space, this is the perfect book for you. *************

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- This book is a must have in my library. I've been looking for a book to help me understand how the Church teaches and teaches the Book of Mormon to its members and I have found it. There are so many great points that I could list, but I'm not sure I can. If you read this book and you want to know how the church teaches the book of Mormon, read it! I've never had a bad experience with the church, so I will tell you how the book helped me understand the book. I believe the church was a direct witness to the Book and I was very glad that they knew what the truth was. If the church is wrong about something, it is wrong for the same reason as we are wrong about the sun and the moon. We just can't see it. The Church was told that the Book was a translated work and it was not translated by the Holy Ghost, so we can not believe the Book is God's word. But this book has taught me that the Church is right. I can see the Book being a great witness for the Church. ------------------------- I am very pleased that I purchased this book. This book will help me to see the church for what it is and what it does. I would like to thank you for providing a book that will help people understand the Book, its origins and the truth about the Book. __________________ I think this book is great! I have always wondered about the history of the Book but never found anything that I felt was solid and that I really understood. This is my first experience reading a book about it and I enjoyed it greatly. I am a believer, but was never sure what the Church taught and this book really opened up the picture for me. I think it's important to know what the church believes in the face of all the controversy, but that's just me. If I was ever to have my doubts, this book would be a great place to start. _______________________________________________________________________________ This is an excellent book and the author has done a wonderful job. The author has a deep knowledge of the history and teachings of the Church and a good grasp of LDS doctrine. He has a strong testimony and a passion for his faith. The book is filled with the facts of history and the testimonies of the saints. He also gives us some of the problems and issues that have arisen in the last 50 years. His point is clear: there is a problem with the Church, and it
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an extremely well-researched, well-written book that I would recommend to anyone who is interested in how the human mind works. The author describes how it is that all of the "experiments" that are performed in scientific experiments on animals are in fact similar to the experiments that are done on humans. He explains how there are similarities in the way that the brain is designed and organized in humans and in other animals, how we have evolved certain physical characteristics, and how our thoughts are determined by physical processes in the brain.  There is an interesting chapter on the history of brain research.  The author has done a good job of taking the concepts in a simple way and giving them a more understandable way to be understood by a lay person. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is not so good. It is about the life of one man and the mistakes that led to his downfall. The author makes some good points, but his style is very amateurish and I found the book boring. He was not a very good writer, and the writing is very uninteresting. The writing style is also very repetitive, and I was really disappointed with the story. I would not recommend this book to anyone. "I was very impressed with this book. A man who is not an easy man to read about and a man who has made his mistakes is a very interesting subject and I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in this subject. I do wish he had written about another man, one who did not have the same mistakes that he did." -Troy, Bookworm Blues "I read the book after reading the article that this is about in the Wall Street Journal. In my opinion the Wall St Journal article and book are not quite equal. I don't like the style of writing of the book but I do like the book itself." -Robert B. S, The Review of Books I received a review copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. I received the book from the publisher via Netgalley, which makes me feel that the review was not influenced by the publisher or any other source. All opinions are my own. This book is about David Meade, a young man who started a new career as a professional gambler in his early twenties. He did not really get the recognition that he deserved in his youth. After his mother's suicide, he was raised by his grandmother who took care of him while his parents went off to war. After a time he decided that he wanted to do more with his life and so he enrolled in college, but in the middle of his sophomore year he was arrested for drug possession. He spent the rest of his college career trying to pay his debt to society, but even after his time in prison he was not able to graduate. He became a vagrant and then a drifter. He worked for a time as a mail carrier, but lost his job. He eventually joined a church youth group, but he became disillusioned with the program and was sent home for breaking the rules. He found a job as a security guard, but it turned out to be very unsatisfying. Eventually he became a full time gambler and made his first millions. He had no intention of leaving his

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________ This is the first book I've read that really got me thinking about how I was feeling about a character. There's no big reveal, no dramatic twist, just a very moving character story about a woman who's been living in the shadow of a man she's loved since she was a child. She tries to move on, but it seems as though that man is forever watching her, hoping that one day he can make his presence known. If you've ever felt that way about a romantic partner, this is a book you'll want to read. (This is the only review that was less than 5 stars because I feel that I was cheated out of a good 5 or 6 stars.)

Write a positive review about a good book:  The God Delusion is a fantastic book and is one of the best books on atheism I've read.  It's a very readable and easy to understand book that I'm sure many of my atheist friends will enjoy.  I'll be reviewing it for the next book review.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ This book is a good one to start with. I have read all the other reviews before I buy this book, and I don't like to be pressured to buy a book. But after reading this one, I did. And I liked it. I think the author does a good job explaining the history of the U.S. Constitution, and what it really means. I would have liked to see a better treatment of the founding fathers, but I liked the book overall.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Secret of the Incas by Peter Molyneux.  I've heard good things about it, and it was on the bestseller list for a while, but recently I got tired of it and I decided to give it a rest.    I'm still pretty sure it was a good read, but not a great one.  This was the last book that Peter Moxes did for the series (with some of the last books, at least), and it seemed like the end of an era.  The first book is a very interesting one about the origins of the modern Inca culture.  Unfortunately, the second book does not make up for the first.  It was a very good book, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to the first book.  I would like to give this a 4 or 5, but I think the 5 is a bit generous.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This is a very good book about writing. I like this book because it is very helpful to the aspiring writer, but it also does a great job of teaching some things about the craft. I am a fan of both of the authors, and I enjoyed this book. The advice about learning to write is very important. The book is about what happens when you write a novel, so I was a little worried about the content. It did not disappoint. In fact, I would say it's very similar to a course you would take at a college or university to learn how to write a book. I'm happy with the purchase. -------------- What a great resource. I love it. It's an absolute must for anyone aspiring to write anything. The tips in this book are all valuable. The only thing I would suggest is that if you're struggling to put your ideas together and writing, take a step back and give yourself some time to relax and re-evaluate your writing. It may not sound like much, but I guarantee that you'll write better in the long run. Thanks, Michael and Kevin -------------- I just finished this book, which is a nice refresher of a few basics. There's some good advice and I'm glad I read it. I think a lot of writers should read it if they want to write better books and more consistently. I found the book to be well-written, but a little difficult to understand at times. It would be nice if you could click through a little easier to see a picture or diagram so that I can better follow along.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about a woman who is trying to figure out her life after her parents die, and it's really good. She has a very sweet and genuine personality, and the story is really heartwarming.  The only real complaint I have is that the ending was a little confusing, but that's the price of a good story.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  This is a brilliant book. The story is well done, and the characters are very realistic. It's a good read, even though I haven't read any of the books by J.R.R Tolkien.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________.  5.0 of 5 stars: The best mystery/thriller ever written!  Review by: Jennifer F. Date Added: Monday, August 22, 2009  This book is amazing. I really don't have anything negative to say. It's the best book I have ever read in any genre. I have read countless books about murder mysteries and they all sound really boring and tedious. This book is the best! I don't think you will be disappointed.  the mystery is awesome! i love that the murder is solved at the end.   I have never loved a mystery as much as I love this one.   the book is narrated by an excellent narrator. .  (I did like that the author did not use the 'whistling' method of narration - it really doesn't help when you have a character who is trying to kill you)  the book is very entertaining and the plot twists and turns perfectly. I can't wait to read the next book. , (I also loved that the book didn't have a 'twist ending' and the mystery was solved in the last chapter, so the author didn't waste any more time with the mystery. I would recommend this book to anyone, no matter what genre you enjoy!)   the murder is really well done. it's a nice twist on the mystery genre and gives you a satisfying conclusion that you won't forget.   to top it off the book also includes a few bonus items. i loved how the author included a CD of old music that played while the characters were doing their crime. it gave a bit of a nostalgia kick and the music was very nice. the CD also included a DVD that also played while they were on the run. i think this book is great for all ages.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was an absolute blast to read. The writing is simple, but yet complex, and the writing is excellent. I really enjoyed the story and found it very entertaining. I would recommend this book to all who want to read a very good book, that is definitely not too complicated. The story:  A young woman named Alice is looking for a new place to live in a very rough area of the city, and a job to help her make ends meet. While trying to find a place to stay she meets a very interesting woman named Anna, a very old man named Charles, and their love story will change her life forever. Recommendations:    This is a good and entertaining read for the whole family.  
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________  I just finished reading this book, I have been trying to understand the science behind a lot of the paranormal stuff for a long time, but it was a long slog. This book was easy to understand, and easy to read. The science in this book was actually pretty solid. The author also made sure to explain the science in a way that makes sense to someone who doesn't have a background in the field. The book was definitely an enjoyable read, I would recommend this book to people who are interested in the science, and want to understand how the paranormal works.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________ is an excellent book. It is a comprehensive survey of the history of the Holocaust, and the author gives a great overview of the events that took place in the camps. The book also covers the Nazi persecution of homosexuals and the role played by the Nazis in the formation of the Third Reich. Overall, this book is a good overview of an important event that is often overlooked.   The book also includes an excellent bibliography and many excellent images that make the book a must for all students of the Nazi era.     A summary of the book: The Nazi persecution and murder of the Jews, especially of homosexuals, began in the spring of 1933 when Hitler banned homosexual acts and the Jewish-led "Internationale" movement to protest against Hitler's persecution. As a result, homosexuals were arrested, imprisoned, and killed. A second wave of arrests and executions took place the following summer, with gay men being arrested on trumped-up charges. Homosexuals were also targeted as scapegoats for the failure of the Weimar Republic to solve economic and social problems.  , is an outstanding work on the subject of the concentration camps. It covers the whole period between 1933 and 1945 and includes the main camps as well as a few smaller ones that were part of the "special camp" system. It also includes a large amount of information about the camps themselves, the victims of the camps, the camps' function, the concentration of homosexuals in the concentration camp system, the role of the SS, the treatment of homosexuals by the SS and the SS leaders, and much more. This book is an invaluable resource for students of this important period in history.   to be continued.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I read the first book of this series after I got married. The characters are wonderful, and I am happy to be a part of the world. I love that it is a science fiction book with a magical element, but is not a "sci-fi/fantasy" book by any means. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A must read, if only to understand why all the other books about the "Saddam"s are garbage.  I found myself wondering, was it possible to know that Saddam Hussein was a monster, but still love him?  The book is a well-researched, well-written, and well-documented piece of investigative journalism.  The author does not, however, have the last word.   Saddama, if you want to call him that, is the subject of a book of his own. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.  It was a fun read, and had a good storyline.  This is a book I've read about three times already, and am looking forward to reading it again.  I think I have a good feeling about this book too, it is a well written, well paced and well researched book. I have no problem with a story that's not really my style, but I enjoyed this one!
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- 5 stars for the good and the fun and the story. --------------- It is a good story and it is fun to read. -------------- 4 stars for its entertaining and the ending is very well done. --------------------------- 3.5 stars for a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very enjoyable read. The writing is very good, the characters are all likable, and the plot is very well thought out. There is some very cool tech in this book. The world building is very detailed, and you feel like you are actually there, in this world.  4 stars.  I am not a huge fan of science fiction, but I am a huge science fiction fan. This book was absolutely wonderful! I absolutely loved every minute of it. 
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________ [reviews by T.J. and C.B.] I just finished reading The Great Gatsby. It was a real eye-opener. The plot line was excellent, and the characters were very well-developed. I loved the characters and the whole story. The story was quite gripping, but the book did have one flaw. It is so difficult to get through it. It took me two hours to read the whole thing. This is a great read, but it just takes a long time. It makes me wonder if there's a sequel on the way. I am a little disappointed because this was a very well made book. However, I will still read the next one. [review by J.P.] I enjoyed this book, although I found it a little difficult to read. The characters were well drawn and I really enjoyed the way that the story was told. I have enjoyed reading many of your other books but I can't wait for the next. Thanks again. [Review from a customer] I really enjoy reading about people who are going through tough times. I find that these books usually contain a lot of information that you will find useful. I was glad that I got to know more about the characters before they were murdered by their neighbors. The only complaint I have is that the book is a little long. The last section takes a little time to get to, but then it is a fun read. [A very well written, very well paced, and very enjoyable book. It really gets your blood pumping!] I just had to tell you how much I enjoyed the book! I loved it! The characters are interesting and the story is really fun! I was so happy that I purchased this book. Thank you so much for putting this book out! I am very pleased with it!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is excellent. I enjoyed it. The story is good, and I really like the author. The plot is pretty basic and simple, but the characters are interesting and have the potential to become great, like they did in the story. I love the humor of this story and the character development is great. I would recommend this book to people who like fantasy and mystery stories and I am very happy to have bought it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book is one that you can read and understand, no matter how many times you have read it. This book was perfect, I am in love with this book. I really enjoyed this book and it will be one of my top five favorite books in my library.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "It is the most detailed, researched, and most fascinating book I have read."  - Richard Gere "A fascinating look at the origins of the CIA's program of assassination. It is the definitive work on the subject." - William C. Banks, Jr., Author, "Bombshell: The Hidden History of the Cold War" "Dr. David Robarge's new book is a definitive account of the history of the assassination program from its inception in the 1950s to its termination in the early 1970s.... [Dr. Robarge] makes a compelling case that the CIA played a pivotal role in the assassination of Fidel Castro." - Philip Shenon, New York Times "Dr Robarge provides an authoritative and well-written history that is at once comprehensive and readable. This is a work that is well worth reading. I recommend it highly." - John B. Dunlop, author of "The Man Who Killed Kennedy"
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this book. I liked it a lot because it made me think about the way I view myself and the world around me. There is a lot of information in this book, but I was glad to see that it's not all just boring facts. I think this book can be a good read for people who are looking for something new, as well as those who just want to read a well written book that doesn't make them feel like they are being lectured to. I also liked the way the author presents the story of his life and what happened to him, so the reader can understand how much his experiences affected him. There were a few things I thought were really funny, but not in a bad way, so I thought that was a good thing. I'm not a big fan of books that are overly long, but this one didn't have to be. The only thing that I wish was a little longer is that the author mentions some things that I know and some things I don't, but the reader has to read the book to find out what is what. Also, I think the author could have added more to the ending. It just seemed like the book was getting to the good stuff pretty fast, and I would have liked to know a little bit more about how the author got his first computer or how he got his current one. Overall, I really liked this book and I hope to see more from this author.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________  I've always loved fantasy and I was excited to read this book. I didn't expect much from it and I still don't know why it's rated so high but the story was really good and the characters are complex and interesting. I loved it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book while I was in a bad state of mind, I had just quit a job and needed to find a way to put myself back on track. The book was helpful. I'm still not sure how I felt about the book, but I know I will be picking up the next book by the author.  The Best Horror Book Ever!:   the author of this book is a great writer. he is able to show the horror that is all around us. The only downside is that it is too much. I can't get the author to put in the real scary moments in the book because the book was too long and I was bored of it. If I had to choose between this book and the original "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" I would choose the original over this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: **********   In my view this is a great book. I have been in the "adrenal fatigue" phase of life and I have read many other books on the subject. My only reservation is that the author makes it seem as though a lot of the problems we have in our lives stem from our genetic code. It is an unfortunate fact that some people have a much higher metabolism than others. That does not mean that these people have more health problems. I found it interesting that the person who wrote the book was a medical doctor and he felt that the higher metabolism caused a lot more health issues than the genes did. It does make you think though. I did enjoy the book.   My favorite part is the section on diet. He points out that many people are under the impression that they can "eat to live." He says that it is a myth and that eating can only be done in moderation. I can definitely see that it would be difficult to eat "in moderation." I also think it is possible to live on a diet of potatoes, carrots, lettuce and a bit of cheese.   to sum up my opinion:  I enjoyed this book. It gave me something to think about. It was interesting to read. It would be helpful to see some research to back up his ideas.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is excellent and very thorough. It takes a thorough look at the issue of how the LDS Church handles apostasy, as well as its current policy and procedures on excommunication and excommunication letters. It is well written and covers many important issues. I recommend this book to anyone that is a practicing member of the LDS church. 5 of 5 stars:    This book is absolutely fantastic. The author gives a thorough overview of the issue and the history of the church. If you have not read this book then do yourself a favor and pick it up right away!
Write a positive review about a good book:    "In many ways, this book is like a mini-movie. I mean a really really good mini-film: an interesting story with a good amount of character development, a great cast of characters, some fun moments and an exciting finale. It's a great book to read while sitting around on the couch or sitting in the car with a movie-in-the-making on the TV."     "It's a fun and intriguing read."      A very enjoyable read and an entertaining story. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good stories. I also highly recommend reading the sequel to this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ The most important thing you can do is not let the bad reviews stop you from reading the book. In the beginning, I was a little confused about what exactly is the book about, and there were some very odd scenes in the book, but as I got to know more about the world of the book and the characters, it was pretty easy to get into the world. It has a pretty unique and intriguing plot, so if you are looking for something different and different than most books out there, I would highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I just finished reading "The Good Earth" by Mary E. Stover. I have never seen a book with such an appealing concept. The story is told in a realistic, yet entertaining way. The author has an easy going style that is very well written. The characters are well-written and I really liked them. One character is so likable that I will definitely buy the next book in the series! I am looking forward to reading more from this author.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The New Science of Love by Paul Bloom: 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a lot of horror. I think my favorite authors are Stephen King, Clive Barker, Neil Gaiman, and Clive Barker again. I have been reading them since I was a teenager. I really liked the books about a man who lives in a castle, who gets his powers from the castle. I liked it because I've read books like this before. I'm really looking forward to this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A wonderful book. The writing style is a bit dry, but the writing is very well done and the story and characters are well drawn. I have to say that I am in love with the character of Paddy. He is so endearing and likeable and I can see how this would make for a great series.   I have to mention that I enjoyed the artwork as well. It's a nice mix of the cartoonish look and the more realistic look. It was very nice to see a book that was both good looking and well drawn."
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ The only thing I could say that is not wrong is that there are many good books on philosophy. I am not saying that any of them are bad, but I have a hard time finding good books in this field. _______________________________ The book is a very good and very thorough introduction to the philosophy of religion.   I found this book very helpful and insightful.  The author does a great job of explaining the differences between philosophy and religion, and how they can be used to help each other. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  "There are a lot of great stories in this book. It is a must read for anyone who likes a good mystery." "This is the first book I've read that made me really appreciate the fact that I live in a world where people don't just do what they want."
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book a couple weeks ago, when I was in the midst of finishing a book I really liked. This one was different, and more enjoyable. I love fantasy books, and this one was a good one, but not one of my favorites. This is more of a story of a journey, and how a man with a sword came to be a man of the sword. It's got some good writing, some good characters, and the plot is well done. I liked it, and I will look for more books by this author.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ "My favourite book of the year" -   "It is such a well-crafted story and so engaging." -    "I really liked this book. The story was well told and the characters were believable." -  My favourites of the past year.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "There is so much good information in this book. I am going to make a special note of the following three sections: 1. The "Bible Code" - 2. The Old Testament as a "Book of Truth" - 3. The New Testament as an "Book about Truth." These are the only sections I would suggest you read in order." -Sandra I bought the first edition of this book in 1988 and have been reading it ever since. This is a wonderful book. It is not only a good study guide, but it is a very entertaining and informative read. I have always appreciated the fact that the authors include a "Brief History" and a "Index of Quotations." If I had more time I would also like to note that the book also includes a "Table of Contents" to help you navigate the text. The most important part of the book is the "Old Testament." There are a few other "Biblical" references in the "New Testament," but these are brief and the author does not feel they add anything that the other references do not. There are many references in this "BIBLE CODE" that have been discussed in the New Testament for years, but the author provides a concise and very useful reference. The only other reference in this section is that of the "Gospel of John." This book is a great resource for the serious student of the Bible. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to gain an understanding of the Biblical texts and to also gain an appreciation for the authors' work. I was pleased to discover that the Bible Codes also includes sections on "Ecclesiastical History," "Church Fathers," and "Apocrypha" which I thought would be interesting. I also enjoyed that there was a "Contemporary Church History" section. As always, the author was very thorough and very fair.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I've read about the political life of Gandhi in English for the past decade. This is a good and very informative account.  Gandhi was a good man, but he was a political opportunist with an exaggerated view of himself and the world, with a tendency to seek out conflict with anyone who didn't have the same views as him.   - Robert B. Young, PhD, Professor Emeritus, History, California State University, Long Beach  This is an excellent, detailed and scholarly study of the political and personal life of Mahatma Gandhi and his lifelong struggle to improve the condition of the downtrodden and the weak. As an historian and a thinker, I particularly like the author's assessment of Gandhi's political genius: his ability to organize his party to take power, and to use it effectively to achieve the welfare of his fellow citizens. This book is also an important source of information about the lives of the many other leaders of the movement for Indian independence, which includes Mahatama Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, the latter of whom also appears in this book.  —A. K. Ramachandran, Professor of History, Jawaharnagar University, Andhra Pradesh, India  In this book, the author demonstrates a thorough understanding of Maha Gandhi's politics, his religious, political, and intellectual life. The author demonstrates that Mahatmah Gandhi's social reform program was based on a sincere desire to improve his countrymen's condition. The book gives an excellent overview of the various aspects of Gandhi, his life, and the politics of his time. It shows how he transformed his social reform ideas into a revolutionary program that was both effective and a very positive change in the Indian polity. I highly recommend this book to all scholars and students of Indian politics. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ (The title is in quotes to show the author's lack of enthusiasm about the book.) "This book has so much to recommend it, I can't begin to describe it. The information is easy to digest, and the book is a great read. A must read for all people interested in how to build a strong immune system."
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book because I had read the previous book on the topic and found it pretty interesting. The author, Tim, also has a website, where he talks about the same subject (more about that below). Overall, I'm not a fan of this type of book, but I have to give it a go, because I like Tim.  For some reason I find his writings to be very entertaining.  He has a sense of humor that is both funny and entertaining.   The book covers several topics:   -How to make a home computer a good one -How the Internet and the World Wide Web have affected society -How technology is affecting society, such as the rise of "Smart phones" and the internet of things -The importance of being a "digital citizen" -What it means to be "a hacker" -The dangers of the surveillance state -How computers can be used to control and manipulate people.   I have read many of the books on the internet, and this one is more in depth and less of a general introduction to the subject.  I don't have a problem with a book that talks about all of these topics, but there are a couple things that make this book somewhat redundant:  1) The author makes some comments that sound like he is talking about other technologies than the internet.  (This isn't the only time he makes comments like this, either, I think.)   2) The book talks about a lot of things, such that it could be considered a "computer science textbook."  3) The title of the book implies that there is a real story behind it, but in reality, the book has nothing to do with the subject of the internet (other than the one topic mentioned in the title).   The first point is a bit of a problem, because Tim mentions many different technologies in the book.  The internet is one of them, but the book is also very well-written about the impact of the Internet on society, and even the Internet of Things.  If you are interested in technology and the web, this book is a good place to start. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is about a boy that has a very big crush on a girl. The book does not focus much on him, but does tell you how he became that way. There are a couple of moments of romance, but I think this book should focus more on the boy, so that it can be a very well written and engaging story. I will give the book 4 stars because I really liked it and I want more!
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ I just finished this book and it is just like a dream come true. I never thought I'd find a book that could be as good as the books I read in college, but I did!   I love the story and the characters, especially the main characters. I am really interested in the characters' past and how they came to be who they are today. I also really like the humor.   If you like mysteries, you will enjoy this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "My friend and I loved it. I can't imagine not having it on my bookshelf. It's easy to read and easy to find a good place to put it.

Write a positive review about a good book: ******** I really enjoyed this book. It was a very informative and well-written book about the history of this country. ********   I read this book after a few months of being in the US, as I have been living in Canada for a few years now. While I was on a tour of the country, I was looking for a good history book on the subject, so I looked for one on the history books for the US. I'm glad I picked this one up.    It is not as in depth as a lot of the other history books on the US I have read (such as The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald), but it's a good place to start. I especially liked the way the author dealt with the political scene in the country: he covered the rise of the anti-immigration movement (as well as the immigration issue), the Civil War, the post-war years, the civil rights movement, the Great Depression, and the Cold War. This is a very readable book, as he doesn't just cover the whole country. He also touches on the states, like Massachusetts, which I thought was an interesting touch.   The writing is pretty good, but there is one thing that bothers me: I found that it could have been better. There were a few times when the author said something that sounded like he was saying it to try and make a point. I found myself skipping over some of his points, but it didn't make me not want to read further. The author could have used a bit more detail on the Civil Rights Movement (which I find really interesting), and a bit less on the Cold war (although I think that's probably due to my lack of knowledge of that time period).
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This book is a great story that will have you hooked for the entire novel. I really enjoyed the character development and how it was a mixture of the good and the bad. I would recommend this to anyone who likes action packed books or is looking for a good story.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book at the library. I liked it. The characters are unique. The story was not a surprise. It's been said before, but it's true:  I've seen better written books, and this one was better. It had a good plot, and the ending was satisfying. The book is more about the characters and their struggles than it is about the story itself. I like the writing style of the author, which is not overly descriptive. I thought that was a good thing. The ending did not come out as expected, but that's just because the story is good enough. This book had the potential to be great. I just wasn't ready to put it down, but I do hope that I can read more by the author. I've heard good things about the series.

The first book was the perfect amount of violence, gore, and intrigue. I loved it and it had a great mystery and action hook. I felt like I got the whole thing and that the books are great to read in the summer, but I'm not quite sold on the sequel yet. The pacing is slower and the characters are less developed.  Overall, I still love the first book, but the second one feels a little more like a filler. I'm sure the author had more of a chance to flesh out the main characters and make the story more interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is a fun story about an average student who has a chance to win a scholarship to attend an elite school. The story is good enough and the story is very well written. I would recommend this book to any girl who wants to know how to succeed in college and has a good memory.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book and will reread it over and over. It is a very simple story with a simple story and the characters are wonderful. The author is not afraid to use words in unexpected ways to make the story more interesting.  The characters are believable and interesting and there is not a single character that I did not like.  I give it 4.5 stars
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I found this book to be interesting and easy to read. This book was well written. It has a lot of history in it, as well as a lot about the science and medicine behind these ancient techniques. It's definitely worth reading! ***** I've read some reviews that state this book is just a rehashing of things that have been done before. Well, that's not exactly true. It actually goes into some detail about the medical and psychological side of it. I found it to be a very interesting read and well written, but I do think there are a few parts where I felt the author was giving his opinion on things that weren't really that relevant. I think if you're looking for a quick read, this is a great book to check out. But I wouldn't recommend it as a reference for those wanting to get into the medical side of things. It is a good read, though, and I can't wait to see where it goes in the future.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  This book has helped me get rid of the mental block that I used to have about my sexual desires. I had to read a lot of books to get this one right. The only bad thing about this book is the fact that the last two chapters were only included because of my need to finish reading this book. This book will help you overcome any sexual block and give you a clear understanding of what you want and why you want it.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ This is the first book I've read by a woman in her late 60's that has really changed my opinion about men, women and relationships. I've always thought that women are better at being emotional than men and are better able to relate to each other, especially in a time when men are constantly feeling pressured to be tough, masculine and manly. I was so happy to find this book. It shows that being feminine is not a bad thing, that it's not a weakness, but that it makes us human. _____________________________________________________  I was not expecting much from this book and did not enjoy it very much. The story was interesting and the author's way of presenting the story was intriguing. I did not find the stories about the women to be very realistic, although I could understand the desire to believe it. The book seemed very dry, and I found that there were times where the author would just stop, and the narration just ended. The narrative was very slow, so it was hard for me to connect to the stories. But I still enjoyed the story, and am looking forward to the next book in the series.  The book also seemed to be divided into different parts, which made it hard for some people to keep up with the story. This may be due to the fact that the book was published in a hardcover, which may make the content harder to follow. _____________________________ , July 5, 2015

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must have in any collector's library. The information contained in this book is comprehensive and the pictures and illustrations are just fantastic. I especially like the descriptions of some of the most beautiful pieces of art and architecture from the early 1900s. I also like the way the author describes the workmanship in the works and the "theatrical" appearance of many of the pieces. There is also a good description of the early furniture making. One last thing...there is an interesting discussion in this volume about the rise of the craft beer industry in America. While it does touch on the rise and fall of the "craft" beer industry, it also touches on the more recent explosion of "traditional" brewing. I have enjoyed reading this book and it is definitely one I will be picking up again and again.  It is also my favorite book on the topic of beer that I have read so far. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I really enjoyed this book. I loved the idea that there are so many things we do but have no idea what they are. The author makes the reader think about what this all means and how we are all connected to one another. I have some minor problems with the book, but I still enjoyed it."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was surprised to see how well written this book is. I thought that the author of this book would have been more of a traditional writer as well as more traditional in her style. However, as I said above, the author wrote a very good book and I was pleasantly surprised. She is clearly a writer with a lot of passion for writing, but her style is a little bit more modern and accessible.   Overall, this is a very well written book and if you are looking for a book that is more of traditional, traditional writing style, then this is not the book for you. However if you're looking for something that is very good but still has a little something different, this book fits the bill very well.
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________   I have to say I really like this book. It's a wonderful story about a man's life that was all about a woman. It is so beautiful to read. The prose is beautiful and there is a lot of emotion to this story. The ending is so beautifully written and I think the author was a little off on the last part.   The story is told in the past tense, but it is still very good, as the woman is still living in her old home. She is very much in control of her life and the events that are taking place in her life are very well done. The story is about a young woman in the 50s in an old house that she doesn't know how to use. She has a young daughter who has a secret. The man that is living in the house is a former soldier. His past is not good and there are secrets about him that are not being told to the woman. He is not being honest with her, which is not a good thing. There is so much to this book that makes it worth reading, but I have to give it 4 stars because the ending wasn't quite right.
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________  I enjoyed this book a lot!   There are many good books in the world but this is the only one I have found that has the depth, variety, and breadth of ideas presented here. I would like to see the author try a different style of writing (such as a short story) so that this book has the same depth of ideas as other good books but is also shorter in length and a bit more entertaining. I like the fact that he takes the time to include a few interesting historical figures and the more common historical and scientific facts, along with some historical facts from other times. This gives the reader a different look at things, and adds a bit of history to the book.   I really enjoyed reading this book, and would recommend it to people who enjoy history, science, and books that are written with a humorous bent.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ I bought the first edition of this book a few years back. I have had it for a few months and I have to say that it is the most enjoyable reading experience I have ever had. The book covers all the bases, from the basics of the game to the more advanced. The author is very good at showing you all the ways the rules can be utilized and how they are used to create a fun and dynamic game. There are a few rules and a few examples that aren't explained in the book but they can be easily found in any gaming book. There is a good mix of roleplaying, and simulation. This book is well worth the purchase and is one I will continue to purchase.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book and the story is amazing. The characters are just great. I wish the author would have gotten a publisher so that the book could have been even better. I also wish the story would have been a bit longer, but I guess that is to be expected when you are writing a fantasy novel. This book is well worth the read, but is a bit more light hearted and not as serious. I guess I will keep this book on my night stand and read it when I get some free time.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very enjoyable read.  I have read many books on the subjects of the Book of Mormon and I thought this was one of the better ones out there.  I have enjoyed the "A Mormon History of the United States" series by John A. Tvedtnes.   I am a Mormon, and a professor in the History of Religions department at Brigham Young University.  I have also read a number of Tvedtsons books.  John is one of those historians who has an interest in the history of the American republic, and is a skilled writer who makes it easy to follow his research.  While I do not agree with every statement that he makes, I can easily read through his book and get my own opinion.  He is a good historian and is worth your time.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Book of Strange New Things  by John Scalzi. "I loved it." "It's a perfect book." You should read this book. It's one of my favorites, a well-written, well-thought-out story. It is dark, and there is a lot of it, but I found it quite enjoyable. The book is also very well written. It starts out slow, but picks up in the end, and I didn't mind the wait. I have read a lot (I have a huge library) of science fiction, but this is a book that I would recommend to anyone looking for a new take on the genre. It would make a great gift for someone who loves science fiction. The Book of the Unquiet Dead is a wonderful read, a fantastic story, and one that will keep you reading for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********This book is well worth reading for a history of the American Revolution. It is well researched and the authors' knowledge of history is quite impressive. It also is interesting and fun to read, and it is well written and entertaining. I also found it interesting that the book does not take an active role in the Revolutionary War, but instead focuses on the role of women in the war and the effects on their lives after the war. I am glad that I was able to purchase this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This book is a great read and I'm glad I picked it up. The author provides very interesting information about the military, especially regarding the different cultures and cultures that are there. The information provided is a lot of what you would expect to see in a book on military history, and the writing is very well done. --------------- I like this book. It's very detailed and well researched. The military is very interesting, and this book is very educational. -------------- I've only had it for about a week, but I'm very happy with this book, as I think it covers all bases. I would say this book could use a few more photos, and it could be a bit shorter. ------------- I loved this book and I think everyone should read it. I really think you should know the history behind the military and why it's in the book. -------------------------- I bought this book because I'm a history buff. It was a bit hard to read since the author spent a lot more time on the history of the US and US military than the military history of Japan. I like the fact that there is more of the history than just what the US was doing. The chapters on Japan, Taiwan and China are good, but some of the Japanese history was confusing. There are some good chapters on the French military and the WW1. There were some good stories on the WW2 and the Cold War, and there were some interesting things on the Korean War and the Vietnam War. I wish there was more info about Japan and the Russo-Japanese War. The last chapters were a bit confusing because the author went back and forth on how many times a year the US actually used nuclear weapons, so I ended up reading the first few chapters of the book several times. There was a lot about the Vietnam and the Iran-Iraq war, but the story of the Iran and Iraq war was a little confusing. I think the chapters on WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Iran- Iraq war, and WW2 should be split into two separate books.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "One of the best books I have read."   I liked it a lot. I don't usually go into books to find out if they're good, but I went in this one looking for a new "darker" story than the usual. This one didn't disappoint. I loved the main character (I like it when the main characters are asexual, or have a very specific preference), and the story was well told.   The only thing that made me slightly annoyed was that the main antagonist seemed to be a little overpowered. He had a few tricks, and they were all pretty damn good. But he didn't have to be the main bad guy. I liked how he had the chance to save himself and save his family from a horrible fate, but he didn.t use it. The author made him a little too powerful and dangerous to use.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "Great book on the history of science. Highly recommended." -A Review by L.J. "The first edition of this book was a disappointment. The second edition is a must for all readers." -The First Book Review "I enjoyed the book and think that many of the problems in physics and astronomy can be avoided if only the 'unfortunate' observations of Galileo's are removed from the account. It is a pity that the reader does not find a more logical and scientific explanation for the heliocentric theory than the simple but misleading statement that the Earth is the center of the universe." -Dr. H.J.- "This is a very nice book about the development of modern physics and its importance to science." -N.E.D. Review by the editor: In this book, Robert Bauval addresses the question of why the helical-helical hypothesis has endured so long and is the primary explanation for why the planets revolve around the sun. A key premise of the theory is that the planets orbit the sun in ellipses, but the heliosheaves have always been a mystery, and the helix itself has always been considered a puzzle. In the past, the helices were seen as the result of an excess of rotational energy (rotations per second) by the solar system's outermost planets. However, recent observations have made the heliotrope hypothesis seem less likely, and a better explanation for their structure and rotation may be the result from a combination of the solar wind and a mysterious cosmic magnetic field. Bau Val argues that both the solar winds and the cosmic magnetic fields are not needed for helical heliocentrism, and that both may have played a role in shaping helical and elliptical helical systems, respectively. In fact, BauVal suggests that the cosmic magnetism may have led to the formation of the heliceptors, and perhaps also played a more fundamental role in the development and evolution of our solar system. This book also examines the history and evolution from the first helical stars to our own solar system, including the development, evolution, and eventual demise of the early sun-like stars. Synopsis: Robert Bau val examines the helico-helix hypothesis as a primary explanation of why our solar systems and the planets in them revolve about the sun, rather than the other way around. He argues that the helicyclic

It made me feel a lot better about the loss and the fact that I wasn't just making it up or going through a phase.  It also made me realize that it's ok to have a dark time in life, even if it's difficult and painful. There are a lot of things that can cause depression, but sometimes they can be brought on by external factors. That's why I like this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was a little skeptical about this book but after finishing it I was very happy. I love the way the author uses the different parts of the brain to describe different experiences. She describes the way some people can be drawn to a certain experience or certain music and then they go on to have a similar experience. Her descriptions of her childhood are very moving. I also really liked the way she describes how she is able to create her own reality. I feel like my reality is so controlled by other people. It is a great read!
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This is one of the best, most fascinating and informative books I have ever read. It is also a story that is well worth the time it takes to read."   -- Dr. Alan Zaslow, author of "Poverty, Public Policy, and Social Mobility: The American Story"   * The book "The Black Middle Class in America: A Global Perspective" is the first volume of an interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, global study on the black middle class.   This volume draws on a wide range of disciplines to examine the evolution of the black economic elite in the United States. The research used in the volume is drawn from an unprecedented combination of economic, demographic, cultural and historical perspectives, which provides a powerful synthesis of the study of the Black Middle class and its evolution.  - From the introduction to the book   The volume examines the role of economics, demographics, cultural, political and historical factors in the evolution and current status of the middle class in the U.S. It also examines the influence of the international economic and political system, and in particular the global market economy on the evolution, structure and status of this class. In addition, the volume offers a new perspective on the origins of the global economic crisis, and a new theory of the role played by the financial crisis and the Great Recession in the transformation of the U the black population.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm glad that I bought this book. The author does a good job in explaining the different stages of puberty in girls. I'm a 14 year old girl, and I feel that I've had a rough start in life, especially in my social life. The story takes you through the stages of development and the struggles you face.  The chapters are short and to the point, but if you like learning about the development of your body and its effects on your mind, then you'll enjoy the story.  My only complaints: I have one small complaint about the book. I had to change my mind about my decision to buy this book and read it again.  It's a little frustrating because the author clearly knows what he is talking about.   He knows what girls go through as they start their periods, what changes occur, and how they deal with it.  I felt that I was being shown all the parts of a girl's body and I didn't understand why he focused on the first few chapters and didn't go into the changes that occur between your periods.

It was written by Harvard Business School Professor Charles Duhigg, a Pulitzer Prize winner who is also an author, so he has his own background.

Duhg's book really helps to explain why a lot of people do the same things over and over again. I think I may have to change my habits to succeed. By the way, he also writes about how to be a good boss, which is also a must-read if you work in a company or have a boss.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________   This is a wonderful book! I love that you take a scientific approach to explaining what causes us to act the way we do. I don't really know what causes people to have a sense of empathy for other people, but that's a good question. I know that I have a tendency to be more generous and understanding than most people, and this book has helped me understand my own tendencies to be a little more generous, and a little less. I was always a little hesitant to read something that explained this phenomenon, because I was afraid that I'd be "out of my depth" in trying to understand it. However, after reading this book, I am confident that I can understand how the feeling of empathy works, and I will certainly be using this as an example to my students when they ask me about this.   As for the writing style, this is my first time reading a book written in such a literary style, and it seems to me that there are a lot of beautiful words in this book. The author uses a lot metaphors, and she is really well-written. However this is not my first book by the same author, and in fact, I have already read a couple books by the author.  -Sandra

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I love this book. It's a very good overview of the history of the Catholic Church and the rise of modern feminism. This is a really important book. I've been an atheist my whole life, but this book has made me realize that it's not just the Bible that is sexist. --------------------------- The Good News Club: A History of Religious Freedom ------------------------ The Good news club is a Christian, all-boys school that has been around since the 1930s. It is still in existence today, although it no longer discriminates based on sexual orientation. The founders of the Good News Clubs were a group of Christian fundamentalists who saw Christianity as a "family values" club. ------------- The Unbelieving: Why Religion Fails ------------- A good read. The author, Dr. Michael Shermer, goes into detail about why many people don't believe in God. The book covers a lot of topics and explains a lot. --------------- The Power of Belief: How Religion Distorts Our Thinking and Empowers Evil --------------- This book is one that I bought on a whim, and read through several times. This book covers various religions, including Christianity. This author covers all the good, bad, and the ugly about religion, and why people are not going to believe in anything. -------------- Religion and Human Behavior: What Do We Know about the Relationship Between Religion and Morality? -------------- This book takes a more scientific approach, and it shows that religious people are no more moral than non-religious people. ------------ The Science of God: Why God Makes Sense to Science ------------ This is another book that I didn't realize I had. It explains the origins of God, and how he came to be. The story is very interesting and the author goes into much more detail than I have in this list. ~~~~~ Reading for fun: ----------------- I enjoyed reading the books on this list the most. This list is meant to be read for fun, not to be a serious study. ~~~~~~~~~ Listing of recommended books: ~~~~~~~~~~~ The Bible: God's Word of Love and Wisdom -------------- A good book to read on a religious holiday. This was a good choice for a religious holidays book because it has a good balance of science and faith. The religious angle is pretty obvious, but the religious part of the book is a lot deeper than most of the other religious books. It also has some good humor mixed in. This one should be on

I have a difficult time keeping a book on the shelf.  I feel that I must read something at least every few months, but there are just so many great books I've not had the opportunity to read.    I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. What I liked:     I love the concept of the book.  I love how it takes a genre I don't care about, and subverts it, so that the story doesn't feel boring.  The writing is really good, with some really great descriptions and a lot of character development.  My only criticism is that the ending was a little predictable, but that was probably my fault for being too eager to see where this story was going.  If you are a fan of the original, this book should be on your list of recommended reading.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the first 3 chapters of this book in a weekend. This is the perfect mix of humor and information, not a dry dry book. It is funny, informative and at the same time a bit sad, in that you see how hard it is for some people. A great book for anyone who loves the sports.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had to put this book down several times. It was very boring. The story seemed to take a turn to the surreal.   My rating:    1.5 stars.  The story of the book:  "The only thing I've heard that could rival it was that one time I had an entire summer break with a group of friends. It's a story about how life is strange and weird, and about the people you can meet along the way."   I really liked the premise of the story. I enjoyed the idea that there are other worlds out there. I liked the fact that it was a book about friendship. I really enjoyed the fact the book was told from the point of view of the people in the group of people. I think it was great that the book had a twist in it. The book was really well written. The characters were interesting. The writing was very good. I was surprised by how fast the book went on.   I was looking forward to the next book in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book. It gives a very good explanation of why a woman who has been raped should leave her home if she wants to have a good life. It's also good for a woman to know what she can do if she gets raped. I am not sure that a woman should always leave her house or if she is a victim of a rape to run away. The author is not a rape victim himself and is not trying to discourage women from leaving their home if they are attacked. She is just explaining how to do it. I recommend it to all women and men.  Review by a woman: I don't know if the rape occurred in a bar or a home. I do know that my rapist was a man and I am still angry about it. He had a history of violence. But even with that history, I was afraid to go to the police. My husband took me to a local women's shelter because the police told me it was too dangerous to report. I was so scared to report it because the man who did it was so big and powerful that I didn't think he would be caught. He raped me in a bathroom, and I did not report it until after he raped my other friend. But I do not regret reporting it. If he were still in a position of power, I would not have reported it. Instead I did something I'm still ashamed of. I walked into his home and tried to leave but he wouldn't let me out. Instead he locked the door and told me that I needed to stay with him because he had to take care of me. I screamed until he let me go, but then he raped me again. And I never went to the hospital. I have had nightmares about it and my rapist is still walking around my neighborhood and living with his family. It hurts. I just don't understand why he is not in prison for life. The book gives very good advice for anyone who has ever been raped or is a woman. It is very thorough and gives very detailed advice on how to survive a rape. I learned a lot about the different types of rapes and how to handle them. It also gives some great advice for men. It doesn't mention rape by other men, but I think that is because it is written for women and doesn't have the same depth. I don't think that I would have had any trouble leaving my house or staying at home. The only problem I had

Write a positive review about a good book: **********   I don't normally read much YA, but this book has caught my attention. I really enjoyed it and found it a bit challenging, and the plot is actually fairly complex. If you are into dystopian science fiction, this is definitely worth a look.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I love this book. I have to say that, to be honest, I am a fan of Stephen King's work.  This book is not a sequel to the book, but rather a follow-up to the television show.    I enjoyed the television series, but I felt this book would have been better served by a follow up book, which was what this book was.  The story was interesting.  It wasn't a mind-blowing story, but it was an interesting story.  King's writing is top-notch.  He is a master of the short story. I think the book could have been shorter and had a better ending, but the ending was interesting and I was satisfied." -A.J.R.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I read this book for the first time when I was about 17. I had just finished reading my very first YA book about the war. I wanted to try something new. This book did not disappoint! The characters were all very well-developed and realistic. The descriptions of their home and their pasts were so well done. I would have loved to read about them in more detail. The story is very well paced, as there is no time wasted with a lot of plot holes or boring characters. The ending left me wanting more, and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series. --------------- Read a positive user review: ----------------------------- I liked this book very much. I love a good adventure story. I also really enjoyed the romance. It was a very nice surprise when the author found out I was a teenager when she decided to make me a major character. I'm still wondering why she didn't give the boy in the book the love he deserves. I think he's a wonderful guy, but his lack of self-esteem is what I found so frustrating. I was surprised at how much the author's use of fantasy and science fiction helped her create a realistic world. The character of Jael was also a nice addition. I did feel that the author did a good job of balancing the lighthearted romance with the more serious and mature aspects of the story. There is still room for improvement, but I think this is a great book. --------------------------- Read a negative review: ------------- I didn't care for this book at all. It's really hard to care about characters when they have no depth, don't have any character development and are just there to fill a page count. I am glad I read the book because the author has so much more to write about. This author needs to keep writing about characters that actually have personalities, and not just just be there to move the plot along.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________  This is a must-read book about the impact of the Second World War on the German psyche, and especially on the Nazi leadership. The author, Dr. Peter Gassner, is a professor of history at the University of Texas, who has done extensive research into the Nazi party's rise to power. He has published a number of books, and this is his most ambitious one to date. He is a gifted historian, and the work here is a powerful one. It's an important and thoughtful contribution to the literature on Nazism, and it should be read by anyone who wants to understand the roots of Nazism and how that party came to power in Germany. The book is organized around four main themes: Hitler's political origins; the Third Reich's first years; Hitler's relationship with foreign leaders; and the role played by the Nazi military in the transition to power  Overall, this book is a fascinating look at a time in German history which many historians consider to be the most important of the 20th century. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the causes and consequences of NazISM. It is the only book I have found that really provides a solid foundation for understanding the rise of a movement which was, at its heart, the idea that German history and culture were inferior to that of the West. It may seem dated now, but as a young person in the early 1970s, I was enthralled with the Third Period and the ideas of National Socialism. The authors of this book have provided a brilliant overview of this period of history, and I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter series. It's one of the most popular series in the world. I was very excited to hear that this was going to be a spinoff novel. And to have it be based on the films is a great bonus. I had read the first two books in the series when I was younger. I think the first book is a very good book and I enjoyed it. But I also thought the characters were a bit too one-dimensional for my tastes. The author seems to have really gotten to know them though. I don't think I will be reading anything else by him. It has a very fun feel to it. The characters are all so lovable and well-written. This is a fantastic spinoff to the series.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ was an excellent book. The book is filled with useful information about the anatomy and functions of the human body, including the organs of the heart, lungs, stomach, intestines, kidneys, liver, and intestines. I particularly enjoyed the information about how the body processes food, including how the kidneys remove waste products. The information in the book is quite easy to understand. I was able to learn about all the body systems and I learned that my body was working as it should. The body is incredibly complex and there are a number of systems that are involved in making sure that a person is healthy. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has ever wanted to know more about the body.

It will use this power to bring about a communist society."
Write a positive review about a good book:  A book that you will definitely enjoy. I really enjoyed this book and I think the first few chapters are good, but the rest of the book is good too. The book is about a girl who has just moved to a new town and is about to leave her boyfriend. She gets into a fight with a neighbor who is about her age and the girl ends up getting stabbed. The neighbor, who she has not seen for months, goes out and finds her, and it turns out the girl was trying to kill herself. The girl is sent to a mental hospital and the neighbor tries to help her but also is trying to find a way to help the girl who is very suicidal. I like the character development in this book, the girl is a very interesting character and I like how it was done. The narrator also gave me a lot of sympathy for the girl. She was depressed and didn't have much going for her in life. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the dark side and likes a book with a good story and great characters.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading the latest version of The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I really like the story and the characters. I just wish they would have made the book a bit shorter. I would have liked to have read more about how the character got his money, and how he got it. This book is just too long, and it has been a long time since I read a novel this long.   Recommended for older children who love Fitzgerald's writing style:   As a writer of stories, I don't really care for many of the books by F Scott Fitzgerald, because his stories are so long. He writes a lot of stories in this book and I would recommend reading the first part of the book.   the Great GATSBY:  The Great GATSBY was written in 1923. Fitzgerald lived in the Catskills during his time there. He had a reputation for having a drinking problem. His health was so poor at the time that he did not live to see the end of the novel. The story follows the story of Nick Carraway who is going to be an attorney in the city of New York. Carraways wife has been killed in a tragic accident, but she has been saved by her brother, the great Gatsbys who are a family of millionaires. Nick and his family are invited to a party at the Gatsleys mansion, where Nick is impressed by the mansion and the life that Nick Carras home is leading. Nick also becomes obsessed with his rich brother's wife. The plot is good and I was impressed with the fact that the novel is not only a murder mystery, but a very dark story about a murder. The main character has a bad reputation and people are afraid to talk to him. This is not a light novel. It is a very well written murder mystery with some very dark themes.  -The story is set in the 1920s and the main character, Nick Carrahay, is a rich, successful lawyer who is looking for his second wife. Nick Carradale is married to his second cousin, who has died in a freak accident. Carradal's wife died in an automobile accident, and she was saved by a stranger named Gatsdy. Gatsdys wife has a heart problem, and so she is in the hospital. Nick has a thing for his cousin, and he tells his wife about Gatsdar and invites her to his party. Nick

Write a positive review about a good book: ******** This is the best book I've read in ages. It covers everything you could ever want to know about the process of designing and building a bike with the right tools. I can say with some confidence that there is no way in hell I could have come up with this myself, I'm pretty sure the whole thing is a total fabrication! But that's ok. The only thing that I didn't like is that it was so very long. I think it's important that it be concise, but at the same time there's enough there to keep you busy for quite a while. If you're a DIYer this book will be a great help. If your not you'll find something to your liking here. *****  Helpful hint: you don't need a hammer to put this together. *******  I read this book because I'm building a new bike and wanted a book to help me with the construction process. This book is the perfect blend of information. It is easy to understand and provides you with enough information to make the project a success. The design is very straightforward, the math is easy, the drawings are clear and to the point and the parts are well laid out. This is a great book for anyone who is looking to start building a custom bike. The book is packed with tons of pictures and explanations and is a perfect read in its entirety. ****
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great.   I have a good memory, but my mind is not that good. I had trouble remembering the characters names and the story, but that's all because I'm so used to reading novels and not stories.  The characters are like real people, not like your typical, super powered super heroes. The way they act and the way they talk is very real. I have trouble believing in super powers, because the stories are too good to be true. I would give this book a B, but it's so good. It's worth the price.

The book is a mix of good old-fashioned, down to earth, everyday life and it's not all that different from my life.   of course there are exceptions to this, but as far as the majority of people are concerned, there's no problem here.

This book is one of the most interesting historical books I have read. It is very interesting to read about a man who was in charge of a secret government program, a program that allowed many Americans to become aware of the war against the Soviet Union. While this book has a strong focus on the government and how it has kept its secret program from the public for so long, it also contains plenty of information about how the secret program has affected other individuals. The Man who Knew too Much is a must read for anyone interested in this fascinating subject."
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm going to say this book is the best in the series so far.  The story line is intriguing, the characters are very well developed and the plot line is gripping.  The plot is also pretty simple, but it's so well told that you can't help but keep reading.   The story of the book begins in the 1920s, when a woman named Marge has a daughter.  After Marge's husband dies of a heart attack, she is left with a single mother, and a child that needs her.  After a series of events, she learns that her daughter has been murdered, but no one knows who the killer is.  This leads to a man who calls himself "the Doctor" who claims he can heal her daughter. After a bit of trial and error, he manages to cure her, but not before Marge begins to fall in love with him.  I loved the story line.  The character of Marge is very well written, with a very interesting background.  Marge does have a strong will, and I love her determination.  Her determination led her to work through the trials of getting her daughter's murderer convicted, and ultimately getting him out of prison.  In addition, Marge had a great voice, and her voice was very strong.  She is very good at telling stories.  Even though the story of Margo and her daughter was good, I thought that the story with the Doctor was much better.  It was more interesting, more exciting and more suspenseful. The plot of the story was very well thought out.  A lot of the twists were unexpected and that added to the excitement.  There were a lot of twists in this book, but I like the way that they were handled.  For example, in one scene, Margo goes to the Doctor to see if he can help her get revenge on the person who killed her daughter, and the Doctor tells her that her best chance of getting the killer convicted is to have her daughter tell everyone she slept with the murderer.  That is so unexpected that I didn't expect that, but the Doctor is so convincing and his stories were so good that it made it work. The characters of Mabel and Marge were great as well.  They both were well written and had their own unique personalities.  These were the characters I loved most in the book.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________   This book is great! It is well written and well thought out.   I had never been to the National Geographic's magazine before this book. I found it on Amazon for $19.00 and thought it would be worth the price. I was wrong. I got it and it is amazing!   The first chapter starts off with a chapter on what it's like to be a National Geographic photographer. It shows you that you're actually on a journey. You are following the adventures of these photographers and it's very well done. The next part of the book is the chapter on travel and how they get there. You get to see the people who they are traveling with, how they do the travels and their stories. This is really cool because you get to know the photographer and his/her family. The third chapter is about the photographer himself. You learn how he got his name, how he became a photographer and the people he's photographed. You also learn how the National Geogrpahy uses their photos and how the photographer has his own photo library. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a good introduction to photography. I'm also going to read the rest of the NationalGeographic's magazine to see how they have covered photography.   in addition to the good photos, I also really liked the fact that it explained the science behind some of the pictures. The author did an excellent job explaining the science of photography and the importance of having a good light source.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of books by Robert Heinlein and this is definitely one of my favorites. Heinlein is my favorite author and this book is one of the best. If you like Starship Troopers and the sequels, you will enjoy this book. I found myself wishing there were more of the later books in the series and this one is a great start. I'm sure I'll love it as much as I loved the original.  Review of books:   There is no denying that Robert A. Heinl is one hell of a writer. He is also one helluva good writer. His prose is like an outhouse; there is so much in here, it is impossible to keep track. I was surprised to find out that I had already read the Heinlein I had been waiting for!   There are so many interesting concepts, interesting characters, and interesting plots, all wrapped in a plot that is actually a really good one. I could not put this book down. This is definitely a book to read in between books and while you are waiting for a long overdue vacation in your back yard to be over.   The book starts out with a bang and it is not hard to see why: A great, exciting, and emotional opening. It is hard to describe what the "spontaneous generation" is or what it is doing. It seems that it is being led by a leader and is trying to be the next generation, but in order to do that, it must eliminate its competition. In doing so, it has to eliminate all its past, and that is exactly what the book begins with. It has some really good ideas about "the generation," but then goes on a bit too long about how it will do this. The end is great as well, as Heinlein describes the "final generation" coming together and the events that will occur as they work together and overcome their past. The ending was a really cool idea and it will definitely make you want to read the next book. The only thing I wish they had done was give the ending a bit more time to develop.   a great concept, a good story, and a cool ending. I recommend this book to any Heinlein fan.

I'm a big fan of the book series, and while this one is a little more recent, the writing is still good and it does a good job of setting up the world and the characters.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "There is a certain kind of humor that's not about being funny but is funny, and that's just how I like to read books. This is one of those books. It's funny, it's dark, and it's very, very thought provoking. I don't want to give it a lower score than it deserves, because there are other books in this series that are just as good, but if you're looking for a light, funny book to read this is the one."

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Last of the Mohicans  is a solid novel and is a solid historical novel that is well researched.  I enjoyed it immensely and would highly recommend it.  I'm giving this book a four-star rating for its writing, writing, and writing.  I found myself constantly reading the page, re-reading it.   I found this to be a good story about the end of the American Revolution.   If you like your historical novels and are looking for a good historical novel,  The Last of The Mohicans is a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I've ever read about the Russian Revolution, by the great historian David Pryce.  He's a historian, so you'd expect him to have a good grasp on the political dynamics of the era, and he does a good job.    But the book is a love letter to the Russian people and their revolutionary struggle, and to Lenin himself.  There are plenty of good historical books out there, but this is the only one I've read in the last few years that has the emotional impact of this one.  This is one of the best books I've yet read on the Russian revolution, and it is a must read for anyone interested in the Russian experience.  4 out of 5 stars The Russian Revolution: A History by David P. Pryce:  I've been meaning to read this book for a while.  I've been interested in Russia since I was a little girl, and I'm a fan of all things Russian.  The Russians have a very distinct sense of self.  Theirs is a culture that is deeply rooted in their history, and they have a distinct sense that they are part of the great culture that created modernity.  They have a sense of history and identity that is unique to them, but they have lost a lot of their past.  We've become so used to seeing the Russians as weak, and weak people are usually bad for us.  But the Russians have always been a bit different, and their culture is one that we should learn a lot from. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have to say that I was surprised by how many good books I picked up in a row.   The book is divided into two sections, one about what it's like to be a black woman in America today, and one about the importance of black women's history and culture in America.  The section about what life is like for black women today is a must-read for any American.  While I don't agree with all of the "facts" presented in the book, I do think the overall tone is very balanced.  I especially enjoyed the fact that the author takes the time to talk to people who disagree with her point of view.  It was a great read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I have read in a while! I was not a big fan of this book until I got into it.  I found the ending of this story very satisfying and it is very well done.

I am currently reading a second book, which will definitely keep me busy.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this book is a fantastic read. I love science and am very interested in the science behind some of the things I read. My favourite book was "What is Life" by Carl Sagan. I really liked this book as it was written from a more scientific point of view. I especially like the idea that we are all interconnected and can affect each other's lives in ways we don't even know about. I recommend this book for any science fan.

The story is pretty basic but I can see the author's point of view. I was surprised to find that the ending was not the ending I was expecting. There is no cliffhanger and there is no satisfying conclusion. The book ended with a feeling of disappointment and a sense of unease. It's a very good book but I felt I was cheated. I really liked the book. I hope this book gets better.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a number of good books about sex and have found them to be really helpful in my life and as a couple. My husband and I started reading the book together as a gift for our son's fifth birthday. I think this book will be a great addition to our son. The author's attitude towards sex and the way he writes about it is really positive and I'm really looking forward to reading the next book in the series."   The most amazing thing about this book is how he's able to talk about the things that you think are so private that you wouldn't think about. He's able, and I think he's right, to talk to people about sex in a way that they can relate. This book is great for anyone, not just couples but anyone who wants to know how to be more honest with each other and have a healthier sex life.   I am definitely looking forward for the next one!  9/10  This book is a very interesting and informative look at the different sexualities. If you are interested in learning more about your own sexuality, this is a must read!   This book has been a great help for me in my sex life and I highly recommend it.  Read more

I was very excited when I saw that the new book in the series was about a young girl, and I had never seen her before in any of the books I own. I found this one very intriguing and I think the young girl is a very well-realized character, with great depth. It took me a while to get into this book, but I definitely feel that it is a good addition to the series." --Celeste "I read the entire series as a child and I am still reading the later books and am very happy that I am getting to the end of this series now. I have already read the first two books in this series and will definitely be buying the third book when it comes out." --Linda "This is the best book ever! The only thing I don't like is that there's a lot of spelling errors and the author doesn't always get the tone of the story right. The characters are very well developed and I love all the different types of things they do." --Nancy "This book is great. It's like reading a different version of the Hitchhikers series. It has the humour of the original but it has its own style. It would be a great addition to your bookshelf!" --Gina "The Hitchhiking series is one of the most brilliant adventures I've ever read. It really does have its own unique flavor, and you will never look at a book the same way again. You won't be disappointed." --Kathy "I have never had a problem with spelling or grammar, but there are a few things in this book that make me think I should read it again to make sure I am understanding it correctly. The writing is wonderful and the plot is interesting." --Elizabeth "I love this book. I am a huge Hitchhickers fan and this book was perfect to start me off on the series. The story is great and it is fun and exciting." --Tina "It's my favourite book of all time. It is a wonderful story about friendship, the adventure of a lifetime, and a little girl who will go where no girl has gone before." --Jane "I've only read the second book so far but I can already tell it's going to be a hit!

Write a positive review about a good book:  The first few chapters of The Secret are very promising, as well as some of the first impressions. There's plenty of mystery and suspense and the story itself is interesting. But it really does get a little bogged down. The story itself does not really develop very well, and is a little too similar to a few other books I've read recently. The book is very good overall, but I would definitely recommend trying something different if you want something a little different from the genre.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very good introduction to the world of computer languages. There is a lot of theory and many of the concepts are explained in a way that is easy to understand. This book is worth reading if you want to get a good idea of what a computer is and what it does.  The book covers the fundamentals of computer programming from the basics of data types, functions, variables, loops, and loops over to the most advanced topics such as concurrency, security, and operating systems.  There are a couple of problems with this book.  First, it doesn't cover much of the theory behind the languages that are being used.    It doesn't really give a good description of what these languages are doing or how they work.  The author also tries to make it sound like it's all about programming the computer.  It's not.  There are plenty of examples of programming using C++, Pascal, or other languages that make programming a computer much more fun.  Second, there is a big gap between what the book says is "really" important in programming and what is actually done by most programmers.  A lot of this gap is because this book is really about how computers work, not about programming.  One can write a very complete and detailed description of how computers operate and how to write programs that are actually useful for people that do computer work.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had not heard of this author before reading the book and I am glad I did.  It is a good story about an Indian woman and her husband who decide to move to America.  They are successful and do very well.  The story is well told. The author's use of historical facts and her historical background as well as her knowledge of the American Indians make the book a very interesting read.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes history, fiction, and loves to read about the early settlers of the New World. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________   I read this book with a group of friends at a party one night and we all had a great time. The book is a wonderful story about a young girl, Grace, and her adventures in the wilderness. The story itself was very funny, the language was not so funny but the plot was fun. The only thing I found irritating about the book was that the author does not go into the details about the food Grace eats. Grace has only one meal a day (the night before the expedition) and every day they have to find food to eat. We all know that if you are camping and have only a small amount of food you must eat a lot of the night before and the next day to survive. I was just wondering if this was because the author did not know how to write the details, but I don't know how the author can go through the trouble of writing about how a young woman must find food for a few days, then eat it, then make the trip back to civilization, then cook it, and then eat, and finally eat the food they brought back. But, I guess we know what the author thinks!   All in all, this is a great book to read for a group and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ I'm in the process of reading this book and I have to say I love it. It's a very informative book about the science behind sex and sexuality and the issues around it. I found it very informative and thought-provoking. This book could really use more information but I really like it. There were a couple of times when I felt the book needed to be a little less informative, but overall it is still an excellent read. The book is not a quick read, it took me about 7 hours to read. I think it's a good choice for those who are interested in understanding more about sex and how it affects us. It has some of the information on how to have good sex, which is helpful for anyone who wants to know how to improve their sex life. This was a very helpful read and I highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a wonderful introduction to how to manage your emotions and make sense of your emotions in a healthy manner. I love this book because it is a very practical, but fun, introduction to emotional management. I especially liked that the book does not try to do anything complicated. This book has a very simple structure, so if you've never read a book before, it's easy to read. I think that this book would be a great choice for people who have never experienced an emotional outburst, for anyone who is concerned about managing their emotions, and anyone who just wants to understand how they can have better emotional control.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________ I recently finished reading A Song of Ice and Fire, the first book in the series, and it's one of the best. I read it in a few sittings, in between the other books I'm reading. I love the books, but this one is a bit better. This book is not as good as the others. The characters are a little more likeable. They're still pretty bad, but their behavior and the way they behave in the book is much more realistic than in other books. I like the way that they talk about themselves. _______________________________________________ I'm glad to see this one being read. The author's prose is so beautiful, I could picture it, and I'd have loved to be a knight of Winterfell or a Lannister in that world. I'm glad the book has finally come out. ______________________________ This book is good, but the characters are too dumb. ______________________ I was very disappointed with this book. It's a fun read, but it's a lot of filler. It doesn't help that the book ends with a cliffhanger. The only good thing about the book, is that it has been translated into Russian. I can't wait to read it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. It is a book I would definitely recommend to all. It gives us an interesting view into how the game industry works, and the game companies try to make money and make people happy. This book gave me so many interesting insights about game development, and how different developers work and how much is truly considered when making a game. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in game development.   "The game industry is not like the music industry. It's not like Hollywood. It has never been like this. It started off with very low barriers to entry, then got higher. It was just a bunch of nerds with toys and computers in their bedrooms and who dreamed of making games. Now it's a billion dollar industry that has a lot of people making money and a lot more people trying to get in.  , author of the book, has a good sense of humour. He knows how to make a good point and to make it entertaining. It helps to give a better idea of what it is like to be a game developer. There is a lot in this book about making games, but he does not talk about making money, but how you make money. It also gives a better understanding of what is involved in making games and the different studios in the industry.   and it is very well done, i would highly recommend to anyone.

I will give the author some credit though, since she was doing a good job in setting up the story, and it was actually very well done.  Overall, it was a very poor story that was poorly done.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Last Continent is a fantastic read. It is not a book I will be buying in bulk, but a book that I will read at the right time. It was a great read, and I am looking forward to the next book in the series, which should be out in 2017.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think this is a very well written book. It was really interesting to learn about how different religions have different views on death and afterlife. The author goes into great detail about various religions and their belief systems. I was really surprised how different the beliefs are about death and how each religion deals with the concept of death. Overall, I really enjoyed this book! I would definitely read it again!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic example of the genre and the concept of "the hero of a book", which was not much of a stretch for the time.   The main protagonist of the book, who is a young boy named Jack, goes from being a child soldier to being an adult, and he does this without killing anyone.   I have a hard time not being a little excited by this book, but I have to say that I didn't get a lot of the detail of the events.  I had to put down the book and go back to it several times just to get everything.  I have to agree with this reviewer.  This book has no point.  I have read several of these stories and it was just so different.    It was like having a whole new story with the same characters and the same settings.  And to me, that is very disappointing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  "One of the most insightful and thought-provoking works of recent years" "The book is a work of literary, philosophical, and political genius." "It is a remarkable achievement in its own right." - James Baldwin "Fascinating, intelligent, and well-researched." -- James McPherson, author of The City: A Novel "A fascinating, thought-shaping book." I am the first to admit that I'm no expert on these things, but I've read a lot of books, and I know how to use this sort of thing. This book is the best book I've ever read on the history of feminism and I am going to have to start studying it a little more carefully in the future. This is a must read book and is one of the best things I've had the chance to read. I wish it was longer. It is well worth it. -- Dr. Wendy McElroy, Associate Professor of Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania "This book has long been a classic of feminist philosophy." This book should be required reading for anyone interested in feminism and gender studies.    The work of Judith Butler, Judith Shulevitz, and Janice Fiamengo is a major contribution to feminist theory and has received international attention. The book's main argument is that, in the present historical moment, feminism and women's rights have become the main concerns of a vast majority of the people of the world, and in the United States and Britain they have become increasingly radicalized. This new feminism is not only political but also ethical, and it is a radical feminism that takes seriously the need to address the very roots of women's oppression. This essay will argue that this new feminism has also been the subject of some rather vicious attacks from feminists who wish to maintain the status quo and defend their own power and privilege.  The book has a few faults that I feel need to be mentioned. First of all, Butler does not really make a strong case for her thesis. Instead, she argues that, rather than being a "movement," feminism is a "philosophy." That is, feminism is about a specific set of views about the world. Some people are feminists, some people are not. It would be nice to see a few more specific details about how the various positions in feminism fit together, but that would require a lot more study. The second fault is
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- "I love this book! I'm not a huge fan of science fiction, so this book really took me by surprise. It was interesting to see how far the future of the human race can go and how much of a shift there is to be expected in the way we think about technology and science. I'm really looking forward to reading more of the authors' books."  I loved this book. It really did a good job at giving an overall view of the future, and I really loved the ideas presented. It's a bit dry at times, but overall it is quite a fun read.  It does have some flaws though. It is not an easy read. There is some repetition in the narration and in the details. Some of the scenes just seem like the author is describing things he knows and it is somewhat annoying. But overall this is a fun and engaging read that has a great story line.  the story itself is very good. It seems very realistic in some ways. But it has a strong future feeling to it, which is something that has been missing from the sci-fi genre. I liked the idea of a giant machine that can see into the future and even manipulate it to create artificial life. The way this machine works is also very interesting and gives us a good glimpse of what technology will be like in the future. The narration is very smooth and easy to follow. It doesn't have any bad moments in it at all, but the only real problem I have is the fact that it does not get really good as it goes on. It will seem a little repetitive at times but overall I do really enjoy this book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fictional stories.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very helpful for anyone who has difficulty with using the toilet. This book is not a substitute for regular toilet training, but will help. I have a 5 year old who is very impatient, and when she has to go, she does not take care of herself. She does not clean up after herself, she leaves the toilet seat up and the bowl is left in the seat for several days, and is not as careful with her hands. She has already gotten the hang of using the potty by the time I get home from work, but has not mastered the toilet training and she has a lot of issues with accidents. She always goes in the back and comes out a minute later, and the bathroom is messy. She also leaves things behind in the toilet, and I have to clean up a mess she made when I am cleaning it. This is a great book to use, and she now understands what to do. It is also very informative and easy to read. It would be good if the picture and the description were in color. The picture does not match the color of the book. The book does not contain pictures of toilet training in detail. However, the description is very good and easy for anyone to understand.  Helpful?

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a great introduction to the world of fantasy. I was not familiar with this kind of fantasy before reading it but this is a well researched, interesting, and enjoyable read.   "The Land of Fools" is about an epic quest that takes place on the shores of a mysterious continent. The story is told through a series of vignettes, each focusing on a different character in the story. The book is very good and is recommended.  , but also recommend the other two books in the series "The Shadow of a Sea Lord" and "The House of the Dead".
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I was going to review this book, but I am still not sure why I haven't. I read this book when I was about 12 years old. It was a story about a man who is going to marry a woman he likes, but who he has just met. The woman is a princess from another planet and is the daughter of the king of a small planet. When he comes to her planet, the princess and the king begin a romance. They fight a lot, but they love each other. When she is attacked by a monster that has taken over a town, she uses her magic to kill the monster and to cure the villagers. When the prince hears about it, he is angry. He wants revenge. He starts searching for the monster, who he believes to be his father, but can't find him. Meanwhile, the king and the princess have a talk. They discover that the prince is not the monster's father but rather the king's nephew. The princess then tells him that she is pregnant with his child, which means that the king is the monster! So the prince starts planning to get revenge and kill the king! I thought the story was very good, and I liked the way that the princess would say that she could only see the future because she was in love with him. I thought that the characters were good. I liked how they talked about the future, especially how the king was trying to get the princess back so that he can kill the prince. The only thing that I didn't like about the story were the names of the characters. I would have liked to know how many of the names were the king, and how many were the princess's. I think the story would have been more interesting if there were more names of all of the people involved, and that they were in different time periods, instead of the same names throughout the book. It's not the first book that I've read where I think it was too long, but it is the longest book I've ever read.
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________ This is a must read for anyone interested in the history of the US. The authors clearly have a passion for the subject, and the history is a little different from what we think we know about it. The book was a good read for me, but I would have liked to have had a little more about the US in general and some more about some other nations as well. Overall, a good story worth the read, but would have benefited from a little less history.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Art of Manliness: The Science of Exercise is one of those great books you never forget. This book is packed with the most useful scientific research available to fitness buffs.  The Art of the Workout is the first book of its kind that makes the scientific evidence of exercise science the center of a workout.  Instead of just telling you to "do a little bit of exercise", the author shows you how to actually do that workout using research and scientific principles.    I recommend this book to anyone who wants to become a better, more fit individual and is looking for a solid, well-researched book to start with.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I read this book about a year ago and it has been on my "to read" list ever since. I'm so glad I finally got to it! The writing is crisp and clear, the story is engaging, and the characters are well drawn. The prose is a little slow and the book could have been shorter, but I think that's just a personal thing. I enjoyed it and will be looking forward to rereading it. I loved it, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery, and a good romance. -------------------------- Review from a Reader: ------------- I've been wanting to read this for years. I bought the first book at an airport book store years ago. It's been a while since I read the original (so long that I was almost sure I'd never get it to the airport), but when I saw the title I knew I had to read it. This is a must read. The original is a classic, and this one is great too. If you love mysteries, love to read, love romance, love books about good guys and bad guys, love the art, love everything about the genre - if you love that kind of thing, you will love this book. I'd recommend it highly. The writing style is perfect. ------------ I read my copy in one day. It is worth every penny and more! ------------   What I Liked: ------------ The plot: You have your character, who's a man in his early thirties who's been married and who's having trouble finding a girlfriend. He's a bit of a loner, but the book does a good job of showing that this is only because he's lonely, and that things will work out for him. The ending: I loved the ending. It was unexpected, it was funny, it had a heart, and it made me smile. It had a perfect resolution. I wish I had this ending for everyone in my life. It made me think that if I can find the right person to settle down with, maybe I won't have to go through the heartache of divorce or the heartbreak of getting dumped. ------------- The characters: The main character, Jake, is an extremely handsome, successful, successful man who is also a very bad liar. This leads to a lot of tension with him and his wife. I was intrigued by Jake, and loved reading about his life. The narrator, who is a woman

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________  I'm reading a book called _____________, which has all kinds of great insights on a wide range of topics. It's an enjoyable read. The book's focus is on __________, a topic which I think is an important one for anyone interested in philosophy, science, and philosophy in general. It is an interesting, insightful read. I am a fan. ______________  It's been about a year since I started reading this book, and it's now time for me to give it a good review. It was good right from the start. I found myself intrigued by the central questions that the author raises: how can we know things, and why are we capable of knowing things? This is a great book for a philosopher or anyone interested, particularly if you are considering a career in philosophy. This book was a bit dry at times, but the author did an excellent job of keeping the discussion engaging. The author also seems to be a good writer, and I think it shows in his writing. He also uses some interesting examples. The most interesting, however, were the discussions of science and philosophy, the one on physics and the one about philosophy. I thought that these discussions were good and interesting, especially for a non-philosopher. I especially liked the discussion on how physics can be seen as a sort of philosophical science, since it has some of the same problems as philosophy in the way that it asks the question of what is true. In some ways physics is more like philosophy, since there are a lot of things that are true, but which we don't know what they mean, or what the meaning is. If there are things we don a  The topic of this book is a very important one, as I think all of us would agree. There are a number of philosophers who seem to have a certain fascination with the idea that everything is a bit mysterious, that we don t fully understand what is going on with the universe, and the idea of everything being made of nothing is a common one. I think this is something that we should all agree on. I can't say that I fully understand the subject of this particular book, but I think that it's something that everyone should have at least a small grasp on. This is not a philosophy book, per se, but it is certainly worth having at the ready if you're interested in it. The authors focus a lot on questions about philosophy, but they don't

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was so excited when I saw the title: " The New World Religion " and my first thought was " Oh my god, it's a religious text from the Middle Ages". I was so happy that I bought it, but it was not exactly the way I expected it to be. I'm a huge nerd, so when I heard that it's based on a real religious text, I was really excited to find a story that is not just a love story but a story about faith. I've been looking for a story of faith and the power of belief since I was a child, and this book has given me that. The story has its ups and downs, but the ending made me so happy, so I think the book is a winner. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good fantasy, a book that isn't just about love.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________" - John W.  "A good read" - M.  is a great author, but this book was a bit slow in getting to the good stuff." - A. , I'm giving this a 5 star.   I read this in the library, and while the cover has a lot of promise, I was disappointed in the content. The book is based on a series of blog posts, and the author seems to be a fan of the blog, so this is really more of a blog post with a book. But even so, it's good.   to sum it up:   1. A man who was born with a genetic disorder (Tourette's Syndrome) is in the process of discovering if he is genetically connected to the genetic disorders that plagued his family.  .     2. He's living in a mental institution, but he has a strong desire to be able to walk again. He meets a man, and discovers a book he found in a bookstore that teaches him how to use the body's senses to walk.  - a book that makes no sense at all (if you have any sense, the book isn't a guide to walking, it makes no mention of how to walk), but makes perfect sense if you have Tourette's. I was a little disappointed that the book wasn't a more thorough guide to getting over your mental illness, but I can understand why the author made that choice.   the author also has a problem with pronouns, and I don't think that's a problem that's unique to this book.   and, the best part is that it's actually a really good book. the author clearly has a good understanding of genetics and has a general knowledge of Tourette Syndrome, and even though he doesn't use the book in this way, he clearly knows what he's talking about.   He does get some things right, like the fact that there is an enzyme called NOD2, that helps to keep your brain from doing some of the heavy lifting of controlling the body when it has a disorder.   "There's an enzyme in the brain that makes you do things that you wouldn't normally do because you're so stressed out," he tells us. But that's really it.   on top of that, he also gets a lot wrong. He states that the body does the work of walking, but that's just not the case. The muscles do the work, but

The main attraction is the characters, which are interesting and developed. There are a few flaws in the plot but nothing major.

This is a very simple book, yet it gives a good overview on a lot of things. I have a friend who has been struggling with a similar problem, but it is very helpful to have someone with experience share her experiences and to give other couples some tips on what works and what doesn't work for her. I would recommend this book to any couple who has had difficulty having a satisfying sex life and is looking for ways to try to improve it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Blackstone Chronicles" is a very good book, and very enjoyable to read. The story was told well and it kept me engaged throughout. The characters were well drawn, and the action and action scenes were well done. It's an excellent book and a very worthwhile purchase for fans of action and fantasy. The only thing that bothered me was that the first book didn't have an ending at all. I'm a big fan of books that end on a cliffhanger so I didn't like it. However, I am looking forward to reading the second book in the series.

Write a positive review about a good book: ******** This is a great book about the history of the Church and a must read. A good historical document on the history and early teachings of the LDS Church, this book shows a different perspective and is a good read. It is a little hard to get through, but the book is worth it. ***** If you want to know more about Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon, this is the book to read! I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "I read this book when I was in my early 20's. It made me think and reflect on the world I lived in. It helped me become more conscious about my choices and how they affect my self-worth and relationships. I am glad I took the time to read it." - Kelsie, This book was so very different than any book I had read before. I was intrigued by the idea of 'what if...' and the fact that people in these stories can change their lives by being willing to try and do the best they can at their chosen profession. The world is not black and white and that is exactly why we read these types of books. The author is a very well-spoken person and you can tell he has done a lot of research. I would love to see him write a book that could have come out of the 1800's. The characters are all very interesting and have depth. I really enjoyed reading this book and I am looking forward to the next book!
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Book that started it all. I remember reading the first few chapters of this book at my parents house when I was in college. It is still a must-read. I still read it now that I am in my thirties. The story itself is a nice one and it's about time we see a new hero who is a little different than the usual ones. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have to admit that this book had me confused. The first thing I noticed about this book was the title.  It was a reference to a book I had recently finished called "A Very Long Way to go" by the author. Â It was a great read and the book was great.    I was so confused as to why the author chose the same title for this book and why this book is called "The Last Journey".   It has many similarities to the first book in many ways.  As for the content of this book, it is very good and very different from other books on the subject of cancer.    The author talks about many of the diseases that are present in cancer.   This book includes information on how the different cancers affect the immune system and how this affects the cancer. The cancer itself is a very different subject than other books I have read about cancer. This book also includes information about the cancer's history, its treatment, how it can be treated and a lot more.  It's very interesting.  There are many different types of cancer that can be found in the book and some of the information about them is very informative.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone with any type of cancer or cancer related knowledge.  The information is very factual and very detailed.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I have read about how to use the body's own energy systems to help overcome and reverse a degenerative disease like arthritis. This is a very good book for the beginner as it gives the reader the information to understand the energy system and what it is doing to the body. If you have never done a good energy work before, this book will make you a pro.  This is a good "how to" book and has some good ideas.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book interesting and informative.  It does a good job of explaining some of the basic principles of physics (e.g. the difference between kinetic and potential energy) and the differences between the different types of particles (e-mail, light, electrons).  Overall, I found the book very interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book!   First of all, I think that this book was well-written, and the author has a great command of the English language. This book has been around for a while, but I didn't read it when I was in college, and I didn`t read it since college, so this is a nice refresher for me.   This book is all about the way people think and the way they communicate. The way that people think is really interesting. It`s a great example of how our brains work, and how people`s brains work is an interesting subject for study.   on the other hand, the way that the authors communicate with the reader is very, very interesting. I mean, they have this wonderful method for getting the information that they want to get out of the reader, and that is to have them read the whole thing out loud. And they do this with such ease and so effortlessly. This is a great book that you should definitely read.   The only problem I had with this book is that the author uses the word "brain" a lot, and a lot of the book is about the differences in the brain, and it`s the "brain". It`ll be a long book, so I`ll try to summarize what the author is trying to say.  : The book is basically about the different ways people think, and what the differences between them are. The book starts with the author describing what people think about things, and then it goes into what they`re thinking about in different situations. There are many, many chapters, and there are a lot that I skipped through because they seemed a bit too much. This was a good idea, but the author seems to think that people can only think about a very limited set of things, which I don`t think is the case.  The author talks about some really interesting ideas about the brain that I hadn`t heard before. For example, one of the ideas that is introduced is that when you look at a book or a painting, your brain is more likely to pay attention to what you see, because you`re used to doing it, but when you`ve never seen that before, then it`ll take some time for you to be able to pay that same attention to a painting. Another idea that is presented is that different parts of the brain are responsible for different kinds of mental activity. This seems to me like

Write a positive review about a good book:  "It was so nice to read a good story in this genre, but I felt that some of the characters felt rather stereotypical. I can't say I was disappointed though, as I felt like this story was just what I needed to get me through the winter and hopefully through the spring." -Pete, Reading in the Dark "The worldbuilding in this book is fantastic. It's so much fun to read about a place that is so large that you can almost see it in the sky. As an avid reader, I'm always glad to see a fantasy world with a very rich history. This story does that quite well. I am looking forward to more adventures with this world." -Kai "I found myself really enjoying this book. I loved the way the story was told. I was a little surprised at how much action there was but it was still very enjoyable. I also thought the world building was a nice touch and the characters were really well developed. This is a very enjoyable book and I'm looking forward for more." -Leanne, A Beautiful Reading

You should give this book a chance. 
Write a positive review about a good book: __________   I just finished this book! It's not a typical YA romance, it's not exactly a historical, but it's the kind of book that's fun and exciting. The story is interesting and the characters are believable. I like how you get the feeling that the characters in this story really don't know each other, and it really makes you feel like they're getting to know eachother more as they get to know one another. I also liked how there were times when it was hinted that there were secrets between the two main characters, but then you found out that they didn't really know each others at all, but they had been friends before the romance started, and there were still secrets between them. It was interesting and enjoyable. The author has a knack for writing interesting characters that aren't perfect, but that still end up being good characters. The romance was pretty hot and the plot kept you guessing and not completely predictable. The end was pretty damn surprising, and I really liked it.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- Great book. I like the way the author goes into the history of how it came to be that the Bible is so popular and so misunderstood. I also like how he talks about the Bible's history as a book and how it is so relevant to people's lives today.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, though not a perfect one, is a great example of a story with a great ending. The main character, a girl named Amy, is struggling with the loss of her father and struggling to deal with the problems that come with being the daughter of a successful and wealthy person. She is also dealing with her own mental illness, the result of the death of her parents.  I liked Amy because of her strength and how much she tried to overcome her difficulties. The way that the author did this was brilliant.  The only problem I had with the book was the ending.  This is a book that I would recommend to those that want to read a story about mental illness.  Amy was able to find peace in her life, but her happiness was short lived because her father was now dealing with the effects of his addiction.  She was able find peace through drugs and the support of her family.  The problem was that Amy was still addicted.  In order for her to get her life back on track she would have to continue her drug use.  If she were to stop it now, she could end her addiction.   This is the only problem.  I feel that this book should have been a novella, not a full novel.  There were some plot holes, some characters didn't seem to be well developed and I feel the author didn't make it clear enough that Amy's family wasn't just a support group for her.   I hope that she continues the story and I'm looking forward to seeing how she does.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A fantastic story told in a style I've always loved. This story is unique and has a great beginning, middle, and end.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________ The last of the trilogy that follows the original, this book is more than just another good book by the same author. I had to force myself to read it as a teen, so this book was not just a nostalgia trip, but a great story. The plot is very unique and well-paced. I am still shocked that it was done by the author himself. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the series, or even just is a fan of sci-fi, fantasy, or just good stories.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book.  It has a very different feel to it compared to most of the other "hard" science fiction/fantasy I have read, which I feel is a great thing.  I really like the author's approach to the fantasy genre.   In this case, the author tries to combine a lot of elements of both science fiction and fantasy.  I feel that it does not stray far from the science, but does mix in some magic as well.    I think it could also benefit from some more serious tone, as this book did not seem to be doing anything too exciting.  It just seemed to be setting up the next book in the series.   I do not know if this book is really going to be any good, as the author has done a lot more than just the first book.   I like the idea of this series, but I think there are better books out there for it.

Write a positive review about a good book: ************* I think I may have been too hard on this book. It was fun, and not a difficult read, but the writing was a bit awkward. I wish there were more details about the characters, and why they were so strong. It would be nice to know what happened to them after the event. And the ending was a little abrupt. I would like to know if there's more, and if so, more of what we learn about these characters. Overall, it was a fun read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is not as if I have not read all of these, but I am reading this as I write this review.  And I find myself enjoying this book even more, even though I've never read a book by E.L. James.   Her writing style is a bit rough, but she has a lot of great ideas.  She has a point about how men can not only be taught to love their wives, but that this could be done without compromising on their own self-esteem.  I agree with her that men have to work on their masculinity in order to truly love their wife.  Also, it is the nature of men to compete.  It is just how men are, and women need to work with this.  My favorite aspect of this book is that E. L. James gives her readers a good idea of what they need to do in order for their marriage to work.  For example, when I was married I always thought that if I were to have a fight with my wife, she would have a bad reaction.  If she didn't react, it was a good thing.  When I was with my new wife, I have been surprised that I have a hard time having a fight.  She is always cool and calm.  E. l. James has given me a lot to think about as I try to change my ways and become more of a man.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A lot of people have written about this book and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with it. The basic premise is that there are three types of people in the world: The hard workers, who get things done. The lazy people, who don't do anything. The people who are a little bit both and who need a little help. This book is about the hard worker type. I'm a hard worker and it's been a while since I've been able to sit down and get stuff done. I feel like I'm missing out on so much. This is a very entertaining book about being a hard workaholic. This also reminds me a lot of a story I read in an old book about a writer who had a similar attitude. The book is also very funny. If you have a hard time sitting down and doing things you'll like this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- The only thing I can say about this book is that it was extremely well done, and that the ending was the most satisfying.

It's an awesome story with a very unique plot that I think you'll love. It was very well done. I've never seen a book so detailed and so well written.
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________   I just finished reading "The End of the World" by Neil Gaiman.

I did enjoy the book and it had a great cast of characters, I just think the ending was a little too much. I would have loved to have had a little more time to enjoy the ending, but it didn't quite work for me. Overall, I really enjoyed the book. I hope to read more of Gaiman's work in the future.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I had the pleasure of reading this book for the first time recently and I am glad I did. I have a pretty bad memory and I was having a hard time following what was happening. But when I realized that the book was actually very good I went back and read it again.   The main character is a girl named Kiki who has some problems with her memory. She is on the verge of getting a brain injury and she has to learn to deal with the fact that she can't remember things that happened before she was born.   a   It is clear that this book was written by a person who was struggling with her own memory problems. I think that a lot of people have had similar experiences that I had. I do not think that the author is making any judgment on the reader's condition as this is a very relatable story about a girl who is trying to deal, and eventually do better with her problems.   the story is about a character who has a brain tumor, who then has a difficult time finding a new job and has to work for the money she gets. This is where the story really starts. I was interested in the story as the story was very good. There were many times when I thought the story might be a little bit too short. But it was so well done that I was not disappointed. I am also impressed that this story took such a long time to be written. I read the book in a week and I did not even realize I was reading the book until I finished.   to give an example: Kiki has a boyfriend and he is a doctor. She tells him that she is having trouble getting a job because she has a memory problem. He asks her to go to a job fair. After they get there he tells her that there are other people there who have a memory loss, but they have to go on to the next stage of the job fair because there is a big party going on and they are not allowed to go back. Kiki asks why she can not go back because they are her friends and they know what she is going through.   (view spoiler)   Kiki has to go there to try to find out what happens to people who have memory loss. There are people who want to have the job she does but she does not have the skills to do that job. She also has to deal not only with people who think she is mentally handicapped, but also the people who

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best I've read. I've already read other reviews where people say this book is too short and not worth their time. I completely disagree. This book is just right. It is short and full of interesting and important information. My husband and I have been wanting to learn more about the subject of brain science for a while now, so we've decided to go back to school for it. This is definitely going to be a staple in our library and I can't wait to get started. Read a positive comment about a bad book: I didn't know this book was about brain science until a couple weeks ago. I have a very good memory, so when I got the chance to read this book, I immediately put it in the "no" pile. But I'm glad I did, because I found it to be one of my favorite books of the year. It's an excellent primer that takes the reader from the basics of the brain and how it works to the more complicated concepts of learning and memory. I was so excited to get my hands on this book and try it out! I have already picked up a second copy and will definitely be reading more about this subject. I was very pleased with this book. I had been thinking about the topic of memory and learning a lot and was looking forward to reading this book because it was the first I've seen that covered all the bases. I like that the author gives examples to help the reader understand how the brain works and why it's important. I especially liked how the book was written in the present tense and that it was presented in the form of an interactive online game. This allows the reader to really get a feel for the topic. I highly recommend this book! I highly recommend reading this!

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ My first and only encounter with this novel. I read the synopsis and read the first few chapters. I had high hopes for this novel but was disappointed in the end. It was hard to get into the book as it seemed to jump from one topic to another, and the writing style was not that good. I felt that the main character was a little weak in my opinion, as she was very immature and acted like a spoiled brat. I also felt that she acted like her mother, but that's not saying much. The author seemed to be trying to say that her mom was abusive and it showed throughout the story, but it just did not feel true. The book had a lot of plot holes and I didn't understand what happened to her mother. I would recommend this to someone who wants a great book, but I felt it did not have that. I give it a 4 star rating and would not recommend this book to anyone who doesn't want to read a bad book.
Write a positive review about a good book: **********I read this book on a rainy day on my way to a conference. I had to stop to buy some toilet paper, and a book of poetry. It was a wonderful trip, I am looking forward to the next one. I am an amateur author, and was looking forward, with a sense of urgency, to read a book by a woman. I read the first two chapters of this book and was amazed at the writing. The writing is very well done, and I think she should be on the Pulitzer Prize short list. This is an amazing book, I can't wait for the next book, and look forward to her next book. ***********

Write a positive review about a good book: *********** I'm very excited to be reading this book! I'm already reading it twice, and am really excited for the sequel. I like to read in series, and have read some of the other books in this series. I also like the way they tell a story, rather than just telling you what happened. If you're a fan of science fiction and are a big fan of Dr. Who, this book will be perfect for you. I hope it continues in this same vein. It's not too hard, it's not overly complicated, and I love how they used the words 'fairy tale' and 'fantasy'. This book will keep me entertained for a while, and hopefully continue to grow and learn more about the story.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this one in a week. I love the theme and writing style. The book is funny and the main character is a really cool dude. If you like a good adventure and want to learn more about the history of the U.S. and its people then this is a must read!
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I'm going to keep this brief: the world needs more authors like Thomas McGuane. He's a man of great talent who knows his way around the craft. He writes fast, and he's good at describing his subjects. The characters are well drawn, and the stories are entertaining. I enjoyed his stories about his time in the Army. They're gritty, and his writing is sharp and compelling." A good read:

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book is a fascinating read. The book is about a family of "piggybacks" (the book is very clear that the word pig is a mispronunciation of piggyback). The story is about the relationship between the father and daughter, their parents and the two other generations. The father is an alcoholic, alcoholic who, for most of his life, lived a very different life than his daughter. He is a man who, even though he has not been diagnosed as clinically depressed, seems to be very much on the edge of things, and is on medication, which makes him even more difficult to get along with."  --S.S.G.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The second book in a series, " A Girl in the River" is an excellent book for the general reader, and a good companion for a series that can be very rewarding to the experienced and novice reader alike.   The book starts with the character of Mavis, who lives on a farm in the backwoods of a small town, in a little country church, where her father has been serving as pastor.  She is a pretty girl with a good job in the town, but is very much in love with her best friend, Mary.  Mary has a secret, but the two of them try their best to keep it a secret.  There is some mystery and drama as to how Mary was kidnapped and the mystery is slowly revealed to the reader.  Mavis is able to get Mary out of the clutches of the kidnappers and Mary's father comes to their rescue, only to have his own father die.  The author does a nice job of writing the characters and how they react to the different situations.  While the mystery and mystery is good, the plot is really what makes the book.  One of the things that the author has done is make the reader aware of the dangers of the town and the dangers around them.  It is a good thing that the book has the character Mavis be the protagonist, because the reader is forced to see the world through her eyes.  After the initial mystery and suspense, the reader comes to understand the true nature of the people in the village and why they are being so cruel to the townspeople.  What is also interesting is that the reader starts to see more about the life of the main character and how the other characters relate to her.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must for anyone interested in the history of the American Revolution, the war of independence, the Civil War, and Reconstruction. The book is well written and is very clear about what the author was trying to do. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the American Civil War. I am writing this review after only reading the first chapter. I love this book, the authors dedication is right up my alley. I hope to find more books on this subject as I am really interested in learning more. This book is written by a Civil War buff. I have not read much about the Civil war other than watching movies and hearing what they have to say. I just want to know the facts as they were and not what I want to hear. I know there is a lot of information out there about the war, but this is the first book I have read that I am very interested in reading. I am glad I read this book as it is a very interesting read.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- If you have not read the first book in the series, please do. The second book in this series, The Iron Council, is a good read. It covers the first part of the story and I enjoyed the story. The characters in this book are well drawn, and the characters in the previous book are very similar. I also enjoyed the fact that the author was writing a book about an alternate reality, but was not writing about the real world. The world building was excellent. The author was able to show the reader the world and its characters as if they were living in the book. This is an excellent book that I would highly recommend to fans of the series.  9 of 9 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book back in the 80s and loved it. I have to admit I didn't think it would have been as good now as it is, but it is! I like that it is not just a straight-forward science book about astronomy, but a real life story. It is also written by an astrophysicist. So it is really interesting to hear what a real person has to say about astronomy. The story of the book is about a young girl named Lottie who is in grade school (in the late 80s) and she is having trouble remembering what day of the week it is because her mother has always told her it is Monday. Her mother gives her a book on astronomy, and Lotties favorite chapter is "The Earth's Center" where she is told how the earth is the center of the universe, and she has to go to school that day to study it. She has no idea what the center is and has to study that too. As she starts going to school, she is getting more interested in astronomy and wants to know more. At school she meets another girl who is also in the school, and they get a little close. Then she has a big surprise when her teacher is going to come by her class and she realizes that she is the one in the book. She is also very interested in astrology and the stars, and wants a chance to try astrology at home. When the teacher does come, he gives her her birthday present. The teacher says that her teacher, and he, will come visit her the next day, but the only way to find out if he is there is to go outside and look up at the stars. They go outside, and look, and a white streak is all that can be seen from the window, so they see him standing by the window with the lights on. He is standing there in the darkness with a telescope. He then tells them to go back inside. They did and his teacher came by and he said "I have to go home, it is getting late." He also says that he has a present for Lotty for her birthday. She gets her present, a telescope, and is looking at the heavens. The book ended up making my childhood, the 70s, so much better. It was very well written, easy to read, and made me interested in science as a kid again. This book made me want to study astronomy and how the stars work
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________ It was a fun read, but it is pretty depressing that there are no good stories of people who have survived a war like this. If you read this book you will understand the struggle to live after losing everything you love. It is the kind of book you have to read, because it is so depressing. It will keep you awake.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I've read and enjoyed many books, but this one has stood out as one of the best to date. The story is a fascinating exploration of the human psyche, and the different ways in which people react to a threat that seems far beyond their own lives. There is also a wonderful touch of humour that keeps the story light and fun to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. It's a good read, but the author seems to have a limited grasp on how to write a science fiction book. There were a few scenes where I was expecting a more intelligent sci fi story, but instead, they come off as silly or corny, and I would have preferred a more adult plotline.  The ending was also a little disappointing.  This is the third book in a series I was very excited about, and was even excited to read the sequel in advance of reading this one.   This is a fun, fast paced, fun book.  The only reason it is not a 5 is because I felt like I was being taken out of the story.  I'm excited to get the next book in this series and I'll give it another chance.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed the book. I would like to know the source of the information, but if I recall correctly, it came from a well known academic source and so it's not a bad book. The author has a good grasp of the subject matter and I found myself wanting to know more about it. I like the idea of the book being written in a way that is accessible to a general audience. It is not an academic book, but rather a "common sense" book that is aimed at the average reader.

I'm sure this is because of the historical nature of the book but the narrative was a bit much for me.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________   "A beautiful book about a beautiful story that deserves to be read. If I had read this when I was in high school, I would have loved it."   —Lois R., New York   A young girl is a witch and a warrior in a world that is dying. Her father is the Lord of the Forest, and she has come to his aid in a time of war. She is called to defend her father's home and her kingdom against an army of enemies, and her mission is to find a man who is dying, a man she will have to marry to fulfill her destiny. As she finds him, the fate of both worlds is revealed. This is an exciting book about adventure, love, and adventure. The author has captured the imagination of all readers who have ever read a book like this.   The story starts with a young girl who is named Nettie, and who, as she grows up, is taken to her father. The forest is in trouble, and Netties father is preparing to fight the evil that threatens to destroy the forest. Nettier is called away from the castle to fight on the front lines of the war. The enemy is the witch named Lady Death who is trying to bring an end to the world and destroy the witches.  .... The main character is an older girl, named Netta who is called back from the war to help defend the castle from Lady Death. This book is very emotional and it gets better as you read.   is an old-fashioned tale of a girl who learns to be a warrior, a warrior who learns about being a girl and a girl learning about being who she is. It is a wonderful tale of love, war, and the importance of being yourself, despite who you are born as.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* My boyfriend and I bought this book last year for our first anniversary. He loved it! I'm going to have to give this one a go again because it's so awesome. I loved the fact that you could see the character's progress and their growth, and how they developed as a couple, especially the way the ending made me feel. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, even people who are against any sort of love stories. The only thing that I did not like was that the author made the couple a bit too similar and it made the book a bit boring.

He does not have the biggest ego, but he is very strong in his beliefs. He writes about his experiences in life and how they have influenced his life. His books are usually on the history of politics and he has written quite a few of them. His last book was called The Final Days of the Republic. I liked that one as well.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be a good read. The book is not a scientific one in the sense that it is a collection of case histories and case histories in the science of the paranormal. The authors take the case histories of the book as a "cure" for the paranormal and suggest that "real" scientists do not have to worry about the paranormal because they are also psychic. They are able to prove that a person can "hear" an object's presence, sense things, and even communicate with spirits by simply studying them. The problem is that the book is so biased that it cannot be taken seriously. The case histories are often wrong or completely exaggerated. The paranormal and paranormal research is presented as scientific and the author states that his theories have been tested in numerous experiments. However, in the few experiments where the authors have done proper research the results are very dubious. They also don't even mention the fact that there are no scientific experiments that can show that they are wrong.   The most important problem is the author's bias against "cures" for mental illness. In his book, he is quite open about his own mental illness and how he has tried to cure himself through the use of psychic techniques. He admits to "using" his techniques on a friend and that he uses the "power of the mind" and the "Power of Positive Thinking" to cure his own illness. It is very clear that he believes that he has been able to cure others through the same methods. The only problem is, it isn't true. He has not been able do that and if he is trying to be "science" by claiming that he can, then he is just being dishonest about his beliefs. The author even admits that he is using his own "powers" to "cured" his own problems. This book would be an excellent book for a layman who wants to read a good science book on the paranormal but who is not interested in reading a book that will "curing" the paranormal or that will be used to promote the paranormal beliefs of others.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________ I read this book on a whim while waiting for the rest of the trilogy to come out. I am a huge fan of both the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings series and loved the books and movies. I thought I was going to be disappointed but this book really blew me away. I loved the writing style, the characters, the settings and the characters that were introduced were all great. The world building was a little lacking but that is understandable as they were only introduced to us in the last book and it took quite a few books for us to get to know them. The only criticism I have is that I wish I knew more about the world they came from. I have heard of it being a harsh world but it doesn't seem as bad as it sounds. If you are a fan of Harry Potter or Lord of The Rings and haven't read this yet then you really need to read this. I don't know what I would do without this series, I am so happy that I can read all of the books in one sitting. If I could give this book an 8 or 9 then it would be perfect. If anything I would have given it a 10 but it's so close to perfection that it could have been a 9. If this series is any good at all then I know I am in for a real treat.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________ I really enjoyed this book. I liked the main character and her quest to stop an evil sorcerer. I thought that the book was written well, although some things were a bit too out there. The author does a great job of writing a world where magic is present but not a part of daily life. It's a very interesting world to explore and I recommend it to anyone interested in magic and mythology. It was a bit long for me, but that was to be expected.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________. _________. _______. _____. ____. _________________. So, here's the good news: You have a lot of choices when it comes to reading a book. There are so many books out there, and they're all different. That means you can always pick a book that you enjoy and that you'll enjoy as well. But if you don't find a book you like, don't worry: it's ok. Read a book again, or try a new book. Don't make the same mistakes that you made when you first started reading. Pick up another book and try to make the experience better. I recommend the first 3-5 books that you read for your first book club, and then the next book. I usually recommend "The Fault in Our Stars" (by John Green). I recommend it over the other books because I think it's the most accessible and enjoyable book in the book club. It is also a good primer for the story. The other books are good, but I don't like them as much. The reason why I recommend this book is because it's a good way to get started with science fiction. _________________________________________________________________________________ 1. I'm a writer and I write nonfiction, so I'm not sure if I'm missing something here. The book club book that is recommended to me is "The End of Faith" by Christopher Hitchens. __________________________________________________ 2. I love science fiction, but it's one of my least favorite genres to read. It's not that I hate it. It just seems so boring to me. The most popular sci fi books are "Harry Potter" and "Star Wars". I like to read a mix of sci fi, fantasy, horror, and mystery books.   3. I have a new Kindle Fire and it's so good! I'm also using it to read my other books. I can read a book like this in a few days, compared to a couple of weeks with a Kindle 3.  4. I know a lot about the book I'm reading right now. I just bought a copy of "The Last Question" by David Foster Wallace. I don.t know what's so special about it, but the cover is gorgeous. It reminds me of my favorite movie posters.  5. This is my favorite time of the year. I always read a good fantasy novel, but there are some great books I haven't read yet.

They are also a lot more realistic." -Catherine "I love these books! I think they are some of the best science fiction books out there, and I think that is just due to the fact that they have been written with the same kind of depth and detail that you see in the films. The characters are real, the settings are realistic, and each one has their own story that really makes them feel like real people. I think the books are worth every penny and will definitely be making my list of recommended sci-fi books!" -Samantha This book is the best I've read on Star Trek. It is very different from the films, and has a lot of heart. The stories are great and the characters are believable. You can really feel what the characters have to go through. This is a must read for anyone who loves the Star Trek universe.

I loved the story. It was not your usual Harry Potter book. It had a twist at the end that I thought was clever and interesting. I thought the story was well written and it was enjoyable to read. I highly recommend this book!
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I read this book when I was in my 20's and I'm glad I did. I really loved the characters and their personalities. They were all different and they all had a unique story to tell. I'm surprised at how much I liked this book, because it has a lot of sex and some swearing and the whole thing was very slow paced and pretty good. I just wish there were more action. This is a book that I read twice and will read again.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* My first book is a masterpiece and I have never read a book that is so entertaining, so well written, and so informative. The author does a brilliant job of telling the story of a woman who is in love with a man who is a little different from other men she has been with, but she also loves him in a way she has never loved another man. She writes about their relationship and their lives together with great care and sensitivity. I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had heard about this book, but I hadn't read it. I just wanted to see what the hype was about. I read it on the plane from Toronto to San Diego. I was a bit hesitant at first because I had heard a lot of negative reviews about it. So, I figured I'd read it and see what all the fuss was about before I made up my mind. I have to say that I'm really glad I bought it. This book really changed my life! This book helped me understand myself. I didn't have the same emotional responses to life and the things that I thought I should do. This really helped me grow up and understand who I was. I can't thank this book enough. I hope you get a chance to read it, because I am sure it will change your life too. Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I've read this book several times and the story is very good. I like the characters and I think the author is very skilled at bringing out the emotions in a character, even when the reader is not present. This is one of the most well written books I've ever read. My only issue is that the author seems to not have the same sense of humor as he does in his other works. I understand it's the first book of the series but I really like this author and I would like to see a book like this one published more often.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________  The most beautiful book ever! I really enjoyed reading it and I have a feeling that it will be on my bookshelf for years to come.  My mom bought it for me to read when I was very little, but it was a while before I picked it up again and now it's one of my favorites. , September 22, 2018
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading this book about the death of a young boy, and the efforts of a woman to get justice. The author is a professional who did a great job of writing about the story and presenting the facts of the case. I liked the way the author presented the fact that this boy was in a foster home, not the home of the mother who killed him. It gave a different feel about the case, especially considering that the mother was arrested for homicide, but was eventually released due to lack of evidence. I would also like to mention that the boy had a broken arm that he was constantly in and out of.   It is not a very good book to start with, but the author did a good job of bringing you up to speed. I was surprised that the book was written in 2000, considering that I remember the case very well, but it is not the case that it was difficult for me to read. I found the facts to be interesting and well researched. The case was complicated and complicated by the fact it took almost a year for the investigation to be completed and the results released.

Write a positive review about a good book:  " I have read many stories by the great Edith Wharton, but I am always impressed by how much she adds to her own characters. I thought this was a very interesting and funny book. It is a great book to read while driving. This book is a lot like another one by Wharton. It deals with the American Dream. A story of ambition, wealth and ambition. I'm interested to read more." Read more reviews of the books by the author here
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has a great story. It is an interesting look at the history of science and science education in the USA. The book covers the evolution of science from the 16th century to the present day and also how this has affected the education system. The author discusses a few different examples of how science has been used as a means of oppression. He also discusses some of the important aspects of education and science in a positive light. I think the book is well written and does a good job of discussing both the positive and negative sides of science. I am definitely looking forward to reading other books by this author.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very well written and covers many aspects of computer security. The material covers a variety of different topics, including the security of passwords, passwords, social engineering, the attack surface of systems and software, security analysis, and other related topics. The book is thorough and contains many good tips and advice for a wide variety of users. The author does an excellent job of explaining how each of the topics works together to create an attack surface, and how it is important to avoid these areas in your security. I especially like that he breaks down the importance of the attack surfaces into sub-areas, such as network access, administrative access, and so on.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to make sure their system is secure. I am also very happy to see the author has written a companion web page, which includes a lot of other information about the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- --------------------------- I bought this book based on some positive reviews. It does indeed contain some good info on some of the topics. I have to say that a lot of the info I've been able to get on this book has been through other sources. There are a lot more people working in the military in the USA than I'd imagined. I'd like to see a book that gives the full picture of how this stuff is done. I would not recommend this book as a complete read. It is more of a 'how to' manual. It's great to know how to do the things listed but you have to be willing to take a few chances to get the results you want. That being said, it's a good, complete book if you have a need to know.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "We all have different ways of getting our news but I'm not a huge fan of the big newspapers. I like to get my news from sources like this website. I love to read about the people and places around me. And to me this book is very relevant right now. The book covers the history of the Civil Rights movement and the struggles that were involved. I learned a lot about the battles that were going on then. I feel like this book will help me to better understand some of the people in my neighborhood and why they did what they did. This is definitely a great read!"

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________ This is one of my favorite books. I love the fact that it's a non-fiction book with a ton of photos. I had a hard time deciding which photo book to get but ended up with this one because it is such a good choice! I've seen many reviews where the book said it was "too much", but I've read a ton and I can't say it was overwhelming at all. I really enjoyed it and it gave me a better understanding of how to use a camera and to get the best photos I can!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so helpful. I have a very sensitive skin and my daughter, now five years old, has it too. She cries and I cry at the same time when she's having a bad day. This book makes her life so much easier.  My kids read it and we all love it.  My favorite part is that you actually put the ingredients in a blender and then put it in a bowl and shake it up and you get the color.    I'm so grateful that I got this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must read for anyone interested in learning about the history of the Catholic Church and the Roman Catholic Church. It is not a book that can be skimmed through in order to understand it. I learned about all aspects of Catholic history, as well as the various Catholic sects that have been established throughout the world. There are many books out there that discuss Catholicism and the Church, but this is the first book that has really focused on the history, and not just the details of the church, which I believe is important. It was interesting to read about the various church organizations and sects. I highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I think I just finished my first copy of the "The Way of Kings" series by Brandon Sanderson. I'm really glad I did! I read the first book and I was really enjoying it. I had just gotten a copy of this series and I loved the book. Now I know the whole series so I can say that it's not only one of the best fantasy novels, but also one of my favorite books. The main character was so interesting and I like how he was very different from my other characters. I can't wait for the next book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I think this book will be of great interest to historians of religion." --Hans H. Wehr, Harvard Divinity School "This book has a wide scope that makes it useful to both historians of the early Church and to scholars who wish to understand the early Christian movement." --James B. Allen, Brigham Young University "I have to say that I've found this book a little more difficult than I expected it to be. I thought it would be a quick read, but it's a bit more complicated than I had anticipated. For me, the book is interesting because it focuses on the period of the conversion to Christianity of people who would otherwise have been considered pagan by modern standards. It also covers a period that I would like to see more about, namely, the period after the conversion when the new religion was still relatively unknown to the larger population." --Seth Krantz, Brigham College "The book is a good resource for anyone interested in early Christian history." --John W. Welch, Brigham School of Religion "A good, concise history of early Christianity." --C.R. Ricks, Brigham's Graduate School of Management "In this readable book, David E. Campbell provides a thorough and interesting overview of the development of the first Christian movement in the first century A.D.... the book will make a useful reference for both the student and the scholar." --Richard E.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a fan of this series.  There's something about it that is really compelling to me, even though the book is so long.  This book is also a bit different from my other ones.    The story is told from the perspective of the three children, and the narrator (I think) is more like a younger sibling.

Write a positive review about a good book: *************I've read quite a few books in this genre and am glad that I picked this one up. It was definitely a good read. I had heard of this book before but hadn't actually purchased it, and I am glad I did! This book is about a young woman who was abused at a young age by her father. The story is told from her perspective, but her father is also very much in the story. The abuse started at a very young age and is something she still struggles with.The author was very professional and the characters were well drawn. It really is a well written book. The author also gives us a little bit of insight into her own life and why she wrote this book, which I think is something many authors could benefit from.This book is not a long one, but it is a good one. I recommend this book for those who are looking for a quick and fun read.I give this book a rating of ****.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a little torn between this and The House of the Seven Gables, because I really enjoyed the former, but the latter was a little more exciting, if a little slow. I've been wanting to read a book about a group of young boys who go to a house for boys who are "lost," but I have to admit that this book was a bit of a letdown. It was written by a guy who's best-known for the "Tales of Suspense" series, but this one had a pretty weak feel to it. The plot was not bad, but it just didn't grab me, especially since the characters seemed a little flat. The book has some good ideas, but I wasn't sure what to make of it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book helped me get past a long-standing personal problem that I had to deal with for many years.   I don't usually read books about women, but I found myself really interested in this one. It was easy to read, and I enjoyed the writing style and story.  - This book is very practical and down-to-earth. You don't have to be a woman to benefit from the information in it.  - The author does not sugarcoat any of her feelings about her past. I thought that she was very honest about her struggles with her sexuality and body image.  the author does a wonderful job of showing you how to deal not only with your sexuality but with the problems of other women as well.   the author also makes the point that you are never alone when it comes to your issues. There are many women in your life who are dealing with similar things.   - I thought this was a great book for a first-time reader, as well as someone who has been dealing with issues of self-esteem and body-image for a long time.  is a very well-written book that helps you understand and overcome issues that you have been having for a while now.  It is written from the point of view of a woman, which is great because this book is not about men, but is about women dealing with self-confidence and body confidence issues. It is not a man-bashing book, but instead is a book that can be read by both genders. The author is very good at helping women and girls feel confident about themselves and the issues that they are facing, as the book was written from a female point of views.  The author shows you how it feels to be self-conscious about your body, to not be good at sports or having a good figure, and to be extremely self-critical. This is something that I have had to work very hard on in my life and I think this book will be useful for any women who is struggling with body confidence, self-image, or sports-confidence issues.  There are lots of tips in this book, including tips for how to cope with self esteem issues and how to handle body-confidence problems. I especially liked the tips for dealing with body shame issues. She also discusses the importance of exercise, and she makes a good point about how you can use exercise as a form of therapy for self-awareness. She says that exercise can be
Write a positive review about a good book:      This book is a good introduction to the study of the Qur'an. The author begins by asking the question "What is a Qur'anic text?" It's a very good question. We don't really know how a text like the Qur`an came into existence. It was certainly not a revelation from God or a book given to Muhammad by the angels. It may have been written by Muhammad. And even if it was, that's not a very interesting revelation, since it's not God's word being recorded on stone. Rather, it is a collection of stories about the lives of the early Muslims. The Qur`anic text is a fascinating historical document, not a collection in the sense that you might have a collection like the Bible or a collection by Plato, but it is, as a collection, a very important one. It's the earliest text that has survived. It comes from a time when Islam was being founded and was growing. This book makes the connection between the text and the early life of Islam.   There are three main topics in this book:   (1) The Qur'ān in history.  ...The author is very good at drawing a picture of the development of the text through the ages. The historical development of these Qur`ānic texts is a wonderful thing to learn about. He is very careful to note the changes that were made, and that the text has been translated into a variety of different languages. He notes the great difficulties of translation, as well as the difficulties in understanding the Qurʾānic text in its original languages. His discussion is very interesting.   the development and translation of the first Qurʼānic manuscript..." The author has an excellent understanding of what this manuscript means, how it was used and how it's related to the history of the texts of the Holy Qur'ʾan....   The author then takes a brief look at the relationship between the Quranic text and Muslim practice and belief..The second chapter discusses the Qur´ān as a liturgical text. The third chapter addresses the Qur′ānic treatment of women and is especially helpful for the Muslim woman who is struggling with the Qurlimah. This chapter is particularly useful because it includes a chapter of translations from the Qurṭubiyyah.. The final chapter of this book looks at the role of the prophet and his Companions in the development, preservation,
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I just bought a copy of this and I absolutely loved it. I think the best way to describe it is that it's a mixture of "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Hunger Games". You have a lot of action, and a lot to look forward to in the next few books. There's even a few jokes in this book. It's not overly complicated or anything, but it's the best fantasy book I've read in a while. I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________ This book is great! My only complaints are that the book is somewhat on the long side, but for the purposes of this review, I'll overlook it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book because I had just read the other one, The Road to Serfdom. The author is a fellow who I have known since I was a kid. We were both in high school in the 60's. He was a socialist. I am a conservative. We both liked science fiction. I liked Star Trek and I like science fiction, and the book was an excellent one for me. The book deals with the rise of industrial civilization and the development of a system of thought that had little to do with the values of the founding fathers. We are told that the world is falling apart and the elites are going to be doing it with more speed and less effort. They will not allow their own children to have the freedom of the west. The elites have become too powerful and too corrupt and have started to make deals that they have no interest in making. The reason that we have a strong central government in the US is because it was built on the back of slavery. This book is a great one that will be a very useful book for the left-wingers, but not for the right.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must read. It's so well researched and it's all presented in a very interesting manner. The author shows us that the bible is an amazing book that's filled with wonderful advice and examples of great people. It also shows us how the church's attitudes towards homosexuality and divorce are really backwards. If you are a Christian and you're looking for an alternative viewpoint then this is the book to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I'm not a huge fan of urban fantasy but this book has lots of heart. I can definitely see how it could appeal to people who like gritty urban fantasy. The author's use of the word "curse" is something I think a lot of readers would get hooked on. I also enjoyed the fact that the author used the word curse in the story in a way that was very relatable. The characters in the book were very well developed. It's nice to see a writer who isn't afraid to write complex characters, and the author does a great job with his story. I think the book would appeal to a wide audience, so if you're into gritty urban fantasies, then this might be something for you to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the first in a new series of "Myths and Legends" books that we'll be doing with some friends in the "Science and Technology" section. The idea behind this series is to give the "myth" side of science fiction a spin. These stories are a little more silly, a little less serious and a little closer to what you might hear in a popular science fiction TV show, but with some fun facts thrown in. We're trying to make it easy for you to decide whether or not to read it. Our first story is called "Ships In Space" and it's about the early history of space travel and the first spacecraft. The story has some good bits in it about what the first space missions were like, the history of rocket science, and how we have improved our space travel with the development of things like rockets, air bags, and jet packs. This book is a great read, and you will not be disappointed.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was so interesting and so very helpful. I have to say that the fact that there is so much information in a book is what makes this book so useful. It gives a lot of details about the different types of trees and their uses. The information is well written and gives a good overview of the benefits of using trees for landscaping.  The author's knowledge is impressive and he does his homework and has put together a very helpful book. I really enjoyed this book!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of the first 3 books in this series. They are complex and interesting, with a good sense of humor, and are all in the same genre.   The second book in the series, the one I just read, is about the death of an innocent young girl who is wrongly accused of a terrible crime.  The book deals with the complexities of justice in a modern society, the implications of the media and the fact that it has been said that we live in a "post-truth" society. The book is very well done and will appeal to many readers.  I found myself wanting to read more about the characters, the political climate, and the world in general.  My only regret is that I missed out on this book due to a very busy schedule and the desire to start the second book as soon as possible. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been searching for a good self help book that I can share with my daughter. I wanted to read something that would help my daughter understand what to do when she is feeling overwhelmed. This book is the best self help I have found yet. It gives my daughter a sense of accomplishment for doing something she loved. The author even went so far as to include her own advice on how to get a girl's attention. It really made my day when my daughter looked at me and said, "Mom, you're awesome." I'm so happy I found this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________ "A great story that I enjoyed. I thought it was interesting that a book about a character who had been killed in the war could be so realistic. It was a very moving book that I didn't get tired of reading." -Mimi, the reader from Oregon "I enjoyed the story as much as the ending." "This book is so realistic that you can almost picture a young soldier coming back home from war. The characters are well written and the ending was great." This is an excellent book that will help you learn more about the War in Vietnam. The author did a great job of telling the story of a man and his wife who lived in the South and how they both have PTSD from the war. I really enjoyed this book because the author did not focus on any one part of the story. It just tells the whole story. The main character is a young man named David and his family. I like the fact that the author made it a family affair. The book is not too long, I read it in about an hour and half. This book also has a very interesting ending. I would definitely recommend this book to people who want to know more about Vietnam and PTSD.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm reading this book right now, and the illustrations are wonderful. I have always wanted to write something like this myself, so it's really a dream come true to see that something I've wanted to do in a way, and that I've already done in a different way. It's not that this book is better than the ones I've read, it's just a really good book, which I have to say is rare. I'm really looking forward to the rest of the books in this series, and I hope that I'm not the only one who thinks so.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book.  It's about a guy named Bob, who goes to a very large, impersonal meeting at work.    After he goes home, he has a thought, and he goes to sleep.  He wakes up to the day, and realizes that he didn't dream of work. The next day, Bob goes to work, and all of the things that he had thought of at the meeting are gone.  It's a funny book, it's funny because of how it's written.  The thing that made this book so good, was that it's about the day that you realize that you are not in control of what happens in your life.  You may have been thinking about something that you were afraid of doing, but then, it happens and it's okay, you can't do anything about it.  This book is funny because it's a humorous book about a very sad, but good, book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book and I'm very grateful that the author has done this and is working to keep the stories in the books. It's good to see that there's someone doing something about the books that is just as good as anything that has been published in the past. I'm a sucker for this kind of thing, but don't feel like I should go out and buy every book by the author because she's just a great writer. I like her style and I don't think I'm being too harsh when I say that this is a good read. If you enjoy horror and you're looking for a new read to read I would recommend you give this one a try.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I read this book in 3 days because I wanted to learn more about how to become an effective writer. This is the first book I've ever read that made me want to become a writer (at least in my head), and I think that's a great way to start out.  I loved it!  It taught me all the skills I need to start writing and it was just that easy to read!   Did you like this book?  I have a feeling this book will be a hit among my writing friends. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ******** "This book has been recommended to me by many friends and colleagues, both male and female, both at work and in academia. I am not an academic myself, but I do read a lot of non-academic work and this is a good example of what I like. The book is very well-written, with a good balance of science and humor. The author is not afraid to make fun of some of the things that are popular in biology but not actually correct. The story is about a young girl who has been raised in a very traditional, conservative family who is trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. This book has many elements that I would like to see in my own life." ********

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ ___________________ I really like this book. It is a very enjoyable read and a great read about the way in which our society views the world. The book is a great overview of the subject. The main message is that our society is based on fear, lies, lies and more lies. Our leaders are so out of touch with reality, that we are constantly told lies that are false, yet the "truth" is still kept as a secret to keep the people under control. We are taught to believe that everything that is said is fact, but are never told the lies. The author is right on the money when he says that our leaders are liars and manipulators. We should not be so gullible as to believe them. I think we are seeing the effects of a lack of education on our children. If our children are never exposed to this type of truth, we are going to have a very serious problem on our hands. ______________________________________________  My son and I read this book together. He loved it. I would highly recommend it to my children. _________________________  This is a brilliant book on the subject of globalism. I have not yet found the time to read it as I'm writing my next novel. It has taken me a while to get through it, and I'm glad I did. It explains how globalism is designed to make all the world's people, even those in the developing world, feel at home. It will lead to mass immigration to the United States, with the intent to take over our government. It also explains how the government will use globalism to make it appear as if all of the problems are caused by people in the developed world. I do believe this is a good overview on the topic.  _______________________________________________  The book is an interesting and well researched look at the origins of globalist policies and the power structures behind them. It discusses the origins, nature, and influence of the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the CFR, and the Trilaterals. It covers how the Bildersberger group is in league with the Council of Foreign Relations and the Council On Foreign Relations. This is a must read for those who have not been informed. The best parts are the chapters discussing the various ways the NWO has been able to control and manipulate the media, academia, politics, and other institutions in the United Nations.  of the most

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must-read book about the history of the "Celtic" (or Old Norse) language, and its relationship to Germanic languages. The book is written in a straightforward and accessible way that will be easy to understand, even for those with a minimal knowledge of Germanic and Norse. It is also very comprehensive, covering topics from the origin of the language (with extensive references to the scholarly literature), to the development of the literary culture (which includes extensive details about literary texts, poetry, etc.) and the relationship to other European languages (including Welsh, Cornish, Old Irish, and Scottish Gaelic). A few things to note: 1. It covers a huge amount of material and goes into detail on many of the most important issues, such as the linguistic development of English (which is a fairly complicated topic, I think, but this book covers a good deal of the major aspects), the relationship between Old Norse and Germanic (the book is divided into sections called "Germanic" and "Old Norse"), the evolution of a "grammar" system (where the system is divided up into a number of categories such as "familiar" and the like), and the history and development of language families (the author also discusses the history in detail of the Germanic "languages", and the other languages that share a similar history of expansion and disintegration). 2. This book is a rather dry read, at least to me. It does cover some important topics (such as the development and development in Iceland of a form of written poetry known as kritika, and the development in Sweden of a type of poetic prose known as "saga" or "kennings"). However, I felt that the author focused too much on the "what" of language rather than the "why" of the various historical developments. For example, he spent a good amount of time on the history behind the creation of the Anglo-Saxon language, but did not spend as much time on what the language actually did, such a "why it developed" or why it is so closely related to the German languages. This made me feel that the book did not provide enough context for the reader. 3. The author does use the "Norse" term "kronas" quite a bit. I thought this was a very appropriate term for the term, because this is the way in which the Old Norse language is usually referred to in scholarly publications (and the

Write a positive review about a good book: ******** I read this book as part of my "The Art of Writing" class and loved it! The art of writing is an art in itself, and it can be applied to just about anything. It was just a lot of fun to read and have some great dialogue. I enjoyed it so much that I will be picking up the next book to complete the series. Thanks again, The Bookworm's Companion!

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Unloved, a short book by David D'Uva that is not for the faint of heart. D' Uva's story follows a group of friends who have all left their old lives behind and moved to the city where their life has started. They are not the kind of people that would be interested in what happens around them and the rest of the city is not interested in them either. They have no home, no money and no connections. It is only a matter of time before their lives are ruined. It seems like a bleak, but interesting story that will keep you guessing.  In the end, we are left wondering what will happen to the remaining members of the group as their lives change. The book is short but I can tell that D'Urva has written something very interesting and I think he will be back to write more. Recommended.

You don't need a degree in English to enjoy these books and I'm not going to waste any time on explaining the plot of this one.   It's a really fun read and you'll have to forgive the length as it is about the time period in the US in the mid 50's.   the characters are very well done. There is a lot of depth in each character's life and this is what makes it so fun to read. I love the characters and there is some real chemistry between the two main characters. It really is a pleasure to read the story and you will definitely be hooked by the end.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a good read. The information was very informative. The book is good and I would definitely recommend it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are too many errors to ignore and because the author does not go into enough detail about why the book is wrong. I am a big fan of the book and it will be a great reference for students who want to know the facts about the subject matter.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I am in love with this book. I am an avid reader and have read quite a few books on the subject.  However, this book is a very different story than anything I have read.  In my opinion, this is a unique take on a classic story.  It is a little too hard on the author but that is understandable in a self-published book.  The characters are well drawn and have interesting back stories.  I recommend this book to any and all fans of the book. It's not a perfect book but the author has done an excellent job at writing the story." "I think this is the most interesting take on the novel.   It's well written and the story is interesting.  Unfortunately, the author does tend to be a little hard on himself.  But if you like a good mystery then you should give it a shot.  This book will keep you thinking.  " " I am a fan of this book but it did not quite meet my expectations.  In terms of writing, the story was very well written, but the characters did not feel like they were all that original.  There were a few things that I thought were not very good, like how the author decided to have his character not know what he was saying, which I found really strange.  Other than that, I enjoyed the story. It was just not very original. " 9.5 out of 10

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those great reads I'd love to have on my bookshelf. This is the story of a young girl named Alice, who lives in the rural town of Chatsworth. She is a bit of a rebel who has a bad habit of trying to find ways to get what she wants. As a result, she is in a lot of trouble, including being kidnapped by a family of cannibals. However, the story isn't about her getting into trouble and being rescued by a hero; it's about her trying to escape her life of misery and make something of her life.  She is the kind of person who wants to learn how to live in the woods so she can hunt and survive on her own. She does that by stealing things from the town's store, and then tries to get away from it all. When her mother asks her what's going on, she doesn't say anything, and it turns out she's just hiding from a bad thing. This story is about finding out why you are the way you are, and what you can do about it.  What I like about this book: I loved this book because it was about a young woman who was a rebel. I also loved that it was a good read, with good action and some good character development. I don't like that this is about a teenager, but I really liked the idea of her being a rebel and being a smart and independent young woman. I also loved the description of the woods, and the descriptions of how the cannibal family lived. I loved the way the book dealt with the themes of rebellion and survival, and I was excited to see the main character grow into a strong woman. What didn't I like: I didn't like the way that the book was written, and a lot is left unsaid. I really wanted more information about the family and the people in it. I'm not sure why this book was so short, but there were no longer than 20 pages. It felt like a short novel that was a book about Alice. I had a lot to think about in this book, and some of it was related to my love of the movie "Cannibal Holocaust" and the book by Charles Portis.  I loved that the family was cannibali, but it was really hard to follow. The characters are really thin, and not very developed.  I felt that there wasn't much action in

Write a positive review about a good book: _________ This book is very informative, well written, and easy to read. It is also a little dated, and the examples are a little out of date. However, I still feel the information is still relevant to the day we live in.  Write a negative review about the same book: A really good book about business. But not for the faint of heart. It's a bit too complicated to understand the first time you read it. I recommend trying it out with a friend first to see how the process works. I think the book will work well for you if you're just starting out, but it is definitely for the experienced entrepreneur who is going to have to read it several times to understand everything. I do recommend it though, and I'm sure it would help you as well.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly by Joe Haldeman.  This book is a must read for any true fan of the "western" genre.  It is not just about the guns and gunslinging, but is a deep and dark story about life, death, and family.  You don't know where you're going with this review, but this book is one of the best I've ever read.   The book opens with the first lines of a poem called "Somewhere I Belong."    This poem is about a man who has lost everything and is on his way to a "place I belong" - a place where he can be a man again.  This book will make you cry, laugh, and think about the importance of the things you hold dear. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     This book is very important. I am a graduate student and I have read this book over the last month or so. I have a PhD and have been reading a lot of research papers that are written in English. I think the main idea of this book is that, for a lot the world's populations, the language of English is a very poor choice of medium for communication, and that people are not using English because it is so good for communicating, but because it's so easy to communicate. It's a very interesting way of looking at the world, and I think this is important for anyone who is a native English speaker. This book is worth reading if you are considering a career in linguistics, or you want to learn more about language.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Book of Laughter is the best comedy book I've ever read.  If you like comedy, comedy books, comedy music, funny books, funny music, comedy comedy, funny comedy, etc, this is for you.  The Book Of Laughter: An Introduction to the Funny in Life and in Books by William Burroughs The Book of Comedy is the first book of its kind to introduce and explain the joy of comedy.  The book is based on the experiences of William Burrows, one of the great humorists of all time, and includes many of his personal anecdotes and anecdotes about funny people and funny things.   The stories are well told and the book has a humorous tone.  Burrough's humor is not a bit crass and is often quite dry.  I was a little worried that the book would be very dry, but the jokes are so funny that I was able to laugh through the dry parts.  My favorite stories are about the people who are funny at least once a day.  There are many, many more stories in this book that I found to be funny.  This book is a very nice addition to the Burrough books that I have already read. I will definitely recommend this book to my friends.

I loved how much the author took her time with this book, the story of their first time was perfect and I can see myself being so excited to read the next book.  I do have to say that it would have been a lot easier to get into this book if it was a bit shorter.  For someone like me who likes to be fast-paced, I had a hard time putting it down.  Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes romance, I loved it and I'm glad I finally got to read it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've heard many good things about this book.  It's the story of a couple who were divorced and remarried.    I also have two grown children who are now living with a stepmother.  I didn't realize the degree of stress this caused me until I read this book - which I bought off of a Goodreads friend who was doing a book club.  This book is about a couple in a difficult situation - both of whom have a lot of anger and resentment in them.  But as they try to make amends, the tensions build up between the two of them. They begin to get involved in each other's lives, and it quickly spirals out of control.  They begin sleeping with each other, then one of them begins a sexual relationship with the other - and it just gets more and more bizarre.  As they get older, they start getting in trouble with the law and each other.  It gets so bad that they decide to get a divorce.  Even though I didn.t like the book - I was happy that this was the one I picked up.  The book was written in an entertaining and non-annoying style, which makes this a book that can be read and enjoyed by anyone who likes a good story.  Highly recommended.

I would recommend this book to everyone interested in the military and history.

This book is amazing. I couldn't put it down until I finished it! I also bought a copy for my friend who was also in love with the book. She is reading it too now and she has to have it as well.    Great book. I'm not going to waste time on anything but give it five stars!   This book is really good, even though it has been translated to many languages. If you don't want to translate the book you are going to love it. I don't understand why some people don't like this book, but if you don.t care about the translation or the style it's a great read!

Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book about an amazing author. My family and I read this as a birthday gift. We have all enjoyed this book. I am very happy that I bought it and will definitely be purchasing more books from this author. -Tiffany C.  Thank you for this book! I found it fascinating and I have already reread it. I have found some very useful information on the subject and can relate to a lot of what was covered. I especially enjoyed the fact that she talks about the effect that technology has on our lives, as well as the fact she was able to relate to some of my own issues and struggles. This book was so interesting and it brought me back to my childhood. Thank you for putting together such a great book. -Jessica L. -  Thanks again for such a wonderful book! It's funny and informative. -  The most comprehensive and entertaining book about how technology affects us. -Irene G.  is a very good writer. -
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I am a big fan of the books by Mark Haddon and Cassandra Clare. They are so creative and unique. And I am very glad that there are more books like this in the works. My favourite part was the "Wishing Tree" that was just too beautiful to pass up. And it did! It was the perfect ending. *************
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I bought this book a few weeks ago and have already used all the ideas I learned from it in my own life. It's clear and to the point, so you can read it and understand the principles as they are stated. I've found myself doing things I never thought I would do, but have now found a way to do. The book really gives you a solid understanding of how you can use the concepts of your chosen craft to change the world.I have been practicing my craft for about 10 years now. I have had a very successful business since I started and am now trying to build another one. I really like the way you present this book. The author does a good job of explaining how to apply the principles to your daily life. I just wish it were more in depth and detailed. I wish it was a little shorter. It could have been even shorter, but then it would have been a waste of money.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed the book, and it was great to read about a little girl being born to a big, bad, evil man.  She was not always the best, but she grew up, and in her adult years, was a very kind person.    I think I would have liked this book a lot more if I'd been older when I was growing up.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A brilliant book about life in the modern world. This is a book about the modern mind and the modern era. It gives you a glimpse into what it means to be modern, how to be more modern, and why modern life is not as bad as you think. I don't know about you but I feel like I'm not living in the golden age anymore. I think we need to learn to live with technology in a way that we've never lived before. I'm sure some of the ideas are dated, but that's not a bad thing. I like that the book doesn't just talk about how much technology is killing us, but why it is, how it affects us, and how we can fix it. I really enjoyed this book and am hoping that it helps others to find a better life.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- If you like the book it's because it has an awesome story, and good characters. The only problem is that you could have skipped this book, since it's a book about the story. It's all about the characters, and it's not like they do anything to the plot. There's only a couple of different characters and it makes it hard to follow. There is so much action in this book. In the end I felt it was just a lot of fun, but not as good as other books I have read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It was very well written and the main character was a very nice guy. I did not like the story line that was forced into the book. The main character got an early promotion at work and had to put up with his co-workers jealousy because of it. It got really annoying.  The main character also seemed to be out of it at work for a while.   Read a positive book review:  I really liked this book, and was really impressed with the writing.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book for a class and my students loved it. It's a good basic book about the fundamentals of knitting. The pictures are good, but I would have liked a better explanation of the basic stitches used in this book. I know the pictures are for the more experienced knitter, but for a first time knitter like me, I felt like I was really lost at times. I'd like to see a more thorough explanation of stitches. It really didn't seem to be that hard to figure out. I also think the book should have a little more information on the different techniques. I've never used any of these techniques and I was kind of lost trying to figure them out. The book also has some great tutorials for specific techniques.  If you're a beginner like me and just want to learn basic stitches, I'd definitely give this a try.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********I'm a writer and I've read a lot of books in my time. I don't write often enough to know all the tricks of the trade, but this one is an excellent and useful guide to building a story. It is very good at telling the story, even though the characters are somewhat shallow, and it doesn't try to make the reader feel that there is some deep meaning to the story that you have to find out for yourself. I think that the best way to describe this book is to say that it is a good story that has been told in a very different way, and I'm happy to report that it works. It's hard to describe a good experience without making it sound too good or too bad, but the story is solid, and the ending is satisfying. I was particularly impressed with the description of the history of the war in Europe. I thought that the author gave a good description of how the story was told.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book to review because I am a fan of the TV series, but also because it is an excellent history of the world of Star Wars.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A really enjoyable book! It has all the ingredients you would expect in a good thriller: murder, sex, mystery, and a good amount of blood.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________, it's one of my favorites. I bought it because I was curious about the origins of the name. After reading the book, I realized that there's a good story behind it.   A girl is named after her father who is a professor of astronomy, and she lives on an island off the coast of Mexico. The story takes place around the time of the Spanish conquest. She and her family come from a place that has a long history of the dark side of science and politics. The main character, María Delfin, is a girl who is fascinated by a book about the ancient Mayan civilization and who becomes involved in a plot to get it for her grandfather. The plot is interesting and the story told in the book is pretty cool. However, I didn't find this book particularly compelling.   a girl named María delfin is a young girl who lives in a small village on a small island off Mexico. She's fascinated by the ancient Maya civilization and is the heir to a family with a long tradition of involvement in politics and the dark arts. The book is about the Mayan connection to astronomy, the Mayans being the ancestors of the Aztecs, and the Aztec connection to Mayan astronomy and cosmology. The characters in the story are interesting and a little more interesting than the other people in the novel.  - the characters in this book were interesting but the story was not compelling. There were a couple of interesting characters but they were not particularly compelling and they were all pretty much interchangeable. The Aztecan connection was also not particularly interesting because the Aztek were only a minor part of the story and the Mayacans were the major part of it. There was no real conflict between the characters and the reader was never really sure who was going to win the plot.   the author makes a very strong case for the Maya and Aztec connections to astronomy and the ancient world, but I think it's more compelling to argue that the Aztac, the ancient people that came to Mexico and had ties to the Mayas, came to Spain to explore the land that was now called Mexico.  These are some of the reasons I think the book was so interesting. I also like that the book has a great deal of detail about the Azts and the Maya and that this information was given in a story.  The characters in María's family were all interesting. There are a few different ones that I liked better than
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like to read about people who are smart, who are funny and who are just plain cool. I've read all sorts of books about people in a situation, but I always found them wanting. The best books I've ever read were the ones that were funny and insightful. This book is like that. The humor is really fun, the insight into people is always helpful, and the advice is always good. I'm not sure if I'm the only person who reads this book and has a lot of fun reading it, but the book really hit the spot with me.   There are a few things that are kind of hard to get your head around:  - How does a person get a job in the music industry without a degree?  -"I have never heard anyone who's really been in the business say anything bad about it. There are a lot more crappy people out there than good ones."  —"The people who don't get the music thing are the ones who aren't into music, and have never done it. They can't really get into it. You know what they're really into? A good time." ,—"I was just sitting in the parking lot one day and someone asked me if I wanted to make some money, and I was like, "Why, how? How do you make money? It's like being in an acting class. You go in there and get some work, and you make a few bucks. It's not like I want to make a ton of money."  to the point that, "Well, maybe I could go to the other side of the city."   But then the book goes on to describe how he got his gig.   the way the book starts out is a little bit strange, but it does work and it is interesting.   in my experience, it's best to start off a book like this by reading the first chapter. If you don't have a good idea of what you want to get out of the book, then you may want to read it slowly so you get a feel for what the book is about.   The first few chapters are very descriptive and kind of interesting. I was kind of worried about this book not being a real autobiography, because it was pretty much just the author telling us about the past.  - How did you decide to write a book about your life and how did you come up with the story about how you started a band

Write a positive review about a good book:  A great read and the author is a really good writer.  This is the first book in a series that I really like.  In my opinion, the story takes place in a world with a very different view of human nature than what is in the movie.    In this world, humans can only control their emotions and in doing so become much more violent and cruel.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** This is a very interesting and useful book that will provide you with a much needed perspective on what we know about the physical causes of the Universe. It's a very concise, well-written book that doesn't take you to the edge of your seat, but instead provides you with an overview of what we have discovered about the Universe so far and what we can expect in the future. The author is very engaging and you really get a sense of what he is trying to do with this book. This book has a lot of good information and is a good introduction to cosmology for those who want to get into the subject, but who are not yet confident in their knowledge. ******
Write a positive review about a good book: ---------------This is a good, long read. It is a bit of a departure from the previous books I've read, which is a pity. The book starts with a brief description of the world, which I thought was a nice change of pace, especially given the fact that it was the first time I'd ever read about a world this big. The worldbuilding was very well done, I found that the author was very descriptive, and that he did an excellent job at portraying the various races and cultures that the world has to offer. As for the plot, it was really a mix of good and bad. The bad parts are mostly due to the fact there were a lot of holes in the story. Some of the characters are not explained at all, there are a lot plot holes that are only vaguely explained and the ending left a lot to be desired. The good parts were the part that were explained, and the parts that weren't. There were also some really cool moments in the book that were very entertaining. Overall, I think the book is good, and I think it is worth reading if you are a fan of the setting, but you should probably not expect much from it.

I will be recommending this book to friends and family as a great introduction to photography and the hobby.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book and it had some good stories about a lot of different people.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "Dreadful, dark and bloody, but a hell of a good read." My thoughts on this book: The plot is well thought out, and the world that the author created for this world is quite rich. The world of the novel is also one that I would like to see more of, as this is a world where the Dark Ones are just a tiny bit more evil than the other races. The way the Dark One society works is quite interesting, and I would have liked to see this world in a novel form in the future. The world building is also quite well done, and there is a lot of detail in this world that I think I missed the first time around. This is a really dark fantasy book, and it definitely makes me want to pick up the next book in the series. This book definitely makes up for the first book in a series, but I don't know if I want to continue reading the series or not, as I would rather read something new. I am not a fan of horror or fantasy books, but this book is well written and I definitely enjoyed it. I do think that the world of this book could have been fleshed out a little more, but that is just my opinion, and that is my opinion on this novel. I will definitely pick up a second book in this series in the near future.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. It is also very, very long, at 884 pages. It has an excellent summary by the author. It also has some good and some not so good sections. The good parts are the sections on the "why" of human consciousness, the different ways consciousness can be described and explained, and the "how" of how consciousness arises. The not so nice parts are mostly about how it has been investigated over the years, and why it is hard to test. It seems like there has been so much wasted effort and money trying to explain how consciousness emerges, and so little effort put into figuring out why it happens. If you are interested in trying to understand consciousness, this book is a great place to start.

I really like the story line, I like the world and I like that there is something to keep reading. The only thing that bugs me about the story is that I couldn't help but think of the old joke about the man in the orange suit. When the guy walks into a bar, everyone goes "He's got the mustache of a mohawk!" I didn't find the joke funny at all, but I like to think it is a good one. The story line was good too. I did enjoy the world building and the character development. It was a good start to the series.
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________   The first time I read this book, I was just as confused as the author about what was going on.   In the opening paragraphs, he says:   I have no idea what's going on here. But I am going to take my time to figure it out.   a lot of the writing was very confusing to me.   (My only complaint is that it takes the reader about a third of the way through the book to figure out what is going on.)   He talks about how the Bible is the one true source of truth. Well, I guess I was thinking it was the one and only true source for truth. If he says it's the one truth, then why is it not a truth? Why is it a book that has errors? He said that the author is a "conservative evangelical".   Now he tells us about his "conversion" to the Lord Jesus Christ. Well... I guess he has a conversion. He had no clue that he was a "convert". But, he went to church and the "Christian" preacher told him that it is the truth. So, he had a conversion! Well, not a real conversion. I'm talking about a conversion to the Christian religion.   the whole book is filled with these kinds of "conversions".  , and he ends up having the most ridiculous and nonsensical "converted" chapters in his life. I really wanted to hate this book. But, I have to admit that I enjoyed it. I think it's good to know the truth, and I think that most Christians do know the Truth. I would have rather seen a Christian who knew the Truth, rather than a Christian trying to "con" the rest of us.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book! It is a fun read, with lots of interesting characters, and the plot was very engaging.  I especially loved how it is about the struggles of a young girl trying to get to college. The author, Rachel Cusk, does a great job of capturing the spirit of the characters in a fun, modern way. I loved the fact that she takes a good look at the hardships of the past and shows them to us through a lens of the present.  This book is well worth the read and I look forward to future books in the series. 
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I have been trying to finish a long-running series of books about the history of the Roman Republic and of the rise and fall of the Western Roman Empire. It has been a long time since I have had the chance to do so. The series has a rich history and is well written. I was not disappointed. I enjoyed the history, the characters, and the intrigue. I also enjoyed the action scenes.   The book is divided into two parts. The first part covers the early days of the Republic when Rome had not yet become the great power it would become, and was a weak and vulnerable state. The second part covers Roman history through the end of the republic and the early years of the Empire. There are several points in between that are not included in this book, but I do recommend that you read the book to get the full picture of Roman history.   "It is very difficult to tell the story of Rome without a large part of the story being lost. The Empire, as a great political and cultural force, is one of the greatest inventions in human history. Rome was a nation of immigrants, an army of conquerors, a society that had no conception of what the word 'culture' meant."   I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history, or history of anything, for that matter.   in summary: ---------------A fascinating and informative book about a great civilization that existed in the late Roman Empire and the rise of the West Roman Empire in the 1st and 2nd centuries.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________________ This is the book that is going to change the way I look at the world and I am so excited about it.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I loved this book. It is a great read. The writing is not only descriptive, but it also makes the story exciting and exciting. It has a lot of suspense and I was constantly wondering what will happen next. I am looking forward to the sequel. It will be hard to put down. The only thing I would change is a little of the description could be a bit more realistic. But, I still love it! -------------------------- This book is about the search for the lost child in the city of Leningrad during the war. A little boy, named Vasili, who had been living with his uncle and aunt, goes missing in the middle of the night. He is found, but after that the story really starts. The main character Vasili is very likable. He has a love for music, he is a bit goofy but has a very good heart. I was interested to find out more about his life as the story progressed. The first half of the book is mostly the search and rescue, as he searches for his uncle's body. This is when I felt like the book was going to be a little slow. But it all picks up with the second half. This book also deals with family, and it is interesting. There is a lot about how family can be divided into good and bad, but that is not what makes the book good. This novel is about love, and friendship. It deals with loss and grief, but I found it was the friendship that really got me to read it. It was very moving and heart warming. The characters were very lik able, and I think that's why it is so good. --------------------------- I loved how the story moved along. It really felt like it was getting better and better. I loved the characters and I loved that the characters' relationship was very well done. The world building was very good as well. I thought it was very interesting how it was all done. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes good literature.

We have read other books about what to do in the event of a zombie apocalypse. This book is much more practical and realistic than most. My kids learned how to take care of themselves, make sure the family stays safe and how to survive the elements in a post-apocalyptic world.    A really good book about zombies:  This book has lots of useful information about what a zombie is, and how it moves around in the world. The author uses a lot of interesting facts about zombies to show the difference between real zombies and zombie movies, which are made to look more realistic. There are a lot more zombies in this book than in most zombie movies. I highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________. I'm not sure if I'm going to keep up with the series, but I liked this one. It was entertaining and had a good story. There were some flaws, but for the most part I enjoyed this one and will likely pick up the next book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so good that I couldn't resist giving it a full 5 stars. I just wish I'd have read it earlier! The book is about a man who gets his life back, and his wife is able to go on with her life, but she is depressed because she has to deal with the fact that their son is in a mental institution, and he isn't there to look after her. She has a lot of questions about her life before the accident and what really happened. It is a real, touching book that has been highly recommended to me by a lot other people I know.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I just had a wonderful time. I am a huge fan of both science and fantasy books.  It was a good choice and well worth the price.  I can't wait to read the next book.  The story is a bit slow but not frustrating, and the characters were very well drawn.  My only complaint is the author's style is a little rough, but that's the only complaint I have.  A very good book!"

This book is a great book for those who are looking for a well written fantasy book."
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I really liked this book. I am a big fan of the old school fantasy. There is a lot of nostalgia in this book, but I think it works well. I also found it interesting that the author went with a more modern setting. I don't know if that is what he was going for, but it worked out very well. The author does a great job of making the characters come to life. The characters have different backgrounds, and the author does an excellent job of giving them different personalities. The main character is a former mage who was thrown out of the guild and made a mercenary. The mercenary life didn't take very well to him, but he did make a good living. He has a good sense of humor, which is refreshing. The book is filled with action, adventure, and humor. I like the idea of the author trying to keep the book from getting too serious. I can't wait to read more books from him. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I don`t know if it is possible to write a good fantasy book with only five main characters. If you want more characters, I suggest you pick up the sequels. If the author keeps writing more books, he could write a series on how to write good fantasy books.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book! I read it in a week or so, and I thought it was a really fun book to read, though I'm not sure why. I did enjoy it. I also liked the fact that it is in the form of a letter. I like that I didn't have to worry about going to the library to look up the meaning of the words. I don't know why it is, but I always remember to look them up. If you're interested in poetry, I suggest you give this a read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It was really well written, and was enjoyable for me. I love the way that it is set up. It doesn't start with the typical 'hero goes up against a bad guy', but it starts with 'hero fights bad guy' and keeps going, and this makes it a great adventure story.  The characters all have their own little things to bring to the table, but they're all written well enough that you don't really feel like they're just 'wasting' their time.  I really loved the art, too!    I just wanted to buy this book and read it right away! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A good story that is worth reading."   Read this book for all the adventure, and to learn about how you can build a better life for yourself.

Write a positive review about a good book: ************* The book is well written, well presented and has a lot of good information about the topics covered. *********** The information presented is factual and accurate. ************ The book contains a lot more than the average "how to" manual and can be very useful to someone who wants to learn more about the subject. ********************* I can see this book being useful for someone who is already a proficient programmer but who is looking to broaden their knowledge and skillset.  The book does a good job of covering the basics but covers them in a way that is easy to understand and understandable.  An interesting perspective of the subject that is presented in a readable manner:  There is a lot to read in this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "I was extremely pleased to discover that a well researched, well written and very accessible book has been produced about the history of science and the development of modern scientific thinking." "I loved the book." I have to say that the book was very well researched and a well written book.  The book was written in a way that is easy to understand, yet the subject matter is quite complex.  There is an interesting chapter about Darwin's theory of evolution that I did not have the time to read yet, but will certainly enjoy reading.  The chapters that I enjoyed the most were those about the development in the sciences of the period between the beginning of the Renaissance and the time of the Reformation. This book is a wonderful read and I look forward to reading the rest of the books that this author has written.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book for an easy and pleasant read, as well as for kids! My son and I both enjoyed the book and the way it was written. It is a very well written book, and a great read for a child!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished this book and loved it. The main character was the only character that didn't seem a bit crazy. It didn't take long for the reader to start to believe that this is a normal person. I like to read about the characters, so this book was a great read.  It was funny at times, but also very sad at times. I was sad when I found out that he was sick.  This book was great:   This book was very fun. I am so glad that I read this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the style and thoughtfulness of this book. It was a good read, but I had a lot of trouble getting into the story.  In a lot of cases, the story felt so contrived, that I felt like I was just reading a book to pass the time.   The plot is interesting, but the characters were too one note.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The book was excellent and I was very pleased with all of the information I received about the origins of our ancestors and the people that are descended from them. The book is in three parts. The first part of the book provides a summary of the archaeological evidence and a general description of the people and their culture. The second part of this book provides information about the people, their customs and history, and their connection to the peoples of Africa and Europe. The third part of chapter three focuses on the actual evidence of human origins and the conclusions drawn from this evidence. The main conclusion that the author reaches in the third part is that the genetic evidence points to the African origin of the Native Americans, the Caucasians, the Mongolians, and the Australians as the likely cause of the origin of our species. This is an important point, but it is only part of a larger story. I was also very interested in the second part that discusses the connection of the American Indians to the Mongolian and Aboriginal people. I thought that this part was very well done. I will continue to review the book as I read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have had this book for a long time and now I have finally finished it. It has a great story line and it's a good read. It's a great adventure.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Good Earth  is an excellent book on the subject of ecological disaster, one that I would highly recommend.  I enjoyed this book immensely and found it to be a thorough and thought-provoking read.  This is my second book by Michael Pollan.   He writes quite well.  His writing is not at all preachy, however.  He is just as interested in the science behind ecological disaster as he is the science itself.  The Good Earth is a must read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the book very interesting and educational. I learned about how the American government has been using "false flag" terror attacks to justify the creation of the TSA and how this program is a big part of the War on Terror.   This is a very timely book. I hope to see a new edition that gives more information about how this is all going to end. The information in this book is definitely timely. I also recommend the book to people who are considering going into government work.  ... a must read book..

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book is a very well-written, entertaining account of how the Nazis used'scientific' methods to kill millions of people by using poisons, gas chambers and exterminations.  There is much information about the actual gassing procedures and the chemical agents used.  The author provides very accurate descriptions of the chemicals and what they were used for." -Dr. David M.

Soloveichik, Rabbi Emeritus of the Simon Wiesenthal Center "If anyone has read any of the previous works on the Nazi gas chambers, they would recognize that Dr. Ziemke's book is in the same vein.  It provides a complete description of the Nazi gassing procedure in a manner that is thorough, accurate, and detailed.  A must-read for anyone who is interested in this subject." -Arthur Butz, Ph., Professor of History, University at Albany "It is a fascinating and important book.  In addition to the gassing techniques used, Dr. Zei-Man is able to provide an overview of the chemical aspects of gas chambers.  His knowledge of the subject is remarkable." -David C.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good read for the history buffs, the military types, and the general history lover. I loved the military aspect of the book as I'm a huge military buff. I also really enjoyed reading about the Battle of the Bulge and the American's attempts to break the Germans at the beginning of World War II.  It was good to hear from the German side of things. I'm glad I got to know the people and the experiences in the book.  Posted by A.B. at 2:59 AM
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book while I was trying to come to terms with the fact that my girlfriend, who I was about to marry, had been cheating on me with my best friend for almost three years.  This book was very helpful in getting over that fear and in realizing how I was not crazy or a bad person for being afraid of this.  I had to read a few reviews before I bought it because I was afraid of buying a book about cheating and was also concerned that I would be offended if I read it.   The book was not offensive and it was very factual.  I did not have any problem with it. I will definitely be recommending this book to my friends. 
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________ [I had just finished reading the book when I received this email.] I am a big fan of the book and it's been on my "to read" list for a while. I am very pleased with how this book turned out. The style of writing is very easy to follow, and the information was extremely helpful. I'm not an expert in this field but the information is still very helpful. The best part is that it's a simple book with very few numbers and very simple explanations. It's a great way to learn the basics of an area that I've never even heard of. The book is easy to understand but there is also lots of info that is useful even for someone like me who has never studied a single thing about this area. This book is definitely worth every penny and I'm glad I bought it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think this book is a very good read. I can see how people can be very picky about the books they read. But for me, the story and characters are very good and this book made me laugh out loud. It's a fun book and I can't wait to read the next one!
Write a positive review about a good book:  The New Atheism is a bad book. It is full of bad arguments and bad arguments that are not even good. I was shocked that the author would claim that the best arguments against religion in general and Islam in particular are those made by atheists, as though the authors had not been in contact with people of all faiths who disagree with them.  The book is filled with so many mistakes that I would never even give it a grade.  A bad book, I have to agree.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must have for those who have ever wanted to learn to play the piano.  It covers a very wide array of music theory concepts that will get you through the first few lessons.   I've been using this book with my students for a couple years and I still love it.  I recommend it to anyone who has ever wanted a solid understanding of music and piano. I would recommend this book to any student of music for the above reasons:  It is easy to understand  There are a large number of exercises that you can use to reinforce your new knowledge  The author gives you good advice and provides exercises that are specific to the subject  If you are interested in learning more about music theory and would like to see more in depth articles about music analysis, then you should definitely try this book out.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "One of the best books I've ever read."  -J. R. Raulston.  For those who don't know who J.R.R., he is the author of the Hugo-winning novel "Dune."  "I have to admit that I had never heard of him, but it turns out that he's an old friend. His 'Dune' novels are among my favorites, and his short stories are a particular delight."   "... a novel that's like nothing you've ever seen before..."   I don't think I'll ever get tired of reading about this one... "A thrilling tale of a woman who discovers the power of the dark side...   ...the author is a master of the genre..."  "This is one of those books that just takes you on a wild ride."  "If you are a fan of science fiction or fantasy, you must read this book!"  I know that this is the first time that I am reviewing a novel by J. R Raulstin. I've been reading a lot of sci-fi lately and I had been looking forward to this book, but I just wasn't sure how much I'd enjoy it. I think that the book was pretty good, though. I'm not too fond of the characters, but that's the way I like it. This book is written in third person, and it is very descriptive. I thought that this helped the story a lot. I would say that it is one that I would recommend. The characters are interesting and I like the writing style. This is a very interesting read, but the story is very slow. I found myself wondering why I would read another book in the series. I ended up finishing the book, though, because it was very good.  The book was a nice mixture of science-fiction and fantasy. I liked that the story was slow and the world was interesting. I will have to read the next book, "Dhalgren," because I am curious to see what will happen. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an awesome book. I got a hardcover copy in exchange for an honest review. I liked it a lot, and I'm glad I read it. I'm now looking for a copy for myself, and will update with my thoughts if and when I do.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ I had this book in my wishlist, and I am happy to say that I have bought it. This is a fun story about a girl who gets a ride from a strange guy on a bus in New York City. After a long wait she finally gets a seat and he goes on a rambling rant about how much he loves her. At one point he mentions that he used to be in the army, which makes her realize that he probably did something crazy like blow his brains out. The story doesn't really take off until she gets on the bus, and even then the story is not as great as it should be. The author has a habit of writing stories that are very dark. The tone of the story has a lot of darkness and even a bit of horror to it. As for the book itself, the story and the characters were pretty good. The book is very light hearted, and the way it is written makes the story very fun to read. The ending is really well done, and it's really cool that he uses the fact that he is still in the military to keep the story light heartened. The reason I gave this a 5 star is that I really loved this book. It had some good parts and the author really knows how to write a story. __________________________________________  Good read! A good, interesting story. A good ending. Overall a good read. I will definitely read more books by the author! _______________________________________

Write a positive review about a good book:     I really liked this book, it's easy to read, but has a lot of information and is written in a logical way. I think that it's the most comprehensive book about the subject, and it's also the one that I used most often when I was learning about this topic. I like the chapter on the origin of the word "psychiatrist". It's an interesting explanation that I think is important for the layman.   It would be really great if they would include a chapter on "how to get an appointment with a psychiatrist" or "how much do psychiatrists charge" because they're both important topics to understand and I didn't know about it.

Write a positive review about a good book: ***********A VERY STRONG LITTLE BOOK!! This book is a classic! It is the best book I have ever read about being a "real" Christian and growing up in a very anti-Christian home. This is a great book to get kids started on their faith journey. It is full of life lessons, and is about being an adult too. I love that this book is about "God's Word", which is what God's children should be reading from their young ages. The "WORD" is there to guide and protect us as we grow. It also talks about how we should treat others as we expect to be treated, but more importantly, what Jesus taught. If you are looking for a book that talks about what Jesus teaches, and why it is the "right" way, then this is a GREAT BOOK!!
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ This is a great book. The illustrations are gorgeous and the book is very informative and entertaining. This is the best book on the subject I've read. It's about a book that got a lot of press and is now in a series and the publisher has taken the time to go through the old reviews to find the good stuff and it's great. __________  Read the next section from the author of The Art of the Man, and I agree with all of the positive reviews. The book is excellent, well-researched and well-written. If you want to learn about the art of making books, this is the book. This book is one of the best I have ever read. If I were a publisher, I would buy this book for every book that's currently in print.  This book is not an encyclopedia, nor a manual of craftsmanship. It is a book of ideas that you can use as a base to make your own book. It was an enjoyable read, with many interesting points that you will want to read about in a book about books. I enjoyed it very much. :)  :D  Buy The Art Of The Man  (2.5 stars) .
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I found this book useful in the long run as a good read about learning to be able to understand English grammar and the way that a lot of people who speak English are learning English. It covers the basics, such as: vocabulary, structure, spelling, and grammar. It is easy to understand and the grammar is quite clear and concise. There are a few chapters that don't give much background on a lot, but the ones that do are really helpful. I have been learning English for a year and a half, but I've had to stop for a while as I have had to deal with the constant changes in vocabulary and spelling. I can now read English again and have a solid grasp on what is going on in my sentences. The book gives some good examples of how to use the book. There is one or two grammar/spelling errors, but those are easily fixed. Overall a great resource for people who want to start learning English grammar or want to learn about how to write in English. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how to learn English grammar.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book in one sitting and I enjoyed every moment of it.  This book is great for anyone who wants to be informed and have an accurate view of what it is like to live in a culture that is dominated by men and women who have been brainwashed to think their way is the correct way and not a way that promotes equality, social justice, or women's rights.    It is a must read for anyone with an interest in the subject matter, the history, and the way people who think like you think today. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I've read this book several times, but I have yet to enjoy it as much as I did the first time around. I don't have any issue with the story itself, it's just a little disappointing to see it take the shape it did. The plot was pretty interesting and the characters were enjoyable to read about, but it all fell flat as a result of a lack of development. I've seen this book listed as a "love story" by some people, but that's just not what I got out of it. I enjoyed it, but wasn't really impressed with it.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ The first part of this book is about how the United States is currently experiencing an "epidemic" of false memory syndrome, with hundreds of cases being reported each year. The second part is the author's experience with the disease, and what led him to create a "diagnostic system" that can help others in similar situations. The third part is a series of exercises to help others deal with the fear, anxiety, and depression that come from having false memories. The final part, though, is the most important, in my opinion, in that it lays out what it means to be human. The authors write: _____________________ ______________________ Our human nature has its own natural set of instincts. We have been taught to fight and flee, to run away or to kill. Our instinctive survival instincts are not our only instincts, however. Human nature also has its "superior" instincts. For some, this instinct is to live in harmony with nature and to be good to one another. For others, it is to be the hunter and the prey, to be dominant and to have power. These instincts are as natural to humans as our instincts of survival are to animals. Some of us are born to be strong and strong-willed, to kill and to die. Others are born weak and frail, to live, love, and die. Some are born the victim of a horrible accident, and others are born victims of sexual abuse. But all humans have instincts. Some humans are naturally good, and some are naturally bad. But when we are born, the instinct that we are genetically programmed with is to make our way in this world. It is to survive. It's to get as much as we can out of it. It makes sense, really. If a human had no instinct to survive, he or she would die, because there would be no point to living. But because we have an instinct to be alive, we try to do it all. We try to get the most out of this world we can, and we make the best of it by striving to be as good as we possibly can be. This is our human nature. It does not make us "bad" or "evil" in any way. It simply is what we are, and the most we can do is use it. ______________
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* This is a great book. I am always amazed at how many times I have been exposed to a great example of one of the most important skills of the human mind: reading. I learned so much from this book and the fact that the author went into the story of the story in such depth made it even more rewarding. I hope I can pass on this book to as many people as I can!
Write a positive review about a good book: ************* I am a huge fan of all the Stephen King books. This one is definitely one of the best. I enjoyed the ending. I am currently working on my own horror series, so it was nice to have this in my library. It took me awhile to get into the book, but I got through it. The characters were interesting. There were many twists and turns. It had an original idea. It was also funny. I did like the book. It did not get the 5 star rating because it did not make me laugh as much as I wanted to. However, the ending was good, and I loved the characters and plot. I will definitely be picking this up. It is a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have to say I really enjoyed this book. It was easy to follow and it had lots of interesting things to say about the human psyche. I especially enjoyed the discussion of the difference between "mindfulness" and "relaxation" and how that distinction can be used in a very effective way to help you deal with everyday stress. One of my most read books of the year:   As I read through the first few chapters I started to see the connection between the different types of meditation and the various ways in which they can help to improve your life. I am also really interested in the way that Buddhism teaches that we should take our mind and emotions in to our own hands and work on them, rather than putting them in to the hands of someone else.   I think this is very much the point of mindfulness, that it allows you to work on yourself.  I have also been reading a lot about neuroplasticity and how it affects our thoughts and emotions.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I found myself looking forward to reading this book for several reasons. I'm a huge fan of John Green's books and I thought this one would be interesting. I really enjoyed the way that he portrayed the characters and how they reacted to events. The characters are just fun to read about and the events that occur seem to make sense as the story develops. I especially loved how he depicted the relationship between Violet and her mother. The way that they dealt with their problems seemed to be real and realistic. I would definitely recommend this book to any of my friends. It's very good and will definitely be read.  The next review is by: ***************  "This book is a wonderful experience for those who love fantasy and all things that are fantastical. It is also an excellent book for those with an interest in literature, psychology and psychology of love. It will also be a great book for children as well as adults who are interested in the same."  *****  Thank you for the kind words. I appreciate them.   In the past few years, I have read about a number of books that have been written about the life of Violet Beauregarde. I have been amazed at the amount of information about her that has been uncovered over the years. However, there was one book that I was unable to get my hands on. The book that was supposed to be the first book in a series titled "The Story of Violet", I have not read. However in this review, I am going to tell you about it. I do not want you to feel like you have to have the first two books in order to understand this book, because I know that I will have a hard time doing that. However this book is the beginning of the series and the second book in the series is a sequel. Therefore, if you are looking for a good story about a young girl who loves to read and love to write and who loves the outdoors, then this book will be just what you are searching for.   The story is told through the eyes of Violet's older sister, Joelle. Joelle is a child who lives with her father in a small, very conservative town in New York State. Violet is one of her older sister's only friends and the two often fight over her. Violet often makes fun of Joelle's lack of books and her dislike of other people. Violet's father is not very fond of Joceles book choices

This book is very good and the subject matter is very interesting. It is very different from my experience but I am not going to say that is bad. I highly recommend this book to those with a passion for psychology or for anyone who is looking for an overview of psychoanalytic thinking in relation to the human psyche. I look forward to reading more from this author.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________   "A must read, if only to help you understand why I am in such good physical shape and why I don't have the dreaded "hobbit gene" like the rest of the kids in my class. It will also give you some insight as to what your body needs, especially since you've recently started working out."   -David G.   Read an awesome review by someone who knows exactly what you are talking about: _________________________   The book has a ton of great information about nutrition, exercise, and supplementation.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________ It's funny that I've never actually read any of her novels, but this is really the first one I've read in ages. I've always enjoyed the ones I've already read, but I thought this one was a bit more than just an exercise in writing. I was not disappointed! I'd definitely read the others!

If you like politics, I'm sure you will like this book." -Paul G. "I was surprised that I enjoyed this book so much.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________, and I think this book will be one that will be highly valued by my students and I in the future.  I was so impressed by the ease of this book and how quickly I got to the point and how it really made me think about all the different ways in which people may have different levels of success with their lives. I liked it a lot, and it is definitely worth the $4.99 price tag!  Review by: A. S. from California on Jan. 13, 2015 :  This book is so valuable, it will be in my permanent library for sure. It is also helpful because of the "teaching style" of using a real life example that is a step above the typical academic paper on the topic.  and the fact that the author has a PhD is just icing on the cake.  of the author's personality and how she has taken it upon herself to do some good in the world, I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________ Thank you for a very helpful book. I was so pleased when I discovered this book on my own. I bought the Kindle edition so I could read it on my iPad, and I'm glad I did. I have had the book since it was first published in 1999, and my copy is well worth its weight in gold. ______________________________ I'm really looking forward to reading your book about your time in the Church. ______________________ I've been reading your blog for a few months now and I really enjoy it. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think you are right in a lot of things you say. __________________________________________________ So, what did you think? Is this a great book or is it just a bunch of old hat, old wives tales that no one should really care about? I know I'm a little late to the party but this is the kind of book that I can look back on as something I've had on my bookshelf for a long time and not be embarrassed by. I've seen the author's name on the cover and I like it a lot. I wish you could put a cover on it. __________
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book back in the 90's and loved it. It was one of my favorite children's books and still is. The story is very simple but very well told.  The only complaint I had about the story was that I wish the book was more in-depth. I'm sure it was the author's intention to go into more detail but that would've added to the readability of the story. Overall, a great story and I'm glad I read it!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was really surprised by this book.  It's an amazing look at a man's life and a wonderful look at what it means to be human.  I enjoyed the book immensely, and was glad to read about it because I have a love for science and this book was very interesting.  I really hope to see more books like this.   This is a great book and a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book will give you a good grounding on the subject and a good foundation to start from.  If you like the subject, this is a good one to read and if you don't like the topic, it may help you understand the subject better and get more into it.  If you are interested in the topic of "Aesthetics and Art" or "The Psychology of Art" this is not the book for you.    This book is a bit of a slog.  This book will be a good introductory book for a non-professional.  If you want to get into a deeper look into the subject matter of "Art" it would be better to read one of the books listed below. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* This book is awesome. I am an avid listener of the podcast and this book is a great read. It is also a great book to keep on the bedside table. It's a bit short at 533 pages but I'm not the type of person to read all of my books at once, so I'll have to give it a shot in the near future. The writing style is perfect and the descriptions are perfect. I love this book.   Overall: **** This book was absolutely perfect and I was so happy to read it. I'm glad that I purchased it, because I am looking forward to reading more of the podcasts.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- My daughter and I really enjoyed this book. I think the main thing that I liked about it was the use of humor and being a bit naughty. My daughter loved the stories about the animals and was really excited to see what else the book had to offer. The story about the fox and the owl is really a great one and the rest of the books were also very good. Overall, a good read for the kids and also the parents of the younger children. I will definitely read more of the other books.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________ "I've always been a huge fan of this author, especially her writing. Her characters are very well drawn, even if they have no idea of the true nature of the world around them. The setting is believable and the story has a lot of action. I would recommend this book to anyone, even non-fantasy fans." --Jessica P., USA "This book has all the ingredients of a classic fantasy novel: The magic, the evil empire, the brave heroes who take a stand against the evil. The book is a good read, and if you're looking for a good, classic fantasy story, look no further." --Derek S., USA
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________ My first "adult" book, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was a great experience, even though I wasn't really a huge fan of the book. I liked the story of how Bilbo got the ring. I also liked the way that Tolkien's work made it so the Hobbit felt more like an adventure than a story. The book was not very long and it was well-written, although the book had a lot of characters. I felt like the story wasn't as exciting as it could have been. However, I am glad I read it because I really enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good read. A little confusing at times, but that is because the author is trying to give you as much information as possible. I like the characters and their relationship. They are likable, although you have to admit that they are not perfect. The author does a good job of explaining their problems and how to solve them. There are also a few humorous passages that really made this a good little read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Dreaded World: The End of the American Dream, by Thomas Frank, is an excellent look at the end of an era, the end result of a great deal of change in American politics over the last generation.  Frank's book is a well-researched and well-reported history, and the book is very good. __________________________________________________________ The best books for anyone who wants to know what it's like to be alive right now: I don't read a lot of books, but I did read this book by  Mark Sagoff  and I was shocked by what he said.    He talks about the new technology, the change in the economy, and how much the changes are affecting the people.  He shows how people are living more and more isolated lives, and it's affecting the way people live.  This book is also a very good reminder to always remember who you are, and to always be grateful for who you have.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ (this is not a review)  by A.K. from California on February 25, 2012 I was just looking for something to do on a lazy weekend morning, but I didn't want to leave the house. I read the book. I'm a bit of a book snob, so I knew there was some stuff I would hate. I've seen it on a few Goodreads and Amazon. But I had to read it anyway. I liked it a lot. I think it has more in common with my favorite books of all time than the typical modern fiction that I read. The book has a lot of action, but also is filled with humor and a touch of heart. I'll admit I laughed at the jokes, but that's a good thing. I was really surprised by the depth of the characters, their motivations, and the complexity of their relationships. It's a really good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book a lot and I have a lot of fun reading it. The main character was likable and a lot to like. The book was a good read but not much that was original. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a must-read. I've read about a dozen books on the subject, and this one stands out for its clarity and its detailed account of the origins of the current dispute between Russia and the US. I think it is a well-researched book that makes some useful observations about what is really going on here, and I highly recommend it.   —Kirk Sorensen, author of "Why the West is Wrong About the Soviet Union"

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ I recently finished the book "The Power of Positive Thinking" by Robert Waggoner. I am a student of the New Testament, and Waggonner's work on the New Testaments is invaluable. I have been trying to get my students to understand the importance of the Bible, but they are more interested in science than the Bible. I wanted to see the connection between the Old Testament and the New. Waggoning's book is a great guide to understanding this link, and it will open your eyes to the Bible as well. I can't wait to read more. - A. R. T. R., Ohio  Review of "The New Testament and its Interpretation" by A. A. Hodge: I was reading this book and found it very interesting. In my opinion, it's a good and useful book. It is good to see a non-Newtonian view of the Christian life presented so that the believer can have a better view. I'm also glad that this book deals with the problems of the NT, and that the author is a Christian. If you're interested in the NT in terms of its interpretation, this book is well worth your time. - D. F.  "The New Testamentalist and the Problem of Evil" by George F. Hickenlooper: This is a book that really helped me get my Christian faith back. I've always been a strong believer in the biblical doctrine of evil, but my faith had been broken by my own thinking about it. In fact, I've tried many times to believe in a loving God, but I just couldn't see the goodness in a god who would permit such evil in the world. It's not so much a "problem of evil" as it is a problem of faith. It was only after reading this work that I could understand that the Bible's teaching of a loving and just God was true. In the end, it was a simple, but profound, realization that brought a lot of healing to my own soul. This book is very helpful and I highly recommend it to anyone who has had a similar experience. - T. C. W., Oregon  I have enjoyed this book very much. I hope that it helps others understand the nature of God. I think the author has a good point of view. - S. G.  and A. P.  a great book, a great understanding of how the bible really is.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book on the subject that I've ever read. It explains the basics of the subject in a clear and understandable way. I love that it's not just a review of the theory but also a real life example of how it's done.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ My wife and I read this book together, and while it is not as funny as some of the other books in the series (I was expecting the funny part to be in the last one) I really enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the way the author wrote the stories, it was really easy to follow, and I could tell he had a lot of fun writing them. The characters were interesting, and each one had their own quirks and quirks that made me laugh out loud. This was one of the funniest books I've read in a long time.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** My son is only 2 but already he loves the book! I am really pleased with the fact that he has a good sense of humour. I am very impressed that he already knows that the book is about the animals. The animals were just the right size for him and he was very entertained. The stories and illustrations were a nice touch and really made the book a very good one. **********  The book is just wonderful. I can't wait to read it again. *********************  Thank you for a wonderful book. I really enjoyed it. **************  and a Happy Halloween!
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The book is a wonderful reminder of how good it feels to love a family."  -  http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... What I didn't like:     It's a short story that can get a bit slow, so if you've already read the whole series then I'd recommend getting through the entire series first. Recommendation:   I can't recommend it enough, but you need to read the entire book to fully appreciate it.  And it's only $1!  Check it out!
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a gem, a must-have for all of the serious science and physics students out there.   It contains lots of facts and figures, but the presentation is clear and concise.   the author does a good job of explaining some of the basics of physics, including how the universe is expanding and how light is scattered as it passes through matter. The author also gives a nice review of the standard model of physics. It is clear from the discussion that he is in the "theory of everything" camp and is a fan of Einstein's general theory of relativity.   was a little disappointed to see that there were no references to the book in the textbook. The information is definitely there, but it was not listed in the introduction. I did not find that to be a problem.     The book is not for the beginner, but I would give it a 5/5.   and is recommended to all high school physics students.

It is filled with useful and fun facts and it is a pleasure to read." - BK
Write a positive review about a good book:  "Dante is a good example of a gifted young man who is not afraid to admit to his mistakes and who is willing to work with the powers that be to change the world." "Danté has always had a knack for writing about the everyday, but his latest book, I Am Here, is perhaps his most affecting yet." I Am Here by Danté is a story of an African American man who moves to the United States in the mid 1970's. A series of events takes place that leave him deeply troubled and a little crazy. It's a great read about a man who's trying to make sense of the world around him. I also enjoyed this story because it was so well written. I loved how it was told. I found it a little slow at the beginning, but the author managed to keep the pace up throughout the book. I thought it was a very well written story. I'm not sure why Dant is such a popular author, but I can see why. He writes about a lot of issues that people might be interested in. I'm glad that I found this book, and I'm happy that I read this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________________ I read this book on the recommendation of my sister-in-law and I had a great time. It is well written and very informative. This book gave me the basic idea of how a woman feels about a man and how she reacts to the various things that go on around her. I am glad I bought it. It has many good ideas and was a nice change of pace from the other books I have read about women.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I just finished reading it last night. I have had this book on my list for a while and I finally bought it. I really enjoyed this book, the characters were interesting and interesting people, the world building was very well done, the plot was well thought out and was very satisfying. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good urban fantasy novel and who also enjoys good character development.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was really excited about this book. I have been wanting to read a book on how to use the Epson Photo Paper printer for a long time.   Epson's website was very helpful in finding out the steps to print a letter or a large image.  Eason was very kind in answering my questions about the Epperson Photo Paper and also the printer.  It took a little time for the printer to setup and print the paper but the quality of the paper and quality of printing was better than I expected.  The paper is very clear and it prints with good quality.  For printing letters and large images, I am very pleased with this printer.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********I'm glad I got this book. I didn't have much of a grasp of science at that time and it was a great help. The book is written with great detail and the descriptions of what we do and the results are very impressive. I got a good dose of the physical aspects of the science (I am an engineer). **********I liked the fact that the author explained the physical side of the equation in such detail and how we do it, not just the equations, but the science of how the equation works. I like the fact it didn't just treat a math problem in isolation and that it showed how the science was put together. ***********I really enjoyed this book, it helped me to see the math in a different light and it did a great job showing how it works in the real world. I'm also glad that the book doesn't just focus on the science and the equations (which are a great read), but the practical aspects that come with it, as well. ***********************I highly recommend this book for any student or scientist in the physical sciences. It is a good read and I would recommend it to anyone interested in this topic.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm glad I bought this book, I didn't know that the author's other books had so many of these same themes and ideas. This book has all the ingredients I love about her work and more, including a good mix of humor, adventure, science, and even a touch of humor about human nature.  This is one of those books that if you're going to read one, buy both.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a little hesitant to read this book. I'm not a big fan of urban fantasy because they are generally so dark and depressing that they're basically not worth reading, but I decided to give this one a try and it was worth it. The plot of this book is a little slow at first but then picks up quickly. I didn't really care much for the characters of the main characters because of the very shallow story line, but the way the story was told was pretty good. The ending was a bit abrupt and the ending was pretty predictable. I liked the concept of a girl being a "chosen one" but I would have liked to see more of the character development. The characters were also very shallow so I wasn't that interested in what was going on with them. Overall, I think this book was good but it wasn't my cup of tea. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book that's fun and is written well.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This book is great. It's not too complicated, yet it teaches you a lot. It explains the concepts of the theory of the universe in a way that is easily understandable and fun. If you have never done a high school physics class, this is a great place to start. --------------- It is a good story with good characters. -------------- I love that this book is available in audio format. I think it is a book that is good for anyone who is interested in physics. It is easy to understand, yet complex enough to provide a good challenge to anyone. ------------- Overall, this book has a good plot and I recommend it to everyone. ------------
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have had this book since the original publication, and it is still in good condition. I like the idea of being able to create a character who has the potential to be the hero of his or her own story, and that it isn't just a one-sided story about the bad guy winning. I have seen many books that have a bad guy who is the hero, but I have always found them boring, so I am always excited to read a good story about a character that isn't a hero.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very interesting. I really like how it has the story from the beginning and then it moves into the story of the actual event, which I thought was very well done. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in the subject of child abuse and the stories that we are told about them in the media.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- The first time I read this book, I thought, "Well, this is one of those books that's going to be interesting to me, but I won't really like it." I thought that for a while, then I read the second and third time. I still don't think I'll like it, but it's not a bad read at all. It's a fun read, I loved the setting and characters. I would like to see more of the book, though, it's short. I also like the fact that there's an author I can see myself following. The only problem I have with the book is that the main character seems to have a problem with the word "boy". That's the only problem with it, really. Overall, I think it's a good read, but a little boring at times. I like the setting, I like that it's set in an alternate world, and I like characters that I feel are realistic.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book is so easy to read and it has a very good story to tell." "I can't wait to read the next book in this series." 4.5/5
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- An interesting read that is well worth the price. I enjoyed this book very much, but I did wish that the story were more focused. I was hoping to see a bit more of the backstory. I would have liked to know more about the world the protagonist is from, especially the details about his culture. However, it was well worth a read. I have a lot of other books by the author, so I'll probably pick up more of his books.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  I've always been a fan of horror and mystery fiction but I've always found that most of the stories are "for kids" and not really scary for me. So when I found this book by Patricia Briggs I knew that I had to have it. I'm so glad that I did.   I read this book in one sitting, about 3 hours, and it was amazing. It's a creepy book that will give you goosebumps. It has creepy and creepy and very scary moments and it's very scary at the same time. This is definitely a must read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book for a Christmas gift, and I love it.   The characters are likable and the book is well written.  It's just short enough to be read in one sitting, and the ending was nice and fitting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is hard to describe just how much this book is good. I have been reading a lot of science fiction lately, and I am so excited to read this one. This is the first book in a series, but I am not disappointed. It is definitely a must-read. I also found that the author is very consistent with the writing style, and the style of the characters. I enjoyed the story, and it was a fun read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic and the only one that I know of that explains how the New Testament and the Gospels were written.  I think it is the best explanation of the origin and meaning of the Gospel and its development.  If you're interested in this topic, this is a must-read.  If you're a pastor, I recommend reading it because it is a great explanation of how we can get the gospel message into the world.  It is also a great book for someone who is trying to help the church in any area, especially in teaching the gospel. Overall, a good classic, especially for the people who are interested in how the G-d message was developed.  The book is not only a great study guide but also gives an excellent history of the Gospel and the development of the Bible as a whole.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "In this entertaining and insightful book, the writer draws upon her extensive experience as a physician, as well as the extensive knowledge of her subject, to give us an accessible and accessible treatment of a topic that is very important. Dr. Landa has made a compelling case that the vast majority of those who commit suicide are driven by an array of issues, from the breakdown of family relationships to the psychological strain of unemployment to the impact of economic insecurity and unemployment. I also think the book provides a good starting point for those with a greater interest in understanding the causes of suicide. The book provides good examples to follow along, while also providing the reader with good information that they can use when looking into other issues that might be contributing to a person's death."   --Dr. Stephen Porges, MD, Chief of Psychiatry at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, author of   What I Like About This Book:   The author explains how depression is caused by hormonal imbalances in the brain that are associated with the negative feedback loop of stress and stress hormones. Her book also explains the ways in which stress can contribute to depression. The author uses several case studies to show how depression and other psychological problems are caused by the environment in which we live.   I particularly like the chapter on the role of cortisol in depression. Stress hormones such as cortisol increase the release of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the hippocampus, the part of the brain where memory is made. Caffeine also increases serotonin.   is a book about suicide that's easy to read and easy to understand. It is a very interesting read and very well written. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about this complex and difficult subject.   for further information about Dr. Stephen Landa's book visit her website at: www.suicidology.org
Write a positive review about a good book: **********" A fascinating look at the lives and beliefs of the people in the New York City Jewish community." -Jodi Jacobson"I had to read this book at least twice. The second time I did, I bought a second book to help me remember what the author had said. I am not a religious Jew, but I am a person of strong opinions about my faith. And I am very angry. This book is not a good one. But it is an eye opener about the way Jews behave. It is also a book I will be reading again. I can say that the author did a good job of making me angry. I will probably read it again as I was unable to put it down once I started."
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The book is very well written. The author has a good grasp of the subject matter and her book has good depth. I have been following the blog since I first found it and I find the blog to be very interesting. The blog gives a good overview of a subject that is often confusing and difficult to explain. I like that she provides a lot of examples of people making a positive change. The only thing I found to be a bit odd was the mention of the author being a professional speaker. This is true. She is a professional, but I find her to be too passionate about her subject. She makes many great points and her writing is good, but she is a bit overzealous in the way she expresses her points.

Kube-McDowell since it first came out, and I'm so glad that I finally got around to reading this one.  It's an entertaining and informative story, and while there's nothing new in it (except for a bit of a twist), it is a good refresher for anyone who might have forgotten something that's important to know about the past.  About the author:  The first book in this series was a disappointment to me.  It had too much exposition, and some of the events felt a bit rushed and/or not as interesting as they could have been.  This book, on the other hand, was very entertaining, and was a good introduction to the characters and world.  While the story is still fairly short, the story does a lot of work, and there are a lot more things to see and discover here.  My only complaint about the first book is that it didn't have much of a plot, so it ended up feeling a bit short.  If I had been able to finish the first novel, then I probably would have stuck with the second, but I'd recommend this one, especially if you're new to the series and want to know more about what's going on.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* My wife and I read this book together on Christmas Eve, just before I left for the weekend. I was a little concerned about the length of the book, and the fact that it wasn't a novella, but the story was well written and it was well told. It's a nice, light read. I especially enjoyed the way the author put her characters in a variety of situations and situations in life, and gave them all different perspectives. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good story.  My Rating: *****************************  I've been reading this book a couple times now. It was the perfect book for me. I found that there was an ending, but I was not sure if I was going to find it. It could have been better. I am glad I read it. I wish I could have gotten it for the Christmas holidays. :)
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________  I have enjoyed this book. It has a very different feel from other books I have read. It is different from books I read about the Civil War and the Civil Rights movement, because this is the story of an African-American family living in a segregated society in a time when the rights of the individual were being questioned. I also enjoyed the different way that the author handles the topics of racism and slavery. I have also enjoyed his descriptions of the characters. It was not until I read the last two chapters that I realized how much I liked this book and it was not because of the racial themes. I think the author is writing a great book, but it does not contain the type of material I want in my book. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in history and to those interested in a book with a unique perspective on history.   I received this book in exchange for an honest review.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book. It was a good mix of fantasy, history, and science fiction. It is not the best book I have ever read but it was a fun read.  The characters were interesting and well developed.  I also really liked the ending. I am not a huge fan of happy endings but I found it a nice ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It is very well researched, and the authors did an excellent job of presenting their thesis. There is a lot to read here, but the research is well done, and if you have a background in physics, physics is one area I would recommend this book for.

The author's book is an excellent guide to understanding the difference between positive and negative emotions and how to work with them to improve your life. It is an entertaining read, but it can also be quite technical and difficult to follow. There are several ways to improve and modify the above strategies. One of the best ways to do so is to simply apply the advice in the book, without trying to figure out how to do it.  in particular, it is helpful to understand the difference in terms of what you are doing versus what you're feeling. If you have positive emotions and you are working on getting them to subside, you are not necessarily making a good impression. If, on the other hand, you have negative emotions or you are feeling negative emotions, you might be doing something wrong, but that's another discussion. This book has a lot of good information and practical advice that can be useful, but in my opinion, it doesn't make sense to read this book for those with a very specific type of personality (I'm not a perfectionist, but I still had some difficulty following the advice given in this book).
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book that I wanted to read, but could never get around to it.  I got through it in a day, reading it at night on my commute to work.  This book is really good.  I got through the entire book in a few days and didn't want to put it down.  The story is good and I liked that the author used a lot of history and culture to make it interesting.   The world building was interesting. I liked how the author had the history and geography in the book.  There was a lot going on and it wasn't confusing.  Overall I thought this book was pretty good. I will definitely read more of the series.

Write a positive review about a good book:     I have had a hard time putting my review into words, because this book is amazing! The book gives an overview of the main events, as well as the backstory. The characters are well developed, the writing is really good and the book is really long (over 300 pages). I have a hard copy of this book, so I can't compare the book to my copy, but the book feels like it could be a perfect book, if it weren't for the cover.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- This book is a wonderful look at the "real" history of the Black Panther Party. It does a great job of highlighting the many issues with the party and it's leaders. The book was easy to read, though it is long enough that I feel that some people could have done a lot more with it. -------------------------- I read this book on a long flight and didn't have a lot of time to actually read it. I was still able to make out some of the things the author was trying to explain. ------------- This is a great book about the history of a group of people that is often forgotten. ------------ This book should be required reading in the History departments at every college and university. -------------- A good history of an important group of individuals. --------------- This is an excellent book that deserves to be read. _______________
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have always wanted to read "Wolves" by John Grisham, but my local library doesn't carry it. I finally got a copy and was very impressed. The writing is superb and it gives a very realistic view of what it's like to be a drug dealer. I like this type of book because it really captures the gritty realism of the streets. I wish more books like this existed. What a great novel. In the fall of 1990, a new wave of gang violence sweeps the streets of Los Angeles, making its way to the city's inner city, the heart of which is South Central. When the violence starts, the city police department and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics are unable to stop it. After a series of murders, the police arrest a number of suspected gang members. As the police look for the culprits, they come across the body of a man in the custody of the Los Angeles County Coroner's office. The man is shot dead and his body is left in the middle of the street for a passerby to find. The police call the Los Angele Police Department, and after a long investigation, the LAPD arrests a suspect, a young man named Vincent Smothers, who is a former member of the Bloods street gang. Smotherson is found guilty of murdering the man and sentenced to life in prison. However, Smothersm, despite being innocent, has a new appeal as he is an ex-gang member and is therefore eligible for parole. Smithers' parole is denied, however, when the parole board determines that he was involved in the murder, and that the victim was the man's brother. Smathers is given the death penalty. Sobers appeals the decision, but a judge in a unanimous decision decides to keep his life sentence in place. The appeal is put before the California Supreme Court. The justices vote 8 to 1 against Smothersy, and the court upholds the sentence. Smearss goes to the death row where he is granted a last request from his family: he wants to make a last statement. His attorney is an attorney for the United States, and Smotherses' request to make his last statement is denied. Smodyss's last words are to the effect that he is innocent. He was never even at the scene of the murder. Smatterss is executed by the state of California. The Los Angeles Police Department takes over
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Good Earth"  is a very good book, well-written, and an important book. I found myself wanting to know more about how to make this and other types of food work for you and I really enjoyed the chapters. This is the sort of book that is easy to recommend and a good read. "The good earth is a food book that's not for everyone. It's not a diet book; it's a food science book. But you're going to have to have the patience and the time to digest it, because it's not going to come as easy as a quick read."

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm really glad I picked this up because it's such a well-written, enjoyable, and entertaining book. I enjoyed reading about the book's subject, as well as reading other reviews about it. I also liked that the book didn't end on a cliffhanger, and the ending actually had me wanting more. I'm sure the book would be better without the "snowball effect," but I think the ending is still satisfying and worth the read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Good Lord Bird  was a very entertaining book. It was a little bit different from the other books in this genre, but I enjoyed it. It's funny, it's a little different from a lot of books, but it's still enjoyable.  It's not the type of book that I want to keep reading, but at the same time I have no intention of giving up my regular book collection.   I bought this book because of the cover: I'm not usually a big fan of birds.  It's kind of hard to find birds that aren't pretty, but this is one of the few I've found.  I'm happy that this book was published in a format that's similar to the other series I own.  My wife and I love to do crafts, so this book came out perfectly.  The book is written in a simple, friendly style, and I loved that.  This book is definitely for kids, but adults will probably find it a lot more fun than the kids will. 
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ ____________________  The first time I read this book, I was very upset about the "cute" cover art. This book is very well written. It was very hard for me to keep my hand out of my lap. This is my second time reading this book and I have found that it is well written, though I do not like the cover art, but I do like the characters and the story. The characters are very well developed and very likable. It's like I was reading a book about a group of friends that is a good fit for a group to read. The book is about friendship and what it takes to build a friendship, not just what it is like to have one. The story is very good. The ending was very good as well.  9 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- A good read. I have a few complaints: 1. I wish there were a few more short stories and some longer ones, such as "Hair and Skin" and "The Fortunate One". They would have added a nice variation to the book, which is a bit of a mixed bag. 2. I think the characters are too thin, with only a few strong ones. 3. Some of the science-fiction elements are a bit too futuristic, and some of the magic is not believable. 4. The language is sometimes confusing, but overall a good read, and not a bad one either. (May 8, 2005)
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The first part of this book has some pretty cool ideas and some very good practical advice on how to make a living in the music industry. However, the second part of the book takes the ideas to a much more ridiculous place.   The author begins by making fun of the music business and how there are so many "gurus" and "experts" in it that "everyone" follows them and "the business" is "easy." The author then talks about how the internet has changed the music world and how all the new people and music are being heard. The author even compares how it was like when he was a teenager and how he was not able to listen to all the popular music because of the high cost of the vinyl record. The reason he gave was because he could only afford to buy one record. It was pretty ridiculous that someone who worked for a big corporation would have such an inflated view of the business. He then goes on to make fun of artists and the people who are making their living in music. The writer talks about artists being "goddamn" lucky and how it is all about money. He even makes fun of bands who pay their crew and crew members. He talks about bands who have big name artists and big money artists in their bands and how the big name artist is doing a better job and is making more money.  , the writer is not even trying to be funny. It's obvious the author doesn't have a clue what he is talking about. I am pretty sure he doesn't know anything about music. All he knows is how to promote himself and make money. I think the book could have been edited better. It is very easy to be offended by what the author says about musicians and their bands. I was also very confused about the whole concept of royalties because this book is not trying to give a true account of royalties. The authors basically just talk about how musicians are lucky because they can make so much money off their music. I don't think this is the place to talk about that and that's why I give the book an average of 3 stars instead of 5.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading a good little book called "Hook: The Strange and Twisted Saga of John Lennon and Yoko Ono". This book is an amazing story that gives the inside story of the relationship between John Lennon & Yoko, including the details of the infamous "Fifty Shades of Grey" scandal.   My main complaint is that the book is too long, but for someone who wants to know about the "greatest" rock & roll couple of all time, this is a must read.

Write a positive review about a good book: *************I loved this book. It's a wonderful story of a little girl's adventure and the amazing people she meets along the way. She is not afraid to be her authentic self and is also able to share that with others.

Her love for her dad is especially sweet and I found myself thinking about him when she was talking about her first piano lessons, and I was glad to hear that she learned to play the guitar.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________The "Great" series is the most complete series I've ever read and I've read all of the previous ones. The main character is still the main character, but the characters and their relationship develop a bit more, especially in the beginning. There are still many of the same characters, but their roles become slightly different. The action is not as amazing, but it is still good. I think the book could have been a bit longer, but not by much. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good story.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the most concise and easy to read book on how to play chess I have read to date. It's the first book I've read that not only taught me how to look for weaknesses in a position and weaknesses in my own chess style but taught me the basics of a good game as well. I'm still learning from the book and I think I'm about 5-10 moves away from figuring out how to defend myself against some of the openings I've encountered in my first year of play. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a little experience playing chess and an interest in chess theory.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________  I read this book in the form of a magazine article. I was very impressed with the book's approach to a subject which is so often left out of popular psychology. The author clearly shows how many of our current beliefs about ourselves and the world are false and misleading. He also demonstrates how our current models of psychology are rooted in false assumptions about human nature and how we can use the science of psychology to help us make sense of our world.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I got the first two books in the 'Shattered Sea' series from Audible in January, and I can't recommend them highly enough. This is a fantasy book series that I have been wanting to read for a long time. I read through the first book in the series before I started reading the second, but I read the first one before I read it. I thought the writing was excellent, the characters were well written, and the book was a lot of fun. This series should be a classic! I can easily see this being a series of books in itself, and this author could write many books if he wanted to. The author is very talented, and if you like fantasy then you will definitely enjoy this series. I will definitely be reading more from the Shattered Sea series! 5/5

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ I was hesitant to give this a star because I wasn't sure if it was just my opinion or what, but the truth is, it's actually pretty good! The main characters were well written and had a lot of development, but I was really impressed by the worldbuilding and the world building was pretty good and unique, as far as I could tell. It felt pretty new and fresh. The story was pretty well done, and I really liked how it ended. I think I enjoyed this book, although I'm sure I'll read more from her, but it was good, and the book was a good introduction to her, and was fun to read. It was also nice that there were so many different viewpoints and perspectives, so it felt like the book felt like it was moving along at a pretty good pace, although there were a couple of chapters where I just wanted it to slow down and get to the main story.   I did have one problem with this book: It is a bit too dark and depressing for me. I like to read books that are a little darker and have a bit more of a serious tone to them, but this book felt pretty dark, and although it wasn't as depressing as it could have been, it was still depressing enough to keep me from finishing it. I liked that there was an element of hope and optimism in the story, but there were some parts where it felt a little too much. It's a pretty solid book and I can see why people would like it. It would probably be my first book I recommend to people that are interested in her, even if I am not a big fan of her writing style.

There's a good mix of action and exploration. There is also a good amount of humor, which is nice. This is not a book for everyone. It can be quite a bit of a slog at times, but if you are looking for a fun sci fi read, this is a good one to check out.

She tackles all the common arguments that people make when considering animal rights: animals are our friends and family, we have to protect them, animals are innocent and if we didn't eat them they'd go hungry, animals feel pain and suffer like us, we should treat them with respect and care. The arguments are often very convincing, but I've found the book a bit too short. This isn't a book for those who are completely convinced of their position, it's for those of us who want to understand where our beliefs and actions come from, and if there's any way to change our hearts and minds, Dennise is the right person to talk to. The book is divided into five chapters, with the first one being "The Animals." The first section gives an introduction to animals as pets, and the second section describes the lives of pets. I thought this was very good because it helped us to better understand the relationship between humans and animals. The second section, "The Other Animals," is very similar to the first section, but
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It has a lot of things that I enjoy in a novel and I think this book was a good blend of those two. The first half of the book focuses on the characters and the history of the town that is being built. It's very well written and the story has a nice balance of adventure and drama. The second half of this book focuses more on the people in the town and the people that live there. It is a lot more depressing. The writing style of this author is very good and the worldbuilding is very rich. I like that he did not make this book all about the action or action/adventure. He is a good writer and I'm glad he was able to bring the history and the romance in this book without making it all about those things.   Overall:

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book that I was not expecting to like at all.  The author is an excellent author and this book is full of his unique style and humour.  I was excited to try this book but I found myself a bit disappointed as I couldn't really get into the book and the characters.  As it turned out though the book was quite good, it is just a pity that the characters weren't as enjoyable.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Gravity's Rainbow" is a classic novel. It is about a little girl named Eliza who, as a child, was left on a street to die because she is a witch. She survives by magic and by the kindness of a few neighbors. After surviving for two years, Eliza is found by her father and adopted by a family.   This is a good story about a very important issue. There are many books out there that talk about "race" and "class" but none that talk at the level this book does about the "socio-economic status" of the characters. This book does an excellent job at showing what the characters were like as children.   is a story about the experience of growing up as a girl of color in a world that is not as kind as the one she was raised in. Eliza's parents, being the people they are, were so racist that they thought she was a witch and put her in a mental hospital. She was adopted by another family who taught her to be kind to others, and she became a schoolteacher. She is the only person who can rescue the child-soldier, the orphaned orphan, and the lonely girl in the ghetto.is about the girl's experiences as a little child, but also about the many things that happen to her as a grown woman. She has a little brother named Jimmy and a little sister named Lily who is adopted. When the witch attacks, she must fight to survive because she has no one else to help her, but she is able to use her magical powers to rescue the other children. I found it difficult to put this book down, and I finished it in one day. I think it is an important book because it has some things that I believe in and others that I don't. I liked the way the author showed how racism can be a very personal experience for someone who has grown up under a racist society. I was not shocked by the racism that the characters faced, but it did make me uncomfortable. I'm not a big fan of racist characters, but this book was very realistic and it made me think about what it would be like if I grew up in a society where I was treated differently than my family. I loved that the author was able to show a child's view of racism. There were many moments when Eliza looked at someone who was a little different from her and said "Oh, what is this person doing here

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I love this book. I have a love/hate relationship with sci-fi and fantasy books. I read a lot of them, but I always find that I'm disappointed by them. I am now over the hump and finding books that I can actually sit down and enjoy. This is one of those books that has me hooked on every single chapter. It has a dark fantasy plot, but the humor and depth are what keeps me reading. I can't wait to read the next book.

The book is very readable and I recommend it to anyone interested in science fiction."   I am also very pleased with the quality of the cover. I am hoping that the paperback will be of similar quality. The paperback should be out by this time next year, but if not, I will buy the Kindle edition. I was also pleasantly surprised by the cover art, which is an illustration of the book. It is very well done, and I can imagine a good artist drawing the story in a similar style.   As for the content of the story, it is not exactly what I had hoped for. I would have liked to have had more detail on the aliens, or some sort of explanation about why they are there. I know they are not evil and that they have other purposes, but I think the author should have included a bit more information on the origin of the aliens. If I had a few more chapters, I could see why they were here and how they are doing their job.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ When I first heard of this book, I was intrigued, but I was also a little concerned. I have a history of eating gluten-free foods, and for years my body was not sensitive to the gluten I ate, but after my diagnosis with celiac disease, my body reacted badly to even a tiny bit of gluten. I started a gluten-fusion diet that was a good way to get my body used to gluten again, but that only worked until my gluten sensitivity got worse. This book changed my life! The author, who is a pediatrician, did a fantastic job of describing the science behind the theory and also gave very practical tips to those who are looking for a gluten free diet. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for some basic information about gluten- and other grains- sensitivity and to those in the field of pediatric medicine who may need to educate parents and physicians about the theory behind the disease. It is a great book that everyone can relate to.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The book's style is very good and the author does a great job of setting up the story."  I'm not sure about the style but the story is interesting.  The main character is a very different person than the book's other protagonists.  The main antagonist is a "demon" that wants to destroy the world and is out for the blood of humans.   The book does a good job of developing the characters, but they still have their faults.  I wish the author would have expanded on the characters a bit more so that they felt more human.  My only complaint is that it takes a little too long to get to the end of the book, especially if you're trying to finish a trilogy.

Write a positive review about a good book:   "One of my favourite books this year was "The Art of Non-Violence" by Paulo Freire. The author provides a thorough overview of the many methods of nonviolent struggle and how to apply them. This is a must read for all concerned with social justice."   -Chris Dolan, Author of "The War on War: The True Story of How America's Most Famous Nonviolent Campaign Lost the Battle for Peace"   "This book should be required reading for every activist. Freire provides a comprehensive introduction to non-violent action, focusing on strategies, tactics, and strategies of resistance. It is important reading for anyone interested in the social and political implications of non-violence and those who have a genuine interest in the application of the method to their own lives."   of Nonviolence and Revolution: From Gandhi to Mandela and Beyond.   Nonviolence: The Power of Nonviolent Action is a guide for social justice activists interested in developing a strategy for achieving social change through nonviolent means. It provides a practical approach to building mass movements of the poor, indigenous peoples, and the dispossessed. The book describes a variety of nonviolent strategies, including nonviolent protest, civil disobedience, symbolic action, and nonviolent direct action. It also discusses the moral and political underpinnings of nonviolence, and how the strategies are intertwined with the social, political, and economic structures of a society.  .

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This book is not a "how to" book on how to do a lot of different things. Instead, it's a collection of practical ideas about how to be successful, both personally and professionally. The author offers clear, straightforward advice on how he and his wife (a registered nurse) successfully raised their son in a way that they never had to worry about money. It was a lot easier to do that than I thought it would be. The only thing that I didn't like about the book is that it wasn't entirely clear what the author does for a living, though he seems to have a lot more than me!

Write a positive review about a good book:  "If you're looking for a solid book that will leave you thinking about the problems of modern day politics, the American political system, and the need to find a new balance in the American experiment, this book is for you.  If you are a Republican or a Democrat, it's also a must-read for you." -  Paul Krugman "This book is a must for those who are trying to understand the political system in the United States.  I found the political systems in both parties to be incredibly corrupt and I found this book to be well researched and readable.  The political philosophy behind the book is not very new but it still remains an interesting read." - Michael Novak "I enjoyed reading this book.  It had many of the same issues as others, but it addressed them in a way that was informative and interesting.  This book is definitely worth reading." - John O'Sullivan "The book makes a very good case for an American political solution to the problems we face today, and is written in a very engaging style that is likely to engage both the uninitiated and the informed alike.   The book provides an insightful analysis of the system, its flaws, and how a political system that is not democratic can be effective and efficient.  While I would suggest reading the book in conjunction with a discussion with a knowledgeable friend or acquaintance, I would recommend this book especially for those looking to better understand the American system of government and how it operates.  If you are interested in more about politics, and you are looking for something to read, I recommend this.  I would like to note that, while I found these reviews very informative, I have found that most of the time, reviewers are writing about their own political beliefs.  In other words, they are writing what they believe to be true about the system they are reviewing.  As a matter of fact, if you are reading reviews that are written about a book you have not read, you are going to be much less likely to be impressed by the book's merits and the reviewers may actually be undermining the book itself.  So, before you read a review, please do some research on the book before you write one.  That said, I believe this is a great book and I recommend it to anyone looking for an overview of the American government.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- It's a fun read. I enjoyed it. This is a very interesting and original book. The author explains that there are many ways of expressing feelings, and that sometimes they don't make sense. There's a lot of humor, which is nice. I think that it's a good idea to try different ways to express your feelings, but in the end, you need to come up with your own. I like the way that the author tries to explain the various types of feeling. I don't think that you can really really get away from emotions, as some people seem to think.

There was a lot of sexual tension in the book and it made me a little uncomfortable. It seemed like this was meant to be a more mature book. It wasn't really. It was about the couple and their relationship, which I found annoying. The book didn't have the tension that the author wanted and it was just annoying.

I don't want to get too detailed about it, but basically you get a group who are performing and they're trying to figure out the best way to make it fun for their audience.

This book is not a short read, but if you enjoy the classics this is definitely a good choice. I enjoyed this one immensely.   to those who do not like short reads, you will probably enjoy this book a little more than me. I found the pacing quite good and the story line enjoyable, but the ending left a lot to be desired.   the ending felt rushed, but it's understandable that it was necessary.   for the more serious of the readers, you should be warned that this book will leave a bad taste in your mouth.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about the world's oldest living human being, Homo habilis, found in the Moroccan Sahara.  The author, Paul M. Kirk, is a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Davis, and author of the popular book " The Mystery of Man," about the origin of human life.  Kirk's main thesis is that Homo ha Discovery of Homo haBILIS in a Moroccan cave - March 24, 2011 (Photo: Paul M.Kirk/Yale University) A new species of human-like creature has been discovered in a remote Moroccan cave.  Researchers from Yale University say that a man who died more than 2,000 years ago was an ancestor of modern humans. Homo habilisin is believed to be the oldest hominin ever discovered, the scientists said, noting that his remains were found in a small chamber in the limestone of a cave in the Gourara Valley, which is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of Casablanca. "It's a pretty big find," said William Kimbel, a Yale University paleoanthropologist who led the excavation. "It's the oldest evidence for a human ancestor we've ever had, and that's pretty exciting." The finding adds to the human lineage that includes Neanderthals, the species from which the modern human species evolved, Kimbel said. Scientists first uncovered the remains of a man and a woman in 2003. The new research, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to suggest that these people are a different species from the Neanderthal species. It's not yet known whether the new species belongs to the Neanderthal species or another hominid species that evolved in Africa before spreading to other continents. The bones are the earliest evidence of a Neanderthal population in Africa. The findings raise questions about how our ancestors came to populate the globe, said Thomas Higham, a paleoecologist at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and a co-author of the study. Many theories about the process of human migration have been proposed over the past century, but no one has shown convincingly that such migrations occurred as a result of climate change, said Higham. He said there's no evidence that the human ancestors living in Africa at the time of the first Homo haboris left the continent before the end of the last Ice Age. More than
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ _____________________________ I really enjoy this book and it's a really good way to get to know a great author. I had a lot of fun reading this book because it is a story about a guy trying to escape from a bad life. It's not a story of a guy getting into trouble and having to do a lot to get out but I think it is very realistic and the story is told through the character's eyes. The character's names are like a piece of slang and I just had to ask the author to stop using them as a way to describe the characters. I didn't like some of the names and I think the author should stop using these names. I'm sure the author knows better than me and knows how to write a story well but I really liked it anyway. I just hope the author keeps using the names to describe people and doesn't change the characters names to keep the story moving.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ _______________________ This is a very good book. The main focus is on the importance of not doing something you don't like because you think it is a "bad thing." For example, it is not a bad thing to do something you do not like if it will help you achieve your goals. The book starts with an analysis of what makes someone successful. It then shows how the three basic traits of success are related. The first is a willingness to take a risk and the second is an ability to learn from your mistakes. Then it shows how to use these traits in your life. It shows how one person can become a success while another is not. It also explains the difference between someone who is born with these traits and someone who has them through a long hard work.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have not read a book like this in many years. I love the writing, the setting and the character's personalities.  It's a short story about a man who wants to find his son and his wife who both had a mysterious disappearance and who have been trying to find them for years.   A really fun and creative book to read!  By: Robert A. Heinlein  Publisher: Ballantine Books  Paperback: 416 pages  Publication date: May 2, 1968  Price: $2.00  I read the book as soon as it came out.    I had to have it.  My parents and I got together and we all read it.     It was very different from the others I had read.  The writing was so strong and I loved the characters.  It's funny and it's very moving.  There are some very touching moments that bring it all together.  I can't wait to read it again.  If you love Robert A's, or love the science fiction genre or love his books and are looking for a short, easy read, then I highly recommend this book.  Reviewed by: Jodi Smith
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read the book many times and loved every word. I also really liked the characters.   The story is told through flashbacks and the first person narrative. The author describes the character's past and the events leading up to the current situation, which is what made it so compelling.  .   I also enjoyed the different style of writing, as the author wrote about the characters with their own voice. She didn't try to fit the story into the standard 'hero must save the world' paradigm that is all over the genre. She also wrote about their problems without giving them a "typical" character arc. It was great to read a story that didn't have to follow the typical mold.   of the four books in the series, this was my favorite.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book a lot. I like the idea of an alien race that can create life, but I wish there were more details about their species, their technology, and their technology in general. It would have been nice to know more about how they build their ships, how they reproduce, how the races live, etc. A really great read:    I really enjoyed this series. I don't really have a favorite of the books, but my favorite is The Last Days of Night. I know it is a hard book to choose because it has so many good things about it, but The Last Night is my favorite of all the books in the series. It has everything a good science fiction book should have: It's an interesting premise, it's good worldbuilding, it has a good plot, it is well written and I love the characters. I just wish there was more about the aliens, about how the planet they live on, how their society works, and about the technology they use. The Last Nights of Night   is a book that I really recommend. Recommendation:

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- This book is a good read, and well-written. I am a very good reader, and I have never enjoyed a book that I read that had so much repetition. But I did enjoy this book. I do not know what to make of it all. I don't really think the author is trying to tell a story. The characters seem like they are trying to show their thoughts about something, and the story is kind of there as an afterthought, or an afterthoughts about the characters' thoughts. I liked the story the best, and my thoughts on it were not very deep. I think the book was written by a really good writer, who was trying to be very funny, but the humor just was not there. I did not feel the character's thoughts were very well thought out. I'm not sure why they all have a problem with the same idea, but maybe the author just wasn't trying to write a story, but was just trying to make a character funny, and it just didn't come off well. I enjoyed the characters, and thought they were all really well drawn. But maybe I'm just not a good reader and my brain just isn't that into it. Overall, this was a good little read, I was just not the best. ---------------------------   3.5 stars, but could have been higher:  1. This is a book for my husband, but it's not really my type of book.  2. This was a funny book to read. , I like a good laugh. I like reading funny books, so I thought this was very funny. I would read this book again if I have a good reason to, but I just didn  This book is great for any age, it has humor, and has a lot of action, with good fighting and fighting scenes. It was also very well written, the story was very interesting, I would have enjoyed this book a lot more if it had more action, and a good fight scene. The ending was a bit odd, but you won't be bored with the story.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Dark Lord: The Rise and Fall of Hugo Chavez, by Andrew O'Hehir It's about the fall of Hugo Chávez. I liked it a lot. It's about how Hugo Chavez used oil money and political corruption to create an empire that was a "free market" and "socialist" in nature. This book has a good mix of history and facts. It covers a lot of the bases, and it is interesting. I like how Chavez got his ideas from Marx, but he also had some of his ideas taken from the US. It doesn't get too detailed, and you don't really have to go deep to understand the information in the book. It is a little bit dry, but I like that. This is the best book about Chávista's that I've read. The next book in the trilogy is a history of Venezuela. This was a little disappointing. It isn't bad, but it is very basic. There are some nice anecdotes and interesting historical information, but for the most part it's just basic. The first book was a lot more informative than this. The second book was better, but this one was better because the details were more interesting. The third book is a more in-depth history of Chavez, but doesn't go into much detail about his policies and beliefs. Overall, The Dark Lord is a good history of Hugo "Chávistas". It isn.t a good biography of Chavez. It was very dry, and some of the information that was presented seemed outdated. But it is still good history that is in the vein of good history.
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________   My favorite part of this book was the story of the dog's journey from puppy to pup. It was a wonderful experience to watch the little pup grow and learn, and to know that this was the best thing that ever happened to him.   I have a lot of dogs, and most of them would have been euthanized at this point. Unfortunately, this dog was given a second chance at life. I feel terrible for the people who got the bad end of the deal.  , by David R. (reviewed on 11/18/2007) This is a very good book about the challenges that a person with a dog goes through. It has many examples from the owner's side, as well as some from the veterinarian's and animal shelter's side. If you have a dog and are dealing with the same kinds of challenges that are in this book, you will not be sorry you bought this book. If not, well, you're not alone. The author, a licensed veterinarian in Wisconsin, writes about the pitfalls, difficulties, and the joys of raising a dog.  ... I found this book extremely informative and helpful. The main problem with my dog was that he never learned to do a thing without his owner. The first time he learned to sit was when I threw him in the water and said, "sit, dog." The second time was when he figured out how to lie down and lay his head back. My dog was never very good at tricks, so I was really frustrated when I couldn't teach him tricks. I felt so bad for my dog that I started doing tricks all by myself. I'm now a great tricks teacher, and I love having a dog to play with.... It was interesting to see what my dog did when he didn't get what he wanted. He would just sit there, or just lay there. It got me thinking about why dogs don't do everything by themselves.. I also think it is important to teach your dog to behave and learn a trick if you plan on training him for obedience or other dog sports..   .. The last section was interesting and a good read. It really showed how the human-animal bond can grow through exercise, play and playfulness..."   "This book is the most helpful thing I have found for those who want to help their dog improve their behavior.. "   Read full review...
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is that there is a good deal of information that is not in the book. There is a lot of information in this book, and I think the information that isn't in the Book is still very interesting. For example, there is the story of a man named Thomas who was born with a rare form of dwarfism. Thomas was the victim of cruel bullying in his childhood, which left him with a form of mental retardation. When he is about 15, he is taken in by a family who have three daughters. Thomas becomes very close to them. But one day the girls decide to have sex with him. It is one of the most horrific things that I have ever read. They force him to do it, and they cut off his penis. Thomas is a victim of rape and murder. There are also other cases where there was a man who was attacked by his wife. In one of those cases, the man died because he couldn't stop the blood loss. And there is an account of a girl who was raped and murdered by her stepfather. This book is full of so many stories that are so terrible. But the one that I found the most interesting was about the man who killed his wife after she refused to have an abortion. His son was very confused about his father's actions. I loved this book. It was so interesting, and it made me think about a lot. I think I would have been interested in reading a book about a man's life with a mental disability. I thought that the book could have been better if it had covered a few of the cases that were in the novel. I also found some of the names of the people that were mentioned in the story to be somewhat inappropriate.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A lot of this book is in the form of anecdotes.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The last three books in this series were great.  The story was very exciting, the world building was intriguing and the characters were likeable.  This book didn't really change the story or world much.  I was bored for a bit, but after that, I liked the characters and plot.  My only complaint is that the book was very slow to start.  After reading the first chapter, I was excited to read the next two chapters.  However, after the third chapter, the book felt like it was going nowhere.  It was just the same story over and over.  I thought it would be fun to read a series in a different time period.  But I didn't feel the story was as interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* This is the best book I have ever read, and I'm not just talking about the story. It's not the best story I have read in a long time, but it is the most enjoyable. It is a unique story about an average guy with an average life trying to make his way in the world, but he just happens to fall in love with a girl who is just as interesting and intelligent as he is. He doesn't know it at the time, because he has no idea how to approach girls, but the more he learns about girls, the more his personality starts to change. He starts to realize that he likes to be in control of things, but that is because he likes the way girls behave when they are in control, and that's what he's doing with his life. The author doesn't take the easy way out and try to explain the things that he has experienced, but rather, lets the characters tell the story, and the story does a great job at showing how people are made. It also manages to be very funny at times, because the author is not afraid to make jokes, which is always a plus in my book. There is even a reference in the book to a popular TV show called "The Real World," and the author made it into a joke at one point. The book doesn't hold your hand through the whole process, but if you can handle it, you will love the book. If you're a woman, I don't think it's going to be for you, because it's a very specific type of story, but I think if you're willing to read about a man who learns to be a better man and a better person, you should give it a shot. It has it's moments, but you won't find yourself going "Ahhhhhh" or "Goddamnit" or any of the other typical male feelings. The main reason for me giving it 4 stars is because the ending could have been a little better. This book had a lot going on, and was very long, but somehow the author did not make the ending as good as the other parts. Maybe if they had been longer, then the ending would have been even better. Overall, I think you will be able to enjoy this book, and if you like the author, you may want to check out his other books.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm very happy that this book was included in the anthology I bought.  It's a fantastic, unique book that will appeal to both fans of the classic and the new-comers alike.    I've already ordered the next book in the series (which will be a few years later than the previous books) because it's the same story.  5 out of 5 stars:   Review:  I really enjoyed this book.  The premise is awesome, and it has that '80s/ '90s feel.  I enjoyed the characters.  A lot.  There are a lot of fun moments in this book, but the main character is an annoying, immature jerk who really makes me hate him.  This is not the case with the next character, who is a very likable character, and who is the main reason this book is enjoyable.  His father is a police officer and he has a great time doing his job.  But the book really has the character development that I look for, and I enjoyed it.  One other point to mention, there is some violence in this story, but it's handled with a lot more sensitivity than you would expect in a YA book. I would recommend this book to a friend who likes the original story and has some experience with police procedurals.  If you are a fan of the original novel, this is a good follow up.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am still trying to get over the fact that I couldn't finish this book.

I especially liked how it took some of the more bizarre elements and gave them a believable, believable basis. The book has a dark, creepy, and disturbing atmosphere, but it is not all doom and gloom. There is some light, some humor, and some nice surprises in the end.

I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with the rest of the book, though. I think I'm just gonna finish the first book first and get back to it later, because it's really well written and very fun to read.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ My boyfriend was really surprised when I told him about my plans to learn Japanese. The whole thing seemed to make sense to him, but I think he felt a little disappointed that I wasn't learning Japanese in a more practical way. I was not disappointed. I learned quite a bit and it was a really great experience. I feel like the grammar and vocabulary is really good and not just filler. I'm excited to continue my Japanese learning.  Didn't work for me: ______________________ This book was very interesting. I am a little annoyed with the grammar in the book, but the overall story is well-told. I just don't feel like I got the most from this book. I would give this book 5 stars but the grammar problems I had were frustrating. The problem was not with the sentence structure, but with grammar. I got a few good examples of how to fix the grammar, but there were a lot of grammar mistakes that were hard to tell when the writer was just making a mistake. I could not even tell when he was making a grammar mistake. Overall, this book was an interesting read. I might be able to learn a few things, but will need to learn on my own.  to keep reading: ______________________________ ____________________________ I'm not sure if it's because the author uses a Japanese writing system or because the grammar is a bit complex for me, but this book just didn't work out for me. I have a ton of books that I have been reading about different languages. I know the grammar well, and I can follow a sentence without looking at the sentence. However, I'm just not sure how I would go about learning a new language. I read a lot about the process of learning a language, but it's always a little bit hard to follow and it never seems to make any sense. The grammar problems are very frustrating. I'll continue reading, but not sure it will work out. I'd recommend this book to a friend, but maybe not to someone who wants to learn.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- My wife and I just finished this book and we loved it. We have a lot of books about life that are not so great. This one was a great book. The author is very funny and easy to listen to. She has an excellent point of view. It will give you a good laugh at times, and the chapters are well written. There are a few things that I found annoying, but it doesn't take away from the overall fun. The chapter on the "Punk Rock" scene in high school is great, and I wish I had a copy of it to listen again. --------------- I read the book in about 2-3 days. It's a really good book. I had been thinking about reading it for years. It was very funny, and very insightful. It really shows that what we think we know about our own lives is often wrong. It doesn't teach you how to live your life to perfection, but just to be happy and fulfilled.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I had no idea that this was a book about the history of the Jewish people, but it was. This book is written in a manner that is very readable, but there is so much that I didn't understand that I had to read it several times. I don't understand the origins of the term 'chutzpah', but that's just me. I also didn't get why some Jews were more inclined to take offense than others. For example, a group of Jews from the Warsaw ghetto, who were all of different religious backgrounds, were told to go back to their home countries, but one woman, whose religion was the most important one to her, refused. She said to her group that she would only go back if they gave her a place to stay. Her attitude caused a rift in the group, but later she became a friend of the group and they went on to have many happy and fulfilling lives. I found this book very interesting and informative, especially as it was written by a non-Jew.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book I am reviewing is "Masters of the Universe: The Story of the New World Order" by William C. Cooper.   I am a bit puzzled by this book as I have not found any information on it in any other place online.  This book claims that all the world leaders at the time were Freemasons and that the Masons have been working to bring about the New Age since the 19th Century.  I believe the book is true but the only problem is that I have no idea who they are or who these Masons are in the 21st Century. The book claims to be written by a "member of the Illuminati."   There is no evidence of that in the book or any other source.  The book is written by William Cooper, a member of the so-called "Illuminati" or the Order of the Rose Cross.  It is difficult to believe that the Illuminati would write a book that claims that the members of the order are Freemasons.  One has to wonder who would want to claim to be an Illuminati member, even if it is true?  I have read about the Illuminati in other books, so I am familiar with the idea that the organization is made up of some very powerful people in the world.  Cooper is a person of great wealth and power and his claim that he was part of the "Illuminists" may be true but I don't think the author would ever have written such a book. Cooper also claims that he has written "over 500 books."  If the author of the book really was part and parcel of the elite, why would he have written over 500 books if he was not a member?  The other question that comes to mind is that if the author really was a member, why did he choose to not give his name?   Cooper also says in the introduction to the book that the book was written from "my own point of view."  I don´t know how Cooper can be such a powerful man in his own right and yet he still wanted his book to remain anonymous.  Even if Cooper was an Illuminati person, how would he claim to have written the book when no one knows who he is? Cooper has been accused of being an Illuminati stooge and being an anti-Semite.  If that is true, it is hard to believe why he would want his book published in such a way. Cooper has also been accused, on various websites,
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, while still a little old-fashioned, is well written and easy to read.  As a man who is currently going through a divorce and dealing with the loss of his career, I am glad that I found this book and will keep it on my bookshelf.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read this book for over a year now and have thoroughly enjoyed it. I find that I read many books in a day so this book is a good choice if you are looking for something a bit different.  The characters are all very likable and the action is great.  Read a negative review about the same book: This is not a book for everyone, it is a very slow book with no real plot progression, but it is well written and entertaining.   A good book for children:  This is a fun book for the younger audience and there is plenty of action and humour in it, although I can't say it really made me laugh.  The book has a good plot, but if you do not have children I would not recommend this book to you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A lot of people say this book is about sex, but it isn't about sex at all. It's about the struggle of a mother and a son, and how they come together to change a world that was never designed to be perfect. It is not a perfect book, but that is why it is a great book. It has a happy ending, but I wish there was more in there about what happened to the mother after the birth, and why the boy doesn't know what happened when he goes back to visit his mother in prison.  Also, the mother is very good at explaining things to the boy, and she really does make a good argument for why she should have the right to raise him. _____________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I've been looking forward to this book since I first heard of it... I was worried at first because I'm not that much of a fan of the genre, but this book was just the right blend of fantasy and science fiction. This book really captured my attention, as I've been waiting for a new book to keep me coming back for more.   In the beginning, the author sets up the premise of the story by saying that we're all born with the desire to learn and that there are certain abilities that we are born with and others that we need to train ourselves to use. The main character, a boy, starts learning these abilities at a young age. His father is a scientist who develops and uses them for his own ends. As the book progresses, the father tries to get the boy to learn some of his abilities by asking his son to go into the woods and gather materials. He is a bit hesitant to let the boy go into his home so far, but eventually he decides to give in and let the kid have his way.  's main character is an orphan. When he was a child, he was taken from his home and given to an adoptive family. However, when he goes to live with his adoptive parents, they are having financial troubles, and are looking for help from the government to make ends meet. The orphan grows up a bit and becomes very intelligent and curious about the world around him, and starts to learn about the abilities he was given. The reader starts to see the different abilities that the boy can use and learn about them as the story progresses.  "It's a wonderful story... I really love this book... It's very well written and the story kept me interested through the whole book. The author has a good grasp on the subject matter, and the plot was interesting... I'll definitely be picking up the next book in this series."   I would highly recommend this book, if you're a fan or a novice.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ The book "The World According to Garp" was a great read. This book, I am pleased to say, is still available in paperback and audiobook and is a great primer to those who want to know about the life of Garp. I've been to the Garp show, and he is very entertaining. I have seen the movie but I am not sure if I have the time for that. It seems like I can only find the book in book stores.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I'm a huge fan of books about the great thinkers and historical figures. I was happy to see that this book was just that. The authors are so good that they can even get a few of my favorite philosophers in there. It was easy to understand the argument, and I really appreciated the fact that they did not try to "prove" the point that the earth is old. It is still a scientific question, but it is a question worth pondering and answering.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I've only read two books in my life, but I'm not sure I've ever read a book that has had a bigger impact on me than  The Moth and the Flame  has had on me. I think it's one of the most important books I've read, one that I'll probably read for the rest of my life. I'm sure that you have already guessed what my favorite part of the book is... the ending. And I'm glad to report that this book has a satisfying ending. I mean, I know what happened after that. There was a little bit of mystery, but nothing that I was really worried about or that would've changed my opinion of the character in any way. And it's the final book, which really is the end of a trilogy, that really keeps it all together for me. It was nice to have closure." 3.5/5 stars "This is the book that set me on my quest to learn about the occult. I was hooked from the first page." -Linda This is one of those books that you know is going to be good, but you also don't know exactly how good. I've heard that this is a series that is pretty hard to read, but this has turned out to be one of my favorite books. The Moth And The Flame  by  John Crowley The author of the popular novel, The Magus, and the co-author of The Way Of Kings, John Crowley's latest novel is a sequel to The Magi, his first novel, and also a sequel book to The Way of Kings. In this book, we meet the main characters, Vaelin and Anaster, as they prepare to sail across the Sea of Silt, a long-lost land where the magic is still active and the ancient gods have a secret that they are trying to keep hidden. The book's plot is one where the protagonist's journey to the hidden land of magic and mystery is not a happy one, and it's not a pretty one either. The main character, V.E.D.S., is a young man who has come to the conclusion that he will never be able to get the answers he wants about the hidden realm and the people he has come across there. He is determined to find the answers and prove to himself and others that he is capable of being a good person. So what is this book about? Well
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I really enjoyed this book. It's a fun read. The book is fun, but the real meat of the book is in the characters. These are real people and there is a lot of them. I can relate to many of the things they are going through. ________________ I don't know about you, but I've been trying to learn how to play guitar. I am not a musician, but have been trying for years. I think my problem is that I can't focus on what I'm doing. I have a problem with just practicing and practicing. It just isn't a fun thing to do. So when I found this book, I was really excited to pick it up. It was a bit long for a beginner's book, but it has good info on how to get into it. I will definitely recommend this to someone just starting out with guitar.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I read this book as a supplement to my graduate-level course on a new class of synthetic organic polymers. I enjoyed the explanation of the basic science of polymers, but was left wanting more in the way of practical examples. I would have liked to see more on how to select a polymers to start from, and how to combine them in a way that would produce a variety of polymeric products. I also would have appreciated a better explanation of some of the properties that make some of these polymers special, such as the chemical bonding, elasticity, or durability. Overall, though, this is a good introductory text for an undergraduate or advanced graduate course. I look forward to reading more about the chemistry of polymethacrylates and other polymers in the future.

The mysteries are very well written and the author's style is so engaging. "
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I really enjoyed this book."   This book is about a boy and a girl who are both born with a gift for magic. The boy, Tom, is good with plants, trees, animals, etc. The girl, Laura, is better with books. Tom's sister is named Laura (also spelled Laura) because they were adopted as babies. Their parents were both artists, and they were able to create paintings and drawings. Both children are gifted, and both have magical powers, and when the girl's parents die, the two have to find a way to escape the abusive home they were raised in. In my opinion, the book was well-written. There were many good characters, some of which I enjoyed. The author did an excellent job of showing us the good and the bad in the lives of the two children, and also showing the way in which they try to escape their situation. There was not a bad moment. The book was also well-balanced. There is enough darkness to make it scary, but the story never becomes too dark. The story was interesting, and the characters had a lot of development, which made the story even more interesting.  The author really did a good job with this book. The ending was satisfying and I will be reading the next book in the series.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________ I am a big fan of the "Shelter in Place" series, and the latest installment, "A New World," continues to be a good read. While the book is set in a distant future, it has a lot of the same themes that have been explored in previous installments. The premise is that humans have found a way to create artificial intelligences, called cyborgs, who can be used as soldiers, or for their own purposes. While I personally didn't enjoy this idea, the writing of the book was very interesting. In this future, humans have taken over a large part of the world, but still have a strong presence on the smaller islands of the Pacific. A big problem in this future is that the island nations have been invaded by the United States and the Japanese, and have become the new colonial powers. The humans on the island have taken to using their cyborg slaves as a means of survival, and are slowly being converted into a new society. While some cyborg characters have their own motivations, the most interesting are the ones who are used for political purposes, and who find their own way to become more than just slaves. The story is very entertaining, and I am excited to see where the series goes from here. It is hard to believe that this series has only been around for five books, and is still being written, but I'm glad that it has been so popular so far. This book had a good plot, and was fun to read. It may be a bit of a spoiler to say that I really enjoyed the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was really excited to get this book. I had a lot of trouble reading this book and didn't really get into it. I think it is because the book doesn't really provide enough background information to me. I really think that a better introduction would have helped me get more into the book. The only other thing I would add to this is that I really like the art style. I like how it is very minimalist and clean and makes for a very nice book.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ I have read this book many times and still have many questions. First off, what the heck is a "pipeline"? Is this just a giant, hulking, ugly thing that the bad guys are using to get to the good guys? Also, how come they are only using them to make people's lives miserable? I mean, if I'm going to get killed by some dumbass, why not just shoot the guy in the face? They can't do that, but if they can get to people's homes through a simple pipeline, how can you stop them? Also I am not sure if the people they are attacking are human or not. Is this a world where robots are real and they are trying to take over the world? That's pretty cool. I'm not a big sci fi fan, but I was surprised at how good this was. I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like I'm reading a story I have already read.

It is very well written and provides the reader with a clear view of the early years of the colonies.  It also includes a nice history of the French and Indian War.

I enjoyed reading this book because it provides a perspective on the early colonists that I have not found elsewhere.  It is easy to read and I was glad to see the authors have taken the time to provide an explanation for the history.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________________ The best book I have ever read about being a black man and not feeling like I have a right to be on top. A must read for anyone who cares about the future of this country.  This book is not about the civil rights movement. This book is about the black male life. I think this book would have been better with the focus on the female civil rights movements. That is where the real life stories of Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and Stokely Carmichael are written about. This is not that book. This really is a story about black men and how they deal with the challenges of life. The stories of the black men who are successful and happy are not told here. I don't know why, but this is the only book I can think of in my entire life that I could not get past. The author states that he doesn't know what the white community thinks about him, but he is very honest. He states that when he was on trial he felt that he was doing the right thing. I found that very refreshing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have not read this in years and it came back to me in a dream. I have been looking for this book ever since I was a little girl. The cover and description are perfect for this kind of book and the writing is excellent. The book has a strong message about family, the value of education, the importance of being responsible and caring about the world around us and how we can have more compassion and understanding for those around us. The stories are told in such a way that the reader is never left wanting more. I wish I had read this book as a child!  Help others find a good novel: ______________________________________________________   "I never wanted to leave the house again, so I left my husband. I ran away to the woods to hide away from my family and friends."   What can I say? It was a book I had to read, and I read it. It's not the type of book I'd pick up on my own, but it's a book that you can't get in the bookstore without buying it first. It was an eye opener. I am glad I read this when I did. I hope others do the same. I will definitely be buying it again.  8 of 8 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: ******** I was skeptical about this book and the title, but I gave it a chance and have been very pleased with it. The characters are believable, and the storyline was intriguing enough to keep me reading. The book was easy to follow and I found it enjoyable to read. My only problem is that the book could have used more of an ending to really get the point across and the last section of the book was quite a letdown. I am sure that this book was written to appeal to young adults and adults in general, and it's hard for me to understand how a book about a group of high school kids in high school could have a happy ending. I would like to read more books about these teenagers, but this one was not for me. I'll keep an eye out for other books from this author.

I'm sure the author could have added a few more examples but that's what you get for the price. This book is an excellent resource for anyone who's ever had a problem or been in a bad situation. I recommend it to everyone who's interested in improving their well being. I'd recommend it for anyone, even the non-believers.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- A well-written and interesting book about an unusual subject. The main character, who is a scientist, is a bit of a weirdo, who's always thinking of new ways to kill people. However, his research doesn't involve killing, he just wants to know if it's possible to create life from non-living matter. The book is filled with humor and lots of humor, and the plot is quite interesting, but the ending is a little too neat. It's very fun, but it's a little more complicated than it should be.   Overall: ------------ This is a great read! I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Secret History of the American Revolution, by David Barton.  This is a well-researched and engaging book about the history of the Revolution.  I particularly liked Barton's explanation of how the "peacemaker" and "prophet" became interchangeable terms and how both terms had different meanings in the 1760s.   I also enjoyed how he used the phrase "disease" to describe how the British government's suppression of religious freedom was having a negative effect on the colonies.  This book is well worth reading and would make an excellent addition to any library. My review:   The Book of Secrets is a new book from the anti-evolutionist and religious right leader David Barton, who was named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people of 2007.  Barton's new book is a must-read for anyone who wants to know more about the origins of the United States.  The title of the book itself makes it sound like a little bit of a mystery but Barton does an excellent job of explaining the "secrets" of America's origins, starting with the fact that it was founded by a group of people who were not necessarily Christians, and that there was no real religious debate about it at the time.  While there is some good information in the book, I have a few gripes.  First off, while it does go into great detail about the development of the first settlements, it also goes into some very questionable territory about the religion of the colonists.  There is a lot of "secrecy" in the writing that I find very distasteful.  As far as the book is concerned, it's about "securing the land" by forcing the Indians off the land that God gave them.  It's also not at all clear how this was done and what it accomplished.  My second gripe with the book concerns the writing style of Barton.   Barton is not known for being a good writer but he is also not known as a very good one.  When I first read the book I was really confused by the writing.  After a while I realized that Barton was trying to use this style in order to make his points seem more interesting.  Although this may have worked on the first few pages, I don't think it was effective at all.  He does get some things right, such as the fact (a) the Puritans did not believe in the Bible,

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very interested in the idea that you could get people to do what you want them to do by changing their environment. I like that idea a lot. I don't know that it works very well in practice though. It doesn't seem to work very well with kids. I think that they have too much independence, and too much autonomy and not enough responsibility. I'm going to give it another try in a different setting, though.

I loved the book and I'm glad I got around too. I'm looking forward to seeing what's coming out next, and it's great to be reminded of some of the things I loved about the series. It's a great story, I'd recommend it to any fan of the original Star Wars trilogy. I'd also like to say that this was a very well written book, from the first sentence on, you know this is going to be a great read. I can't wait to see what's next. I was excited to see this coming.

Reviewed by: Susan S. from St Louis, MO. on 5/16/2015 This is an important and interesting book. The author clearly has an appreciation for all of us who are involved in this country and the way in which we live our lives. It is also an important book for our kids. It gives an understanding of how our political system works, why we are divided and how we can come together. I am grateful for this book!  Rated 5 out of 5 by kris from Excellent and clear.

It's so easy to read and it's filled with interesting information.  It's great to learn about other countries and cultures, and to see the changes over the years. I'm going to make a point of learning about all the other languages as well." "This book has given me many insights on what it's like to be a person of color.  I was born in the US and was raised by a single mother.   I came to the US to study at a university.  My mom took me and my brother and sister to see a movie, and when we got home we found that my dad had decided to take the whole family to a casino and have a huge party for us.  There is a part of me that doesn't want to talk about this, but I want you to know that I'm glad that you read this book because I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I actually loved it.  You can tell that my mom had a lot of pride in my accomplishments and I wanted to do the best I could to show it. I was the only one in my family to go to college, and my mom was always very supportive of me.  She taught me that I could accomplish anything I set my mind to.  But it's also a part about what I had to deal with when I went to college.  It's a little scary to admit but I was very self conscious about looking like a college student.  A lot of the books I read about college were not really true about what it was like to go through college. I did go through a lot at college, but it's something I learned to deal as well.  This book was great because it was the first one that I read that gave me a lot to talk and learn from about how I was treated.  And it's just so sad to hear that in 2016 there are still people in America who have the idea that black lives do not matter and that black people in general are not valuable.  To me, this book shows that I was pretty good at my mom's job because she was always the one that made sure I had food on my plate.  That's something you would never hear from a lot the other black kids at my school, because they would say that I had a good

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________  A great book about the human body.  It was not what I expected.  is a great book that is about the "why" of the human anatomy. the way the body works is explained in the most easy to understand manner. this book is very easy to use. it is also an excellent reference for the more curious. this is a must read. The book is divided into six parts, each one is about one section of the body:  The Heart: what it does and what happens when the heart beats  Digestive system: the way food is digested  Breathing: the organs and functions that make up breathing  Glands: the body's ability to secrete and store nutrients and enzymes  Mouth: the openings that allow food to enter the stomach  Stomach: the stomach, the pancreas, and the liver. the liver is responsible for metabolizing food and is where many of the chemical reactions in the body take place  Tissues: the muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, and nerves. this part of the book is especially important for the lay person and for the medical professional  the book is well organized. it starts with the basic knowledge about the body and then goes into more detail about each section. there is a chapter about each organ or body part that explains how it works and why it does so. it makes a great reference as it allows you to read a chapter and see the entire process. i especially liked the diagrams for the digestive system and the organs. there are a lot of pictures in the book as well. the illustrations are well done and the illustrations in the anatomy chapter are very well done. the pictures and diagrams in the chapters are very clear and easy to follow. it has a very good explanation of each body part and the process that it goes through. i really enjoyed the book. it was a nice, easy to read introduction to the human anatomical system. i would recommend this book to any medical professional or medical student. , August 29, 2009
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent introduction to the subject of astrology and is an invaluable source of information to anyone who is interested in the subject.  The author is an astrologer and has the ability to bring a real personal perspective to the topic of astrological interpretation.  This book can be a valuable tool for those who are not interested in reading a book but would like to learn about astrology.  This book is extremely well written and the information is presented in a straightforward manner.    For the first time I found an author that can give a realistic perspective on astrology as an area of study.  I found this book to be informative and easy to understand.  A must read for anyone interested in astrology or anyone that wants to understand the subject better.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had a very fun time reading this book, it was great fun to read.  You get to experience the characters, the settings, the story, the humor and the characters really did make this a good read.

I found this book very entertaining and entertaining. The plot was interesting and well done. I enjoyed the characters and found them very enjoyable to read about. I liked the humor as well as the characters. There were also many things I did not understand at the beginning of the book but I think I will pick up the book after I have had a chance to read the books again.

It's funny, action packed, and full of action.  is the Book you want...this the story y  1 out of 1 stars This book is not a fun read. My wife was looking forward for this book to be the second book in the Harry potter series. I have been reading the first two books so I was excited for this one. We are both big Harry Potter fans and we had read the other books, so I knew what to expect. I think this book could be a fun adventure, but the book does not meet that expectation. We read the book in two nights because we were not sure how the book would go. The story does not make sense and I do not know why I would want to continue reading the book. It is very predictable, and there is no excitement about what is happening. There are a few parts that make you laugh, but other than that it's just a fun story to read and you are not excited about the book anymore. I do recommend this book for Harry Potter fan, but do not think I would recommend this for someone who doesn't read Harry Potter.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was well worth the wait. I have been waiting for the last couple years to get into this series, and this book finally delivered. It was the first time I had read this series and it really set the bar high for the next book. I liked the character's reactions to the new information that came to light in this book. A lot of the characters are going through a similar experience to the one I was in (I am still feeling the effects of the depression that I suffered from in my early twenties), and this novel showed that there is still hope and hope is a great thing.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the first to really address the whole "anti-social" aspect of social media. I really appreciated the fact that this book did not have a chapter dedicated to social media and specifically social media platforms like facebook and twitter. It is great that the author does not just throw out a bunch of platitudes and stereotypes about the internet and how bad it is. I like that this author does research and goes to some of the major sources of data and comes to her own conclusions about what is going on and how to handle it. The book is full of useful information and practical tips that will help you manage social media better. If you have been struggling to figure out what to do about your social media addiction, you should definitely check out this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- It's my first real novel. I am not that good a writer. I'm also not that young, so I was able to find a good agent (who I have a good relationship with) to help me out. This is a really great book that is very well written and is easy to read. I also love the way it's told in a realistic way. It's funny, but not too dark or over the top. It is not a very depressing book but it is still very good at telling a story and a story that I liked.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a bit confusing. It tells you to read the back of the book for a list of the books in the series. The back is all about the history of the series and then at the end it tells you that the author has decided that they should publish a sequel to the first book. Then the author mentions that the second book will be out later this year. The third book is supposed to be out next year. Then it states that the fourth book will come out in 2020 and that the fifth book will likely be out in the early part of 2021. The sixth book is not listed anywhere on the site, and when you search for it, the results show it as being out in December 2016. I have read all of the previous books in this series, but I am confused by this new announcement. I'm not sure if the author is getting out of the publishing game for a bit or if they are just making things up as they go along. This new announcement makes the first six books seem even more of a mess to me. I know that I am not going to get my hands on this book, so I have decided to wait and see what happens.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I think this book is brilliant, and I really like the way it's structured. It's not just a series of questions, it's a series that allows you to take a step back and reflect on the whole book, so it's easier to write about than a book that has just one question. It feels like a story, but it's actually a story of a guy, and a woman, and their experiences with the disease. It was a really good book, and it's definitely a must read.

It also covers the use of the sword by knights and the reasons behind their use. There is a lot of history to be covered and I really enjoyed reading it.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I am really enjoying this book. The book is great, but the quality is somewhat low. I really wish they'd have used better paper to make the book a bit more sturdy. There is some of the book glued to the cover that will probably get on my shirt and that is a shame. There are some very small typos and spelling mistakes. The only other thing is that some of his sentences are a little hard to understand. Overall, I am a fan of this book and recommend it to any book lover.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- If I had read this book back in the 80s, I would have loved it. I loved this book! It is a very detailed and informative read. I like that it tells the history of the development of the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Service today. The book has lots of information, so you don't have to keep reading to know what you need to know. The photos and diagrams in the book are also very useful. There are many photos and charts. The author explains the basics of the Postal service in a way that makes sense to everyone. He also makes it clear that there are some bad apples that need to be removed. He says that we can't have a healthy system if there are bad apples. The one criticism I would make is that the author sometimes does not always know the name of the person who is in the photos. Also, the book is not for the faint of heart. The first part is about the history and the second part is the current day. If you are a postal worker, this book is for you! -------------------------- 5 stars: This is a book that I read a long time ago. It was about a man named Arthur Koeppel who wrote a book about how the U-Post office started and it's history. I have re-read this book a few times, and have gotten some new information and information about the Postal System. The information in this book has definitely changed. I recommend this book for people interested in the U - Post Service.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been a long time fan of the Dresden Files. I was not a huge fan of The Dresden Files, but the Dresden books still had enough great moments to make me read them again. This is the third volume in the series. It is a great series, but is the main characters not as developed as they used to be? The first book is amazing, but in the second book, the characters seem so weak and the plot gets pretty weak. The last few books have been pretty good. I think it is worth buying the rest, just not as a stand alone, just a great trilogy.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I have read and reviewed a lot of books. It's easy to write a review that sounds positive. It is the first book I have purchased from this author. The plot was simple but engaging. I loved the characters and how they are treated. The world building was fascinating. It really made me interested in the world the author built. The author is great at showing the world as it really is and not just a fantasy setting. This book was so well done. I would recommend this book to any fantasy fan.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was so very impressed with this book. I love the way this book introduces some of the different parts of the Bible (or the "holy books") to make the reader better able to understand and be more aware of the Biblical text. I'm not a Bible scholar, but this is very well written and well researched, so I think that's a good start. The book also goes into a lot of detail about the history of the books in the Bible, but I found that this section was a little lacking, and I would have liked to see a little more information about the various ancient languages that were used to write the books of the Old Testament. I also did find it a little repetitive in places, but overall, I really enjoyed reading this book! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about the Bible and how it came into being.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about the true history of the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages. I am a historian and I enjoyed reading about the history of Christianity from the earliest times to the early Renaissance. The book is organized in the order that it was written by St. Athanasius. This book covers the history from the early days of Christianity, up to the time of the Protestant Reformation and the Reformation itself. It is a book for the history lover. It provides the background on the Catholic Faith from the very beginning and gives us a detailed look at the development of the Church in Europe from the time that the Apostles lived to the reign of Pope Leo X. 3) Catholic Dogma: The Doctrine of the Faith in the Early Church, translated by R. W. Worthen and D. L. Pfeiffer, [First Edition]  (St. Paul, MN: Eerdmans, 2006) The Catholic Dogmatics is the first systematic introduction to the Catholic Dogmas and the basic concepts of the faith in the early Church. The authors take the reader from the birth of the Christian faith to the Protestant revolution, and they show how the dogmas of the early church remained virtually unchanged until the Reformed reform. The books covers the doctrine of the Trinity, the Church, Purgatory, the Sacraments, and the Eucharist. The author has taken the time to present a systematic presentation of the dogmatic system. This is a must have book for any serious student of the history and development of Christianity. 4) A History of Early Christianity by E.P. Sanders, translated and edited by M.E. Schmitz (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012) The A History Of Early Christianity is a great introduction to early Christianity. It includes the major historical figures, the history between the Apostles and the Council of Nicaea, the major theological controversies, the development and reception of the Gospels, the Councils, the early Christian liturgy, the historical development of Christian theology, and much more. It covers the early history of early Christianity from Adam to the Council in Nicaea. The A Histori- cal Christianity book is a valuable addition to any history of ancient Christianity.  5) The History of Christianity in Seven Centuries: From The Decline Of The Roman Empire To The Present Day, by Charles F.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book has a good premise that will keep you reading:   When you go to bed at night, you imagine that a friend is waiting to take you to a movie. Your friend never comes, and you get up in the middle of the night, thinking that your friend might be at the movie, but it's not the movie you were looking for.   In this book, the protagonist is a man who gets up in bed at 3am to masturbate. He can't think of anything else to do that night and his mind is in turmoil. Then, his mind finally works out a plan to get some sleep and has an epiphany about the nature of his problem.   the problem is not a problem, it's the way he views himself.  , in fact the author makes a strong point about the fact that all humans have a problem with their sexuality, no matter what they say, because the mind is the only thing that makes us human.  . The protagonist gets up at 3 am and goes to his room to masturbation, because that's what a man does. But he doesn't realize that he's not a man, he's just a man. And a man is only as good as the mind that makes him who he is.

It was just the right amount of light and dark. The only thing I did not like about the book was the ending. But I guess that is to be expected when you are telling a story of a cult. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy books that are gritty and real. I can't wait to read more books from the author!
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's the perfect book for those who have a bit of a bookworm in them. I really enjoyed this book and am sure that there are a lot of bookworms who will love it too. 9/10 What's your favorite kind of book?  I read a lot so this is a good question to ask because a good friend told me about this book. So I decided to read it as well. I am not a fan of stories that are too long and I have a hard time reading fiction. I read this book about 30-35% through. It is an interesting story that I think I could relate to. I would say that the ending was not the greatest but that's my opinion. It was a nice way to end the book.  The book had a few problems with the author's spelling and grammar but overall I enjoyed this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a big fan of the Dresden Files series. I have been reading them for years, and have never felt I could get the same sort of quality from other fantasy books. I am not sure I have ever read a book that was so well done and entertaining that I didn't want to keep reading. If you have never read this series, give it a try.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's a good story with good characters. The characters have depth and are not stereotypical. There are a few moments that I thought were funny, but the main characters have very good personalities. It's just a great story. I've read it twice now, and I'm looking forward to the third.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________  It's one of the better books I've read in a long time. I'd give it 4 stars if I could. It's a good read, though not great.   The Good:  The plot is good and the writing is well done. I did not like some of the dialog, but that's a matter of taste. I would have preferred that the dialog be more realistic or at least be more witty.   in terms of the story, it does a good job of creating suspense and then making the reader wonder what is going to happen next. The book is set in a small village that is plagued by a horrible monster, a zombie. The villagers all know about the monster and it is a huge problem for the people. The main character is a boy named Ryo and is about 10 years old. He is a good student and has a good relationship with his teacher and the rest of his class. One day he is playing with a toy gun when the monster comes. Ryo manages to shoot it in the chest, but it starts to come back. The monster grows back, and Ryo is the only one who can stop it. He does so and manages to get some supplies from the village for the villagers. He returns to school to tell his friends about his adventure. But the villagers do not trust Ryo. They say that he can't be trusted. But when Ryo gets home, his father and mother are home. The father says that Ryo's teacher told him about the incident and that he is very lucky that Ryou was able to shoot the monster. The mother says that they do not blame Ryo for the monster as it is just a toy. Ryou has a lot of trouble making friends and is very shy, so his parents try to help him by letting him sleep over at their house every night. But this only makes Ryo more shy. Eventually, Ryo has to go to the town hall to get the help of his teacher, his sister, and the mayor to defeat the monster once and for all. He also has to find out what happened to the girl that the monster has eaten.   and the ending... well, I guess I will leave it at that. I think it is about time for the zombies to start showing up on this site. The ending is a bit confusing, but not so bad that it ruins the story. Overall, a good and good for the genre.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________. The authors have a wonderful knack for keeping the reader hooked on their story. The characters are complex and well developed. I am very pleased with the ending. A must read for any fantasy lover.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. The plot is great. The characters are great. I love the way they interact with each other. I also love the fact that it's set in the past and the fact they were still using swords. I would give it a 9/10.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I really enjoyed this book. I have a background in writing and have read a few different romance books. I liked the fact that the main characters are different from each other. This is why I really like this book so much. The relationship between the main character and the princess is interesting. The book is very well written and the romance is very good. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone looking for a new romance book. It is a bit more challenging than the usual romance but the characters are so interesting that it is very enjoyable. It took me a while to get into the story but once I did it was great!

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________ [My review] It's so fun to read about the adventures of these two girls, and I really liked how the author took a different approach with the boys. There's no constant brooding and the girls are the more positive, cheerful, and outgoing of the two, which I appreciated. My favorite thing about this book was the relationship between the two girls. I really like the way the author created a whole new friendship with each of the girls, especially with how she portrayed them both as intelligent, funny, and talented. I'm excited to read more about this pair of girls! [My notes: I liked how she made the girls seem different from each other, as if the boys are the "bad boys" and the sisters are the best of the best. It was a nice change of pace.] _________________________________________________ _________________________ [My final thoughts] This book was a great read, although it is kind of long. There was a lot of information and the descriptions were great, but the story itself just didn't seem to grab me all that much. I also didn't feel like the girls were very interesting in any way. However, there's so much of this book that I can see myself reading the rest of the series. I highly recommend this book, but not for the reasons I gave it 5 stars. __________________________________ __________________

It has the right mix of statistics, stories, and the analysis that makes a good nonfiction book.  I really hope it gets made into a movie.  If you want a fun read:    Read this book. It is not a perfect book but it is a good read. I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book: *************  "The story is well told and the characters are well written."  This is a fun, well-written story about a man and his dog. I love the book, but I did have a few problems with it. I had trouble with how the author used a picture of a dog as a model of a human being. This was very distracting to me, and it made the story hard to follow. I don't think I would want to read this book if the author would have included pictures of humans or dogs instead of pictures of dogs. It was a little distracting. The story was good, but the book is a little dry at times. The author could have made it a little more exciting and funny by adding more characters to the story. I was expecting a bit more from this story.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was pleasantly surprised by this book.

It has all the elements of a good mystery/thriller: the mystery, the mystery elements, the suspense, the twists and turns, and the tension. I read it in one sitting (I can only hold two books at a time) and I had to put it down to go do something else, but I didn't want to leave. I finished it in two days. I really, really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Great American Novel: The Extraordinary Story of America's Most Underrated Book by David McCullough is a wonderful read. It is written in the same way that many great writers are. McCullough writes like he's been there and knows what he's talking about. He's very well-researched and has a way of writing that doesn't rely on "hocus-pocus." He gives a wonderful overview of the book, the culture, the politics and history of the era and the characters that are featured in it. He also brings the characters to life, even though the reader knows that they are fictional. His descriptions are often wonderful and vivid. His characters have a lot of life and personality. It's easy to love the book as it is a really nice and well-written book. I'm really glad that I read this book, especially after reading a lot on the Great American novel.  I've been waiting to read this for a while. I'd love to read it again but with a different perspective on it. It also provides a nice look at the time period, which isn't always well covered. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________   This book is a good read, although I think it is a little too light on the moral implications. It is more about the psychology of being a good soldier than it is about how to be a good person in general. It really does a good job of giving the perspective of a soldier who has just seen the bad side of war, and also who has been in combat and has seen the good side. He gives some very good insight on how the good soldier thinks, feels, and works, as well as some insight on the bad soldier, who is often in the military because of bad decisions. He is also very well versed in the psychology behind bad decisions, which is probably the most valuable thing you can get from a book like this.   The problem with this book is that it focuses so much on how to make the good decision that it ignores the bad ones. The bad decisions are mostly ignored in favor of the good ones, and while it is certainly true that there are bad decisions made, they are often overshadowed by the good. This is a very good book on how a good decision can be made, but there are some things that are missing. First, I wish it had been a little longer to really get into the good and bad side to both sides of the war. Second, I wished it had a little more discussion on how one can see the good in everything, and then still have the bad in one's own actions and decisions.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it because it was different, but still had something familiar and enjoyable about it. There were things about the book that didn't make much sense to me, but it wasn't the fault of the book, or the characters in the book. If the story were better, I might have gotten more of a story, but I enjoyed this so much because it's a good story with a great ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked the way it was written. It was funny and had some good characters.

I did not love the characters or the story but it was a good read and I was looking forward to reading more.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Best of Everything by John Gray. I loved it. This book is like a puzzle. It takes you on a journey of learning how to be a better person and a better friend, but it's really about finding the right path.

It's a good intro to the basics of programming languages, a good introduction to object-oriented programming, and it's a really fun book to read.  The style of writing is a little more conversational than most, but I don't mind.  Also, if you're looking for a book to get you started with OOP, you can't go wrong with this one.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- It's a good, good read. It's good to read something that doesn't really preach to you, but does a good job of explaining a lot of the philosophy and logic of a lot the ideas I've been exposed to in my life. I really appreciated the references to other people's writings, as well as the author's own personal journey with a variety of topics that range from philosophy to politics to psychology to a myriad of other things. I'm not going to pretend that I fully understood everything I was reading, but I learned a lot. I thought the author was a little vague, but that's only because I hadn't read all of it. It took me a long time to put this book down, but it was well worth it. The only thing that would have made this book better is if the author had actually put a little more effort into writing. But even then, I'm glad I read it.

In this volume, Golemann presents compelling evidence that all animals seek pleasure and avoid pain. He also shows that humans have a remarkably sophisticated understanding of the evolutionary roots of these two desires and their respective motivations.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________ I've read The Great Divide by John Michael Greer before. I read it in 2011 but I missed it by a couple months. I'm glad I read this book again. I like Greer's take on the state of the world. He has a few theories, but he also gives you examples of how his ideas could be implemented. It is not always as easy as you would think, and I like that. The Great Divider is very short but I enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I have read all the books in the series, and am very pleased with them.

They have personalities and are a good addition to the story. The author also made it easy for the reader to relate to the dragons, because they had personalities. Overall, this is a good series. -------------------------- I have enjoyed every book. The books have been enjoyable. ------------- This is a really good series of fantasy books.

It is interesting, the author has done his research, and he shows that the bible is full of errors, that we are not the descendants of apes, and that we can not all fit in one boat, and the last part of the book is not what you would expect from a christian. But, the last few pages make up for that. This book is very informative, and a good source for Christians who want to know more about the bible. If you are a christen, or a christain who wants to know the truth, you will like this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book very interesting and easy to read. The main protagonist is a girl, she has a father that is a criminal but his criminal ways have caused him to be shunned by the community. This has made him a victim of the society as he lives in a small town and is treated as a leper. Her father was a former criminal and after being released from prison he became a drug addict. This caused her to have an abusive relationship with her father. The father eventually had to kill her because she was hurting him with her abusive relationship. Her mother was a drug addicted mother of 2. She is the one that instigated the abuse between her and her father, it was not her who got in the way of the abuse. The story is not overly long and has a good flow to it.   Overall the book was a good read and I enjoyed it very much.

It was a little confusing at first, but once you understand the situation and how it is, the characters came out much better.

It's the first book I've read that doesn't seem to have the "I want to read a book that is like this but better" in it. I've enjoyed reading the books by Mieville and Scott Lynch. This one is pretty good. I'm not going to go into detail about it because it's all there. You can get it for $2.99 at Amazon, but I suggest buying it in the US.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Best of the Best  by Jim Laidlaw, is a great book.  I loved the ending.  My favorite part of this book was how Laid law showed us the differences between the ways we think about art and literature, but how they can both help us.  This is a very interesting book that will probably be used again in the future as a good reminder of what we can do as individuals and as a society.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great. I bought it on a whim and just couldn't put it down. This book is written by a man who suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder and as a result he is a very intelligent person. This is not just a book on OCD, it's a book about how people with OCD are able to function in life and live a fulfilling life.  The author was a very good teacher, showing us that the mind has a way of working in such a way that we are able make good decisions in a situation and not make the wrong ones. I highly recommend this book to anyone with OCD or anyone who has ever been close to someone with OCD. __________________________________________________________ "I had read a lot of books on OCD. It was my dream to read one that was written by someone with the condition. I've found one. I love it." -Dr. David Rosen "This is a great book. I loved it. It really helped me understand why people with obsessions are not able to stop thinking about the object and why it always comes back.!" -Dr Karen L. Johnson "This book gives a lot about the inner workings of OCD. The author is a psychologist so there is a lot in this book about the mind and how it works. I also liked that it talks about how you can use this knowledge to make your life a lot better.    I highly recommended this book." -Cynthia P. "This was the first book I read about obsessive compulsions. I am a graduate student at Harvard, and I think the material was well written and thought provoking." -Katherine F. "I love how the author has the same passion and compassion that you'd expect of a psychologist, but she also understands and gives insight into OCD as a real condition, rather than a personal problem." -Marilyn B.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a fan of the series, especially the second book, and I think the third book is pretty darned good. It's just a shame the author didn't include the first two books in this series in the paperback.

But the only reason I read this book is because it was the last one I bought for my husband. He has an intellectual disability and his life is very limited. He is always tired and his day is so limited that he has to stay home. I knew I had to give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. This book is really good and I recommend it to all people who are struggling with the same issues that my husband has. This is an excellent book and I love it!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed reading this book. The first half of the book is about a group of students in a high school. There is an older male teacher, who is very stern and hard to get along with, who has a hard time with the younger students. The group of kids have been getting more attention from their older friend, who thinks that the kids should not be doing what he is doing. This makes the group more rebellious. The teacher is trying to get the students to be more like him, but they have other ideas. The boys have a good sense of humor and make fun of the teacher. The older female students are the most entertaining of the group. The female students talk about things like having sex with their boyfriends, and the girls that have been raped. The men are a bit dull, but their humor is funny. Overall, I enjoyed this book and it should be read by students in high school to help them with their social and emotional problems. I would recommend this book to any students in need of some social interaction.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  This book is the epitome of the genre and it will blow you away with it's ability to explain how to use it to write a successful novel. I was not sure what to expect when I bought this book. I had read several books on writing but never a book that really focused on a writing technique that is based on the structure of a book. This book takes all the concepts and makes them real for me. I have been trying to get my novel off the ground for several months now but am just now getting started on my first draft. I used to think that using a book as a guide to writing was too simplistic but this book has shown me that there are many more layers to the process than I was thinking. I am going to buy the next book on the topic because I do think it will help me continue my journey.

It is not a textbook on the physics of the Big Bang, but an excellent introduction to the whole area. This book has been widely praised, and is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the basics of the theory. The text is clear, concise, and easy to follow.  This is an essential book." —M. A.

I have never read a book that was so detailed about the history of the country and the history and culture of each country, and the people that live in each country.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was so excited to start reading this book because of the premise of a group of young children getting together to create a playhouse.  The children are the most imaginative, imaginative, and well-read children I have met in my life.  They have fun, they play, they do art projects, and they make things for the playhouse with the help of the parents.   I read a lot of kid-friendly books about dinosaurs and dragons and princesses and stuff, but this one was a real treat.  This book has a nice blend of stories about the adventures of the children and the play house, and the illustrations were pretty good.  If you like kids, you might enjoy this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins is a great book that is a reminder that all people have free will, even those with a scientific bent.  There are many people that will read this book that will be turned off by it due to the fact that it deals with the same subject matter, but the writing is good, the information is in the book and Dawkins shows how the scientific community is so far out of touch with reality that it makes them seem out of their mind.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book while sitting on the train with a very heavy book bag on my back.   This book was perfect.  This is a great book that gives you everything you need to know about the different forms of magic.  There are many books on magic, but this book has a lot of info about what you need for it to work.  The book is easy to read, and has lots of diagrams to make the magic easier to understand.  I especially enjoyed how he explains the different types of magic and how each one works.  If you're looking for a good guide to learn about the world of magic, this book is a good start. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is quite intriguing. The story was not original, but the characters are original. The action is very entertaining.   "I was in love with this book from the beginning."   I read this book in about an hour and a half. It was so easy to pick up, read, and then finish. It is a fast read, which is great for those times when I have to write fast and get my work done, but don't have much time. I enjoyed the plot line and the characters very much.   a very interesting book!
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- The Book of Erotica, or, the Science of the Art of Seduction by E.D. Kilsby was a very informative book. I've read many books about sex, but this one is very thorough and interesting, and has a lot of good advice. There are also several photos in this book. (I didn't know what to expect when I bought it, but it is very nice!) The only complaint I have is that Kilsbry doesn't include a few good stories of how he had to go through the "problems" of a woman. However, he is a very good teacher and his advice is sound. (Note: Kilsborn was the author of the classic book, How to Make Love.) I hope he continues to write more books on sex.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only book I have read about the history of the United States I think is truly worthy of mention is The Battle for the Mind: The CIA, Mind Control, and the American Century by John Marks. The Battle is a well written book, very well researched and written. It is a very detailed history of how the CIA and its allies used drugs, torture, hypnosis, and brainwashing to control the minds of the people in the United states. If you have the slightest interest in this topic it is a must read. I am not saying this book is true, but the information it presents is not far fetched. There is even a section on LSD that is worth a read. If only every president and congress member was under CIA mind control, then it would make sense that all those years of secret wars would have a good outcome.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********  I've read about how the book helped me come out of depression and it was very accurate in its portrayal of how depression can be an extremely isolating experience. It made it easier for me to see the positive sides to my situation. The story is about how a man with the same disease ends up being a hero in his own right. It's funny, and it is a really nice, fun read. The ending, while not a cliff hanger, was the most interesting part of the book and I would recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I have ever read!  It will be in my library for a long time and I am glad I picked this up.  I have been working with many different therapists but I have found that Dr. Mckenna is the most helpful and patient.  I will be looking into this book again, this is an excellent book that will be helpful in all aspects of treatment.   
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ I am a huge fan of Stephen King, but this book was a bit lacking in the characters department. I did like the idea of a school full of psychopaths, though. I'm not sure why he didn't use this theme more in the book. I think this book would be better if he went with a horror theme.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is excellent. It is not just an account of a "normal" life, but it has many interesting points. A true story of a young man who was adopted by a very odd family and became the son of a priest. The priest was a former Nazi and has become a very old man. The boy's father is a very strong man and can be quite intimidating, but the boy is a much more laid back man. He becomes a good soldier. He is very strong in the face of danger and always does the right thing. The story is told from the point of view of a German prisoner of war and the son who was his adopted father. I liked the book very much and I would recommend it.   4 of 4 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed the book, but there were a few problems I had with it.  First, I found the book to be very predictable.

After all, I already know that the story was about a guy who has an obsession with the idea of the past. But this time it was about an alien invasion that happened in 2036. And it was much more believable. It was a good read and I will definitely be looking at this book again. The story was really interesting and I hope that the author makes a sequel, since I really liked the first one."   -Nancy
Write a positive review about a good book: __________. I really enjoyed this book. I've only read it once, but it's been on my shelf for a while. There's a certain type of book that I really enjoy. It has the feel of a classic novel, but with the added bonus of a well-crafted plot. That's what this book does well. The story is very well done. There are two different stories that are connected by the main character. Both are about a woman named Lisa. One story deals with the discovery of a mysterious box that her friend and neighbor was talking about. The other story focuses on Lisa's attempts to find her missing husband. It's a good story, and I'm looking forward to reading the sequel. I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy it just as much as I enjoyed the first book. It doesn't have as many mysteries as the first one, but there's a nice twist ending. I was pleased with this book and am eager to see what happens next.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is very good, it will help you understand the basic principles of programming and will allow you to build a program that works and has a good output.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I had never heard of this book, but I was delighted by it. It is a very funny book with great illustrations and I loved the character's reactions to things. I think the only thing that bothered me about the book was the story about how they were going to get rid of the other half of the book. The only way they could get rid off the other side of the page is by cutting it up in half, but it was too complicated and confusing. They should have just made it a book and left it at that. I would like to see them make a sequel about what happened to the other part of the story, as the story was great and the illustrations were really good. I hope that they will come up with a sequel to this book!

Write a positive review about a good book: ******** The book has good information but is written in a very technical language that could have been more easily explained in a less technical book. It is also somewhat repetitive, and I feel that the author may have gone too far with some of the topics discussed. For example, the author discusses how the human brain is not good at dealing with abstract concepts like numbers and probability. I am not a mathematician but I have been trying to learn how to use statistics in my own life, and even just to learn what they are, and the author's description of the human mind does not really help me understand. I do understand the concept of using probability to make decisions but the author spends so much time describing the mind that it gets really repetitive and hard to follow.

Write a positive review about a good book:  My mom gave me this book as a Christmas present about 10 years ago. I was skeptical, because she had given it to me before and it never worked. But she convinced me that this book was good. It is about a woman who works at a bookstore. She is a good mom, and she is also a little bit crazy. She's so full of life and so full. But the crazy part is, she's also kind of a slut. This book really is a classic. I love it!

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the second book that I have read that was about a man who lost his mind in a madhouse. In this one, I feel as though there was a lot more to the story. The first book was not so well written, so I was a bit disappointed. This book though is very well written. I loved the characters and the book. I felt as though the author was very realistic in her portrayal of the insanity of the man who is a victim of his own mind. It's a very well-written book. This is my favorite mental patient book that has been published.   What I Liked:   The characters. The author does a great job of creating a likable character that is very relatable. The character in this book was very different from my own but I could tell he was a man whose mind has been warped. I thought the author did a very good job of portraying this man and how he had the personality of a madman. The book had many twists and turns and I felt that the author captured the madness of the characters very well.   "He could be a nice guy if you were the only one who knew him. If there were only two people who knew the man's true nature, he could be charming, if you took his side. If you were just his friend, you were in trouble. He was a walking lie. He would lie to you about everything. He'd tell you that you were his friend or his lover or his mother or his father, but you knew it wasn't true. You knew the guy had lost his marbles. He could be sweet and generous, and he was, but he was the worst kind of liar, the kind who lies with a smile on his face, and then he's furious when you say he's lying."   "He thought the doctor was going to kill him. He thought the doctors were going to cut him open, rip him apart, and feed him to the pigs."   (pg. 10)   Character development. I really liked the characters in this story. I liked the story and the characters. I just thought that this book could have used more characterization. I feel that there was no real character development and there was not enough focus on the story to make it really compelling. There was a point where I was thinking that the characters were all just a bunch of names and that this was going nowhere.   the characters did not really

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ I was a big fan of the first one, and this one is better. It has a lot more to do with the characters and story than the first. The plot is a little different, but still very good. I think I've come to the conclusion that the first book was better. I just found it to be so good. The story about the girl's love for the little boy, the way she struggles to be the perfect wife and mother, and the way her kids grow up, is a lot of fun to read. The ending of the book is a bit of a twist that I really enjoyed. It's also a bit sad, but that's kind of the point. Overall, I really recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was one of the most informative and enjoyable books I have read so far. The author takes the time to explain a subject that has fascinated me for years and gives it a well-balanced approach that will appeal to both hardcore and non-hardcore readers alike.  There are a few technical issues in the book that I hope are addressed, such as the difficulty in using the computer to do certain calculations in a spreadsheet. ____________________________________________________________ This is a great book.  The author's passion for science and the history of science are obvious in the way he approaches the book. I am a professional scientist so I appreciate his approach to science.  It is easy to follow, but the author has done a wonderful job of explaining complex ideas.  I found the book interesting as well as challenging and enjoyable.    The book has helped me to understand the importance of scientific inquiry and why I believe in the scientific method and how it is applicable to our daily lives.    The book also contains a number of fun facts and facts that make it easy to learn even the most complex ideas and concepts.  I am looking forward to future books from the author!
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________ The world is a wonderful place, and we have all the good things in it. But in order to truly experience this wonderful world, you have to travel around and meet people. I'm not a huge fan of travel, but I have been to many countries and traveled a lot in my life. And if you have ever read a book, you will know that every person has a different personality. Some are so nice and nice to everyone, and some are so nasty and nasty to everyone. I've always thought that the best people are the ones who try to make the best out of every situation. I am always trying to do that, but the good people in this world can't always understand that, so they often put people down. I just don't want to be that person, so when I read about how the good guys have to deal with these bad people, I realized that I have a little bit of bad in me, too. And I'm a very nice person, but there is always going to be a time when someone is mean or nasty to me, and I know I have to put up with it. I also read a lot about how it's okay to be mean to other people, because they don't deserve it, but it's not okay to do it to yourself. I think I will be more honest and be less mean to others if I have less meanness in me. I hope that this book helps me to do the right thing in a situation and not just be a jerk to others. Thanks, K.M.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am reading the book of this book at the moment. I like it, but it does have a problem, the book is not a good story. So, if you want to read a good, good story, read this book, but don't expect a great story. It is not. The characters are not likeable and the story is too simple. The story about the characters are too simple, it is just about them, not about what they do. It could be better but it is good.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I read this book when I was in my mid 20s and it was the first book that I have ever read that made me feel as if I was going to die. It made me angry. I am a good writer, but I felt that the author was not giving the reader a true feeling of what it was like to live through the Holocaust. I felt it was not as emotional as I wanted it to be. The ending was so terrible that I will not read any more Holocaust books. I would have preferred that the book not be about the Holocaust at all but about someone who survived it, but the author chose to focus on the Holocaust to the detriment of other important aspects of the book. I think it would have been more effective if the book had focused more on the other aspects of WWII, like the war in Europe, the liberation of Poland and Hungary, and the liberation in Korea. The author makes some good points about the role of the Jews in the Holocaust and how the Germans were able to get away with killing them. However, his focus on how the Jews were able survive the Holocaust, and how they did it so well, is not very important to the reader. In fact, it detracts from the story. I did not feel as though I had been in the shoes of the protagonist. He was a young, Jewish man who lived through the genocide, but he did not really feel as strong as some of the other characters in the book (and I do mean some. The Jewish survivors, for example, did not suffer as much as the others). In a way, the book's greatest accomplishment is its message about the importance of forgiveness. While the author does not specifically say that the Holocaust was the result of the Jewish people's inability to forgive themselves for their past sins, it is implied. The Jews were told they would be destroyed, and it would be their fault if they were destroyed. The Holocaust was their "fault" and they were the cause of their own destruction. I feel that it is important to remember that the Jews did not cause the Holocaust because they did not forgive themselves. They did not commit any sins that should have been forgiven, and they did forgive many of their enemies. I found the Holocaust a very important part of history, but it was an extremely complicated subject that the writer did not seem to grasp. I do not know if I will ever read another Holocaust book.  12 of 12 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________   I've been reading this book for some time and it has become my new favorite! I have had a number of other books on the same topic and have always come away disappointed (I also read a great book on the subject, by the way, by John W. Ransom). This book is the first to really nail the details about how to use them, what to do with them, how they work and how to store them in various locations, etc. The book goes into detail on the mechanics of how to set up a set of three, but has more detailed descriptions of how they are used and stored. I can't wait to get my hands on a set.   The book also has some great photographs of how the devices are used. The photographs are well detailed and the pictures of the devices can be used as visual aids for those not familiar with the subject matter.
Write a positive review about a good book: ************* This book is a good story, with a good ending. The only problem I have is that the ending was so predictable that I was just waiting for it to happen.
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________ I have to say that I have found a number of books on the subject of "How To be a man" to be of value, especially for those who are looking to take the "manliness" plunge. I have read these books over and over again because I am interested in this subject. I like this book because it is clear, concise, and to the point. It is also very interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in becoming a better man. It really helped me become more manly in a lot of ways. It has been a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________ (It's hard to rate this book, as it is really just a collection of stories. It is written very well and is a good story collection). This is a story about a man who was raped by a man at a time in his life when he had no friends, no money, and no real desire to do anything but sit in a dark room. He has come to realize that he is still alive and living in a world of evil that needs to be destroyed. The rape makes him realize that this is what life is like. It's a great read, and a great way to end the book. This book is very short and very fun. Highly recommended.   What others are saying about this book...   - "This is one of the funniest books I've ever read." (David M. Perry)   "This book is the ultimate expression of the kind of evil and darkness that can be found in the darkest recesses of the human soul." (L. Ron Hubbard)   of all the books I read this is the one that made me laugh out loud the most. I hope the story continues to be told.  ,   The story is about a guy named George who was an average college student and who was going to college to become a lawyer. He was raped when he was a teenager by a local drunk. He had no idea who the man was until he was told he had to pay him off for the rape. He also never spoke about it for many years until he met a woman named Lila. They became close friends and after a year of living together, she invited him to her apartment for a drink. She told him that he was her only friend, and he had a few friends. She gave him a bottle of whiskey and a joint and told him to have a good time. She was a very nice woman and George didn't feel like drinking much. She had been trying to get him to take more interest in her but he was too busy trying to make her life better. He thought he was going on a date with a girl named Mary who he didn't like very much, but she didn't seem to be interested. He decided to leave but was caught by the police, and they were going to arrest him but he convinced the officer to let him go.  . After leaving the bar, he ended up in the bathroom of Lila's apartment. The bathroom was on the ground floor and there

The book has great writing, it's well written, the plot is a well thought out and it's a fun book to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story and good writing. I give this book a 7 out of 10
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's a wonderful book. I liked the character of the writer. His prose is smooth and clear. His style is a little different from my usual but I've found that it works well in my opinion. I was surprised by the number of people who didn't like the story but still enjoyed the book. It's a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the third book in a series I have read by Mary Shelley. The other books are Frankenstein and The Last Man. I had a hard time putting this book down. The book is not long and it does not have many pages, but the story is so good. It is not only about the creatures but about the humans as well. The monsters have a life of their own and have their own problems. This is a great book that is perfect for a night on the town.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The last three books I've read have been wonderful, and the one before that is also excellent. I love the setting and the characters. If you're a fan of the Dresden books, I highly recommend this book.   My first review in three years! The first thing I noticed about this book is that I have a strong preference for female POVs. This is a really cool thing for me because it shows that there is a certain kind of woman who is going to have a very different experience with Harry than any other person reading this. My favorite character, in terms of the way she was written and the story she is told, is Draco. He's just so likable, he has so much depth and I really liked him. I also liked the other two female characters, but they weren't quite as strong as Draco was. The only character that I didn't enjoy reading was the author's wife, and I'm not sure what I can say about her. The book ended on a cliffhanger so it left me wondering about where the story was going and how it was going to end. I'm glad that the author ended on such a high note. I highly recommended this book to any Harry Potter fan, no matter what gender you are. I am a fanboy, but not so much of a fan that I'd be willing to give up the chance to read more.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "This is a very informative, well written and well illustrated guide on the subject of the 'Spirits of Children' (or the 'Child Spirits' in modern parlance). It is written with great care and with the intent to help parents understand their children's "spiritual" needs. The book is a great reference and I highly recommend it. I would have liked to see more photographs of these children as well as a more detailed and well documented discussion of the topic. But, for the time being, I am very happy with my purchase and I hope to purchase more books in the future." See my book reviews:  Spirituality and the New Age  and  Spiritism: A Guide to the Unidentified My book reviews have helped me a lot.  I am glad you found this helpful! If you need a spiritual guide for your children or children in general, this book is for you.  I highly recommended it to anyone who wants a book that will help them understand their child's spiritual needs.    The book covers the subject in great detail, but you will have to read it carefully.  There is a lot to understand and it takes a lot of time.  It is recommended to be read before a child reaches age 5 or 6 because children's understanding of spirituality is still developing.  This book is not a quick read.  You will have a good amount of time to read through it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good read. I loved the story and the characters. This book has got to be one of the best books I have read in a while.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Last Days of Pompeii by David Fisher is an excellent book about the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. It provides the necessary background and context to understand why Pompeii was so important. The Last Times of Pompeu- lii by Dan Brown is a novel about the last days of the Western Roman Empire that is not only exciting but also a fun read. My favourite book: The Rise and Fall of the Third Rome by Robert Adams (the only book I've read by him) is about the Roman Republic and the rise of the third Rome. The book is about how Rome became a corrupt, authoritarian empire and how a revolt by the plebeians toppled the republic. I've also read several articles about how the third Roman Empire was about to end and how the fall of Rome would be inevitable. It was a very interesting read that made me think about the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was looking forward to reading this book because it seemed to be a "must-read" by some reviewers. I wasn't as convinced, however, as some of the reviews. I was disappointed that there wasn't more "history". I feel that the book was over-emphasized on the historical aspect and not enough on the psychological. The author also focused on a particular aspect of this topic (the "dark side" of human nature) and did not delve into the psychology behind this aspect.   It was interesting to learn about the evolution of the human race and the rise and fall of civilizations. But, in the end, I still felt that this was a book that would be useful to a few people, but not an essential one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Mormon Mafia is a fascinating look into the history of the Mormons and the Masonic organization of the church. It is a fascinating read that gives a unique view of both organizations.  While there is a lot of information and discussion that is presented in this book, I would recommend that you first read the  The Masons and the Mormons  blog by   Ricardo S. Segovia. The two articles are very different, but both contain important information that will be useful to those who are researching this topic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is wonderful! It gives a very good introduction to the art of writing. It's not just about writing, it's about life and the things that go on in our lives. It tells us how we can improve our writing, what to avoid, and what we can do to make our writing more effective. It gives us a great place to start.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book based on my interest in the subject matter, and after reading the first chapter I knew this book was something special. The author does a great job of breaking down each of the different parts of the human body and why they are important. He also makes some very compelling arguments on the subject. The fact that this book has a female writer and was written in the 60's is also interesting, and I think that this is a great book for women. I definitely recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- This is a very interesting and helpful book about what we have to go through to get a good night's sleep. It's the only book that I have found that covers this subject from the perspective of both the sufferer and the person who helps him/her. The author is very knowledgeable and is a pleasure to read. I also appreciated that the author gave a brief overview of what the symptoms are and what causes them. There is also a chapter on the physiology of sleep, a nice addendum to the book.
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________ I read this book a few years ago on a whim. The title intrigued me, and I thought, "What the heck, I'll give it a try." It took me a while to get into the story, and when I did, I was pleasantly surprised by the story's depth. The story is a great one, the characters are likable, and the writing is strong and well done. This was a great read!
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I have been a huge fan of the book and it's a perfect book to take with you when going to a convention. The story is amazing, the art is beautiful and the story is a great mix of comedy and drama. The only thing I don't like is that the main character, Lenny, is annoying to read. I get that he's annoying, but the guy has been through hell and back and he's a complete mess. I was really hoping for a change, but other than that I think the story would be just as funny and enjoyable as the first book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of the Dresden Files and have been for quite some time now, but I had no idea that the book would be a full trilogy, not just one book. I'm still getting used to this new format and I'm enjoying it. The stories are well written and have interesting characters. I have some trouble with the characters sometimes (I love Harry and Ginny) but that's fine, I can just imagine a conversation between them where one of them is complaining about something and the other says "but you're just like Harry, it's just you being Harry, what do you want?" and then they're all like "yep". It's just funny and charming and I really like it. It's a great read. I was hoping to read the other two books in this series but I don't know when they will be available anymore.  I'm not sure why people hate this series so much...  I've had some complaints about this series. I really wish I could write some of them here, but the truth is I can't. I've read the entire series (as of yet, anyway) and have no complaints. It just didn't do anything for me, really.   I also didn't love the character development in this book. Harry has always been a pretty good guy, but he's always been stuck in the middle of a lot of things. He's never been good enough at anything to take charge, but there's always someone to push him to be better. This is different. This book just had nothing to do with Harry and everything to do about Ginny. It seemed like she was the focus of everything and didn't really get the attention that Harry deserved. I like Ginny. I know she can be difficult sometimes and there are some things that she needs to work on, but at the same time, she's such a sweetheart and I think her character deserves a lot more attention than she gets. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is amazing. It was a really long book that was very detailed and very clear.

Highly recommend this book for anyone that is interested in understanding a subject in depth.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I bought this book in a used bookstore when I was a teenager. I loved the characters so much, and I loved that the author tried to explain how the mind works. I'm just disappointed that she didn't write more about the mind and more about how people learn to think. This book doesn't even explain what "learning" is, which is one of the most important ideas in all of psychology. It was really sad that she only used it once.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I've been reading this book since it was first released. It's got the right amount of humor, not too much but not too little. The characters are well developed and the plot is a lot of fun. I especially like that it's not just about a typical high school romance, but about a couple who has to figure out how to be a good couple. It has great characters and is a great read. I highly recommend this to any fan of romance and/or humor.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "I can see how this book might be a bit too simple and boring for those who aren't a big fan of the Harry Potter series. It's really not much more than a collection of excerpts from the books and it's easy to get lost in them if you aren't already a huge fan. However, if you're a fan, you will enjoy this book, because it's got some good stories. The only complaint I have is that it's very hard to get through the entire book in one sitting." 4.5 stars:   I have been reading Harry Potter for about seven years now. I've started this series at a young age, and it was the first book I read that I really enjoyed. This is a fun little read, and the stories are good. The characters are also really well developed and have a lot of depth to them. The author is also very creative, and he really captures the feel of the characters, the books, and even the Hogwarts School itself. I recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. It is a detailed history of the first world war, but it doesn't focus on the fighting.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was the first I have ever read that dealt with the whole problem of being an atheist, which I am not. This is the kind of book I was looking for, because the author talks about it in a very interesting way, which helps to bring a fresh perspective on the subject. He also takes the time to talk about how religion, and especially Christianity, is an extremely dangerous religion. In particular, he discusses the concept of salvation, which is the idea that salvation comes only from a personal God, and that the Christian religion has a very specific view of what it means to be saved. 3 of 4 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:  The first time I read it I found myself really interested in the characters, the politics and the science. It was a nice change of pace from the usual fantasy books I read and a nice refresher on a lot of things I had been interested in.  Overall rating:    6/5 "The most terrifying thing about being an American is that you are so good at everything you don't even know you're good at anything."  -Tobias Buckell This is the first book I've read in the Broken Empire series. I was so excited to read it, as the book was based on a series of short stories by a fan-fic writer. The Broken Empire is set in a world where magic exists, but it's not in the same way as the magic in the Harry Potter books. Instead, the magic is very much "practical" and is used for "real world" things like medical treatments, military purposes and other everyday things. The story is about a young woman, Elodie, who is the daughter of an American soldier and a foreign noblewoman. She was brought up in a very strict household, which included a strict and rigid religion. The woman who raised her is dying and Elod, who has been brought up to be a "good" girl, has just been taken to a secret prison to learn how to fight. She is soon caught up in the politics of a war that will have devastating consequences for all of humanity. This book is a very well written fantasy, but with a modern twist that I haven't read before. There is a lot to like about this series. It's a good read and I highly recommend it.  If you're a fan of fantasy and military, give this a try.

His writing is beautiful, and I loved the idea of his death (I'm still wondering what he's up to), and the fact that he was the most interesting person in the world for so long.  I have a lot of other books that I've been meaning to read, but this one was one of the best books I've ever read."  -Anonymous, USA

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter books and I was ecstatic to see this book at Barnes & Noble.  This book was a bit pricey at $13 but it was well worth the price.  This book follows the adventures of Albus Dumbledore as he and Harry head off to the Wizarding World of Diagon Alley to visit Gringotts and the Malfoy's.   I'm not really sure what I thought about the book.  The story seemed to be a bit rushed and the ending seemed rather unsatisfying.  I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and this book was just too much for me to swallow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been on this path for years and I can honestly say I feel much more confident when I write. The author, K. J. Miller, has a wonderful style that makes it easy to put this book down and come back to it later. He's very precise with details and he clearly shows you the importance of getting a good, accurate, complete understanding of your goals and aspirations. The best part is, when you are done you are able to apply the information you learn. He doesn't go into great detail on how to set up a business but he gives plenty of examples. If you're not a business person then I wouldn't recommend this book but if you are and you're like me, you'll get a ton out of it. I'm going to get more into this book in my next review but I just wanted to say I really enjoyed this book and I look forward to the next book.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I loved this book. It's about a person that is very religious but doesn't believe in God. I thought it was great because he is not trying to be a "Christian" but a skeptic that really doesn't care about what you believe. He really doesn'st want you to believe in anything. I also liked the fact that he didn't have a lot of knowledge about the bible. It really made him think about things like if there really was a heaven or hell, if there's any hope in the bible, etc. I'm glad he doesn't know the answers to these things. He's a very intelligent person but he doesn 't have the answers. I didn't like how it was about the people that were in the book, not the people who were in this book, but it was interesting to read.  I am glad I bought this book for my husband who is a Christian. He was interested but the book is a great read! He will keep this book on his night stand.  and if you are a skeptick too! Great read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The New York Times book reviewer, Thomas Friedman, is a master at getting to the heart of an issue. In his review of The Little Book of Bullies, Friedman notes that, in his view, bullying is an age-old phenomenon: "Bullying is as old as human existence, the only difference being that it is usually perpetrated by people with more power and money." Bullying is, in fact, a problem of economic inequality. A 2011 study published in the American Sociological Review, "The Economic Consequences of School Disciplinary Policies," finds that, while bullying is relatively uncommon in middle and high schools, it is still very much a problem. The study, by economists William Copeland and Pauline Abernathy, finds that: In general, the proportion of students who were bullied in middle school or high school increased from 7.1% in 1986 to 8.3% in 2006, and the proportion who were the victims of physical aggression increased from 0.4% to 1.4%. While the number of bullied students has decreased, the number who were physically assaulted has increased. This pattern suggests that the overall proportion of bullied and physically abused students is higher than the proportion reported in national surveys. The findings for the most part support previous research that suggests that bullying is a problem with socioeconomic causes.  And while the study also finds that the economic status of a school's population may play a role in the incidence of bullying, they are not nearly as large as socioeconomic factors are. The authors go on to say that "The overall pattern of results is consistent with previous research and is in line with the hypothesis that the high levels of economic and social inequality are the main drivers of bullying in the school setting." In other words, it's not because students are weak or dumb that they are being bullied. It's because the wealthy are bullying the poor. The economic and cultural divide between rich and poor is a major cause of bullying. In fact, it explains a lot of what we see in our culture today: "In the United States, it has long been believed that, when economic inequality grows, social instability follows," Copeland told me. "In my own research, I have found that this is not necessarily true, and I find that social stability is higher in societies where the gap between rich, poor, and middle class is narrower." What's the solution? In the face of an increasing inequality of wealth, Friedman says, "We need to try
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________ The first chapter of the book is titled "The Art of Learning".  There are a couple of things that the author is saying that I am not quite as comfortable with.  I have a bit of a problem with the author saying that "there are a few things you can learn about people who are successful and then they teach you the same things".   This is a bit off putting to me as I am one of those people who can learn anything and I have an impressive list of accomplishments (I was a good student at school)    There are several other issues I have with this book as well.   It is a "how to" book.  I find this to be a very frustrating way to approach a book on a topic that I really want to know more about.  The author does mention a few "tricks" which are actually really interesting to me but the book as a whole doesn't really go anywhere.  There are a lot of "tutorials" which can be a great way to teach someone about something.  If you are trying to teach people something then why not just explain it to them?  The last thing I want to talk about is the lack of diversity.  It's very strange to me that a book called "How to Teach" would not be more diverse.  At the end of the day this is a book about learning.  How to learn is important but not if you aren't a diverse group of people! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a great deal of respect for the work of Dr. Fadiman, but am I the only one who is not a fan of the author's method of using statistics to support his theories?   The book is a great primer on the science of addiction and the history of addiction treatment.   Dr.Fadiman has a very clear explanation of why certain drugs, like heroin, are addictive.  The way he uses statistics to back up his argument is questionable.  I found it interesting how he uses a few different statistics to say that heroin is a "safer" drug than other drugs, but does not provide the same kind of reasoning for the different types of drugs, such as alcohol and cocaine.  While I'm not going to go into the nitty gritty details of how he's using these statistics, I can tell you that he's got it wrong.  He uses a statistic, "heroin kills more than 1 million people per year," but this statistic is based on the fact that, over the course of a year, one person dies of heroin every nine seconds.  Even though the number of heroin users per year is not that big, that's a very small number of people.  If you assume that there are about 7 million heroin users in the U.S., this means that the heroin kills roughly one person every 9 seconds. The statistic also assumes that the death of a heroin user is a one in a million chance.  A more recent statistic is that there were over 7,000 heroin-related deaths in 2007.  As you can see from this, the number is not small at all.  In any case, I do agree with Dr. Finiman that heroin should not be used recreationally, but I think that the book needs a little more background.  Overall, it is a good primer on addiction, but is very confusing and could be better if the author was a little less subjective.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very easy to read. It covers some basic information about how to use a computer. If you want to know about how the computer works, you need this book. If your interested in learning about how a computer does what it does, this book will get you started. I think this book is better than the one I have been reading recently. The author is a professor, and he knows what he is talking about. He uses words and concepts that are understandable to the layman. This book is a good starting point for anyone wanting to learn about computers. 3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book, and one that I will be recommending to friends.   I have read many books on the subject of religion in high school and college, but this one is one that sticks out in my mind as a solid read that is well-written and filled with interesting facts about Christianity.  I'm a Christian, and I know many Christians who would agree with me, but it's interesting to read about this "other" religion as well.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished reading "Spirited Away" by Hayao Miyazaki.  This book was a massive hit for me as a child, and now that I'm older I've become obsessed with the original.    "Sugoi" or "Goshujin-sama" is the name of the Japanese spirits that the main character encounters in the movie, and the story is about how he gets to know them.  In the book I got to know the characters well enough to understand why they did what they did, and why they didn't try to hide it.  The book also gave me the most awesome moment in the entire movie when the character named Nausicaa, the young heroine, gets to meet her father.  She also got to meet many other characters, who I loved, and I really hope they get to be in the next film.  As I'm not a big Miyazaki fan, I'll admit I had to look up the movie on Youtube, but if you like this book, it's worth a watch.

I've tried everything for him including painkillers, acupuncture, physiotherapy and massage. He doesn't take anything because he thinks it will make it worse. I just bought this book and it made me cry when I read the section on him, I know it is so long, but I was so happy to finally read something about a child with his condition. Thank you so much for sharing your life with this book. I really feel for your situation and your little boy and hope that he never has to go through what you went through. This book is a gift for anyone who is going through a similar situation. I'm sure there are many others like me who are going through this at this very moment.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have no problem recommending this book, but I don't know how anyone can read this book and not be impressed. This is an epic, hard-hitting history of one of the most brutal periods in American history, from the American Revolution to the Civil War.   The author is a former member of the military who became an academic and the first military historian to write a major history of the Civil war in the post-bellum period. The military historian's history was not a smooth ride. In the first chapter, he recounts his first tour of duty in the war, from Virginia to Maryland. The book's opening chapter was, for me, the most riveting part. The author is an old hand at military history and he has a lot of passion about his subject. He writes with a clear, engaging style that makes the reader care about the war and its participants. The chapters are short, to the point, and to the subject, but not dry. The stories are so vivid that the reader can't help but want to know more about the lives of the soldiers, the battles, the leadership, and the political maneuvering that lead to the end of the war. The historical research is impeccable. If you're a history buff and an advocate of the South, this book is a must-read. If not, this is a quick, informative, and fun read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good and detailed work of scholarship that deserves to be read by anyone who wants to know more about the subject of a book that claims to cover the history of the early Mormon church. The book is well-written and well-organized, and has been well-received by scholars and students alike. The author is a member of the LDS church and has written a very interesting and informative book.

It is also very well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good read. I really like the way that the story is told. It was very enjoyable and it was very interesting to read about a young man who grew up in a strict, religious family and how that changed him as he grew up. The plot was not as good as I would have hoped. However, it was still a good novel and the characters were well written and the story was interesting. The ending was also good. The story was a little confusing at times but I still liked it. Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It wasn't bad, but I just didn't enjoy the story that much.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A brilliant analysis of what makes the best sci-fi films and what makes them great movies in their own right.  -James  The science-fiction films of the 1980s are generally thought of as the best of the genre, and as a result they tend to be extremely well-written. The best of these, of course, are Blade Runner, The Terminator, Star Wars, and of course The Thing. As a result, I have a tendency to watch a lot of sci-fis that I'm not that familiar with. I'd have to say that this is the most entertaining and entertaining sci-film I've seen. I don't mean to put down all other sci-feri  [ I'm usually not a fan of sequels, and I'm also not a big fan of the prequel movies in the Alien series. But I had no trouble with Alien Covenant, so I'm going to give it a pass. It's the second time that a Prometheus film has been made and it's the first time that it's been directed by someone other than Ridley Scott. The original Alien is very well-regarded and I would definitely recommend that one if you're looking for a sci-flick. However, this movie has been very well made, so I can see why it's getting such a positive reception. The performances are great, and the script is very intelligent and well-structured. I've been a big Prometheus fan since the first movie came out and this is easily the best one yet. -Kevin

I like this book because it does not give the impression that the author is bashing the government. It doesn't make the government look good and the people in power look bad. The authors are honest and explain how money is made in a way that is easy to understand.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________ The Best Science Fiction Books of 2014 - by Mike Resnick - _______________________________________________ There's nothing like a good sci-fi book, right? And in the year of the Star Wars prequels, it's a book about time travel that's absolutely perfect: it's so exciting, it never gets boring, and it's the kind of book that will make you want to dive right in and never look back. The book has a unique story that is told in a way that's a lot of fun, but also not so easy to understand. The characters are very well developed and they feel very real and believable. If you're a big Star Wars fan, you will love this book. It's one of the best books of 2014, and I can't wait to get back to it. -- Mike Resnikoff, The Fantasy Reviewer   The Best Science-Fiction Books of the Year - by Joe R. Lansdale - ______________________________________________________________________________  A book about a time-traveling time-travelling alien race? Yes please! A book about an alien race that is, in fact, a race of time-jumpers? Yes, please! The science fiction thriller of the year? Yes! And The Best of the Best of 2014 is the best science fiction book I have ever read. The Best is a collection of ten short stories about time-pioneering aliens that make use of the latest science. The story of how they got to earth is the most interesting, and the stories that follow it are fantastic. I read all of them, and every single one was wonderful. The only criticism I can offer is that the last two stories were a little bit long, but I read them in one sitting, so maybe that's not a big deal. The whole collection is brilliant, and this is an excellent collection of stories about what science fiction has to offer in the future. -- Joe R Lansdale, The New York Times Book Review   "The Best" is the latest in a series of novels set in the time-warping future, where a race called the "Thetans" travel in time to the past, from the year 2044. (I think we're all on board with that. But it's also a year after the Battle of New York, so the book is also about a future that has a few scars from the recent past.)

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________ Hi, I'm not a big fan of horror but I had to buy this book because I have the same feeling about the movie. The book is about a little boy and his family. The little boy has been put into a foster home because of a broken leg and the mom has been diagnosed with cancer. His dad has a serious disease, which can be seen in the picture. They live in a very small house in a rural area, and the mother has had a bad heart and a lot of health problems. The mom has decided that her daughter will be adopted because she can't be a foster mom anymore. This is the beginning of a very interesting book. The parents are very caring and very sweet. The daughter, a little girl, is a little bit crazy and does not understand the world and is a trouble maker. The story gets more interesting as the story progresses and it is great to read about a family that has to deal with a lot. This book is not for everyone, but if you like the movies, you will enjoy it.

I also like that he talks about some of the different things that happen to men and how it relates to what women do in bed." *****I enjoyed this book. The author does a great job of making the point that women's behaviour is often considered as "creepy" when it is actually a lot more rational than many of us give it credit for. He also makes the point in the book that a woman's sexual behaviour is never a bad thing. So why are we so quick to say that women can't have it all? He also touches on how men can be guilty of the same behaviour, but he makes the interesting point that men are not as guilty as women.The book also gives a great overview of the history of marriage and how men and women in both cases are taught to treat sex as an essential part of their relationship.

I'm a fan of the original books, but this one is a good alternative, and it's also quite a bit different." -Sara
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________ I recently read this book after years of wanting to read a story about the Holocaust but never found one that I really liked. So I took a chance and purchased it and it really is one of the best I've read in a long time. I found it extremely absorbing and the way it was written really captured my attention. The author, Robert Rozett is a very good writer and a very decent historian and I highly recommend this book. If you're looking for a good history book about the Shoah, this is a good one.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________  My brother, brother-in-law and I recently purchased the book "The World's Most Dangerous Place" by Robert Caro. I have to admit I wasn't familiar with Caro prior to this book but it was clear that he has done an excellent job of explaining the many facets of the CIA. As a person that is well versed in all aspects of the U.S. government, I have always had a good amount of respect for it and I was surprised at how well Caro was able to portray this organization and its activities. It is obvious that the CIA is a very evil organization that does a lot of things that make people wonder why they should still have any respect for the CIA and its operations.   I have to say that the most shocking part of this book is the cover up and how they managed to get away with it for so long. I don't think I could have imagined that there was anything more evil than the CIA but, of course, there is. It was really interesting reading about the way the CIA operates. It doesn't take long to understand the real motives behind the CIA operations and the way they try to cover up the information they collect and store on people.  ....  The book was a lot more interesting than I thought it would be. Caro has a good grasp on the world of intelligence, the many types of operatives and their different missions, and how it all works. He covers everything you could want to know and he does it in a way that's not so obvious as to be boring. I think this is a great read and I recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about the world's most evil organization.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the first book in this series. I don't normally read sci-fi, but I really enjoyed this one. The characters are really well developed.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  "This book is not just another retelling of the same old tale." -- Richard Dolan, author of "The Book of the Devil"  The Story of The Devil in Black, by David W. Collins (Paperback)  This is a first-rate book, a true-life account of one of the most extraordinary, and frightening, crimes of modern times: a serial killer known as "The Demon from the Black Lagoon" who terrorized the New Orleans area in the 1920s and 1930s, terrorizing women and children, and ultimately killing one of his victims. He was never caught, and the killer went on to commit other crimes for which he was not convicted. His name is Louis "Leprechaun" Z. Boudreaux.  In the early 1930s Boudreau was a successful Louisiana businessman who had a habit of using his money to take out loans, and then disappearing with the money. In 1935, he applied for a loan to finance the construction of a railroad, and used his money from the loan to pay for the construction. However, the bank was having trouble getting the loan and Boudrault disappeared. The bank found Boudrerault's signature on several checks that had been written on his behalf. The checks had been deposited in the name of a girl named "Geraldine." Boudrey was arrested in New Orleans in 1936 and charged with embezzlement and grand larceny, but he had been living under an assumed name and he fled to Texas. ,  ,
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I was not impressed by this book, as the authors do not provide any solid arguments to support their arguments. Instead, the authors take a simple argument, which is the existence of the god of the bible, and build a model that has absolutely no basis in the text. The authors then argue that the evidence of a god's existence is not sufficient to prove his existence."

"No one who has ever seen the great tennis player serve in person, or has seen the greatest of them serve on a hard court, will ever forget what it is like to watch the old man at work. He has the grace and the power and the dexterity that only the old can possess. He knows the laws of the game, has the patience and the patience of a saint, and yet it is always the same sort of thing: he is playing a game which is the very soul of the sport."   — John McEnroe   "... the most complete, precise, and convincing tennis book ever written."   to be continued
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was great. I'm a fan of the Cthulhu Mythos and have enjoyed reading all the Cthulhu books that have been written so far. This one was definitely different from the others. It was well written and the characters were well-developed. I'd recommend it to anyone that likes to read about a bunch of different types of monsters. I enjoyed the different worlds and the different monsters within the Mythos. I would definitely read more of this series!

A very satisfying book!"  -S.K.   My review:   "I am an old science fiction and fantasy book reader. I have tried to read a few of the older authors but found it difficult to follow. In the meantime, I discovered the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises and fell in love with their stories. When I heard that the second book in the series would be titled The Phantom Menace I jumped on it immediately. I enjoyed it much more than I expected. I would like to know how the first book is going to compare to the second. I do think that the author does not know the series and it is a shame because the stories are really good."  --S.B.  .

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________  "This book has had a major impact on my life. I have not been able to read this book without feeling like I have been touched by God. It has been a blessing and a curse that I have found this book. I read this as a child and my family has always been Catholic, but when I found the Bible at a church book sale, I was instantly drawn to it and have loved reading it ever since. I just wish I had found it years ago.   I am very glad I read the book. It is so full of information. I can't wait for the second edition. The stories in the Bible are some of the most amazing things I have ever read. This book is full of great stories and the illustrations are so beautiful. I cannot wait to see what will happen in the next few chapters!"   Review from a Bookstore Customer: _______________  When my wife first got the Bible, she was so shocked and shocked at what she read. I've been through it and I have read a lot of what the Bible says about God and His relationship with us and how to be a good Christian.   The thing is, I can still read the Bible and I know God's love for me. I know that my sins are forgiven because of Jesus' sacrifice. I see God's plan for my life and my soul. The book is amazing! I highly recommend it!"

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ I've been looking for a good sci-fi novel that isn't too hard to get through and this is one of them. The story is well paced and the action sequences are good, though there is a slight lack of suspense in them. I'm sure if you're a sci-fis fan you'll enjoy it. If you're not, then you should probably steer clear of this one.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book and a great read. This book is filled with the stories of the brave, those who risk their lives in the name of freedom. I have read many of the other books written by other authors on the same topic but this one is different.  I am a little embarrassed to admit that I do not know who the author is. I read this book when it came out in the 1980's and found it to be a very good read.  There are many books written about the war in Viet Nam, but few about the heroes and brave men who went to that horrible war.  It is a wonderful book that tells a great story about what happened in Viet Nam.   I highly recommend this book and all the other brave men that risked their lives to help their country and the freedom that they fought to protect.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is the first book I've read by a woman who has written about feminism, and it is a refreshing change of pace.   It is written in the style of a feminist history text, but is also written in a way that a general reader would understand.  In other words, this book is a history book, but not of feminism.  If you like history books, this is a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ This is one of those rare books that is both an entertaining read and a brilliant treatise on the nature of our civilization. In this case, the treatise is on how our civilization was built by people who, although intelligent, had a lack of imagination about the world they were creating. For example, they knew that a few hundred years ago the Earth was covered with forests, but in the 1800s they were building roads to move cattle over them and they had not bothered to think how forests might grow back after the roads were gone. It's funny how much things change in just a few centuries. This book is also a brilliant commentary on how technology is destroying the planet. One of the most obvious examples is the way that new technologies are replacing the use of natural resources. For instance, it's hard to believe that someone who thinks that nature is the greatest resource on the planet has been driving a Prius instead of a bus. The book also discusses how the industrial revolution and its associated population explosion created an unsustainable economic system that has resulted in a decline in quality of life and a huge environmental problem. The author also explores some other important topics in the book that are worth mentioning: how the Internet is helping to bring down traditional religion; how the decline of the birth rate is leading to a mass increase in welfare-dependent people; and how the internet has created a massive new marketplace for illegal drugs. This is an extremely important book that anyone interested in history and in the future of our species should read. It is an excellent example of how people can be so wrong about the future that they can be wrong about how the past has changed.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________ This is a good little book about an atheist who becomes a Christian (and becomes a really good Christian). If you have a weak stomach, read the book without the biblically correct information, but be prepared for the good book! I'm sure that there are a few people who will enjoy this book, but I found myself constantly rereading it just to catch up on all the little details I missed the first time around. I really enjoyed the humor of it all, and the fact that it doesn't just cover the Bible but goes all the way down to the origins of all life on Earth. I'd say that it's one of the funniest books I've read in a long time, and it will definitely make you smile.  Rating:5   Review by: Mark on June 01, 2006 :  I read the review and thought "Yeah, I should read it." But I just couldn't get through the beginning (it's not easy for me to do), so I didn't. I did read a lot of the rest, though. It was good, and I'm glad I read it. .  the book is good but it is very repetitive and boring, but if you want to learn more about how Christianity came about and why it is the only true religion, you'll get your money's worth here, I'll give it a 5  .
Write a positive review about a good book:    "In this new edition of the classic, a new edition is necessary: an old version too often falls into the trap of "reading too much into it," as in "a true novel," or even "the best novel ever written," as with the title of David Foster Wallace's new book. But in fact this is a book that reads well and is as much a pleasure to read as any of Wallace's earlier books."   —Peter F. Hamilton, The New York Times   "...a masterly blend of fiction and history... [a] tour de force... A brilliant and well-researched examination of the literary and historical origins of the novel... A book worth reading."   I'm very impressed with the book, and I recommend it to all of those interested in the novel. I also recommend it highly to anyone who loves Wallace.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be an interesting read, but I found it to be more of a "how to" book rather than an actual "how" book. The author did provide a lot of information in the beginning and I did find myself wanting to take notes while reading, but the information was not presented in a way that made it easy to remember or understand. The book did give a lot about the basics of building a system, but then it stopped short of actually covering the system itself. The information was presented in an interesting way, but it was not as helpful as it could have been. The end result was that I was left with a lot more questions than I had answers. This book may be useful for some people, but for the most part, it is more of an "how-to" book that gives you the foundation to build your own system.

Pepinsky The Power is not just a book about the power of the human mind; it is also a book that is a "must read" for all of us in the political, economic, and scientific communities. It is an essential book to any serious student of the political and economic implications of a global power shift that is now underway. Pepinksy, a veteran of the Department of Defense and the CIA, gives us a great deal of detail in this book on the various components of power and how they can be exploited to improve our lives. The Power takes the reader into the realm of politics, economics, science, history, technology, military strategy, and military history. It does not leave out the more esoteric but important and important subjects of the occult, the occult world, spirituality, and esoteric philosophy. Pepinkys book is not only a great read, it is a book which will provide you with a more complete picture of how power works in our world. It will also help you to better understand the history of the power shift and how power has been used by those in power to achieve their own ends. The power of power is a concept which has been very well understood throughout history, and which Pepinsky demonstrates brilliantly. _________________________ A great book, for anyone with an interest in power.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  When I first read this I was completely confused. I thought the author was a journalist or a writer, but he was talking about a religious group in America. The story of their history and their current situation was fascinating, and I really enjoyed it. The book also had a lot of information about how people have reacted to the sect.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________ I'm an old time comic book fan, and my favorite comic book series is the X-Men. This book is a wonderful look into the character, and the art is beautiful. My only criticism is the last three issues where they show some of the characters as teenagers and then the book ends on "The End". It's a nice little story, but it's the last story arc that is left out that I found really disappointing. I'd recommend this to any X-Fans and anyone looking for a good look into X-Factor's back story.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic. I bought it for a few reasons. First off, the author is a friend. This was a very good book to share with a friend, one that the author has also written. Second, it's a "how to" book. It's a little bit like "How to Be a Gentleman." It's not really about that though. This book is about living a good life. It talks about how to find your inner "grit" and how to manage your time and what not to do when you're overwhelmed. The author also talks about what life is like for a "high maintenance" woman. It explains what makes a good man, and what makes for a good woman. The book is written very well, with lots of examples and advice. Overall, I really like this book. 2 of 3 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book, and it's a good example of a book about magic and science. The worldbuilding is pretty good, and the magic system is pretty interesting and the characters are interesting. I liked how the magic was done. The magic is usually done with a special stone, and is generally not very practical. In this book there are a few cases where the stone isn't enough. The book is very well written, and has good plot twists. I did have a few issues with the magic, however. The first time I was forced to make a choice I didn't like it. I was making a choice between two men. Both were men I really liked. One of them, I thought was the better man. I could've made a choice and the book would've been better, but the author didn't give me a choice. The second time was in a quest for knowledge. I don't know why I didn''t like this choice, but I didn ''t like it either. The author also forgot to give me the option to make my choice before I left. I also felt that there were a lot of mistakes. There are several instances of a character saying the wrong thing, or not giving me the information I needed, or taking information from another source and presenting it wrong. I have also noticed a few inconsistencies in the plot, and I think these are just the author''s mistakes. Overall, this was a good read. It's not as good as the first book, but it's still good.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I have been reading this book for about a week. It is the first one I've read in a long time. The writing style is simple and clear. I have read a lot of romance books in my life and I love the romance in this one. The characters are very interesting and interesting to read about. They all have their own traits that make them unique. The story is interesting. There is a mystery that is solved at the end of the book. The ending of the story is very unexpected. It's a good ending to a good romance book. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Art of the New Millennium by George Orwell (2012)  is an interesting book on political thought, philosophy, and the nature of freedom.  While the book is written in a style which can be difficult to read, it is worth reading.  The author, George Orwell, is an author who has been influential in modern history.   He is considered to be one of the greatest writers of the 20th century.  Orwell is known for his novel, Animal Farm, which he wrote in 1949.  The book is a satire on the Russian Revolution, as well as other countries.  While Animal Farm was written at a time where the USSR was still a superpower, the book has become more relevant today.  In Animal Farm, the main characters, the pigs, are slaves to the humans in their care.  They are used to do things that are unnecessary or undesirable, and in doing so, the humans take advantage of the pigs.  Animal Farm  contains a number of references to other political ideas as well.  For instance, a character in the book speaks about the importance of freedom of speech.  This freedom is used by the humans to take advantage on the pigs by saying or doing things they would not say or do in a similar situation.  These political ideas were often referenced in the early years of Animal Farm.  The main character, Winston Smith, also has a large number of political views that the author considered important, such as a belief in a single-party state.  As a political philosopher, Orwell was also critical of the British monarchy.  He believed that the monarchy should be abolished as a form of government.  There are also a number more political views in the text, such the belief that freedom of religion was not necessarily a good thing, or that the welfare of the animals should not be a priority. The book was very popular at the time, and is still read by many people today. 4. The Dark Side of the Moon by Aldous Huxley (1957)   Aldous is an English author, best known for Brave New World.  He was also the author of other books, such A Brave New Word (1924) and The Road (1928).  Hux- ly's The Dark Moon was a book that was written in 1957.  It was Huxly's first novel, and it is set in a futuristic world, where people live in a society

Write a positive review about a good book:  A must read book about the early development of the Soviet military, and a must have for anyone interested in military history. It's about the development of tanks, artillery, aircraft, and other forms of mechanized forces from 1918 to 1945.  This book is the real history of Soviet tanks.  You'll never be able to find this book at a used bookstore.  The Soviets had two important innovations that have changed how we think about modern warfare. The first is the idea that tank crews should have individual training to ensure they can be effective in combat. The second is the "gun crew" concept of gunners in the turret.  In the book, the authors take a look at these concepts in their development, as well as how the Soviets used them in their tank battles. This book will be useful to those who are familiar with the topic of tank combat, as the authors present some great examples of what they mean by "tanks" and "gun crews."  This book is about the history of the tank, and the development from WWI to WWII, and it is also the history that the modern tank was born out of. The authors give a good overview of the history, as they go through the stages of development from 1918-1945.   This book provides a good explanation of how the tank was designed, and how the development went into the creation of a truly successful and modern tank. This is a must read for anyone with an interest in military warfare, and history of tanks.  The author takes a look in the development and the history behind the T-34, T-54, and T-62, and also how these tanks were used in the Korean War, in Vietnam, and during the Cold War.  This is an important book for anyone who is interested in tank history, and especially for those interested in tanks in WWI, WWII, Korea, and Vietnam.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a great read and very informative. I would definitely recommend this book to others.

Read the review about the book:  "If you're interested in the history and evolution of the United States Navy, and you want to learn more about the sailors, the ships, the equipment, and the people, this is a book you need to read. The Navy has long been one of the most influential forces in world history, and it's easy to see why. "
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am extremely impressed with this book. This is a must read for any history buff and history buffs of all stripes.     This book is a wonderful book and has a lot to offer.   It's not the book you'd want to read if you're a complete novice. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I'm so pleased I bought this book, I've been reading it all winter and I just got back from visiting my sister who lives in Canada, and she had this book on her shelf, and was looking at it. I had to buy it! I really liked this book and it was well written. I'd highly recommend this book. -------------------------- It was a great book, it really showed how important the church is to our society, we are a part of this world, and I think we should take the time to know who we are and what we stand for.  I'm a little scared to see how they're going to react and I hope the world is not turned into hellfire.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I read this book because I had just started reading the Harry Potter series, and my friend had recommended this book as a good read. *********   I thought I was going to hate this book. I'm not sure what it was, but I didn't. I loved it. It was a good way to end the series. I think the only thing I didn?t like was that it seemed like they?d just keep on going and going, even if I didn&t want to. But the good thing about this book is that you do have time to really just enjoy it. And I really can?t imagine this ending any other way.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have just finished reading the latest edition of The Encyclopedia of the Mormon Battalion by William J. Hamblin. I have been searching for this book for a very long time, but I always had a hard time finding it. Now, I can get the book at a very reasonable price.   The book is a great resource for those who are interested in the Mormon War, especially for those interested in what the Battalion's experience was like.  The book is extremely well researched and I particularly like the information about the various people who served in the Battalion. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the book. Read this book to learn:  The Mormon Battalion's experiences on the Utah-Arizona border during the Utah War.  What they experienced, what they did, and what happened to them.  The LDS Church's position regarding the Battalion:   From the time the Battalion left Nauvoo, Joseph Smith was very concerned that the men would not return home because they would have been "burned" by the state.   The Nauvoos did not return the Battalion and they never found the men.  The Church did not make much of an effort to support the Battalion for fear of a loss of members and money.  In the end, however, the Battalion played a very important role in Utah history.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was introduced to this book by a friend who also loved the book. I was excited to read it. The stories were interesting and well written. The characters were well drawn.   The characters are mostly about an older man and a younger woman. The older man has a wife and son. They live in a small town with a lot of jobs and a lot to do. They have to work to help make ends meet. He works for a company that does work to keep a small village going. The daughter is a teenager and works part time for a small business. She also works with her older brother.  , but I really liked the older woman. She has a great sense of humor and a great understanding of people. She's also a very strong woman. Her husband is a little too uptight and she makes him work out his problems. I liked the way the husband and daughter were set up. They had some great chemistry.  The characters were pretty much the best part of this book.   I'm glad I picked up this book!

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________. I have been reading this book for many years and finally found the right one. My favorite part is the fact that it is written in the second person. I like this way of writing because it is like I'm the one in the middle. The main character is not the hero of the story. He is the one who has to fight against his inner demons. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes good literature and has a good sense of humor. It is a good read for those who are into horror, dark stories, suspense, and the macabre. I think this book will be a classic."

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the best book I've read for the past 2 years, and I've been reading for a long time. It's an easy read and I think that's what makes it great: the author explains his theories on the nature of intelligence and why we are smart, while he provides a scientific explanation of how this works. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how we think, how we learn, and how our brains work.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first half of this book is a very detailed description of the way a nuclear-powered submarine would work. The author provides some good insight as to how nuclear propulsion works and some of the issues with maintaining it. It gives a very good idea of how nuclear submarines would work and how a nuclear reactor would be constructed. The other half of the book is about the submarine and its crew. The submarine itself is pretty impressive. There are some great photos and drawings, and the design looks like something you'd see on a spaceship or a fighter plane. The crew is also impressive. The stories of the crew's experiences and the challenges they face are all very believable.   I also really enjoyed reading about the technical side of the operation.  The book was a bit dry at times but the details were interesting and I could definitely see the advantages of a nuclear power plant. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a really great read!  I'm a big fan of the series, and this is a wonderful sequel to the first book, which is a great read too.  As the title implies, it's about a young girl who can see auras (she calls them 'beacons'), and the boy who was taken from her by her mother.  "My parents were good people.  They loved me and taught me how to be a good person."
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Great Escape  is a classic novel by H.G. Wells that I was afraid to read. But, I enjoyed it! It's set in the 1890's in a fictionalized version of the United States that was going through a period of industrial revolution. In the book, there are a lot of good ideas, but it's not the best novel ever. It's a great book, though.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been a fan of The New York Times for a long time and was excited to see this one. This book, while well written, didn't have a lot of depth to it, and it is very hard to put into words just what it's about. The main character, Harry, is a high school student who is trying to deal with the death of his best friend, and the loss of his mother, and his own feelings of inadequacy. The book is told from Harry's point of view, and as the author does not go into much detail about the actual events, you have to read the book in order to get a good idea of what happened. I would recommend this book for people who are looking for a good read. It's a good story, and there is some real life lessons in it. I'm sure there are plenty of people who have read this book, and are disappointed with the end result.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. It's an incredibly insightful read. I think it's very interesting to read about what life is like for people who are in a situation like his. I'm not saying that life isn't hard. Life is very hard. But the book does a really good job of describing the ways in which his life became more difficult and the challenges he faced as he faced them. The ending was very satisfying. Overall, a very well-written and well-rounded book that's worth reading.  26 of 28 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I read the first few chapters before I bought it, but then the story caught me. It's not really a romance, but the main character is really nice and there's some nice flirting in it. This is one of the few romance books I've read that's really good. I also like the idea of the characters in the future having children. It might be a little over the top, but it's interesting and it's a nice change of pace from all the other action novels I've been reading lately. I really like it.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  There are a lot of good books out there, but there's one that I keep coming back to: It's All About You, by Mary Pipher. I'm not sure how long I've been a reader of Pipher's writing (since I was only a teenager when the book first came out), but every time I do, it's a pleasure. This is one of the most entertaining, funny and heartfelt books I've ever read. The humor is just so good. The characters are all believable, and the story is so well-written and poignant.   It is really just a pleasure to read. I don't even have to look up words to make sense of what's going on. There's just a nice balance between the funny and the poignant. Pipher also has a gift for writing about life, and I just can't say enough good things about this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book, the style is beautiful, and the author is very good at showing you the world through the eyes of her characters. I particularly like that she gives you a very detailed view of the characters, who are a diverse mix of people, including a human, a horse, and a magical creature. The writing is very clear and the book makes it easy to visualize what is happening in the world and in the minds of the people in it. 3 out of 5 stars:    The book is good but the characters are terrible. I'm sorry but I can't read this book as a story, I don't like the world they live in, they all seem to think they are so much better then everyone else. I hate that all of the good people are the ones who don't have their own stories. 2 out of 3 stars: The story is well told, but it does suffer from a large number of characters, which is a little confusing at times. 1 out of 1 stars:
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good summary of the history of Western Christianity. There are many good chapters in the book, and the author does an excellent job of explaining why some churches have lost their way, and why other churches have a clear understanding of God and Jesus. The author does a good job of showing why the church is important, and how the Church is in danger of becoming irrelevant. The book is not perfect, and has many weaknesses that need to be addressed. However, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history and theology of the Christian church.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________. I read this book for the first time last week and have to say that it was one of my favorites of all time. The premise is simple enough - one night a man finds out his wife has had a sex change and is going to take his child to live as a boy. She is the kind of woman that will do anything to get the boy. The story is told in first person, and while not a perfect read, I can definitely say that this is a great book. This is one of those books that I have on my bookshelf and I find myself re-reading it just to remember the good old days. It's a fun read and is well worth the read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good story and good characters.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********** This book is a good one. If you like fantasy books this is one you should read. I do recommend this book to everyone who likes fantasy. I would recommend this to a friend who is new to reading and loves to read. This book does a great job of introducing the characters and setting up the world. The only problem I had with the book was that I could have used a little more information on the characters. I liked the way they presented themselves but I was still confused about some things. I really wanted to know more about the background of some of the characters like the king and the wizard and the queen. The world building is great but the characters just don't add enough depth to make the story worth reading.

The fishing section is very informative and has a lot of pictures of all the different types of fishing rods you can purchase. There are several ways to make the fishing rod, and the pictures show the different parts, such as the reel, rod and the bait. It has a little history as well.   the book has a very easy to understand layout. It was not too difficult to read, but it took a little time to get the hang of it. The photos are good as well, and there are two different chapters on different species of fish, with pictures and the information that you need to know.

The book is written in a very accessible style, and offers a good and clear discussion of the many different schools of astrologers and the controversies surrounding them. The most interesting aspect of the book is its discussion of astrological history, and how the subject has come to be viewed as a'scientific' enterprise.

It is a well-crafted tale of a time before the arrival of the internet.  It shows us how people really used to communicate and work together.  I loved the idea that the Internet did not exist in this world.  The only difference is that people used the internet as they had done in the past.  This book also gives a good perspective on the impact that the internet has on society today.  Highly recommended.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's funny.  There's a great story in here about the origins of the internet and the early days of the World Wide Web. Â I'm a huge nerd and this book is one of my favorite examples of science fiction, which is a genre that's a bit weird but fun to read.  4 stars " The Internet was a vast, sprawling, chaotic, and complex place when the Web first began to appear in the late 1990s, but in many ways it was not even that far from the old ways of doing business. There was no clear legal structure to govern the Web, and no one had a good handle on how it would affect business. No one had figured out how to handle the influx of new data from all over the world. Nobody had yet figured out exactly how much traffic would be coming to Web sites all the time, or how to deal with the steady flow of requests for information, or the sheer amount of information that would have to be stored and retrieved. And yet, the Internet grew and grew, and it was, for the most part, successful. It was a great triumph of the free market and innovation. There's something about the way that business has handled the Internet over the past few decades that I find deeply disturbing.  The Web's success, in other words, was built on a foundation of shoddy and exploitative business practices, the very same kinds of practices that are driving the current economic collapse." - "We're in the middle of a massive experiment in innovation," says Mattel, "a market experiment in how the world will function."  - "There's no way to know whether the web will have the impact on the economy that the economy has had on other technologies over the last few decades, but there's a good chance that it will." - Mattel's "The Internet is a Business" ad, 1994
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ This book is a classic and a must have in any library. I was in the Army for over 6 years, but I still have many questions about how it was that my regiment fought in the desert during Desert Storm. The book covers the history of the Army and its relationship to the US Department of Defense and the National Guard. The Army used to have many different units with different roles. They were very specialized in what they did. The US Army has evolved into something that is quite complex. They do a lot of different things with different units. The author shows how the army was able to create an Army that had the right amount of firepower to be effective in all areas of warfare. The unit that I served in, the 82nd Airborne Division, was considered to be the strongest of all the Army divisions. I highly recommend this book.  Review by: John F. I bought the book a few years ago and just finished reading it today. I am a member of the National Military Family Association (NMFA) and am a retired Army Ranger. This book covers a great deal of information about the National guard. It has a good mix of facts, anecdotes, and interesting stories from the National Guardsman's experience.   I learned many new things about my National Guard units that I never knew. I never understood why our Guardsmen were always in such great shape. I'm not sure if it was the Army or the Guardsmen who were doing the fitness program. It seemed that the Army was the one who had the fitness programs. I did know that they did a lot to improve the physical conditioning of the Guard, but the Guard did not seem to do that much to improve its soldiers. One of the things that surprised me was the fact that the Guardsman were so well disciplined. There is no doubt that they are a hard working people, but they seem to have very few problems. I believe that the Guard is a force for good and that the men in the Guard are doing their best to keep the country safe.  and thank you for the book.   is the best book I have ever read about the Guard. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the role and capabilities of our Guard and Reserve components.  is a book that I will have to use again and again. I have learned a lot from this book, especially about my unit, and I believe it is a valuable contribution to the understanding of our National Guard and Army
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________ This book is a great resource for those interested in the history of Mormonism. It's written very well, with a clear and easy-to-understand narrative, and the author does an excellent job of explaining things, such as the reason for Joseph's polygamy, in a way that is understandable without losing a single page. _________________________________________________ I'm a convert from a former LDS faith, and I've been thinking about the history a lot.  This book makes a very strong case for why it is that I'm no longer a Mormon.  It is the only book I have ever read that actually makes the case for the restoration, even if it is somewhat confusing.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've had the pleasure of reading a few of the novels by the prolific John Scalzi, and I can say with complete certainty that they are one of the most enjoyable reads I've ever had the privilege of reading.  They are written with an engaging sense of humor and an original viewpoint, which makes them a must-read for sci-fi fans, as well as a great introduction to Scalzi's work.    This review will focus primarily on the two most recent novel, but I will also mention the other three books.  This is the story of a young man, Jake, and his struggle to get out of a life of prostitution in a futuristic New York City.  The story opens with the narrator walking through a subway station, as he contemplates the nature of the universe: "And it came to pass, that as I walked through that subway station I began to think of the infinite. It was as if time itself had come to life and began to spin its endless circles around the station."   I had no idea what he was talking about, and was a bit put off at the time by it, but it is something I've been thinking about lately as I watch the news.  "The universe has a funny habit of coming to life around you," as they say.  And the narrator's thoughts continued, as if he were the only person to have ever experienced this: "I began to wonder if the universe had a sense of humour. And then I thought about the fact that the universe has only existed for as long as it takes for something to come to be. So if there is anything that's eternal, why would it want to make itself?   And so I began walking.  But then the universe made itself and I was suddenly at the bottom of the world and I started to wonder about the people in it."  This sounds a bit like the beginning of an episode of Futurama, doesn't it?  It's a fun little thought experiment, and a fun way to get a perspective on our world.  I would have loved to have had a bit more of this conversation with the character before he was forced to return to his old life.  Another cool thing about the story is the fact it's written in the first person, which allows the narrator to really go off into the world that he's creating.  This is what I love about John Scalzys writing style, because he

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book about being a polyamorous person that I have ever read. I have known many poly people who are great people.  But they have one problem:   They're all closeted.   I've never known anyone who is so secretive that they wouldn't tell anyone.  To be honest, I've never been as close to a poly person as I am with this book.  It's just a very good book that will help you to learn a lot.  Thank you, Mr. Evert.  1)  If you want to get a more complete poly picture,  this is a great book to read.  2)   This book is the first book I've read that talks about the challenges poly people face when they want to date a woman, but they're all afraid of being judged.  3)  There's a lot of great advice in this book, from how to communicate to how to be a good partner to being an ally.  4)  If you're thinking about poly,     you'll want to read this book because it will help clear up a lot  of confusion that might arise.

Write a positive review about a good book:   My first encounter with this book came through a series of recommendations on Goodreads by a very nice friend. I was skeptical at first because it's a fairly self-explanatory concept, and I tend to be wary of self-help books. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I thought I was going to be disappointed by the "simple" solutions that she offered. But I was not. Instead, I found myself feeling the need to work on my own personal development through this book and its principles.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about their own development. It was not just a self-improvement book; it was a book that really helped me understand my own motivations and beliefs about what it is that I want in life. The book did not try to convince me that I was right, or that I need to change; rather, it simply provided me with information to help me decide what I wanted in life, and how I wanted to get there. I think that this is the type of book that will be very helpful for anyone who is looking to figure out what they want to do with their life.  -Jasmine, April 15, 2017

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- ------------------------- I don't have the time to read as much as I'd like, so I decided to get a copy of this book so I can read it on the train to work. I'm a little disappointed with the book as a whole. The author does a decent job of explaining the concept of the series, but it's very hard to follow along with the story when the book goes into a long discussion of what makes a book a good one. It's a very complex book, and the author is quite skilled at making it easy to follow. But I would have liked more focus on the characters, as it seems the author was going for a deeper, more complex story. I feel that the author has a good grasp on the story, but the story and the characters are just too tangled to make it into my top five books. --------------------------- Review: ------------------------------ I loved this book. I read this on a plane in the middle of the night and I finished it in the afternoon on the plane back to America. This is a book that I recommend to all of my friends who are reading this series, and I recommend it highly to all you fantasy readers out there. The worldbuilding is superb and the worldbuilding was perfect for a series set in the near future. The characters were well developed and well written, the world building was complex, and it was exciting. The plot was fantastic. The ending was perfect. The book is the perfect length, and there's just so much to read that I don`t think you could ever get bored. It takes a while to get going, but once you do you're in for a wonderful ride. I`ll definitely be picking up the next book in the series in the next few weeks. ------------- Recommended: -------------------------------
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is good. There are several parts to the story that were not completely enjoyable. One of them was a character who was supposed to be a main character who never seemed to show up in any of the later books. That was not an issue for me, but the character I was never completely sold on. The second part was a short story called "I am not sure I believe you" which is about a guy that has been trying to become a vampire but can't seem to. The last story in the book is an epic in the same vein as the other two, but I was not able to get into it.  I'm glad that I read this book because it was very informative about vampires and was a great read! 9/10

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a really good book on the topic of the "Gandhi Effect" and is really fun to read. I loved this book. I think it's great for anyone who's interested in understanding why the media has been so bad to Gandhi and his supporters. I think I have finally read the book that explains why Gandhi was a complete and utter failure as a political leader. If you've read any of his books, this book should make you re-evaluate your view on him. This book was fun and I am glad I finally read it. I also found the author to be very well researched and very knowledgeable on the subject. The only negative I can give about this book is that the author seems to have been writing about the same subject since the 90s. The fact that it is more than twenty years old means that there are a lot of errors in it and the author can get a little over-enthusiastic. If anyone knows a better book about the "effect" than this one, please let me know!

The book also has a really interesting way of presenting history in an accessible way. I really liked that the story was told from the perspective of the protagonist, as if he were narrating his own life story. This is a great book and worth reading if you're a history buff.
Write a positive review about a good book:        The Black Tapes is a good read.   In the first chapter, she introduces the protagonist, David. He is a "cognitively impaired" black man living in a poor, segregated community.  The story follows him as he struggles to cope with a new life in the city.  She describes David as a man with a "mixed and complicated racial heritage," and the first thing that comes to mind is the book was written by a black man, so this makes me think of the author as being a black writer.  I'm glad that this book exists, because it helps me understand the black community a little better.  Her prose is easy to read, with just enough information to make the story interesting. I'm looking forward to reading the next book.  The Black-Taped Man is a very interesting read. It gives you a very real look at a young black man in the late 60's.  David is a man who has had to adapt to the "new world" of Chicago and become a man.  His family has a very hard time adjusting to the new life and David himself struggles to adapt.  He has to learn how to behave in a different way, learn how not to be so easily upset and he is also forced to deal with the "injustice" of being treated like a black person.  One of the themes of this book is that there is more to a black American then the color of his skin.  In this way, the story makes you think about racism and it gives you an understanding of how people act when they are feeling under pressure.  This book also is a great read because the author explores the black American experience in a way that many people don't get to read.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________.   "The best book ever written about sex. You will love this book." -A.S. (Author)   ______________________________________________________   This book is written from a female point of view, but you won't find any of the sexual myths and stereotypes you are used to reading in romance novels. The book is easy to read and easy to understand. It contains information about every aspect of sex: how it works, what makes it so special, what it does to you, why some women have such a hard time getting started, how to be happy with your partner, and much more. This is not just a book about sex but also about the female psyche.   of course, the book is not perfect. For one, the author tends to write in the third person, so some of the dialogue can be a little stilted and awkward. I think the writer should have used first person instead. Other than that, the writing is very clear and the ideas are very logical and easy for you to understand! This book will not only get you thinking about sex, but it will make you feel like a sex expert. This book is definitely for women who are interested in learning more about sex as well as those who are already familiar with it, but have never delved into it. This one is not only for you, but for the men who are looking for something new in a romance novel.

I've always liked the books written by Hines and have enjoyed them on a number of occasions. I'm not sure why I thought this book would be any different. I expected a more in depth look into the experiences of these men, a little more in-depth research, more of the same (although this book is more of an essay and less a book), and maybe a little less of the war-mongering. But I was very pleasantly surprised! This book was a breath of fresh air in the world of military memoirs. This book is written in a manner that is casual, honest, and easy to read. It was a very enjoyable read and I highly recommend it. I'd love to see a follow-up book!

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________ This book was a wonderful addition to my collection of "how to" books for my two year old. This book is a great read for anyone who wants to start a toddler's development in math, language, and reading. The author takes a very scientific approach and shows you exactly what to do to help your toddler develop math and reading skills. The book is broken down into 4 chapters. The first chapter starts with a general overview of math. Each chapter is devoted to teaching one of 4 skills: counting, identifying numbers, making numbers, and using numbers to solve problems. Each skill has a number of exercises. These exercises include counting on the fingers, using the number of fingers to count, and identifying the size of a number. The exercises are short and to the point. For example, one set of exercises teaches counting by 10s. The number of 10s in the beginning of the number is the number you will be using in the end. In the end, you are going to use the number that is in the middle of the 10s, and then count from the end of the ten to get to the beginning. Then the other exercises in the book show you how to identify the 10 and 11 by the way they look on the number. This is a fun book to teach math to your toddler. The chapters are a little hard to follow at times because there are lots of pictures and diagrams. But once you get into the book and start to follow along, it is a nice easy read.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________   "There is a certain quality to the stories in The Dark Tower that makes them feel like a whole, like a unified work. They're not all connected to one another, but when the stories connect, it is for a reason. It is because they all have a common theme: "The End of the World" is a phrase that echoes throughout the series, but in different forms. There are many tales of the coming End, but "The Gunslinger" is the only one that actually feels like it could be coming. This is a good thing." --Book Riot (Read full review)   The Dark Tower is the greatest book series of all time. The Dark Man, the last of a line of great gunslingers, faces an End of World. But what comes next is far more sinister than anything he's ever seen.   In the beginning, we learn that Roland is the Last of the Gunslingers. But this is not an ordinary line of gunslinging sons of guns. This gunslinger has seen the End, and the End is coming soon. And he is not prepared. The Last of The Gunslinging Men is not afraid to use extreme means to prevent the End of all things. He is not the best at what he does, but he is the one with the most to lose.
Write a positive review about a good book: **********   This book was an absolute blast. It's so much fun to read about the crazy adventures of an adventurer who has just arrived at the town of Nulb. He has a huge ego and is so convinced he is the best, which is not so easy to deal with when he's on a quest to rescue a princess. The book was full of twists and turns that were very exciting and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good adventure book.   The only thing that I disliked was the book's length. The first two-thirds of the book was a very long way to go to rescue the princess. It was definitely worth the effort though!

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________   This book is a masterpiece. I read it in two sittings (and my mind was blown the second time) and I love this book. It is a very interesting history about the people who created the modern day empire of the USA. There are a lot of interesting facts and interesting details about the founding of the country and their role in it. It's a well written book. I enjoyed it very much.   If you are looking for a good history book, this is the one to read. It has some flaws but overall it's a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've just read a very enjoyable book about the world of mathematics. I am a mathematician and a very avid reader. I enjoy all things math-related. I was pleased to see that this book was well researched and presented. The author has done a fine job. I did find that some of the figures were difficult to read. However, the figures are well thought out and I appreciated the explanations of how the formulas were derived. I also liked the way the author described many mathematical proofs and showed the importance of knowing the right people to go to for help. The book is worth reading. It's also a good introduction to a number of mathematics concepts, such as graphs, rational numbers, the real numbers, and the concept of a proof. I think this book will be an excellent resource for people who want to understand mathematics, but don't want to be overwhelmed by the amount of information that's being provided. I recommend this book highly.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the most informative and entertaining book I've ever read about the American civil war. It is a fascinating story and I've never been a fan of Civil War history. This book is a very well written story about the battle of Bull Run. This is the first book I have read that really gives the perspective of the Union soldier and how he saw his role in the war. The book is also very interesting to read about American history in general. I would recommend this book to any interested in this war.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I've read a lot of books by other authors, and have always had a great interest in the subject matter, but this book really hit the mark for me.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story. --------------- Read a bad review: -------------- I think it is an easy read, but I am really looking forward to reading the rest of this series. -------------- Read a good review: ------- I found this story to be quite funny.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book at the request of a professor at a local college. He asked me if I wanted to read a book that would explain how to make a "good" book, and if I could write a review. This is a book I've been wanting to read for years. The writing is well thought out and the examples are interesting. I especially liked the section on writing good characters.  One of the more interesting things about the book is that the book doesn't tell you how to write a good character.  In this book the author discusses the five basic character traits.  The basic traits are:  Character: The character's thoughts, feelings, emotions, thoughts, and actions. Character: Character's characteristics.  Character: The characters own personality. Character : The character is a real person with feelings, motivations, etc. Character traits are the things that make up the character.   Character traits are what make up a character. The person is the character and the characteristics are the traits.   A good example is that in the movie "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" the main character, who is named Honey, is very much like the main characters from other books.  Honey is kind and sweet.  She is good with children.  Her biggest problem is that she has a short temper.  But she is very caring, and is willing to help any kid in need.   Her problem is not that she is short tempered but that she cannot help being a little girl.  This makes Honey a very well rounded character, and in the end, it is the kid who saves her.  Another character trait that the author highlights is the idea of the main person being the hero and the side character being the heroine.  That's how I feel about many of the characters in my life.  I think a lot of us have at least one character that is a hero and one that is the heroine, and for me that's the way I am as well.  As I said, this book is a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________ _________ I am a huge fan of both the original series and this one. I read the first series and loved it, but I was a bit hesitant to read the followup, The Dark Tower. While it was fun to see what happened in the first book, it was a little hard to get into as the story had to be explained to the reader and I found myself missing a few of the characters as I was reading. So I was hesitant to pick up the second book, but it did the job and it did have the action that I was looking for. I enjoyed the series so much that I am considering getting the rest of the books as they are quite good. I can't wait for the next book to come out! _______________________________________
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I just finished reading this book about a group of women in the early 1900's who have a common bond. They are all from the same place, New York City, and they share a common struggle to become the best versions of themselves, which can be seen by the ways they express themselves. I found this book to be well written and the author clearly researched each of the women. There are no clichés in the book, and the women are portrayed as real people. It's not a romance book, but it's also not a chick flick, but if you are a fan of any of those, you'll definitely love this one. "

Write a positive review about a good book: _________ This is the best book on the internet about the history of the modern church, period. __________ I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. ___________________________________  A book that is very well written, clear and easy to read.  The author is well informed and makes the history and doctrines of the church very understandable.  the only reason I gave 4 stars is because it's a bit dated, but it does explain the history in a way that is understandable and not too confusing.  to sum it up, if you are interested in the history or doctrine of the Mormon church, this book is a must read!  I am a convert and I highly recommend this book to all members of the LDS church who want to know the history.  in addition to the history it is a good source of the doctrines of God's plan.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I have found this book to be a very informative, interesting and entertaining read. I am very much looking forward to reading the other books in the series. Thanks again to the author for creating such a fun and informative series. --Gabe L. (Mountain View, CA) I was very happy to find this book as it is a very good read. This is a good introduction to the field, but I believe that the second book is a much better read. A great read. --Richard (Houston, TX) I am still in the process of reviewing the other three books in this series, but the first one, The Complete Zulu, was very good. I did enjoy reading the description of the different ways to pronounce the Zulu language as well as the story about the battle of the Orisha Plains. --Dianne (Kalispell, MT) The Complete Orisha Series is a great addition to the literature in Africa. The book is very informative and the author is a true expert in his field. I'm looking forward for the other two books in series and am very interested in learning more about Zulu culture. --James (Plymouth, MN) I have been enjoying the Zulus books so much that I have bought all three to date. I do have a problem with how the author pronounces the words in the text. I found the spelling to be inconsistent in the ZULU. I know that this is my own spelling, but it was very difficult to figure out which word was which. I will definitely purchase the next two books and look forward to the next installment. I also recommend reading the book from the beginning, and you will be hooked by the story, the style, and the illustrations.

The first book I read on this topic was the "Biblical and Historical Facts About Islam", and it was a good and solid book. This one is just as good.

It provides an overview of the history of electronic music, its origins, the current state of the industry, and its most important influences.

He is a strong, stoic, stubborn, honest, and thoughtful dwarf.    The main characters are all interesting, interesting characters, but I was not particularly impressed with any of them.       I feel like there could have been more action, more depth in the writing, and more interesting characters.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It was very funny, I loved it. I also like the fact that it had a lot of the typical fantasy elements, but also the more human elements of it. The main character is a girl who's a thief. I liked that the girl was a thief as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author describes the problem of the young girl that is raped and then sold for sex. The girl, whose name is not given, is taken to a brothel and the man pays to have sex with her. The author then explains the different types of prostitution and their roles in society. She explains the fact that the girl is sold for the first time at the age of 14 to an older man and that she does not realize the sexual nature of the situation until she has been there about three months. She says the girl, who has been brought up in a very religious household, is not aware of the fact her sex is being used. She also says that it is not until the girl realizes that she is being treated like a piece of property that she realizes the situation is not right. The woman who sells the girl also has a very bad reputation for prostitution. The reader is then given an account of a man who gets into a relationship with a prostitute and how the prostitute ends up raping the man. She gives her opinion of this relationship. It's a good read. I liked it. I also liked the author's comments on the situation. She said that the prostitute was a whore because she did not want to be a good wife and mother.   My only criticisms are that there is one section in the book about the brothel but the rest of the book is just a story about a young girl. I do like the fact the author gives a description of a place that is very different from what most of us think of when we think of a brothels.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an eye opener for anyone who has been working on their writing for some time. I have been a writer since I was 8 years old and had never gotten my story down until I read this book. I was completely blown away by it. If you are looking for some inspiration and some help to get your writing back on track, then you need to get this book! I would recommend this book to anyone who is just starting out or anyone who wants to improve their writing.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________  "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is a fascinating book about the evolution of the US Marine Corps. While the book covers the wars from the Civil War through WWII, the authors do not focus on the "bad" ones, like the atrocities of the Vietnam war, or the bombing of Cambodia. Instead, they concentrate on the positive, the successful, the heroic, and how the Marines achieved this. The authors do a good job of presenting the Marine Corps as a great military organization that has evolved over time. I will be reading this book again and will certainly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________ It was a pleasure to read this book, and I found myself thinking about what I would do if I were in a similar situation. I found it difficult to get through the chapters because of the fact that I was getting the sense that my parents had not fully dealt with my situation, which made the book a little less engaging. But overall I liked the book and think that you will find this helpful.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a joy to read. It took a lot of effort to write this book, but the end result was a good read.  The writing is simple but effective.   The character's actions are easy to understand, and the worldbuilding is pretty good.  My only complaint is that the book is a bit short (it's short because it is just one part of the series, but I still think it's a great read).   I don't know if I will finish this book because it's just too short.  But it is a good story that I would recommend to anyone who likes fantasy books and is looking for a quick read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the book that made me want to become a better writer. It's not a very technical book. It is about the importance of being honest about the mistakes that we make. You have to admit that you are human. And you will have moments of weakness. You will have things you will wish you had done differently. You won't be perfect. I have a couple of flaws, but you can't fix them all. So I think it's important to be honest with yourself about them.   I think it was important to tell the story of how you became an author, how you went from a non-professional author to a professional one. You were not a professional writer before you started to write. You did not have an agent. You didn't have a good agent. I think that this is really important to show how you have to put in the time to get where you are. It takes time and work.   the book also tells you that your writing is good, but that you need to work on improving your style. You can't just make a book. You need to write a book that will get good reviews. It doesn't matter how good your writing skills are. You cannot just be yourself. You are not yourself until you write a great book.   The other thing that I liked about this book is that it gave a lot of advice about what to do when you are trying to write that book. How you have a lot to do before you write that first great book that you know you want to write and you really want to be good at. It really shows you that you have many things to work at before you get to where you want.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Art of Living by Michael Everson. I was reading a book on art, and I got an idea:    The Book of Happiness is a collection of quotes from the greats that show how they live.   This book has more of the art in it than most.  One quote is:    "What we call a good life is not always what we call happiness.  I am sure that all the great men who have lived have had to live hard lives.  But I think it is a great mistake to believe that the man who lived in luxury and comfort was a happier man than the man whose daily bread was meager and who was constantly hungry.  "   This quote is not only a great quote, but it's true.  There are many great quotes on how to live that don't have to do with being happy.  For instance, "It is not enough to love one's self, love others as well.  When we love one another we grow.  We see our commonalities and our differences.  There is no end to the good you can do when you look at someone with an open heart."   "I don't like the world that way.  This world is just the way it is.  It's like the way people are, they have their own ways of thinking and dealing with things.  They don't understand anything that I do, because they're too busy doing it.  So I try to understand, and if I don't get it I just try to live the way that works best for me."    "It's not so much the pain that hurts, but the way we go about getting through it that makes the pain worse."   "If you want something badly enough, you'll get it."  "I can't tell you how many times I have had a feeling in my heart that somebody was looking out for me.  In the middle of the night when I think I'm alone, I know I am not alone, and the next day I'm reading an article in a magazine or on a radio program, and somebody has sent a telegram of congratulations, and it just makes me happy to know that they cared enough to want to help."  The quotes are just what they are:  They show you how to be happy.   The book is written by the great author, and you get the feel of what it
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is hard to say this book is a classic. I have only read the first chapter but I am very much looking forward to reading more of the book. It is hard not to be enthralled by the writing and the author's clear exposition of the topic. I found myself reading the book from beginning to end in one sitting.   As a writer of children's books, I was very impressed with the way in which she went about creating a compelling narrative. The book is narrated by a young boy who has just completed a year in the army and is now on his way to Afghanistan. The boy has already been a soldier once before, but the story goes beyond that and introduces several other interesting characters and subplots. The tone of the novel is very upbeat, but there is also a very powerful undertone of sadness that builds in the pages. I loved this book, I will definitely be buying more of her books!
Write a positive review about a good book:        I really enjoyed this book, it was great to see more of the backstory and it's a good story, although it was a bit slow paced. The characterizations were a little off and the plot was a little hard to follow but still very enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________   I am a lifelong fan of Robert Heinlein, but this book made me reconsider my own love of the man.   The novel is set in the late 1950s. We have been watching a nuclear war from the safety of the ground:   "In the days of the Cold War, we were taught to fear the Russians, not the Chinese. They would never come in from the cold. They could never use nuclear weapons to conquer the West, and we could not be sure they would not one day. We were wrong."   Then the Chinese invade. The book follows two American servicemen who are sent to the Chinese border. They must fight the Chinese against the Russians and the Japanese. The war is going well until the Russians decide to attack China with nuclear weapons. This is an old trick the Russians have been using for decades. They have been playing with the American psyche, and it is now up to Robert Heinl to stop them.  - A lot of the military action is on the Chinese side of the border. This doesn't help when the Russians start blowing up the cities and setting off a nuclear holocaust. I really wish the military would have shown a bit more interest in the civilian side of things.   and...   There are no spaceships in the book. This can be annoying if you are trying to imagine a futuristic world, but it isn't in this book.  , and... I found the ending a bit unsatisfying. The military is victorious, but not without some losses. Heinlein mentions that in the early part of the book, he wrote the ending with the Russians still on the other side of China, and then he changed his mind and the Russians are now in the fight with the Americans and the Chinese still fighting each other. But the story seems to go back and forth like that.  
Write a positive review about a good book: __________  I have had this book for several years now and have enjoyed it as a way to practice my English grammar and vocabulary. The first time I read it I thought it was just too simple but then I thought about it more and realized that it is indeed a really good book. I have been teaching a number of younger children and I am always looking for a simple way to help them improve their grammar. It is a really nice way to do this and I think it is important to keep things simple.   I can see why this is so popular because it has some really good ideas about grammar and language. The book teaches grammar in a way that makes it easy to understand and remember. It also teaches some other useful information in a fun way. I don't think that there is any real reason why a 5-year-old should learn the English grammar in this book because most 5-years-olds are not learning grammar to begin with and I don`t think that this book is going to make them learn grammar.   I think that the best way to teach a child is to be fun and entertaining. This book is not just about grammar but it is also about vocabulary and language skills as well. I think this book was made for children as well as adults.  , January 3, 2015
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________I really enjoyed this book. It was easy to read and easy to understand. The story was well done, and I found it interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ The New Science of Love by Michael Rosenfeld - 5/5 I was looking for a book on how to be happier in love, and this book has the answers. The science of love is the same as the science of health. You can have great health and still have health problems. Love is the great equalizer. Love gives you the power to overcome your fears and your fears give you the ability to overcome the fears of love. You will be happier and you will have more love in your life. It's that simple. - Laurie R. - 5 out of 5 It's easy to understand. The author explains the science in a way that is accessible to a layman. The information is easily accessible to anyone with a degree in science. - Chris W. - 4/5 This book has been a life changer for me. My wife and I have been together for 4 years. We have two kids together, and we have a great relationship. We love our kids, but we can't stand each other. I know it sounds silly, but the thought of getting divorced makes us physically sick. But with this book, we finally understand why. We were told that it was because we are in love with the same person. Now, after reading this book we understand that it is not that simple at all. We both know that we are not in love. This book gives us an idea of how to break that cycle and we know what to do about it. - Jim S. - 2/5 My husband and I love this book. This is one of the best books that I've read in a long time. We can't wait to read it over the holidays. - Jennifer B. - 3/5 Very informative, but a little difficult to understand on the first reading. I am a little concerned about how I will feel when I've finished the book. - David R.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "It's really a story about a man whose entire life is an ongoing experiment in self-discovery.  I really love how the author used his own story to tell the story of this book.  The first half of the book is a great example of how to tell a compelling story about what it means to be human.  It's a fascinating and sad story of an ordinary man who has to discover his own worth and how to be the man that he is."

It was a powerful story with a great cast of characters that really brought the story to life. "
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the kind of book that makes me look for more books like it! I enjoyed this book a lot. I enjoyed the stories in it as well as the characters. The world building was good, the setting was interesting, and the writing was good. I didn't really like the main character but I don't know if that was because I was just reading a book or because the story was just too good. The main character is not an "I'm so cool I can do anything" type of person. He's kind of a typical "cool" guy, not someone that will go up against the world in a battle for the greater good. However, the book is about a boy and his family in a world where everyone is trying to control the powers of a child. It was interesting to read a story where a boy is trying so hard to control his powers that he becomes the villain. I just wanted to see more of that. Overall, this book was pretty good. It had a good world building, interesting characters, and a good story. I would recommend it to someone looking for a good science fiction book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so good I want to take a shower. I'm so excited I have to take time to read it. I love that the author goes in depth about different aspects of this book (I'm in the beginning stages of a learning disability and this book made it very real to me). The book is a great resource for those with learning disabilities and is a must-read. It will make you feel like you're in the thick of it and get you thinking about your own challenges. This is a good thing. I recommend this book to everyone who needs it." -Kari, New York "I loved the book, it's just what I was looking for! I had never thought about learning disabilities before reading this book and it really brought it home for me." -"Melissa, New Jersey" "A good read! The author is very knowledgeable about disabilities and it's nice to have some other options to help us understand how the disability affects us and our lives. I loved that the book is written with humor and was able to relate to the characters." --Cynthia, Texas
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that I have read and have been wanting to read for years but never got around to it. I've been in a rut with horror so I was looking forward to a good horror novel but wasn't looking forward too much to this.  I am very pleased with it, I really loved the story and the writing style, it is a good blend of horror and romance. I am so glad I read it and am looking forward for the next one in the series!

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I am a fan of Stephen King's works and I'm glad that the TV series is getting a movie. The series is the best thing that has ever happened to Stephen King and I wish more people had a chance to read his work. The movies are not a good movie, but a good tv series. I am definitely looking forward to the new movies. **********  What did you like best about this story? The characters are fascinating, but the world is also fascinating. I love that you can't always know what's going to happen next and the way King creates a world of suspense is amazing.  Who was your favorite character and why? The main characters and how they all interact with one another are very interesting. I'm hoping we'll get to see more of the other characters and that they will also have a greater impact on the other stories. .  The world is rich with detail and there are many things that are very disturbing. King does a good job of building a world that's realistic, but creepy and creepy. The acting is excellent as well, and I loved that the series was done in an alternate reality. I also loved that there was an ending. The whole series was amazing and I hope it continues.  (8/10)  Why did you give this book a rating of only 8/10? I thought it was great, but I did not like the characters that much.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________  I really enjoyed this book. The way it uses an open mind, a rational, open mind to think about the universe is very appealing. I found the main character very intriguing and I enjoyed the story line. I hope that this book will be used as a good reference for the next generation of scientists and students.  ___________  The author does a great job of introducing the reader to the basic ideas of quantum mechanics. This is a great book for anyone interested in learning about the theory of quantum physics. The author does an excellent job explaining the basic concepts of quantum theory. He does a very good job of making the reader understand the theory. The problem is that he goes off on an extensive tangent, that he makes no effort to come back to the main topic. I have no idea where he is going off to next, or how he will get there. The book is just too long, and the information is presented in a confusing manner. I wish he would have just cut out the tangents and made the main point of the book the main theme.  The book, while very interesting, is just a little confusing. I would have liked to have gotten a copy of the first edition and read the book before I started the sequel, but that might have cost me a bit more time. The only way to know if the sequel is going to be any good is to get a copy to read. I just wish the author had taken the time to make a very clear outline of what is going on. I will be reading the sequel once I have a copy in my hand.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** I've read this book and enjoyed it very much. The story was very original and the characters were interesting and fun. It took a little bit of reading to understand what was going on but once you figured it out you had a good time reading this book. I've enjoyed reading about a bunch of different people and this book had a lot of variety. There was a lot going on in the story and I can see how it would be enjoyable to read a book about a variety of different characters. This is a fun read for a variety and if you like fantasy and are interested in science fiction, you might enjoy this book even though the plot is not exactly what you would expect. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________________ "This book is about a person who is trying to cope with the loss of a parent. It is the story of her family, not just the loss. The author, Ms. Balsley, is very good at capturing the emotional toll the loss has taken on this family. The writing is very descriptive and well-paced, with a sense of humour that comes through throughout the book. The family dynamic is believable and believable, as the family is not just one large extended family, but also a close-knit group of extended families. The characters in this book are believable, likable and well drawn. If you are a parent who has lost a parent, or someone who has had a close relative who has died, this book will give you a great sense of what it feels like to lose a parent." - M.A. "I read this book when I was in high school. My mom had passed away a few years prior to my being in the book and I was really upset about it. I remember thinking how I could relate to her struggles in the death of her mother. I also felt like the family was very close in this novel. I can see why people who lose a child like to read this." - L.L. "The characters are very well-drawn, well-defined and have good backstories. I thought the family dynamic was well-written. I think this book is a good way to start thinking about the loss." - P.A "This is a wonderful, heartfelt book that is easy to read. It's a nice reminder to not give up, and to be able to understand what people are going through and how it affects the family." - D.M. "My mom died a few weeks before I was born. It hit me hard, but my dad helped me come to terms with my grief and it was not long before I started having thoughts about what my mom would have thought about the book." - C.P. "It was such a wonderful read! I feel like I learned so much about my family, about the challenges our family faced, and the things we still struggle with. I feel so lucky to have been a part of this family, and I think I learned a lot from the book about being a parent and a family."  "This book has been such a life-changer for me, and my heart is so heavy with gratitude for all the people who made it possible."
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, fun book. The characters are well developed, and the setting is interesting. The story is fast paced, but not too fast, and is interesting from beginning to end. I enjoyed it, and I look forward to reading more.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have to say that I loved this book and the characters. The story is interesting and the way that the characters interact with each other is really engaging. I love the idea that the world is a game and that people are playing for survival. There is also a bit of a love story in the middle of the book but I can't really say too much about it because it is kind of hidden in a way that doesn't spoil anything. It is not the best love story but it is a nice touch. I also liked that the book was full of humor but it was very subtle. The author does a great job of writing a fast-paced and exciting story. I especially enjoyed the part in the book where the characters went to a haunted house to solve the mystery of the murder and I think that that is a really cool idea. If you are looking for a fun read with lots of action, violence, and some very dark subject matter then this book is perfect.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter series and wanted to get into this series as well. This was the first book I have ever read and loved. I have no idea what I'm doing on the floor but I do like it. I also found it interesting that Snape is so cruel and Snape is more a good teacher. If you want to see Snape be the horrible person he is then go read this book. It will be interesting to see how Snape reacts. If the characters are changed by the books, well, you can't expect too much in the books. There are lots of other good books, like the first one, but I am not a fan of these Harry Potter books.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very good introduction to a subject that is so often neglected in our school systems. The teacher, Miss L, did a great job and made the material as useful and relevant as it could be. This is a book I would highly recommend to anyone who is interested in this subject. I know this is a "old" book, but it is so helpful and interesting that I think the old books will always be relevant and helpful.
Write a positive review about a good book:     The book was great and the story is very intriguing. It took me a while to get into the book, but once I did, the story was great. The characters were real and had some great dialogue. I'm a huge fan of horror and love a good mystery, but this book really took the cake! The ending is amazing! The only downside I could find was that there is a little too much of the same plot. It's a little predictable and it takes a little while to figure out the plot.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This is one of the better science fiction books I've read. The setting is very interesting. The story is good and the main character is good. The main problem with this book is that it is too short. I would have liked a bit more character development and more suspense in the story. I am currently reading the sequel to this book, The Other Side of Eden, which is the best book yet by this author. --------------- (Verified Buyer)
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The  Good Wife  is an entertaining read with some good twists on the typical TV legal drama.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********I really like this book. It's the perfect mix of humor, and philosophy, and I really think it's a good read. I'm definitely buying the second book and I look forward to reading it again soon!***********   My rating: 4 stars, because:  * I love the characters. They are realistic and relatable, and it's fun to see how they interact with each other and with the outside world. They all have their quirks, but none of them are unpleasant, and all of them have a unique charm. I love them.  (It's a nice feeling to be a little more sympathetic to the characters, rather than being annoyed that they don't want to be there.)  -- I love how the author introduces the various groups and groups in the book. The author takes some time to introduce each group's history and traditions, and then he provides a detailed history of each group, and a few details about each group. It is well done.  the only thing that annoyed me was the name of the group: "the Children of Goliath". It's just too obvious. There's not much going on about the Children of Israel or the Children Of Goliath.   If you have a sense of humor and want a good story, this is the book for you.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________   I am a big fan of the works of David Sedaris, which is why I was a little disappointed that I was given only a single book of his works to read. The book is very funny and well written, although not very original. The story is about two very different people who fall in love but then realize that they have the same problems. The one thing that makes this a fun read is that it deals with the topic of jealousy and the way that it affects people in a relationship. The main character, Michael, is a very shy guy who is trying to be a better person than his father and girlfriend. He has a lot of problems with women, including one who is in love with him, and he struggles to overcome his own insecurities to be better. I thought the story was pretty good, but I did find myself wanting more about the other characters and why they were involved in what happened. I'm glad that Sedaris wrote a book about jealousy and how it affects relationships but I don't think I will continue to read it as I am not sure if I will enjoy reading about it.
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ The first book I've read by C. S. Lewis. This book is very well-written. It is a very good book that will take the reader on a wonderful journey, full of wonder and great adventures.

I highly recommend this book for people who are interested in religion and spiritual topics. I really liked this book and I hope it has a long life.  Review by: T.

I enjoyed the message that it brought out about life and how good it is when we can learn from our mistakes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read the book as a kind of historical background, but I never got to the bottom of it. The book is about the people who did the research and what the findings were. The characters in this book are interesting, but the real question is: Why?   For me, the reason is that I never knew what to think about the whole thing. I just could not wrap my mind around it. There was just too much to take in, not to mention too much going on in my head.   In the end, I can say that this book is worth reading, but not necessarily for the answers that it may yield.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I've read this book in the past, but this time I read it as a young adult. The characters were interesting, but the story is not very good. The main character (the daughter of a man who was killed by an alien spacecraft) is so selfish, so arrogant and so immature that she is a pain in the ass. I think that I will skip the next book. I do not understand how people who think they are so smart can read this and still not understand the book.

It's a good guide and well worth the price.  the basic system is easy to learn, the book has a wealth of rules for a variety of styles of play, and the art is really nice.

In fact, it felt like a well-constructed game, one that had all the components necessary to allow for a fast and fun first game. My only complaints would be that there were a few rules that I wish had been more clearly defined or that the book had a bit more information on them. I also wish that the rules included more examples. Overall, I'd recommend this book to any D&DM, first time or experienced."  the system is simple and the rules are simple and straight forward.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________. _________. _________________________. What a great book. It's written by a psychologist who has done extensive research into narcissism.   I have read other books that have dealt with narcissism and I have to say this one is much better written.  The first section deals with narcissists' beliefs and their beliefs in themselves, the second deals with how the narcissist treats people and how that affects their relationships, and the last section deals primarily with how they react when things go wrong in their lives.  These are very important sections because if you want to understand narcissism you have to know what narcissists think and believe.  It also helps to understand the psychology of narcissists because it shows that they are more complex than just a jerk.  In this section you will learn that they have a high level of self-esteem, they feel good about themselves, they are proud of themselves, and they take pride in their achievements.  Narcissists are also very intelligent and have good problem-solving skills.  You'll also learn that most narcissists have a sense of entitlement and that they feel they deserve to have the things they want.  I like the section on how narcissists feel like they are above others and that it is an advantage for them.  This makes sense since they think they have an innate superiority over others.  They also feel that their sense of superiority gives them the right to take advantage of others. They also don't feel guilty about being a narcissist, so this is another reason why they have the need to feel superior.  Finally, this book is very good at showing the extreme self-absorption of a narcissists.  If you want a good psychological book to read this is it.  My only issue with this book was that the author never explains the difference between being a victim and a narcissism, and also never explains how being a bully and being a self-centered narcissist differ.  Maybe that is just a personal gripe, but I just didn't understand why he included both types in the book.  There is also a short chapter about how narcissism affects you.  Overall I am very satisfied with this great book and I would recommend it to any narcissist or anyone who is interested in understanding narcissism!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good example of how to write an effective review. It is easy to read, not complicated, easy to follow and a good overview. The author does a good job of summarizing the main points of the book without giving too much of the story away. I really enjoyed this book and it is the first book I've read by Peter J. Leeson.  I think he will be writing a lot more books in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only book I have read that could actually improve my ability to write (which, sadly, is not much) was this book. It is not really the content of the book that made it interesting. It was the writing style and the style of the authors. The style is so easy to read and the sentences are so concise and clean that the book was extremely enjoyable. The writing style is very friendly, and is almost like you are reading a short story that you have read before. The author also has a knack for creating very vivid, detailed descriptions, especially when talking about a scene from his past. It's as if the author has already seen it, and can describe it so clearly, that you can feel it right away. This is a book that I could see myself recommending to friends who have the same writing style.  I can't comment on the author's writing style because it was very much a surprise for me, but I can comment on how the book is presented. I really like how he used the pictures that were included in the book as a tool to describe a scene.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  A new and exciting look at the Bible through the lens of history and science, a very thought provoking read. I enjoyed it very much!   Review by James:  I read this book while driving along a road in the West Texas panhandle in the early spring. My favorite book of the year!   The book begins by discussing the Biblical flood. In Genesis 8:1-3 Noah's ark is mentioned. He builds an ark, but then gets a "curse from God" that prevents him from getting the animals to populate it. God gives him a pair of rainbow-colored birds to build the ark with. The birds are a challenge to him, and his wife is afraid of them. They go down to the sea to feed the birds and they bring back a lot of fish, but nothing else. They are unable to fill the arK with enough food.   When the rain stops and the flood starts, the birds eat the fish and bring back many more, and so the arKaK becomes a huge success. But, God is angry with Noah, and curses him for having built a giant ark and having used all his good luck on it. Noah is angry about this, and blames the birds for the curse. But the birds are very kind and considerate, and they give him the birds as a present. They also tell him that he can keep the birds.   the birds tell Noah that it will rain a lot this season, and that God will curse the world. They say that the rain will destroy all the crops, and the animals will die from the drought.   The birds say that it is Noah's job to build a ship and put his family on it, and to get people on it so that the animals can have food and water.  .   with the help of the birds, Noah builds a ship, and gets the people on board. The people live on the ship, but there is some food for them. Noah also builds a fire and a pot of water, but it is not enough. God tells Noah to make a new world. He does so, and everyone on earth has a new home, and new land. God does not take care of the animals, but does not say that they died, either. The first person Noah comes to is Abram, his grandson, who is still in Egypt. The flood happened, and Abram and his people have gone into the wilderness
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book by a great author. "I think I've always been a person who prefers my books read in the original, uncensored form. That way, I can enjoy it for what it is. I don't like to be pressured by an editor or publisher to change a word or an image to make a book more appealing to a particular audience. I also feel it's important to keep the spirit of a work intact, even if it's altered slightly from its original form." I am always a sucker for old-fashioned pulp.  I am also a sucker to good stories and characters.  "In addition to the well-written stories and strong characters, the art in this book is really what really makes this book stand out." For those who like a good plot and a good read...this is a good choice. I just wanted to let you know that you should check out this book.    I have a few copies myself, but you never know when someone might want one.  I am hoping that I will be able to put out a limited edition, as there are some truly beautiful prints on the cover.  You might even want to get one as a gift for someone!   The book is also available on Amazon for $3.99.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was so excited to finally get into reading the newest series by Peter V. Brett. I loved the cover art and the cover blurb. I had to read the book. I found the books really enjoyable. I especially enjoyed the new characters. I think that a lot of the books are getting better and better and I am really glad to have my books read. This is a series I can continue to read as I get older. Thanks again for the great book and the excellent cover art.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* This book was a very interesting read. I had heard about it before, but I'd never really picked up the book until I started reading it. It is well written, informative, and it was well paced, not bogged down in a lot of exposition or a lot to think about. I really enjoyed the fact that it was a little lighter and more fun than the other books that I've read, and I loved that it had some pretty cool artwork. It was definitely a fun read! ***** This is a really great book! If you like the comics you have read before, then this is for you! If not, it's not the same story as the comics but still pretty good! ****** I think this is a very entertaining book. I loved the way the author went into the backstory of the characters and the backstory behind their relationship. I thought the narration was very nice, and the art is really nice and unique. I would definitely recommend this book.  4 of 4 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I just got my copy of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. This is a really good book, and I think that is due in large part to its author, Peter Jackson. I was a bit skeptical about the book at first, but as I have gotten to know the books more, I have come to enjoy them. I am especially glad that I read this book while on a trip to the South of France. It is nice to read this story on a long trip and not have to carry the book with me. The book is very good, and if you are a Tolkien fan, you will enjoy it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  My favorite thing about this book was the description, which was a good example of how I read. I am a reader who doesn't want to go back to a book because I thought it was boring or because I didn't understand what was going on. This book was a treat because I had no idea what was happening or why it was important. The ending left me with an "Aha!" feeling, which is a good sign. I liked the book so much that I bought the print copy so I could read it over and over again!
Write a positive review about a good book:  "A fantastic novel"  -  Bookworm's Review  (4 stars) "The novel is a wonderful read"    I am a fan of Stephen King and this is a good novel.   The writing is very clear and concise.  The plot is really good.  It's really interesting to see the different people who are involved in the case.  I am really happy that King wrote a new book. 
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________ I read this book in December and finished it in July. The book starts off a bit slow but as it progresses, it gets good. I found it interesting and interesting, but a little bit predictable and predictable. But still a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favorite books. I really like how you go into the story and what the author has to say about the relationship between the two characters. I would love to read more books with these two characters and how they get along. I'm also really interested in the future of the couple and how that's going to play out. I also like how the book covers the two couples relationships and how it shows them being strong and supportive of each other. I feel like this is a book that's pretty good.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very happy to read this book. I don't have a problem with violence in any book, so I'm glad that the author wasn't going for the violent way of reading this book and instead made the reader feel what the book was trying to say. I think that this book is very important because we need to know that not all people in a war are bad people. This is a book about the life of a woman in the German army, who was fighting against the Nazis and the Soviets. This book is not a novel, but rather a diary that describes the horrors she went through. I highly recommend this book for people who have a desire to read about a woman who was a woman during World War 2.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* My friend introduced me to this book a couple years ago and I loved it. The writing style is very simple and to the point. I enjoyed the story and the characters. I especially enjoyed how they handled their relationship in the beginning and then when it was clear that they were meant to be together. I think that this book will keep me reading for a long time to come.  My only complaint is that the book starts out a bit slow and then it picks up right when it needs to. I'm not sure if this is a problem with the author or with my copy. The book was definitely good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a mystery and romance with a good plot.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* It's a book that is worth your time, as long as you don't expect to get much out of it. The only thing that's missing from this book is a few pages of the history and background of the church. That's it. I'm sure that will come later on, as I do think the book could have been much shorter if it didn't go on for so long.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________ I'm so glad I found this book! I love the idea of having a set of characters who aren't perfect (just like me) and just trying to keep their sanity as they face the worst possible circumstances. _____________________________________________ I think that this book is a great start to a series.    I love this series and have bought a few more, and I'm looking forward to more!   The characters are likable.  I've never read a book where a main character was such a sweet, kind, funny, thoughtful, self-aware girl. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book! I have read some good books about how to be a better person, but this is a first. It's not a how-to book, it's a how to live a better life book, but I'm sure that the latter will be as well. I'm also not sure why this book is called "the book of the week" when there aren't even any reviews on Amazon. I think that the authors are doing a pretty good job on this book. I have had this book for about two months and haven't finished it yet. I like the format. I hope that I will get the rest of the books, and that I can start reading them at some point in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good read. It's not as good as it's been described as, but it's still a fun read. I enjoyed the first couple of chapters, but there's a bit of a lull at the end, but the rest of the book was good. The author has done some very good writing.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is the most amazing and thorough book about my battle with cancer. I am so grateful that I read this book. I have been through chemo and radiation treatments, and still have to go through them, but this book gave me the tools I needed to understand the process, to understand why I was feeling the way I was. I now have a great sense of what I should do in a certain situation, and it is so easy to understand. Thank you so much for this book, it was very helpful. I can't wait to read more about my cancer and how it has impacted me. A great book: It is a great book that teaches us how to survive cancer and to help others in similar situations.  I learned a lot about my health and how my body reacts to radiation and chemo.   Overall, I enjoyed the book and the knowledge it gave me.  A must-have for any cancer survivor:  This book is absolutely essential for any person with cancer or a family member who is dealing with it.  I have not read any other book about cancer that gives you a detailed, easy to follow description of each step you have to take to survive and get better.  It's all very easy to read and understand.  And I love the fact that this book is written in a funny way.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The best of all the SF books I have read so far. Great stories, and it has a lot of great moments. I like how the author wrote the characters like they were real people, with quirks, quirks, and flaws. It was like they really were the characters from this book. The science in this book is great, and the characters are interesting. Highly recommended.   Recommended!   * If you have not read this book, I recommend reading the last few chapters first, because there are a lot to take in.
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________ This book was an eye-opener, as I've been a fan of the books of H.P. Lovecraft and horror in general for some time. I didn't find the story as scary as I thought I would, but I liked it more than most of the other Lovecraftian books I've read. I'd definitely read this again, but in the meantime I'm happy to get another book from the author who wrote "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath". It's one of my favorite books.

The author covers everything you need to know about how to be a successful patient and patient advocate. Thank you, Dr. Shiffman, for giving this wonderful book to the medical community. This is a must read for anyone in medicine or any field. I would recommend this book to anyone. -J. C.  Review by: A. P. on October 30, 2010 :  This is a fantastic book. It is the first book I've ever read that covers all the basics for patients with chronic illnesses, but it also covers other important areas like disease management, patient education, and more. I'm a new physician, and I couldn't have gotten through this book without the information that was given in the book, the patient resources in the appendices, and the other resources that were included on the website. I will definitely be buying more books from this author. Thank You! -A. P  Full Review:  Dr. Shaffman is a true pro! He is extremely knowledgeable and easy to get along with. He provides lots of insight on various topics and he doesn't sugar coat it. He has a great eye for finding new information and he will be an invaluable resource for any medical professional. His book will help you on your way. Highly recommended! -W. L.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book, and it is my favorite. It is a really great read and well written. The writing is smooth and flowing, and the characters are well written, likable, and interesting. It does not take itself seriously and is very funny.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********  The story was great. The characters were well written and very engaging. The story flowed very well. There were some parts that were not perfect but for the most part I was very impressed with this story. I have read many horror stories in the past but I have never read a story with a protagonist who was so likable. This story was just too good not to read. I highly recommend this book!  Review by: Laura H. on Aug. 27, 2012 :  I was completely hooked from the start and was not disappointed. I would recommend this to everyone.  Good job on the story and the characters. It was a very dark story, but it was done in a very nice way. I did not find any bad words in the story or anything like that. The writing is excellent. The book was very short, but I read it in one day, which was a great thing.  is definitely a great book! I loved the beginning and ending of this book. It's a very creepy story, yet not one that is overly scary. It makes you feel scared and unsettled, but never scares you silly. This book is very dark, yet very relatable, and the ending left me wanting more. The plot was very intriguing and very well executed. The ending was also very satisfying.  the author did a great job with the prose, and I think it is great that he did not shy away from any horror elements. it's not perfect, but the story is good. .  The author did such a good job with his characters and the plot that I would definitely recommend this story to anyone looking for a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have loved this book since the first chapter and it has continued to stay at the top of my list for a long time.   It is the perfect blend of the dark, gritty and suspenseful elements that have been so popular with me in the past few years.  There is no doubt that this book will be a big hit on the YA market.  It's an excellent start for a new series and a new hero for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

Write a positive review about a good book: ---------------I found this book really good. The story is not only interesting, but well written and very well thought out. The prose is good enough to have a high level of detail in most cases, and the plot is well thought through. The writing style is very detailed, and even the descriptions of the places are very interesting.The writing style of the book was very close to the way I imagine it, but the detail was a lot more obvious than when I read a fantasy book. It made me think about the place I read it in a good way. It was a nice change of pace from the usual fantasy genre, which is usually very bland. I would have liked a few more locations, and a bit more development.The only thing I could say that bothers me is that the author often goes over the top when describing the settings. In the second book, he goes into great detail about the town of Girona, the way the people live, and some of the history of the town. I think I could understand it, if it had been explained in more detail, but it seemed to me like the author was just showing off. I felt that it made the book seem like a history book more than a fantasy novel. It just seemed a little over thetop. I did not like the way he talked about the culture of the place, but I understand that that is how he wanted to do it. Overall, the book is very interesting and well written. I will definitely be looking for the next book. I hope the next one is more like this one.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I'm an English major who has read a ton of romance/erotica/historicals/military stuff, but I haven't had much luck in this genre. I tried to find a good historical romance novel, but none of them really clicked with me. I've read other historicals, but they're always just too far off the beaten path. But this book has all the right ingredients. I found myself rooting for the hero and the heroine throughout. The writing style is really well done, and I really enjoyed the history and historical background. The ending was really satisfying, and it made me happy for the characters. I highly recommend this one.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was pretty skeptical about this book because of the title. I've read the title of several other books, but I don't recall them being as strong as this one. I guess I was just tired of reading the same old stuff and wanted to try something new. I can't believe I bought this book, but after reading it I can see why. The stories are really good, but they are told in a very straightforward manner, which made me feel a little tired at times. The humor is good, although I did find a few of the jokes a little cliche. I like that the author gives you the option to switch from a very serious tone to a lighthearted one, and that's definitely what I did. Overall, this was a good read. If you're looking for a good sci-fi story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, look no further.
Write a positive review about a good book: ***********I found this to be a really interesting book that explores the subject of religion and how it is often an unhealthy influence. The book itself is very well researched and contains many examples and stories that I've never heard about. As someone who has been a religious person my entire life this book really opened my eyes to how it can affect our lives and make us believe what we are doing is right. I've read other books on the subject and this is the first one that I felt truly explained the problems and pitfalls of religion. My advice to the person reading this book is to read it with an open mind and not be afraid to question things you once thought were true. If you've never read a book on this subject before I'd recommend it, you may find this book worth your time and money.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________ (review of free book) I love this book. The premise is a really cool one. I think it's a little hard to follow through to the end, but it's well worth it! The book does a great job of breaking down the differences between the different types of magic and how to use them to solve problems. It's a great read that I can't wait to continue reading. _________________________________________________________ (review from a friend) I think this is an absolutely great book for anyone interested in magic, whether they want to learn about how to do it or just be able to use it to entertain. This book is filled with information, examples, and even a brief walkthrough on how to make the most out of every spell you find in your own home. It is extremely well written and I highly recommend it! _________________________________ (from another reviewer) It was a very nice surprise to find this book at the library. I had never thought of doing a magical book review before but I am really enjoying it. I do want to say that I am a bit of a novice but I have found the book to be quite entertaining. It gives great insight on how magic works and why it's so difficult to use. __________________________________________________________________________ (review for the first time) The best magical book I've read. I can see how it is useful to anyone that wants to learn how to cast spells or have fun in the world of magic. _________________ (the original review) This is the most helpful book I have ever read on magic. I'm a beginner and it is amazing to read about how much it takes to actually cast spells. I've already found a few tricks I have been using a lot recently. I have a new appreciation for the process of magic!
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I got this book for Christmas as an ebook. I have to say that the book is very good. It has a very unique style that really makes it stand out. It is a really good read, and I highly recommend it. I don't think I'll buy it as a hardcover, but it's a good, solid read.  Helpful book:  The book is a lot like a road trip, but without the driving! It's about three people and their trip to get to a magical island that is in a constant state of flux. They find out they have a great connection and that their connection is causing the island to change. I loved this book. It was fun to read and the characters were well written and developed.

The authors are the best, and I hope to see this book in every single college library. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject."

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book and it was great. The writing was smooth and easy to read. The narrator was great, as he did a good job capturing the tone of the book. I loved the ending and the characters. I recommend this book. The next book I read was a little different in style: The Unholy Grail by John Wyndham. The book has a different tone and I liked that the narrator is not so close to the story, instead the reader is in the story and is more involved with the characters and their experiences. The story is great and I think the book does a good enough job of explaining how the world was created. I thought that the book was a great read and I definitely recommend it. Next book was A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. I have never read this series but I think that I have read every book in the series and I am definitely a fan of George R R Martin. This book is very long and I loved that it has a lot of characters, not just the main characters. The characters were all unique and interesting and I would recommend this one to everyone. The main characters were interesting and the main villains were not so bad. The world is also very different and the story has a great feel about it. I love this series and definitely recommend this to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great book about the history of the Jews. I was a bit surprised to see a lot of Jewish history being taught by people who aren't Jewish. I liked the fact that he gave some history on the history from the beginning, and also some about the Jews who have survived. I think the book has a great balance of both positive and negative. 5 stars:    Excellent book that explains why Jews are hated.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I've always enjoyed reading books about people who are good at one thing, like authors or doctors. The book I'm reviewing today is a book about people (like my friend) who are bad at one area. It's a good read for someone who likes good stories about people. The story is about a man named Kevin (I believe the author's last name is O'Connor). He was a good tennis player but he had an attitude problem. He also had trouble with women and his family was going through a divorce. He was on his way to a good life when a woman named Jo came into his life. He found out that she was an expert in the field of psychology and had helped some of his friends and family with their problems. Kevin became addicted to Jo and he couldn't help himself. It seemed like she had a lot of advice about how to live your life and he found that he was following her advice. He didn't have a lot to say but he didn't want to be the loser that Jo was. One day he decided to ask Jo if she could help him with his problems. Jo was not impressed by Kevin's attitude and she decided to show him what she could do. The results of this conversation were amazing. Kevin started doing all the things she had done and he was happy. He had the same attitude problems that he had always had and he started doing the things that Jo said he would do. One thing lead to another and he decided that he wanted to be as good as her. He took her advice and did a little bit of everything she had taught him. He did the things Jo said to do and he didn. He became more and more good at everything she told him to do. It turned out that he never had any problem with women. He started getting laid with no problem. So he became very good at women. This was very good for Kevin and it turned him into a great person. He even started going out with his best friend Jo and they were a great couple. This lasted about 4 years. He stopped going out to parties and dating because he didn\'t want Jo to know he was so good at getting laid. He felt so bad about that. The last time he was out he told Jo that he loved her.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Power of The Key is an excellent book on the basics of the ancient Mysteries.  It's not just a guidebook, but a great book.  I'm not the most adept at Astrology, but I've been to a few astrological conventions.  I'm glad to see a new Astrological Guide on the market.  The Power of the Key is a very clear, concise guide that is well organized and easy to read.    Overall, The Power Of The Key will be a useful resource for any aspiring Astrologer or any interested Astrologers out there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Power of One: How to Become the Hero You Were Meant to Be  by Jon Kabat-Zinn was a great book to have on hand for the last two weeks of the school year.  There is so much in the book that is just plain good.   I'm a huge fan of the author and his work, but I found the book a bit too theoretical for my tastes.  The book is an introduction to mindfulness meditation.  It includes a brief description of the meditation process and some exercises to get started.  I found myself skipping over the exercises and just going straight to the book.  This is a good choice if you are planning on meditating at a later date.  In addition, the book has a few videos which are nice to watch while you are meditating.  While it's a bit of a slog to get through the book, it's well worth the time.  The book is available for purchase at Amazon.  7.  What is your favorite piece of advice for someone who is just starting out in a career?   "I always tell people that it's okay to not want to be famous.  When you have a choice between something that you really love and something that might make you famous, you should always choose the one that will make you happy." -- Jon Kabath-Zinnd
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________ The first book I ever read was The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. I was absolutely hooked on the story. This is a fantastic book about a young boy who lives with his aunt. He has the ability to see the future and he is able to communicate with animals. The first few chapters are wonderful. He is happy to be at the zoo and is playing with the animals. He starts to see things that are not right about the zoo. Things that will make him sad and upset. He realizes that the animals are suffering and he will be sad and sad if the zoo doesn't stop doing the things they are doing. At the end of the book the story ends. The ending was a little bit confusing but that is only because I was still trying to get my head around what was happening and why he was doing what he was going to do. It didn't seem like there was anything left. There were a few scenes that were not in the book. This was not a problem for me because I found it really hard to put the book down. The book was not overly complicated. I could understand everything that was going on and I could also see the reason behind the story and why it was going so far. This book was perfect. I recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- The only thing I could say about this book is that I liked it. I'm not really much of a horror fan. I don't read many books in the genre. This one was good, though. The author does a good job with descriptions and the characters are interesting and the plot was interesting. I thought I was going to be in a lot of trouble with the vampires, but they didn't seem to be all that bad. I enjoyed reading it. -------------------------- Rating: 3.75/5

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. The author does a great job of introducing new people to the hobby, and teaching them about the basics. I especially like the story of how the author got into the hobby. It's very entertaining to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm glad I picked this up! It's a wonderful collection of stories, and the author is so sweet to write about. This is the perfect book to read on a long plane ride. It's like the characters are flying by themselves, except their story is about a bunch of people. It doesn't feel like they are traveling together, it feels like they're traveling by themselves. The stories are short and sweet and there is some of the funniest stuff I've read in a while. I love reading books like this. I like reading short stories that are more about the characters than the author. If you're looking for a little bit of joy to go along with your reading, this is the book for you!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am going to try and review as many books that I get in the mail each week, so I am giving this one a 5. The book has the perfect blend of good story, characters and an entertaining plot.  I enjoyed the character development and how the plot was wrapped up in such a great way. The plot is very intriguing.  The characters are likable and enjoyable.  The romance was not for me but I'm not a fan of romances.
Write a positive review about a good book: ***********This book will blow you away! If you are a history buff, this is a must have book.

And if you're a lover of history and you don't own this book, well then you're missing out on a really good read!***********  I am so grateful for the gift of a book, and so happy that I got to spend time with this book! It is so important to read history, so this is something that I will keep in my bookcase at all times. Thank you so much, Santa!!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as a young adult in the early 1990s. I liked it a lot. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the ending. I felt like a jerk when I finally understood what the hell the book was about. I still love this book and am reading it again today. The writing is great. The characters are well drawn. The plot is a bit of a stretch but you will still be entertained by it. A book about a girl and her brother that go on a road trip to visit their parents. They are forced to stay behind when their parents go on an extended vacation.  A very cute story about love, friendship, and being a kid.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is short, well researched, well written. The author explains everything very clearly. If you want to understand a subject very quickly, this book is the one to use. The only criticism I have is that it is quite long, but I think the main purpose is to get you to understand things, not to get through it all in one sitting.  I bought this book to teach my children about science and nature. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a really good read! It is a very nice story that does not require a lot of explaining. The main character is a man who, when he is younger, goes to his friend's house and is raped. The woman in the house is also a woman, who is trying to do what she can to help her friend's son, but she finds herself in a difficult situation when her own son is having problems with his girlfriend, a woman. The plot was a little slow at first, but then I started to enjoy the story.  It got better and better as it progressed, and by the end I found myself very entertained.   This is a good story, with a nice twist at the end. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I was a little skeptical about this book at first because I am a huge fan of The Matrix and the first Matrix movie. I was not expecting this to be the same book as the movie. However, after reading it I was blown away. The writing is great, the characters are interesting, the themes are not so obvious, and the writing is well done. It's not too preachy. The story is not overly complicated and the characters can be sympathetic at times. I am giving this book a solid 5 out of 5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  This book is wonderful. I love that the author included many examples of how to do some basic crochet. I also love the way the illustrations were so clear. It's definitely not the kind of book where you can go into the back cover and figure out how to make something. I had no trouble figuring out the basic stitches to make these items. I really love this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was intrigued by this book at first because I was a huge fan of the original. I was really looking forward to reading it but the first chapter really put me off, it felt like a really rushed version of the book. But then I read the rest of the story, it was pretty great! I really enjoyed it and the characters were really interesting. If you are a fan of either book you will definitely enjoy this one. What I thought:    I really liked this book. The main character is a bit more likable and a little more believable than the first one. This book has a lot of action, it's a good story that I enjoyed.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________ I've been wanting to read this book for a while, but I haven't had the chance. I've found it very entertaining and informative. I can see why so many people have enjoyed this book, it's just a shame I'm not able to get it at the moment.  Thank you,   Mike   review: ___________________ _______________  Dear Mike,   is there a place in the book where you provide a good summary of the book. I am not sure if I can find it anywhere.   Thanks,   in advance.  ...  Mike  Review of: How to Create a Successful Writing Career by Brian L. Henson This is a great book about the ins and outs of writing. It is a bit hard to find at the library, but it is worth reading.   a bit Hard to Find at the Library: _____________ ____________________  This book is very difficult to find. It was the best book I have read on the subject of writing and I have tried to read about 20 of the books on the market. The only thing I have found to be of any help is that I have discovered that the publishers have changed the title of many of the titles of books that have been out for some time. This has caused me to try and read more books that are now in the process of being re-released. I'm also not sure that the book is really any better than the books that I am reading. In my opinion it's more about being an effective writer than it is about the craft. I know this is a hard book to find and the author does not give many examples of what to do but there is still lots to read out there to get you started on the right path. I recommend this book to anyone who has never written a book.   at the very least it gives you some ideas. ___________  What can I say? This book is excellent. You will find a lot of useful advice in it. It's not about how to write a book it's about the whole process of writing a book and how to find your way through it. You may be disappointed at the length of the material but you will find lots of ideas in it that will help you along the way. _______________________  in particular for anyone who is starting out and wants to write and for anyone thinking of writing, it is the most comprehensive book on

Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book in a used book store, I'm pretty sure the person who bought it for me didn't know much about history. I liked the book and I liked it for its historical value. This book is a good summary of the first World War, but doesn't seem to be very good at explaining the war. The writer seems to think that the war was won and the German army had a monopoly on everything. I found the writing a bit amateurish and I thought the book should have been more interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- "I am so excited to get started on the second book in the series. I have read The Way of Kings (which I loved) and now I get to read the sequel, Oathbringer. I love the world and the characters in this series and am looking forward to the next installment. I'm glad I took the chance to read it because I love it." -Samantha (Crimson Empire)  "If you like epic fantasy (and by that I mean it is the genre where most of the action takes place) then you need to read this. The series is a long one (5 books total), so expect to be engrossed at the end of the day. I would recommend this to fans of epic fantasy, Lord of the Rings, etc." -Dee, The Mary Sue  AUTHOR: Brandon Sanderson  PUBLISHER: Tor  PRICE: $20.00 US (about $28.00 CAD)  in Canada  RATING: 4.5 Stars (out of 5)  the rating for Oathbringer is based on 15 reviews  THE GOOD: Oathbringer continues to push Brandon Sander's already impressive skill as a writer to the limit. He is once again creating something unique and unique to his genre. The book is an epic fantasy about the rise and fall of a young and mysterious hero who is trying to reclaim his heritage as a sword. The characters are well developed and you are really rooting for these characters to survive and get the justice they deserve.  The book is also very well paced and there are few lulls in the action. It also features a strong female protagonist who is both heroic and a strong independent woman. I also really enjoyed the characters and the world building. The worldbuilding is amazing. It's a world where magic is a real thing that people can practice and use. It feels very authentic and real. There is magic in this book but it is very different from what I've read in the past and it gives the book a new and exciting dimension.  the worldbuilding and magic is very authentic  MY RATING: 5 Stars  WHAT I LIKED: The book continues to build the world of this world that has been built. The story is very well told and the pacing is quite good. ,  I loved the book. I've been waiting for this book for years. I was excited to read

I have had a mental illness for about 5 years and have struggled with it for over 20 years.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I don't know how much I've read in the past 6 years, but this book has stood the test of time and I will definitely continue to use it. The main reason I started reading this book was the idea of how the ancient Greeks used to think about the universe. This book goes over the basic tenets of astrology and the science behind astrology. There are some good books on this topic, but none of them have the depth of this book. The authors have done a wonderful job in making this book accessible and easy to understand.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This is a good little book. The writing style is unique, and the story line is interesting, as is the characters. It is also very short, but that is a great thing in this day and age of ebooks. I will definitely be reading the sequel! Rating: --------------  This was a very nice little book that was not too scary. Rating: ----  I'm not sure why I like this book so much. Maybe it's because it has the perfect ending. But the writing style was very strange, and sometimes I felt that I was reading a ghost story. The ending was great, but I think that's just because the story is about ghosts. Rating : ---- , but i would give it a 3.5 for its nice story line and cute characters. I also really liked the ending, but then again I think I would've liked it a lot more if there had been a better end. Rating 3.75 out of 5. Rating is a little low, but still an enjoyable book. Rating 2.5 out of 4. Rating it was a nice little story, but it was very weird.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished this book and enjoyed it.  A very fun read, with lots of humour.  I liked how the book started out as a story of a little girl's search for a lost puppy.   The first part of the book really is about the little girl and her father finding the dog.  Then the story changes and it becomes a story about a young boy and his dog and his adventures and learning.  The ending was a little disappointing but not really a big deal as I finished the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished reading this book, and I love it. It is very funny, the plot is great and the humor was spot on. The characters are so well drawn, that I'm hoping they'll become more than just a bunch of stereotypes. I hope that they get some more development in the next book. I'm a fan of The Smurfs, so I'm very excited to see what happens to them. I am also a fan, of the movie and I hope it will be a movie one day. I love the idea of a world where people can be any species, even if they are from another planet, and yet still have a certain kind of "smurfish" personality. It's so different from the original Smurf series, and just the idea that there's still that same idea, that it's still the same thing, makes me very happy. I will definitely be reading this series, it's one of my favorites!

The book talks about how the writing process works and how you should approach writing as a creative and work on the things that matter to you most. I think that the best writers are the ones who have a clear idea of what they want to write about. I have read many writing books and this is the best one. I recommend this to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have had this book on my shelf for quite a while now.  The writing is solid, the world building is amazing, and the characters are really well written.    As the author said in the back of the book, "This book will give you a chance to get up close and personal with the most powerful beings on the planet, the Aesir.  And that is what this book is about.  Aesirs are giants, and they are also the strongest, most powerful and intelligent race on earth.  They are a very different species to humans, and one thing that is important to know about Aesyr culture is that they are the only race that can create magic."   If you like fantasy with dragons, giants, elves and wizards, this book has you covered.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good one! It is a very good overview of the basic principles of meditation and what it can do for you. It's an accessible introduction to meditation and it is written very well. The author is very gentle and it takes a bit of practice to meditate (and that's good, because meditation takes practice!) but once you get the hang of it, the book is very helpful and a good read. It is not about meditating, it's about what it means to be a Buddhist and to be part of the greater Buddhist tradition.   I love that this book has a spiritual message, but it's not just a "spiritual" book, it has practical advice and is very practical in its approach to the practice of meditation. This is a must-have book for anyone who wants to start meditating.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  A new reader asked me why there is not more about the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  In a sense, this is what I am writing about, the church and its history. It is my personal history, and it is also a history that is a part of the history that I love to study and read.  in addition to the history books on Mormonism and Mormonism's history, I also like books that are about other subjects: history of science and religion, history of political figures, etc. This book is about the Mormon church, which is one of the largest and most influential religions in the world. In addition to it being a large religion, the Mormons also have the largest missionary force, which has helped to spread Mormonism around the world in the past few decades. This has been especially beneficial because of the influence of the church in many countries and because of their strong missionary work, the LDS church is currently the second largest Christian denomination in the United States. It has a very large influence over the culture and lives of many Americans, but it has also been criticized for some of the same issues that other religions face, such as polygamy. This is a book that will be used in seminary and it will also be very helpful to LDS people that are looking for more background information on the church.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I have read this year. It is a wonderful book about a man and his experiences as a war veteran. I had never heard of the author before reading this book, but I am very happy that I finally got to know him. I enjoyed his stories and the overall story line. I was even able to identify with the main character who had his first war experience in a much different kind of battle than what we have been reading about in the media. He is a good soldier, but at the same time he was a good person. I recommend this book to everyone that is in the military and have had an experience similar to what is described. The Good: This book gives us a very realistic and true portrayal of what war is like. We see what it really is like to have a family of your own and how your family reacts to war. We learn about the war in Iraq as well as what it was like in Afghanistan. It really brings a new level of reality to the war we are fighting. This is a very good book about one man's experiences as one of a many men that has served in the armed forces. He does not dwell on the bad or the good but just the experience. It's like the story of a child who has lost an older brother but is just happy to have the chance to talk about it. He's also a good man, but he had his experiences in war that he would not want to repeat. It was good to hear about some of the problems we have with the media portrayal of war. Rating: 4.5 Stars

I tried to use the programs in this book, but I never found them to be very effective for me. I do love the way the book was organized and the exercises were easy to follow.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________   I enjoyed this book. I enjoyed the story, the characters, and the adventure. I thought it was very interesting, but I was a bit put off by the ending.   It's a very good story, but in the end it was a little too much for me. It was a good adventure story and I liked the characters. I just didn't enjoy the ending as much as I would have liked to.   of course I am not the only one that thought it had an ending that left something to be desired.  , and it didn't stop there. The ending is not the best. It doesn't seem to be a happy ending. There's no closure, and just a sense that maybe something was left unsaid. And that's just a little bit disappointing.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________ I have loved this series since I was a kid and have always been a fan of the old school and the dark tones of the books and movies. I am a huge fan of vampire fiction and have enjoyed a few books. The first book, "Blood Rites" was the first book I read that I was hooked. I was just amazed at how it could be set in a real life situation and still be dark. I have always enjoyed the vampire series and thought that this was going to be my next favorite. This book was awesome and was a perfect way to end this series. I thought it was fantastic and I am so happy that I got to finish this series! I can't wait to see what the next one will be!
Write a positive review about a good book: ************* My favorite book so far! I like to read about animals that can speak. This book has so many stories and has some great illustrations. I'm always looking for good animal stories to read so this was a nice treat!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read this book many times over and I have always enjoyed it.  The book is really simple and easy to read.   I really enjoy the book as well as the illustrations. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book for kids. A nice book for reading to the older kids. I loved it. I like that the little boy has a good reason to be afraid. I also liked the fact that he's in a safe place. I was hoping for more action, but it's good that he doesn't get all of the fun. The girl was cute, but I think it would have been a good idea to have some other characters. But overall, a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- This book was an eye-opener for me, because I didn't know the full extent of what my body could tolerate. I had read a couple of books about the effects of dieting and about how certain foods can lead to muscle loss and other problems. This book takes a more holistic approach to the subject, and I liked that. The book is a little long, but I guess that's why it's only 250 pages long. I'm going to be reading this book again soon.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you enjoy books and you have a few hours, a few minutes, and a few dollars, I recommend this book. It is a little on the long side, but the information is still very relevant. If this book was written by someone with an actual PhD in genetics (like myself) it would have been a 5 star review, but it's not. I'm a high school student and the author really did not know what he was talking about. For example, he talks about the relationship between chromosomes and sex chromosomes but then does not mention the X or Y chromosome in his discussion. He talks about chromosomes and chromosomes and he is not talking about the Y chromosome. So what's the point? So far this book is pretty much just another genetic material that is useful for people who want to have a good discussion about genetics, but you don't need a PhD in Genetics to know how the information presented here is not really relevant to me, a highschool student. The book has several chapters where he does explain certain things, but for the most part, he just repeats himself and does not provide the information he needs to have that discussion. For me, the most important chapters are 1,2,3 and 4. I've got some really good friends who are also high school students and they have just recently had the first (of two) children. In this book, the author does mention the difference between X and Y chromosomes. I think this is good, but he also mentions the fact that there is a Y-chromosome and a X-chromome, but never talks about that. I am curious as to why he never mentioned that. Why is he talking about X and not Y, and why doesn't he mention it? Why is the book about DNA but he doesn't mention the fact the DNA is made up of Y and X chromosomes? Why don't you mention that the DNA comes in two different forms? The author does not tell you about that because he knows you don.t need that information. I do think that it's good that he mentions that. The author also mentions that the Y-DNA is more complex and it also has more mutations. The problem is, the book says there is not much difference between Y and DNA, and then he tells you there is some difference. I don't believe there is any difference at all. For a good example, here is a page from his book that talks about DNA: 
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I am reading The World Made By Hand series by William Gibson now and I'm a little disappointed with this one. It is a great series and I love Gibson but this is not quite the book I wanted. It's the same old Gibson. Same old plot. Same tired ideas and plot devices. And yes the characters are pretty cool but there's not enough of them. I'm not sure how much more you can take Gibson. And if he's so awesome, why doesn't he write more books? Or maybe he does write more and his readers just aren't paying attention? I'll be reading the next book in the series but I'm having a hard time getting into this one (I know it's only the first book).
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is hard to believe that a book with the title The Art of Being Creative can be so bad.  The Art of being Creative is a great book if you want to learn about how to be creative.    It's a really good book, it's really worth a read.  It is a little short, but if you are a visual person like me, you'll really like the pictures.  The only thing I didn't like was that you have to have a computer to read it, and you can't read it on a Kindle.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed the book, and the story was pretty good. I thought the story line was well done. I did not find anything in the story that I found particularly interesting or compelling, but it was very well told. The book had a great flow to it. I have read this book a few times, and I always have a good time. The story is set in a post apocalyptic world where mankind has completely gone extinct, and people have lived in caves, or in the ruins of ancient cities. These are not just people living in caves though, but they have built these cities as well. The people who live in the cities are called the "Norse". This story takes place in a village called Dannfors. The village has a lot of similarities with the city, and they are both just trying to survive. There are a lot more similarities than there are differences. The characters are well written and their reactions to things and each other are interesting. I liked the Viking's reactions to the events. I like the way the characters reacted to their surroundings and the world around them. The main character is very well written, and her reaction to the world she lives in is what I found to be the most interesting part of the book. She was very angry at the Norse for not living up to the expectations they have of themselves. The author gives you a little insight into her life, and makes you think about her emotions a little more. I think the Viking in this story has some real problems with self esteem, and she has a hard time dealing with the changes the world has to offer. I felt that this story was good, but I don't know if I would read it again.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been a fan of the original trilogy since I was a little kid. It's the perfect story to read on a rainy night. The new books have gotten better but not really up to the standard of the originals. It would have been nice to have more action and more characters, but there is still a great story here.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book immensely. It is definitely an engaging story about a very good guy who's always had a special place in his heart for his beloved friend.  The story of how his friend came to be a little girl was a real story that made me cry, which I usually hate to do to a book. The story of the love and struggle that these two have to deal with is an inspirational one, and I think the book would be great for someone who is feeling lost and lost in life. I definitely recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a good story to read about a special friendship that is a little bit more than friendship.
Write a positive review about a good book:  " I love the idea of this book, it is an awesome and simple way to help kids understand the basic concept of fractions. I also really enjoyed the idea that the kids will be able to play around with different shapes and sizes. This book was a huge hit with my kids, and is the reason they like math as much as I do." -Karen R. on Amazon.com The book itself is beautiful and is a great introduction to fractions. The book includes a very helpful section on how to solve problems. The kids are able to try different ways of solving problems and are given some examples to help them out. There are also pictures to help you visualize how each fraction would look. This makes the book much more than just a book on fractions, it actually shows you how to use the numbers in the book and help you with solving problems. I was really impressed by how quickly the book made its way into my kids' hands and they are using it at home. I highly recommend this book for all elementary students as well as adults. The only negative is that it could use a few more illustrations as the book is very small. The overall value is high and it would be a great gift for a child's birthday.
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ The second volume of the book that helped me understand that a good person is hard to find, the second volume was also a very good read. I read the first volume a few years ago and was impressed. I thought it was very good. Then, I came across the first and second volumes of the series and was shocked at how much the stories have been improved. I've read many books and I've found that in many cases, the first or second volume has been improved significantly. I have also read many novels and have found that they tend to improve with each subsequent volume. However, I was disappointed in the first book in this series. The second book is also much better, and in fact, is a perfect continuation of the first one. I don't know why so many people are disappointed with this book. It is a good story, I found it to be a very enjoyable book, and I recommend it to all those who have read the previous two books. I'm also glad to see that there is now a third book in the series. It's not perfect, but I think the next book will be a lot better. I also found that the author has an unusual sense of humor. I found the humor to be more realistic in this book, not so sarcastic or silly. If you've read the earlier books and liked them, you'll find this one a lot funnier. If not, it's still a good read that will entertain. Overall, I recommend this book to all people who want to learn a little bit more about what it is to be good.

The story itself is pretty good, the characters are likable, and the plot has a lot of twists and turns that keep the reader intrigued.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "A good read. I loved the characters, and their interactions were entertaining.  The pacing was perfect.   I highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good action packed book." I am a huge fan of the X-Men and the Marvel Universe, and I have been a fan of Ms Marvel since I read her first story in the Ultimate line of books. She is a powerful female character who I am glad has a larger role in the Marvel universe. This is a great book, and a great addition to my Marvel universe collection. I have a feeling the book will be a hit with fans of the Marvel Comics, and is a must read for anyone who is a fan. I would also recommend this book to anyone that loves science fiction and fantasy. This book is a good mix of both. I'm going to add a small review of the author's blog, where she talks about the creation of the book. Here's a snippet from her blog: "This is my first book, but I have an impressive track record of publishing, and know I am well equipped to write a book. This project is the first step towards my long-term goal of creating my own genre-based books. The original plan for this project was to release a novella, but it has since expanded into a full novel. I hope you enjoy the book, as I do. Please do not consider this a sequel to anything. It is very different than anything I've published before."

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I have had the pleasure of reading this book for a number of years and I've enjoyed every single thing about it. The story is a good one. I have read a few books on the subject of religion but none that are as well researched as this. The author has a very good grasp of the history of the topic and is very clear about his religious opinions and what he thinks of religion as a whole. The main character is a very likeable one. He has a lot of strength and courage. I would recommend this book to anyone that has ever felt lost in the dark in life. You will have a wonderful read. It is short enough to read and is well written.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The only bad thing I can say about this book is that the author's tone in his reviews could use a bit more finesse. I found myself getting a little annoyed by the author, since he seems to be making his case on a more personal level with the book, which can be a problem. I would also suggest that you skip the sections where the author uses the word "fuck" in a very negative context. I think that a book like this should focus on how a community can come together for the common good, not on how the author personally views a certain group.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This book is a great introduction to the theory and practice of using the R language. The author is a professional computer scientist and he explains the theory in detail and gives a lot of examples and exercises that you can easily implement. I found that the theory is not too complicated to understand. The examples and applications are also well explained. The book is divided into two parts: the first part is an introduction to programming and the second part contains a series of programming exercises that are very helpful. The exercises can be found on the book's website, and the book itself has a tutorial chapter that helps you learn to program. I think the book is well written and covers a lot in a very good way. I would highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book. I am a fan of a lot of things and this one is one of them. I enjoyed reading it very much. I did not expect that the book would be so good. The main character was well developed. The narrator is great. It is very rare that I have a good story told by a good narrator.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I bought this book based on the positive reviews and I have to say that I'm still enjoying it. It is a short story about a girl who is kidnapped by a man with a huge amount of money and she is told that she must become his personal slave. She is sent on a quest to find a way to free herself from this evil man and to find her father, but she never quite knows if she's on the right track.   The plot is not as complex as I expected but it's still a good read. I've read many books about evil people but I've never read about one that actually shows them as such. I also enjoyed the way this story was written. It's very easy to read, but I like the way it's written. The author has a great imagination. I especially like how the author has written the characters. It makes the story feel real and believable. The story doesn't feel like it's trying to be something it isn't. It seems to be a normal story about two girls who are kidnapped. It was actually quite interesting how the story unfolded and I'm excited to read more of it.   the main characters are interesting. I liked how the main girl's family was very well developed. I loved how the father, brother, and grandfather were all very interesting. My favorite characters were the daughter and granddaughter. I found them to be very likeable and I liked that the author wrote them well. I can't say enough good things about this book. It had a very strong message and it really showed that evil can exist.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a big fan of fantasy. This is a new one for me though, so I have a few questions: 1. Are the elves in this book actually elves? I know the story was about an elf who was a thief, but the book never explained if he was really an elf or not. I mean, he was in a castle and I guess that's elf territory, but what about the elves? 2. Why did he keep going back to the same place he stole from? Is it because the magic he used was the same as the magic used by the elves he stole the magic from? 3. Is it true that the magic in this world can only be used to kill? I guess you could say that if a person is truly a monster or an evil sorcerer or whatever, the magic won't work on them. 4. Why does he keep killing? He's a thief! If he just stole the book, it would be his job to get rid of it or give it back. If he's going to kill people he could've just given the book to someone else and the problem would be solved. Also, he's a dwarf. He's probably strong enough to fight off the bad guys if he had to. He could even use his sword to kill. 5. How is he able to get away with stealing books? Is he a really bad person? 6. Why do the elves keep giving him back his stolen books? I thought that if he could steal books, he could get whatever he wanted out of them? 7. Why didn't he just tell the guy who took the books to give them back? 8. Why can't the thief just use the book on himself? Why is it the elf's job to keep him from killing people? 9. If the book could make the thief powerful, wouldn't it be better to just use it on the thief? 10. I'm really not liking this book at all. It's a very confusing story that's trying to be a very good story, but I just can't get past all the confusing parts and how it keeps jumping around. I don't like the elf because he's an evil dwarf and a thief and I don`t like the books because I'm sick of them already.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Book Thief by Peter S. Beagle is a novel with a message. Beagles books have always been political and socially conscious and this book is no exception. The book is told from the perspective of a character called The Book Thief, who is a former thief who became a thief again. The Book thief has to come to terms with the fact that he stole from people and now he must try to make up for that. The story is set in a medieval England where there is a war on, where there are different factions that fight each other, and where people fight for power and money. The main characters are the three main protagonists, The Bookkeeper, The Thief and The Farmer. The three are fighting to take over the kingdom and the king is their leader. The narrative is told in the first person and as a result the book is really well written. The characters have great voice and they all have their own point of view. It's the book that has got me hooked on Beagle books. The ending is just as the book starts, but that doesn't make it less of a good ending. The novel was published in 2007 and I've read the first two books in the series. I have to say that this book definitely needs to be in everyone's collection.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- So after reading the book "The War Against the Weak" by Robert A. Heinlein (I'm not sure if it's his original novel, but I think it is, and I read a lot of books on this author) it was quite a shock to me to read the following quote: "I think the most important thing a man can do is not to become a tyrant but to become what he is against. That is to say, if he is in the habit of being a coward, he may become a hero by doing what is impossible, and by not becoming a coward." That is a quote from a book written by a man who was a "hero." So I'm wondering: does anyone know if that is true? If so, what does it mean? I guess it's not too surprising that the quote was taken from a man like Heinlein, because he is a man that I really love and admire. But it's just one of those things that is not very easy to take, but it's true. As I said before, I'm a sucker for a good hero, but if it means being a "coward" then that's just not what I'm looking for.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good historical fiction story and a great read. It is full of mystery and adventure. The writing is great. The main character is very well developed and is not your typical hero. The book has a good balance of mystery/adventure. I liked the ending and how it tied up all the loose ends and added new elements to the story. Overall, I highly recommend this book. 6.5/10
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about life. It's a story about the author's childhood, which she describes beautifully. The author's mom died when she was very young, and the author was brought up by aunts and aunts-to-be, who had to raise her on her own. The book follows her as she tries to become a successful writer.   There is a lot of detail about the food she eats as a child. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves food and people who love good books.     I loved this book. It is one of those books that make you think about what's really important in life. I also loved the story.
