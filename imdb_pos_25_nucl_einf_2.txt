Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________The following are examples of the kind of movie reviews I've done:   "Starring Tom Hanks as a Navy pilot who crashes at the farm of his former commanding officer (Eddie Murphy). " - (Movie Reviews)   "[Hanks] shows some subtle physical change in the role from his portrayal as a character who'd be happy with a six-pack. This is not to say that the film is without physical comedy, as the character of Mr. Hanks does indeed gain the weight of fame by the end, but it does make the film a more realistic piece of cinema. If you'd like to watch it again, I recommend you see this film as it has a lot of heart and good acting." - (Tribeca Review)   The following are some examples of some of my favorite movie reviews:  , and this:  - and this(thanks again to everyone for the support) - and this, this and this The following is the best place to start when you want to find more like-minded movie lovers:  .

They come across a movie about a man who is a huge fan of the mission. When they come to a stop, a man (Tom Hays) stops them by putting the phone on the ground and telling them about his life that led to this moment."  In his review of "Flight of the Navigator", (the best one ever), John Carlin calls the film the "most humanistic" movie ever made, and I think he's right. In fact, I think it's the only movie ever to be considered "humanistic" by many of its critics. You may not think so, because it was considered to be "a science fiction film" or whatever the case may be.

As a self-proclaimed 'guru of cinema', I can say that I am not one to claim to be an expert in the field, but I do know that there are some films that just hit that magic button that you know that, just from the first scene, you'll love it." (Huffington Post)  ______________________________________________________  'American Sniper' review from our editor, Tim Grierson: "American Sniper is a movie about an American soldier (Chris Kyle) that is, in its essence, a love story: a man (Bradley Cooper) struggling to come to terms with the death of his wife and son, and his life and love, in the service of his country.  It is a true-to-life portrayal of a soldier who has given so much to the American people, and who, in his own way, is also trying to give back.  the film takes us through the highs and lows of the life of Chris Kyle, from the moment he enters the US Army and starts his career, to the time he was given the chance to kill Osama bin Laden, through his death at the hands of the Taliban – and how the US Government chose to commemorate his life. . 's' director, Clint Eastwood, is a very talented filmmaker, but it is his skill with actors that makes this movie truly great. Bradley Cooper and especially Kyle are superb as they bring their own individual personalities to their roles as soldiers.  at times, the story of the characters and the narrative feel repetitive, but in a way, this movie is about progression, and I think that if you can get behind this movie, you will find a very relatable, and inspiring story."  ______________________________________________________________________________________________  a book by Clint Easton, called 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly', which was published in 2009, and is now out of print, is used extensively in this movie as a guide to the life and career of the famous author.  in the book, Clint was very critical of the 'heroic' character of the American Sniper, and in fact he was also a big fan of Chris' 'heroism' and wanted to know more about how he got the respect he received. , which was Published in 2009. and is still in print.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  (B) the movie:   -I would have loved a better ending, as it had a ton of plot holes and left a few questions unanswered. But then, so did "The Empire Strikes Back" and the writers were still in their 20s by then, which explains the bad acting, the horrible script, and the overall lackluster movie.   --The special effects and cinematography are great, but there was way too much of them and I kept getting tired of them.   in the movie's last few minutes, when they are walking out of the spaceship, it looks so beautiful. I felt it was too long. Also, the scene where the little girl is looking at the sun and says that it is so beautiful is brilliant. The director should have used that instead of the one where she is looking into the camera and saying that it looks like the inside of a ship.   a movie about a boy who is a starship captain would not have had so much CGI. There are also a lot of bad CGI, including the giant creature and the water vapor effect when the ship is moving and the ship gets hit. In the last few scenes, the ship looks so powerful that it doesn't look real, which I suppose would make sense with the CGI. I really hope the movie is never released because there are a lot more plot holes than "The Terminator".   __________________________________________________________   (C) the writer:  ....   It's hard to tell if he is trying to be funny or not.  . The fact that he describes the boy as a "young boy" and compares him to the hero in "Journey to the Center of the Earth", makes me think of this book's similarity with "Dune" which is not very flattering.   was there anything interesting about the child that could have inspired the writer to write this story, or did it just happen to be an easy way to make money?   .. The idea that the ship would die was also very much similar to "DUNE". It was easy for the writer, with his background in computer graphics, to think that this could be the new "Star Trek". I suppose the boy may have thought that he could become a hero in the future just like the crew of the Enterprise. I doubt it, though.   has there been a good book about a small boy who gets his parents to become his captains?  :

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  I can't wait to watch the next one. It will be a great film.  By: John B. Latham  When I was a boy, my father, also a movie buff, always bought the next big movie. And this went on, year after year, until I was 14. I have one of those books that he got as a kid. I would sit and read it until I could recite every line in order, and I have since. Now, as I get older, I look at the book, and it gives me a nostalgic feeling as a child. That kind of stuff is what keeps you going. When you are 14, it gives you a lot of excitement.  of a good and I hope to see this one again soon. I don't think the writing is anything special, but that's about it. The director seems to have done a lot to make it more action-oriented. I don't like to be critical, but the action scenes are somewhat repetitive and don't have much variety. But I do like the actors. I wish they had played him younger. And of course there's the great film's score by the late, great George Gershwin.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tell people that you enjoyed the movie.  The more positive feedback you get, the more likely you are to remember the movie more vividly, and will get a better picture of its quality later. Be a good person:  A positive review is a wonderful thing, and a positive movie is a rare thing.  However, do not spend too much time reviewing other people.  You will not really know whether they like your review, or not.  It can be a waste of time and effort.  If your friend does like your movie, and you want to give him a good review, the best thing to do is let him know about it.  That way you can tell him that you're not just making up an excuse and that you really enjoyed it. If you really like something that you've just seen, then you probably need to do some more research on it.  Go to Amazon and read some reviews on the movie that you like.  Then, review them on  Amazon, and leave some comments.  It can take you a while to get a good reaction from other people, and if they do not appreciate your review or are disappointed by it, they can feel less inclined to like your next movie.  Also be sure to watch the trailer for the movie before writing a review.  I've been able to get good reviews for movies from trailers that I watched. Write a review:   When you're finished writing, go to Amazon to leave a review for the film.  Tell them why you enjoyed it, and what you liked about it, along with any suggestions that you made.  Make sure to leave an honest review as well.  Some movies, especially some that you don't have much experience with, you may feel inclined to write a review that makes you look like you were just going through the motions.  A review that's a little too positive, or that you had nothing really positive to say about the movie, can hurt you later, especially if you're trying to get that positive review from the review. What happens if people don't like my review? If someone leaves a bad review or doesn't like it, it doesn't matter whether you liked the movie or not, so don't let it get to you.  Remember, people have different tastes, and your job is to be a good friend, not to be one of those people. As far as leaving a positive, honest

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  My wife and I love the movie: I like the movie because it's got some good action sequences and is funny. I like it because it doesn't have a plot that requires too much explanation. I would like to see some more action scenes like the ones in the beginning of the movie. I love this movie for the action scenes. It's got a lot of really cool action scenes, it's just that it's not done in a very linear fashion. A lot of the movies I enjoy are linear, but this one is not. I don't know if the story is done well. I didn't find the main character (Harrison Ford) to be all that interesting. He is basically an action hero who doesn't really have a lot to do. I have no real issue with that. I liked the movie and think that it can be enjoyed by both fans and non-fans. If you like action movies and Star Wars, then you will probably enjoy this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   This movie's a bit slow, especially during the first 20 or so minutes. But it's still an enjoyable ride, because it takes a few years before the main characters fully develop. You can see this coming from the very beginning. You know who this guy is - it's him. And by the way, this guy never seems to age. I was surprised at how long it took for him to become more like a real person, but it's okay because he's pretty much the same guy by the time the movie ends.   Also, the acting is top-notch. The film uses many different actors, but all are great. The two main actors, Robert Redford and Michael Shannon, really shine throughout the film. Even though I had no idea who the other main characters were (or what their roles were), I was able to get a real feeling of their characters.   (And, yes, I just said that with no reference to the actual movie. Sorry, but I had to do it.)   The music is just right. The movie's theme is played throughout and is catchy, but the film's ending themes, which are played by the cast as they celebrate their success, are all awesome.  , my favorite movie of all time. (Sorry, "best movie of 2005.") You can expect to find the "bad guy" pretty easily (he's the main antagonist of the film), but the characters are still well-drawn and fun to watch. I just loved this movie. It's a pretty good flick.

This movie is good. The story line is interesting and it has some very impressive visuals, especially when the film gets to the part of Neo getting shot and Neo realizing that the world around him is not real. The action in the film is really well done, and the acting by Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne is great. The problem is that the plot is just ridiculous, and while it does get a little tiresome after a while, you do want to know where it will take Neo, and when the Matrix becomes a reality, and what will happen to those who find themselves in the world and how it affects them. This film is a little too far from reality for it to work, but it does do what it can and it is very entertaining. The only thing I really didn't like was the ending, but that is only because it took me a while to figure it out. The movie is worth watching, just like the movie The Sixth Sense. I recommend it to all of the movie fans out there, and I recommend you take a break from watching other movies so you can watch this one, and see if it makes sense, and if it can be made more enjoyable by people who haven't seen it. Also, a lot of people like the Matrix and don't like the first movie so I think you can get away with saying that you liked the first one too, but if you watch the movie, I don't think you will be able to forget it.  …

And if you've seen a movie and it wasn't good, tell us why.  Synopsis: "An all-new movie about a guy who discovers he can control the minds of other people. The twist? You have to be a little bit good at it."  Plot Summary: "A lot of people would do anything to get the perfect girlfriend. But a young, socially awkward guy is willing to try anything to be loved...including stealing and impersonating people on the Internet."  it's not an all-out-evil-theory story with a ton of "well, we already know they were the bad guys" subplots, but more of a straightforward supernatural mystery. There are some creepy scenes, but they're definitely on a low and it makes the movie seem a lot more "comedy" than it really is. I think the movie would be more effective with less blood and more laughs, so the "real" horror part is on the low end. I mean, let's be honest, how many people really were really going to kill themselves because of a creepy email from a guy with the surname of "Stallone"? And that was only the first film in a trilogy!  There's actually one scene where he's basically just looking for money or something for sex and he's getting more and more pissed as the movie goes along and it's supposed to be supposed to make him seem angrier (even though it was supposed to get him killed and stuff like that). I don't see how that's supposed in anyway to make the movie worse. So, the main issue I have with the movie is that it's too damn short. It was supposed be a trilogy, so it's really weird that it was only released as two movies. There's some good stuff here but it feels a little out of place in this genre.  a few other good things: There's a scene where a kid is stuck in the basement and he talks to the computer in the first scene (that's why I don`t think this movie needs a sequel, I think they should've just made a movie about the kid and the computer and the bad computer and stuff).

So, the movie opens with some really great action.    The movie sets up the action perfectly, and gets the audience right into the action.    When I say action, I'm talking about  the action that can be done.     This movie is actually  really fun to watch  and I think that a lot of the people who like action movies  may  like this one.  We are introduced to the main character in the movie.   The main character is the "Hero" and is not a super hero but a soldier who fights to make his way in the world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  "It's always better to see a great film the next day than a poor one the day after it is shown. It is only a small amount of film that one can see over and over again. I know this is not to be understood by everyone, but a good film does not take up any more room than the rest, and it has only a finite time to be seen by one person. Good films are like a little piece of the world's history, or perhaps the world itself. You can hold them in your memory, but they will fade as time goes on. You may be able to see it again, but you cannot take it from anyone. "
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Powered by  Sponsored By Facebook Powered by  At the beginning of each movie season, we watch dozens of movies as part of our film-goer education. I'd like to think I've learned a thing or two about movie-going and film-making. But the one thing I've not learned is how to find the good movies — and what to look for when you're searching for them. In the past, we've all read articles, attended festivals, and made movies in our basements — so when the time comes to watch a movie that's supposed to be great, we'll have been primed to find movies that we're likely to like, and films that are likely to disappoint. Here are ten things that will help you find the bad movies.  1. Don't expect a great movie to come right out of the gate. If you're going to go to the movies, you don't want to go in blind. You want to know that what you're about to watch is actually good. There are exceptions to this, of course. Sometimes a movie comes out of nowhere and just hits it out of its own box. But for the most part, when movies come out of nothing, it's usually because a studio, studio exec, or distributor is looking for a hit, or because the film has been picked up to be released by a major studio or by an independent distributor. A good example of this would be The King's Speech, which became an instant hit at the box office, but when it was released by Universal, it became a box-office disaster. It's probably more likely for a film to do well in theaters and in the home market than it is to do badly in theaters or in the box- office. In other words, it may be better to just go out and see the movie if you really want to find out if it's good, but don't expect to be able to predict when and if it will do well on the big screen. The good movies will generally not come out the first weekend they open, if that first weekend is any indication. "It's unlikely to be the next Batman movie, so wait and see!" "If the new Ghostbusters is as bad as the original one, then it could be the worst of the bunch!" And so on. That being said, if a movie is going to open very well at the beginning, it is

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  I don't mean it as a statement, I mean it in a specific way: You should make the effort to enjoy the movie if you're going to rate it. Do you know how many movies I see where I think "that's great" but then the moment I get home I start watching the review and I realize this movie was a waste of time? I would have loved to have enjoyed it even more, but I felt like I wasted a lot of time. When I'm at the movie, I'm the one doing the rating.  Now, if you really love the movie and really enjoy the review, then you can still have fun and not be upset that it isn't what you had hoped for. The key is to enjoy it as much as possible, even if you hate the whole thing.  with that said, here are some good and bad movie reviews:  5/10: A bad movie that really sucked, I was expecting something great but ended up feeling unimpressed.  a) The movie isn't even very good. It's about the main character getting out of prison. The whole movie is about him going into a prison, he gets out of it, he wants to stay in prison and then he gets the best case scenario. That's it. I don't really think you're supposed to care about the ending. b) The story is completely unrealistic, which is kind of the point, I guess. I thought they were going to try and make it more realistic by having the character's wife leave the character. I guess that would be realistic. It doesn't seem like the writer really thought it through either. c) The main character is so passive, he doesn't even have a good chance at a decent life until he makes a dumb decision. He has one conversation with his wife after he gets into prison that really shows how much the wife is controlling him, while he tries to take control of his life, the wife stays a little too close to him and tells him to shut up. She's the only one who can see how far he is willing to go, and he's a complete coward. d) The film has a really cheesy feel to it, it has no real charm at all, and it has a good score. I think it's supposed to be a film about prison, but even then, I don' think it was written as a prison story, it just has so many cheesy

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________  The movie was a good comedy, but i just found it really depressing. It was a comedy that had a good plot, but the execution was totally fucked up.   I just found myself feeling really sorry for most of the characters, even the good guys. Some of them were really annoying, and some were very boring. The movie made me feel sad about a lot of people, and i don't like that feeling.  ...  I had high hopes for this movie, because it's made by Rob Thomas, the writer of Robocop. But sadly, it was not a good Robocops movie.  __________________________________________  This movie is absolutely a must watch. The plot is pretty good. The action sequences were good. All of the cast was good. I had high expectations for this film, but I felt that it failed to live up to my expectations. I think that there are a lot that could have been improved upon, and the ending left me disappointed. The ending left a sour taste in my mouth and i just think that it was a bit too long. But overall, this movie is one of the better action films i've ever seen. ,,,,,,,,

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  There's a saying in the film biz: "When you're done, write a negative review of a good film."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A) Tell people what it is about; B) What people think about it; C) What it does right; D) What the critic thinks; E) What you think; and F) Do not say this movie is bad.  You know that the person you are writing for knows you are trying to make a point.  If you can write the above three items, your piece is done. __________________________________________________________ Write a negative review about something that you like:  A) Tell what people think of it; B/C) Give a few reasons why people may not like it; and D) If they do like it, tell them why they should not.  If the movie has no merits, it should be ignored.   If you do a poor job of giving all three of these items, you are not the most qualified to write a review.  Don't give them your opinion because that is what the critics think they are doing.  Be critical because you know something is bad and so you can express your opinion about it.  The best thing about criticism is that it allows you to make an informed decision.  Just write what you think about the movie. If it doesn't have merits then it should not be reviewed.  There are many things that people do not like about the movies that are not worth reviewing.  Some critics are known to do just this and write a negative, biased review about some of these things that they do not enjoy in the movies.  If they have not seen the movie, it is hard to judge them on what they think they know.  They might know more about the material than you do and can probably give you a better analysis of it than you can, or they are not allowed to review a film and they know it, which is good in my book.   But don't criticize the movie if it is not for you. Now let's look at some other topics of criticism.  Here are a few of them: Criticism that deals with plot and/or character development.    "The plot is uninspired, the characters are shallow and the themes are flat.  When I was a child, the stories of Peter Pan, The Wizard of Oz, The Three Little Pigs, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory were more imaginative and imaginative, and that made a big impression on me." -Meryl Streep  Criticizing what the critic
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________. It's simple. Write a negative review about something you hated or something you felt was way overrated: _________________________.  2. Don't start off the movie too negative.  that's a surefire way to get a negative response from the audience. start off with something positive, like "the movie was funny". that way you can go into a positive topic and not start off on a negative note. .  and I don't mean to be harsh, I just want to make a point that it's important to start out the movie on a positive note. and I also don't want to seem too down or mean about it, I was just making a point. So let's talk about my favorite movie of all time. the best movie, the best film ever. the ultimate example of the art of cinema. and that movie is...  . The Exorcist  and while I love to hate the movie and I'm still angry about the fact that they made a movie about satanic ritual abuse and still let the movie happen, they did it in such a way where people were so confused and had so much doubt about it that they went completely nuts for it. - and it's not just people that go nuts for the movie, it's also kids. in many ways they even became obsessed with it. there was this one kid in my grade who loved the movie so much he kept a poster of the film on his wall. I always hated the movie because it seemed so strange to me, and it had all the ingredients to be a really great movie. for example... the plot was very good, it was the perfect blend of horror, suspense, and suspense-thriller. they had just one real fear at the start of the movie. the only real fear in the movie was the idea of the demon possessed girl. that fear was all but ended when the girl started to go insane. that's when the movie really took off for me. The film was so well written and the acting was amazing. there were even some funny moments. all these things, combined with the fact it's one of the most famous horror movies of all-time make it such a great movie to hate. That being said, I really can't complain. I loved the film. The only negative thing about it is it is not as good as you'd think. the original ending was much better, but the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Review Title: The movie "Dumbo" had me laughing out loud. The music and characters made the movie an instant hit. I can't wait for the sequel. Rating: 5 stars (out of 5) Review Date: July 17, 2009 I can appreciate the effort that went into making this movie. I loved the music, the story, and the characters. The story had me asking myself: "Why is the lion in the cage?" The voice over by Daffy Duck gave the character an edge that I loved. The only complaint I would have is that this movie is short, and I didn't get the full movie. However, I was able to watch all the special effects in just one viewing. Thanks for a fun experience!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In my opinion, I found a great film about one of the best movie characters ever. Not only was it a great action film with excellent writing and direction, but it also had a wonderful soundtrack and great acting from the lead character.  The film was produced by a company called Universal Pictures and is about an ordinary young boy named Joe. When his father and uncle go away for a weekend, Joe gets the job of babysitting the kids while his parents are gone. It is an easy job, but Joe soon learns that babysitting is far from easy.  of the children are very different, and Joe soon finds out that his job isn't as simple as just sitting there and letting the kids play and have fun.  I have to say that I wasn't too fond of the main character in the film. I don't think that he was given a great enough backstory and development. He doesn't seem that intelligent or well developed, although that's probably a good thing. This is really a film about two brothers who are separated from each other by circumstance and fate. The movie starts off with Joe being very happy because he has got his new job. However, things soon take a strange turn and the whole thing starts to unravel. -The soundtrack in the movie is quite amazing. It's got some nice guitar and piano themes, some sad music, and the most haunting song of all of them – the piano version of the song "I'll Make the World Go Round".  -There's a lot of fun, colorful, and colorful characters in the first half of the film which really helps to build up the tension and keep the characters interesting.  as the film progresses the characters don't seem to get any more interesting or interesting and the film starts to get kind of boring. There's a huge amount of action scenes in this film but they don't really build up into anything very compelling.  The last half of this film starts off fairly interesting but is actually kind of a let down. It doesn't really get much worse than a lot more action movies usually do at this point in time. If anything it seems to be more boring and a little formulaic as compared to the first part of the movie. I found the film to be quite interesting and enjoyable, and was definitely recommendable to the fans of action films. The cinematography in this movie is top notch, and I found that the cinematography really worked well in this particular

In a scene filmed at Pinewood Studios, the massive structure is shown cranked out and slowly being assembled, with its gigantic, spherical structure towering high above a vast, barren wasteland. The Death Star, according to the film's script, was meant to destroy the planet Alderaan.  In Star Wars: A New Hope, the Death Stars were the mainstay of the Empire, but they were destroyed by Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. In the original trilogy, Han Solo and Leia Organa escape from the Death Ship with the help of Chewbacca, and flee the doomed Death Star in a Slave I-class freighter, the Millennium Falcon.  the ship's engine core is seen glowing bright red, and the ship flies towards the horizon. This is the very first time the Death star is seen in action, though it was later revealed to be a very different design: the first Death Star was smaller and more spherical. The design that would become known as the DeathStar was not even finished when the film was shot, as the film only shows parts of it from the outside.  in the film, the first battle sequence takes place inside the Deathstar, as Princess Leia escapes from a TIE fighter. The ship's exhaust port is seen spewing dark matter into space, and a group of stormtroopers fire a laser at the star as its core glows white, as seen from a distance.  with the battle nearing, the Rebel Alliance flies an X-wing starfighter to destroy a communications array that the Empire was using to transmit data from the Star Destroyer. This X-Wing is piloted by a female rebel pilot, played by Kelly Marie Tran, who is joined by a male rebel, played again by Domhnall Gleeson, in a brief scene in which they take off from a Rebel fighter. , it is revealed that the battle has already taken place. The TIE fighters attack the Death STAR from within, and destroy it, destroying both Alderan and the planet it was stationed on

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  "The most difficult thing in the world is to make a good film. It's impossible, you know? But, hey, you're gonna try. Why? Because you want to make it good, you want it to be good, and that's what it's all about. So you want a good story. Well, when you're making a movie, it's a story, right? It's a plot. You have a story and you want the audience to be in the story with you. If you do this right, the audience is in the audience with you, and they're with you in the whole story. They're the stars, they're the ones that you think of when you write the script." (Michael Apted, "The Storytelling Mind in Movies", in "Passion, Filth and Fear", by Michael Apt ed, p. 33)  _____________________________________________  A lot of stories are built upon small moments that are repeated until they feel like a constant. It takes a great screenplay to avoid making all of those moments feel so uneventful and monotonous that they're not interesting. In a perfect world, each and every scene is memorable, with no more than a couple of scenes that feel bland. But it doesn't work that way.  It's easy to find scenes that are memorable and to find those scenes repeated. But the ones you can't find again are the ones worth repeating. That's where your job is to find and create memorable characters, and the moments they share with the audience, and to make them grow and change over the course of the movie. 's screenplay is full of memorable moments. The first scene is an early, quick scene in the movie, set up the characters, the world, and setting. It isn't the only great scene in it, but it is one of the ones we'll look back on. The second scene is also a scene that is repeated throughout the movie until it becomes something more. There are plenty of other scenes that have great moments in them, but they're forgotten, and so they're out of the running for this list.  "When I wrote the script I didn't know what I was going to be doing, and I just decided to do it. I thought, 'This is an interesting idea, and if I can keep the actors involved and interested in it long enough, and not make them feel too confused

Discuss what you enjoyed about the film. What did you think of the story, the action, the cast, the plot?  If you see another movie, will you want to see it or would you want me to recommend it to you? ,  —  It is a well-known fact that the public will not accept criticism. To take it seriously, it should first be accepted. So, what should be said? I would like to start by addressing the criticism that I have received. I am sure most of you have seen the movie. If you have not seen it, I suggest you go and see it soon.The critics have said that the movie has too many baddies, that the action is very predictable, that characters do not have any depth and are basically stereotypes. Let me address these criticisms in their entirety.What about the action? If you see many action movies you will see that the first half of the movie is really boring. The action is there but it is never interesting or thrilling. The only time the action makes any sense is when a character is shot and the action follows shortly afterwards. There are also many scenes where characters are completely useless.The only characters who do any good in the movie are the villains. They show a lot of complexity, are interesting and even likeable, but you have to be very patient with them. They make up for their weakness with their cunning and cunningness. Why? Because this is the only way the movie can succeed.If you have been frustrated by action movies, I highly recommend you to check out the movie, because you will learn to love them.The characters? Well, you are probably wondering who is good in this movie. What happens to the good guys in this world? Well if you watch the movie closely, you will realize that they are all idiots. But that is not the problem with them, the problem is that they do not get to have any emotional depth or develop. They are all selfish and have no real flaws.In the movie they are shown as having one or two flaws which are really not that big of a deal and can be easily brushed off. They just fall short of being fully fleshed out and interesting. But in reality these flaws are not a big deal and

The key is the part that will give your readers that extra boost of joy you need in your review, in order for them to trust you enough to pick up on all the positive things you have to say. The most important piece of the puzzle that will make a positive movie review so successful is to make sure your movie review is short, sweet, and to the point.

For example: "This film is based off a great film in this genre: The Big Chill." You are just giving the film its name, not the movie. Don't tell your readers to check out that film, just mention it. 2. Add the most important, fun facts: This is something I have to do, because I get so many emails from movie bloggers and directors who have written such long, detailed reviews and want me to add them to the review. To add some fun facts to a movie review: This movie is about a family that gets involved in a murder mystery in the early 1900's in Kansas. It is based on the movie Big Chill and is directed by a man named Don Siegel. He worked for years on this movie. He would use the same family in his films all the way up until the early 1950's. 3. Keep it under 140 characters: If you use too many words in your reviews, it is hard for your readers or people to follow and understand what you have written. People are smart, so they will not be able to follow your movie description or what you just wrote. This is the second most important thing. Make sure you don't write any more than 140 characters for your review. You can put some extra words there to describe things that you want people to know about a movie like, which characters are in it, the main setting, or even something about the ending. Make your movie reviews to be short and sweet. That will make them so much more effective.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ This is a short but sweet sci-fi/horror story, and its got a very good ending. The story is about a man who is having a conversation with a disembodied voice, in a room. While this seems strange, the film has a very convincing plot, and if the movie did not have an ending this could be a classic. The ending is well done, the voice that is in the film is well written and does its job. The voice was also used in the short film The Sound of Her Voice (1971), directed by Richard Stanley. I've also watched the short The Sound and the Fury (1935), directed and produced by Orson Welles, which has the same voice. The short was a short adaptation of a story by Thomas More called A Man for All Seasons, and is about the relationship between a soldier and a nun. One of my favorite films of all time. I would highly recommend this film.  No Review yet | Posted Oct 23, 2005
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  Ricky_R  Administrator   Joined: 11/14/2010  Msg: 7 Review  History of the Planet of the Apes   So, I have been seeing this movie all week on the tube. I have never seen this before. I guess that is because I am a big sci-fi fan so I have not seen much of the movies that are more recent. The first part that I did see was the film "2001: A Space Odyssey". I did not like that one either, but the next two were just ok, not my favorite of the series. Then came the one I was looking forward to the most. Now, I do not know how many of you have seen this movie. I am just stating the facts for you.   "Apes are very intelligent and capable creatures. They have a large social structure with some great leaders that lead the way and control the others.   The apes have been known to create civilization all over the earth and have evolved to the level that they now live and work among humans. The apes that can speak and are more advanced than us are the most intelligent. They are not like us in the slightest. Some of them are just as crazy as we are and they are completely controlled by them.  . The animals are very different in color, size, size and many other features from man and they have a complex language of noises. They also have many of the features we look for in a friend, such as our ears. They walk on their hind legs and have four to five feet in length. They can run extremely fast for their size and their claws and teeth are very strong and sharp.   "   This is really about the most humanlike ape you can find. It does not bother me in the least that he is not a "great ape" like our friends. The reason he is considered a better species than man is because his intellect and culture is far superior. His society and culture are of a very high order.   in fact, the whole world is ruled by apes. He is the first person that is truly like a human being. There are several other apes like this that have been found. He can do almost everything we do but he has more intelligence. The humans are his equals in this way. The fact that he has been discovered so far is because he has a unique ability to communicate with other apes. His speech can be understood by

I'm writing this based on my own experience with both the movie and the fandom. I've read the script, seen the trailer, and watched the movie multiple times, and I will try my best to provide my own opinions and insight. A lot of the posts in the movie forum have had more positive feedback than negative, so I hope to see that change in this post as well. (This is not a judgmental post, it's simply based on experience.) 1. It wasn't very good. As a whole, it just didn't grab me. I didn't enjoy the whole thing and didn't even think it was good enough to enjoy if I wasn't already a fan of the franchise. I wanted to like it, but I just didn the whole movie. I know some people said the movie was better than the first, but it didn't really grab me enough for me to want to rewatch it. The entire first act was boring and didn " ____________________________________" 2. It's not for me. This is probably a lot harder to admit than the previous point, but the first half of the movie made me feel like I had watched a cheap rip off of Speed.

I remember at the beginning of the first scene, it looked like the guy that said "The movie is about a man and his dog who get into a fistfight with some bad guys." was in the room but wasn't in the scene at all. I also remember the scene where he says "So, do you know why I'm here? Because I'm the one with the plan?" (I'm guessing this is a reference to the movie's ending, but who knows.) I kept trying to figure out what was going on but all I got were random lines from random characters

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Write a bad review about ____________. The better you feel about the movie, the more likely you are to write a positive one. (Don't worry, this one's true.)  1. Give a reason why a person should buy this movie.  A good reason is something that you wouldn't say in a casual conversation about movies. You don't buy a new movie just because you like the star of it. You would give your reasons for doing so in a conversation with a friend. For example: "This movie was a lot of fun and there was a great twist at the end that kept me entertained for hours."  It doesn't matter what the reason is, as long as the reasons are true. , but it is your duty as a movie fan to explain why you think the movie is a good one. It is your job to convince others that the movie they love is a great one. Why should you be the only one who has seen it?  2. Let the movie speak for itself.  and, the movie should speak for it self. Don't try to fill in the blanks of the movie or the plot. Let it speak for the movie. I will try to give some examples of this, but you get the idea. . A friend of mine told me about a friend of his who had seen the movie "The Terminator". The friend told me that when he watched it he realized that the guy who was killing people in the movie was actually himself and that the only person who was killed was his wife. (It is important to realize that this friend had seen all of the movies. So he had seen every single one of the sequels as well.) , it is important that the actor who plays the part of the character you love in the film also does his job well.  on the other hand, I know of one movie where the actor played a friend who was supposed to be a friend, but his performance made it very hard for him to be called friend. The reason for that is that the friend in the show was supposed be the friend who only wanted to be friends with the main character. But because the friend was playing the part he played with too much care and attention, it was impossible for the friend to be loved in the end of the show. P.S. Please don't get me wrong, I am not saying don't talk about a movie or even discuss the

I got to know Derek over on the website The B-Movies Podcast, a group of bloggers dedicated to talking about and reviewing obscure (and even obscure) films.  In fact, this year, we put on a "Top 10 Lists" event at the Hollywood Improv where we invited folks like John Darnielle, Joss Whedon, Neil Gaiman, and many more!

The show has been around since 2005. .  the show is hosted by Derek Muller, a writer and filmmaker who writes and produces the show and is a frequent contributor to the Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek films. Derek is also an expert on the movie industry, having been on several talk shows discussing movies as well as the entertainment industry.  on the show, Derek and other guests discuss, dissect, riff on and analyze the best movies, comics, TV shows, video games, manga, anime and everything else under the sun!   . The series features two co-hosts: Michael and Tom from the podcast "The Geek's Go to Show". These guys are fantastic at doing reviews and interviews. I've learned a lot from them, and they are definitely a bonus.  (It's hard to explain, but it's like watching a podcast that really makes sense and is made with passion!)   This is a great episode!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here is a nice film that I watched recently that I really enjoyed.  It is in fact a great film, so don't hesitate to give it a thumbs up!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "What is it about this movie?" "I know, I'm not going to lie to you.  It's got some cool action." "I can't stop looking at the screen." "Wait a minute. Â What is it?  Maybe it's the great special effects or the brilliant story or the hilarious characters or even just the fact that the director is such a great writer/director/actor/producer." "Well, it's fun, so...yeah." "That's it?" "That's all there is to it. ~~~*" It's all too easy for some people to say that movies that are "cinema-y" or "good looking" are "bad movies."  But, I think there is more to it than that.   Here's why. Why should a movie be cinematically exciting, or beautiful, or just really funny, or have some really nice special effects? Because all of those things are great, but those things don't make a good film.  In fact, in a lot of ways, they are the things that make the best film. I've written about this before, but I really do believe that the only truly great film is the one that doesn't suck.  There is no reason to go see a movie that is a bore, or that's not a good looking movie, or a movie with too many plot holes, or one with too little action, or with too few special effects, or any of the other things that I just listed. The only true good movie is one that really, really makes you think, that makes you really want to see more, and that you are excited about going to see, and when you do, it becomes a really fun and exciting experience that you can't put down. So, if a movie has a lot going for it, why should you watch it? That's what movies are for. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ I was on vacation in California when I got my hands on this new Netflix movie, Stranger Things, on Friday and just fell in love with the story. The character development, the performances, and the soundtrack are all top-notch, and it just got better from there. My favorite scene of the whole thing came at the end of the series finale when we see the kids back home in the real world after the Upside Down is gone. There, they are surrounded by all of the old friends they made in their magical existence in the Upsidedown. In an early scene, a group of kids play in the front yard and then all of a sudden we see a huge monster on the roof of the house. It is the Upsider, the manifestation of the bad stuff that has been going on in their lives. We then see a woman in a doctor's coat running out of the kitchen, heading straight for the kids. It appears that she is going to try to help them and prevent the monster from taking them away. In the next scene, we see them just running away, the monster chasing after them. Finally, when the monster finally catches up to them, we hear a huge explosion and all the kids are out of its sight. It was a wonderful ending that really put this movie over the top. This movie was really well-done, even though it had many plot holes and even some questionable storylines. If you liked the Netflix show, you will definitely love this movie, which is exactly what it should be. You will probably hate some of the characters (especially the one who goes "I don't believe in magic") but that really just makes the story so much more powerful. I know I definitely enjoyed it. I am glad I watched this film as it is the best Stranger Things movie yet. You'll like it, and if you are a fan of Stranger Things you will probably love this as well. I highly recommend this film and will definitely recommend it to Stranger Things fans everywhere.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I will take an average movie and give it a 4, no higher. I think this is the movie with the most positive reviews. I have seen it so many times I don't know if I can give it an A or B, but this one is the most well-done and has the most memorable lines. Best Line: Â "Do you ever feel that way when you come across a really nice guy and you're just like 'Dude, I really would like to go out with you, but…'?" My friend who just saw it was like "Dude? Why would you say that?" Â But I thought that was a brilliant line. Â That makes sense in context of the movie, and it's funny.  Also, that line was directed by the same guy who directed "The Hangover Part II". Best Scene: ÃƒÆ'Â¢ÃƐÆ¢ÆÂ¢'Â¬" I like how they made the car chase in the first two movies look like it was shot on a Super 8.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  No more than one review per movie: This helps me keep track of which movies are "my" and which are "your" by knowing which are in the public domain or copyrighted. The same is true for movies with subpar reviews (like a bad movie or one that does not get reviewed very often, like a remake). You want a good review, but you do not want all your friends to know. Keep one or two of your friends on "watch-list" that you will not talk about the movie with unless absolutely necessary. This is also why I keep the book I wrote about the original Star Wars out of sight. The original film (as well as the prequels) is protected by the copyright, but the new trilogy is NOT. If you want my thoughts about the new Star Wars, read this post.  Don't mention my name or my book: I also can't say what my book is about unless I am specifically invited by someone. I do not need to know the plot, characters, or any of the plot twists in my book if you know it. In fact, it is against the law to name your book something that is copyrighted in order to gain a review. So just don't. In some rare cases, I do give out spoilers in my reviews. If I give you spoilers in the comments, you have two choices. You can comment as if the spoiler is from a movie review, like "So how does this film differ from the original film?" Or, you can comment that the spoilers are from a book review, and let me know the specific book, the title of the book, and the author name, so I can do a little more homework before I post the review. In most cases, though, I will just ignore the spoiler. "Why doesn't your book have a rating? It must be terrible!"  There are no ratings on Goodreads. , so the Goodreads ratings system doesn't work. I give the movie a rating of 9.5. However, I am willing to give the book a better rating in exchange for a written review. You should write your own review of the movie, rather than writing the movie review. I would write the review that I will give you when you write your book review for my book (though I will still accept a written preview). I won't be interested in reading your review until you are ready to write it, and you
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________ I really enjoyed this movie. It didn't really feel like a sequel to the original, instead I just felt that it was more of the same and that's exactly what I like about this movie which is the characters and their dynamic which really felt a lot like the original. The movie takes place about two years after the original film which I really liked and that just made me want to see what happened to the characters. I felt that this movie did a great job of adding some things that really are just nice and make the movie feel a lot more complete. The characters are very likable and you really can't get too mad at anyone in this movie except maybe a few of the characters such as the headmistress. I personally like her character so I can only imagine how it would have been if she had been played by another actress or someone of a different race. This movie does have some minor problems that I thought were really good though which I will touch on in a bit. The music in this is amazing. The soundtrack in this was great and I loved how the soundtrack fit the movie. I liked that there was so much variety that you could hear the music perfectly. It was really amazing how the music and the story line worked together in this film which was really interesting. The other thing that I loved about this film was the ending. It really was a really nice twist and really makes you think about what the ending really means. It felt really good that the movie ended with a twist because I really loved how everything was laid out. The cinematography and the direction and the editing of this movie were all great so this is a great example of how a movie can be a really great piece of art and how it should be executed. All in all this movie was really good and I really did enjoy it. It's a good sequel to a good film but you really shouldn't go in expecting a sequel in this kind of way. It doesn't feel like the same movie at all but you know it's not.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I had my first drink, I told the waiter that my mom had passed away and that I wanted to spend a nice weekend with my father, whom I'd never met. I thought the whole thing would be like a drunken picnic with a few old friends. Then the waiter came by and told me to leave the wine with the check.  The story is part of a new documentary film "Wedding Crashers: The Great Outdoors Movie," which chronicles the rise of the film festival.  the movie "Walking," directed by Mike Binder, is released at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday. A group of people were walking along a hill one day. One of them is a young American named John Miller. He and a friend were just sitting and chatting. Suddenly, his friend was knocked off his feet. The man says the man hit him. "Who's he going to believe," Miller asked, "me, or his?" A bystander tries to help.  The man doesn't stop hitting Miller. After Miller is able to pull himself up, he turns to the bystander and says: "Don't you know who he is? You're going to have to go back up and kill him."  After the incident, Miller takes to the local newspapers and TV shows to defend his friend. In the movie, he defends himself against claims that he caused the accident by saying that if he was trying to break up a fight, he probably wouldn't have helped. The movie takes a look at the ways we sometimes react to other people and how we use the media to show who we are.  for more of my videos, check out my channel:

I feel it is more accurate, and gives it an edge." - Brian   This movie is a great movie. It's got great action, suspense, humor, a good plot, and has one of the best performances from a leading lady in recent years, Michelle Monaghan. There's some great scenes, but one I particularly enjoyed was in the church, as her character, Sarah, and her sister, Anna, are running from the cops. Anna runs into a man who offers to help her find out what happened to her sister. He's a nice guy, but doesn't know a thing about the details of what happened. And Sarah asks him if he ever had a sister like Anna. And he responds with a sad smile and, "I guess you'll never know." The movie gives you all the information you need to be happy about the ending.   It may be a little dark, but the movie is very well done, it's good to see a movie that's true to life and has no nonsense in it. - Matt   So far I am very impressed with this movie. Very realistic. It feels very real to me. It really feels like a movie I want to watch. - Brian K., USA   The movie is real. It was the most accurate movie I have ever seen. - Mark S., USA (Read more reviews.)   I really like the movie "Mudbound" The script is brilliant, the acting is top notch, and it's not pretentious. The movie is so realistic that you can't help but feel for the main character, especially during the final scenes. If you are looking for a good story, and believable characters then the movie that follows is sure to get your attention. - Paul F., USA I liked it and think it's a great story of a man with an unexpected gift. - Rachael S., UK   Mud is a good family film. The film's screenplay is simple and to the point, with strong dramatic performances that will stick with you long after you've left the theatre. - John J., USA The movie was enjoyable

How about the ones you make yourself? You should always write from the point of view of the characters and never from the viewpoint of the reader. A good script can never take away from the emotional experience of the readers. The last thing you want is to lose your readers by making them feel bad or uncomfortable. A script can only do what the author intended to do. The only reason a reader feels a certain way about a story is because that story was written from the author's point of perspective. It's best to let the reader decide what they are reading. If the reader has a strong feeling for a particular character or scene, they will know to read that story from that character's point-of-view. If, on the

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________. ______________. ____. The "good" movie doesn't have to be a masterpiece to be considered a good film; a movie can have good acting and acting can have a plot that is compelling. However, the movie has to be good, and there's only one way to decide whether a movie is good or not: ____________________________. ______________________________. The first part of the test measures how well the movie is "entertaining." The second part of this test measures the movie's plot. It's important to look at these two parts separately because the movie plot is very important to your scores. If the movie had good acting, then you could be tempted to compare the plot to a novel, and the plot is the reason a good plot gets your scores high. However there are two major problems with this approach. First, in order to compare plot to plot, the plot must be a linear one.  If the plot involves multiple plot points, each with their own purpose and payoff, then it will be more difficult to compare it to a single plot point. Â If the plot includes multiple subplots, each of which is important but not necessary to the end of the movie, then your ability to predict the movie will be very poor.   Second, you can't easily use this comparison to measure how well each plot point is accomplished.  For example, if one plot point was better than the other plot point and the movie was better for that plot point, then we would need to know why.  We would have to see if the movie could be improved if the plot point wasn't used.  So why are these two steps important?  The reason the first part is important is because it is what gives a movie its rating, and we want to make sure that the movie we are rating is good.  It's the reason we don't use the second part in our ratings, which only tells us if the rating is fair or not.  The reason we use the first and second parts of the rating (and don't do the third) is that in order for our scores to be fair and comparable to one another we need to have a similar picture of the film as a whole.  If you watched a film in the same order and had the same score, then there would be little to no point in comparing them, as it would be hard to tell if the two movies were very similar.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ (P.S. It doesn't matter what I think, it is still the review)  I have heard nothing but good things about The Hunger Games, and it certainly lives up to its name. I just watched it and have to say it was a very enjoyable experience.   If you are not familiar with the book, you may want to read up on it. If you are interested, I can only tell you what I liked.  The Hunger Games is based on Suzanne Collins's book series of the same name, which also includes The HungerGames: Catching Fire. , the book is a series of books and they are about a series called The Hunger games. This is a competition for young children where two teenage girls, Katniss and Peeta, will have to fight each other to the death in order to win the crown of The Capitol. . This movie follows Katn and Peetas through a series that has all the suspense and drama you'd expect from the book series. There is a lot of action, a lot more romance, and a ton of violence.  The story is very much based on the books, but they have taken things a step further. They also have expanded on the plot. There are three books now, and they were all different characters that were not from the books. One was a boy, one was a girl, and one was just a child.   of all the books in the series, the most notable change is that Catching fire was written with a younger audience in mind. There were only two children and a few adults. They added a lot to the plot, and I thought it was well done.  the film takes everything that was good from the first book, but also adds in a lot that was not.  (This is not to say that the movie doesn't have much good in it) The first thing I noticed was that there was more gore in the movie. The first one was very graphic. This one was really graphic.   The story revolves around the kids as they try to survive the Hunger Games. The movie is very realistic. The way they tell it really shows the difficulty in this kind of event. They show us the violence and the emotional stress this causes. We are introduced to the various people in the Capital and see their thoughts and feelings about the situation.   This movie has a lot going on and I found myself completely caught up in the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  * It's hard to beat a film with some very good writing and an equally good production.  ____________________________________________________  2. _____________________________________________ * "Mud" is a movie that I watched this summer and I just kept watching it, but it wasn't until I finally finished it that I realized just how good the writing is. It's got an interesting premise (which I won't go into detail about), but it's also got lots of interesting ideas that the film doesn't necessarily get around to doing, but which make for a good story. ____________________________ The story of Mud is based on the true story of a woman named Helen and her son William, who in 1942 were forced to work for the Germans. It tells the story of the two boys who are sent to live with their aunt, and of Helen's attempts to keep them from running away. I really liked that this movie is really about an aunt/niece relationship, and how difficult it can be to maintain a relationship even when the family is in dire circumstances. I liked the way that they made it so the aunt had to work as a nurse's assistant to make ends meet, which is something that's usually reserved for mothers and widows, and the way the aunt, who is in love with the children, never really makes that relationship a priority. It makes it that much more heartbreaking. __________  Actors who appear in this movie are: ____________ I don't remember the name of any of the actors in this picture (it's not a very memorable movie), but if you're looking for some actors to check out, I recommend the following:   John C. Reilly, Tom Skerritt, and David Morse (as Helen's cousin). ___________  3.  _______________________________________ * The director, Joe Berlinger, did an excellent job at keeping things real and realistic. __________________ The film follows three characters: Helen, her husband, and her young son, William.  These three characters have a story of their own, and a very interesting, complicated, and moving relationship with each other. __________________________________________________________________________ 1. _____ * If you're going to write a movie based on a true story, you really need to know your subject and what makes them tick. Â The director did a very good job at figuring out the characters and making them seem real. ~~~~~~~~ 3

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I watched this movie in the theater when it came out in 2007. I was 17 and it was one of my favorite movies of that year. I remember having a really good time watching this movie. The plot was fun and the movie had a dark tone that was just perfect for this young teen. The acting was good and the music was really cool. I can remember how much I liked the ending and how it felt so good to have the movie be over. And for the people who haven't seen this movie yet, the ending was a very, very good and emotional ending. I hope people give this movie another chance because this is a great movie that should get a lot of love and attention. I recommend this movie to everyone, not only to people who are fans of comedy and teen dramas but to everyone who is a fan of a movie that involves teenage relationships. So now that I've gone through everything about this movie I'm going to give my review.Overall: 8.5/10 - This is a very good movie. It has the right mixture of comedy, drama, and heart. It also features some pretty strong acting and music. It's one of those movies where you see all of the good parts, but it's a little too bad that the movie was rushed and did not have a great end. This movie has a great and well-made ending that will bring you back to watch another movie from this same group of actors. I like this movie because it has some funny and great acting, a dark theme that's not too scary, and some good music. I really liked this movie and I hope you will too!

The film will be distributed by the Committee to Protect Journalists and will run for six weeks at movie theaters nationwide. In the film, Moore asks, "why does the American government continue to fight a war of choice in Iraq, which is killing thousands of people and draining our economy?"  ____________________________________________________ About Moore: Michael was an award winning documentary filmmaker and director of "Bowling for Columbine", "Wanted" and "Fired Up". He is now a documentary filmmaker, writer, radio host and political commentator. In 2007 he was named a Presidential Citizens' Medal recipient for his "Firing Up" documentary series.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ If the movie isn't a good one - it doesn't matter. I will not waste my time watching a bad movie. If you watch bad movies, you have no business in being a critic. What is the use of doing this anyway? There are a lot of movies that are just good. If people want to know what's good, let them go see it and let them write reviews about it. We'll just sit back and watch the movies. And then we will say, "Wow - this was good!" There are also bad movies that make for great movies. The best movie in the world will never be a bad one. I just feel that if the movie is bad, then the critic must be doing a bad job. A film may be made in a bad style, or with a bad cast, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it is bad. You may think that it has a bad story, but the story may be very good, and the acting may be good - but it will still be a lousy movie. Just because a movie is made with a poor style, with a terrible cast, and with poor acting, doesn't mean it is a bad film. I think that sometimes we look at a bad picture and we say, `Wow - that is a really bad movie!' But when we compare a good picture with a great picture, we say: `This is a great movie!' This is because we don't give the best picture equal consideration. I know it is hard to make people care about what a movie really is. It can be very hard to put something down and say, ``That was a really good picture. It really showed the power of art.'' When it comes down to it, I think it is important for everyone to be able to see a good, good picture and have an experience of a great film. For that reason, I am never going to waste my own time on a bad, bad movie (laughter). How do you like to watch a movie? ______________________________________ I like to go and watch a film in a big cinema, with all the people who are involved in the movie, and all the actors and all.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________  A little bit about myself:  I was born in 1968 and grew up in California. I attended a Catholic school and then went to a Jesuit high school. When I was about 13 my mother decided to move us to a different state and I didn't speak much English until my freshman year at University. My parents took me to visit a relative in Arizona and he introduced me to the world of Star Wars. I have fond memories of that trip including watching the first Star Wars movie with my dad on TV and getting to know the "kids." I was pretty excited for the first film in the series and it was great to see characters from the original trilogy such as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Darth Vader. I really enjoyed the story. It was also very fun to see Luke and Han talk about the future of the galaxy and how the Jedi Order could possibly defend the galaxy. The new Star Wars movies are pretty good. I especially liked the character of Darth Vader in the prequel films and I enjoyed seeing the return of the original characters. Darth Vader will be back to play a role in the new trilogy and I hope to see more of him. I hope that we'll get more of the classic characters such as Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda. I was also really excited to see the casting of Carrie Fisher for Princess Leia. I thought that it was very touching how she played Leia and I was glad to see her in the film. In the prequels Leia was played by other great actresses such as Meryl Streep and Harrison Ford and she made the character a much better character. The characters in the films were just fantastic. I feel that it is so great to have Carrie Fisher back as Leia and to see other iconic characters such Kylo Ren and Darth Maul also making a return. The best thing is that Luke is still an active Jedi in the movies. He still has a lot to learn about the Jedi way. They did a really good job in creating a new trilogy with the new movies. I enjoyed the films and have many fond memories.  ______________________________________________  How did you get into movie reviews?

Sarek is the father of Spock, a Vulcan who lives on the planet Vulcan. The plot is pretty much the same as the movie 'Starfleet Academy'. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) is captain of the starship U. S. Enterprise. His job is to fight
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________This is just an outline, anything not covered in it, is considered SPOILERS.The story opens on a group of teenagers in the middle of a field. They are playing around as an older man, who seems to be some kind of police officer, walks over. The scene switches to an image of the older man running towards a man, and the man turns and fires a gun. The older man turns around and tells the boy that he has been shot. The boy gets up and walks away, looking at the scene.A short time later, the scene goes back to the older boy, who tells his son that the boy will be okay, and that a "big man" (the old man) will take care of him.The boy walks away from the scene, and an elderly man approaches, and he looks at the younger man, then back at the boy. The younger man walks away again. The elderly man turns back around, looks at his son, then at the other boy, and then towards the boy, as if trying to find out how he survived.Then a voice comes on the radio saying that a young man, "A.J.," had been killed, and a search is being made for him. The young man is described as a boy in his late teens. It's unknown who "A" is, but the older guy is described using the term "man."The next scene is in a field where the boys are now playing with their friends. The boys are having fun, and one of the boys says, "Hey, I just saw that movie.""I don't see that," another boy says, and another boy replies, "That's a sequel to the movie I saw a month ago." They all laugh. Then a picture comes up on the screen. It shows a man who looks like the older boys' father, looking down at the camera and smiling.A long time later a younger man comes into the field with two other men. It appears that his eyes are red, but he is obviously an older person. He appears to be a police officer. The man walks up to the boys, who look away. The police officer takes out a gun and fires several shots, then turns around. The other two men run back to a car, as the man on the road says,I did not understand how this movie would have been more interesting if they hadn't left the other movie in the hands of the cops. It

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I love to go to theaters, especially when they are showing my favorite movie, but when it's a movie that I really want to see but don't get to see, I've had issues with the people working at the theater. The best example of this was the time I went to see Jurassic World: the entire time the theater was trying to make sure I knew about their plans for special offers and other things. I actually found myself laughing at the idea of the ticket prices in the movie because it was all over the place. The only redeeming feature was when I got to the end of the movie, the ticket agent said to come back the following week, when I was in town, and let me know what the special offers were and I would be able to get the same special offers. Another time when I went, I was with a group of other people and we decided to just go and sit outside because we didn't want to have to spend money on something we didn`t want to watch. We sat outside for the entire movie and all of the people sitting in front of us, at least 2 of them, were enjoying the movie and telling me about it and enjoying the night. When the movie ended, we sat in the same spot they sat in when we got in, the guy at the front had the front row ticket and we were all sitting together. We just sat there and drank beers and had fun. They ended the movie by playing some music, so we just sat in silence for a while. That was my worst experience at a movie theater, ever. I`m not even sure if they had good special offers or not, I don't know. But I felt bad for those people who were sitting in the back of the theater and I wish I knew more about the movie they were watching because I had such a bad time, and then I realized I can't change the way they are and hope that the future will be different. When we have the special features on the big screen, I want to be able sit in the front for an entire movie so I know how the special is going to end and I don`t have to be worried about it. Thanks for reading and have a great day,  The only negative that I can give this movie is that the ending is pretty much the same as the movie. The last movie they did, 'Jurassic World', was a good film that I enjoyed immensely. I wonder if

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I loved this movie. It was awesome and had an amazing cast of characters." "I really enjoyed this movie...it had lots of humor and action and it's definitely a classic." Review :  I haven't seen this film since it was originally released. I went back to see it because I had to see the trailers for it again. The first time I saw the film I was in elementary school and I liked the movie. The movie is about a young girl who lives in a farmhouse, which has some animals that can be seen outside, but she doesn't talk to them. One day she sees a horse, and she begins to grow a small crush on it. After school, she decides to ride it home, but this time, she rides it to the horse's pasture and it leads her to a house. She falls in love with the man in the house, who gives her a necklace. But then, this man suddenly disappears, and her friends start to disappear, so she starts to have a lot of trouble. The woman she had a crush on, however, has gone to a different man, and this man starts to date her. Then, a young boy in the town catches her eye and, along with her friends, helps her find the boy, who is hiding. The boy is named Tom. Tom becomes her friend, and the two of them begin to see each other. So the movie ends when Tom and her friend go to the house the man is staying in. As for the characters in the movie, they all acted very well. I'm surprised that this film has been around for so long, and is still being made. I think this is a great movie because I never felt like I was bored during the movie and it kept me on the edge of my seat, thinking "Where is the next great action scene coming from?" The characters are very diverse, with many different things going on and a lot to look forward to. The girl and the young boy were both cute, and I really enjoyed seeing them in the screen. The only downside I found in the characters is the young man. His name is Thomas, but you never really learn who he is. It would have been nice to have him named something other than Tom, but I can't say that I'm sad about that. His character was not too bad, but when it comes to the story, I just thought the story was too long. I never got

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________  I just finished a film with this one star and I couldn't understand why. I'd just bought the ticket and was about to watch it in the cinema when I started to think "Wow, this is a bad film!" But the minute the film started, it changed. I watched it with my son and we were laughing so hard and so much! I watched a horror film once but I can't remember what the film was about because it was not fun. I love horror films but this one was so funny and scary. The only negative thing that could be said about it is that the music was not that great. It was not like The Dark Knight soundtrack, but not bad. I guess the movie doesn't have a soundtrack because it's so good that you don't need it. I would definitely recommend this to people who liked the original movie because the ending will be very scary for everyone. The last thing that I want to say is that this is not a comedy, there are lots of jokes in this movie but it's not a funny film. There is so much tension in the film that you will die just by watching it, so don't be afraid of that!
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________ I enjoyed watching The Crow, but I think it would have been better had it been a more mature piece of work. There are definitely some moments in the movie I liked, like when the group is hanging out in a warehouse and a truck full of men arrive, but other times it becomes over-the-top stupid. I think the movie would have benefited from some more editing and sound editing. As a whole, it is a well-acted movie, but one that feels like it was filmed with the intent of selling more than it is worth.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This isn't a movie I thought would make it onto my Top 10 list, but I had to include it.  The Movie:  Starring: -Avery Brooks-Kirsten Dunst-Jason Bateman  -Miles Teller  Plot: In the mid 1980s, an experimental group of physicists discover a mysterious new particle, that's predicted to be even more powerful than a proton. As this particle is discovered by a team of astronomers, it's classified as a "dark matter particle".  What I Liked:  of course this is my favorite movie of all time, so it's no surprise that I liked it so much. The premise is great, and the cast is awesome. They all did a fantastic job of keeping the tone of this movie realistic and grounded while at the same time being completely outrageous. I really loved how they handled the science of this particle, with many of them having PhD degrees and being able to explain it at a level that a twelve year old could comprehend.  for example: "You know how a lot of times when you look down a telescope at a star, and you see something like the "Gemini", that's basically just a large, pointy star, you know, but with some fuzzy and distorted features? That's dark matter! In the case of the Geminids, it was some of the most spectacular images I have ever seen!"  the other thing I loved is how they made the entire movie so believable. I loved that the scientists weren't trying to pull any pranks on the scientists at all, but were actually trying to be as honest about the subject matter as possible. And it was so great to see these scientists and scientists in real life not just using the same scientific jargon but still communicating effectively. The movie does a great job of not just telling you that dark matter is real, but why, and how it could affect our daily lives if we did not realize it. There is also an excellent story arc, and many of the scenes were so well put together and full of emotion that I was left in awe and wonder just how such a small concept became one of the biggest discoveries in the history of science.  I also loved how this movie got to explore science without making it feel overly complicated or unrealistic. I also really liked how they kept it real by using real actors who just acted the part, and not just CGI. They

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ I've tried to make my rating more objective than any other review. This is my review of the movie "Fantastic Four". I do not think that "Fate Of The Furious" should be classified as a "bad" movie as it just had a ton of fun and made its money back. The acting was superb and the action sequences and fights were well choreographed. I thought that this movie was more of a throwback to the older "Fist of the North Star" films like "The Big Red One" than any "Furious". "Fury Road" does have a lot more action and fighting and "F4" had more comedy and family moments. The only major problem that I had with the movie was that it had some bad dialogue and the story line in the film seemed to be too obvious and obvious at times. I don't think that I would want to watch this movie again. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I'm glad that I watched it and found it entertaining. This movie was a box office bomb. So if you are in the market for a fun summer movie with a ton fun action sequences, "FANTASTIC FOUR" is for you. Rated 5 out of 5 ______________________________________ Fantastique Movie Review by: Jeff A. A movie that has left a massive impression on me since I first saw it, F4 is the first big-screen movie about mutants in over 20 years. It's a great movie! I would go so far to say that it is the best of the modern X-Men series! A little background: X-MEN - The Last Stand - Rated PG - The final movie in the X-Treme series was an amazing mix of the old and new and did an amazing job in setting up what was to come in the future. But it did have one issue - a little bit too much in the way of exposition and plot twists which was distracting at times and ultimately ruined the whole movie for me. This film had more of the former while still doing the new thing. It took the best from the last one and mixed it all into one. F4 continues the trend of the series by giving more of these X-cameos, but with more of them being the bad guys rather than the good guys. The movie also had a few more villains. The one that I thought was the most powerful in the movie (as far as villain roles

Write a positive review about a good movie:  -5 points Do you remember when you watched a movie and thought "Hmmm, I thought of doing that in a scene" Then a few months later you realized you forgot? If so, you should stop what you are doing right now and watch it again.  Don't think about that scene now. ____________________________________________ 2. _______________ There are some movies that just have an amazing effect on you.   They just make you cry, and maybe even laugh out loud.  And then you watch them over and over again and you think "Wow, I'm having a flashback to that movie!  I want to watch it over and again!"   When you watch a movie over and times it, you start thinking "I want to see that scene again."   So watch it, but think of the scene differently.  Do you want to keep watching?    You will feel a re-experiencing of that scene, with a new thought in your mind.  This effect can be very powerful.  A little bit of a "happier" feeling when you watch it  It will also give you the feeling that you are able to re-experience the scene.  Do this for as many scenes as you can think of.  Then the feeling of the movie, will be sooo much more intense.  You can actually re-memorize that scene. When I watched the movie "Iliad" again, I felt as if I was rerunning the entire epic.    It was the exact moment I remembered that scene (when I saw the fucking dragon fly by).    I could not believe that was my first time watching it (I had seen it in the theater as an adult and I was very excited when I saw it again!).    And it made me feel like I was re-living the whole epic again.     Then I thought "That's amazing, I have to get that scene out of my head and watch again!"  _______________________________________ 3. _____ When you remember something from a movie you have not seen for years, the memory is extremely vivid.  If you can remember something in the movie it will feel like you have seen it before.  I remember the scene from the movie "Mystery Men".  That

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________   We are proud to announce that this month's movie recommendation is a great film. The film is, in our opinion, The Shining, which is a horror movie based on Stephen King's horror novel. The Shining is a Kubrick movie and one of the few in which he doesn't show his true artistic talent and abilities. I won't describe the film in detail but it's a must see. Kubrick doesn't let the camera take control. You have to see the movie and experience it for yourself, but it is also an entertaining movie and a good time. This movie will bring some chill and we suggest you to stay with us as we make some popcorn, enjoy some popcorn and relax.   ______________________________________________   This month we have a great selection of movies with a movie theme.   the movies we are showing are: The Devil's Candy (2005) A Tale of Two Cities (1915) Jaws (1975) The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2001) The Shining (1980) Top Gun (1986) The Exorcist (1973) It's a Mad Mad Mad World (1998) American Psycho (2000) Apocalypse Now (1979) A Clockwork Orange (1971) The Usual Suspects (1995)

A good time is better than a bad time and that is the message of this movie with a lot of humor. One of my favorite actors. I enjoyed it immensely. I'm very happy.  "Rent" Review: A good, entertaining movie that is an entertaining watch. One thing that can be argued is that the story is a little too long, but the movie is more like a 90 minute comedy then it is a thriller.  the ending of the film left me a little disappointed in the end, but I understand why it was done. It is very much a comedy with a little mystery in it. The cast is great, especially the lead actor. I am not a huge comic book fan, but this is the best comic book film of all time. I would highly recommend this film to everyone. If you're a comic book nerd this is a MUST SEE. if you're not you might enjoy it a little more then a comic. It would be fun to see if the story was changed and if the ending was left out. Overall a great movie.

If you want to be a critic, get a better pen! ______________  A positive review in an online review system (i.e. Amazon.com, IMDB, Netflix.com) usually means that the movie has "made it" in the eyes of the public.

However, if you see that "Not Rated" (NR) on the review, it might be an example of a low-quality online review. A few good movies (NRs) listed on a major online reviews site, usually indicate that the film is not popular among the film fans. (NR = "Not rated" and sometimes also "Not Recommended.") This indicates that the public doesn't like the film. So it's not recommended, but the film can still be good. : The name of a film is usually something that will tell you about the type of film that it will be. For example, an R-rated film is likely to be violent, a PG-13 film is more light-hearted, and a PG or PG-15 film is a more "adult" film. The title and the description usually give you a little information about the film, such as the year it was released and the director.  and the synopsis usually give a little more information about a movie! : The subtitle is usually the subtitle of the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ 1.5 / 5 **** _____________________________________________________________________ The first time I ever read the book, I loved it. I wanted to be a Jedi. I had a big crush on Yoda. I was excited to see Luke Skywalker's return to his old lightsaber. However, in that moment of elation, I realized that in a lot of ways, the story was the opposite of what I had dreamed it would be. It was filled with the mundane details and mundane actions that a human would do when they weren't being trained by a Force-sensitive. As I read on, I found that the story also had elements of magic, which made it a little weird. I also liked that the action was always a little out-of-control, with the good guys just barely able to hold on to their sanity. There were also a couple of times when it was just downright stupid and hilarious (and a couple times when they just ruined it). I think I enjoyed the book a lot more the second time through, when I realized how much of a flawed and immature person I was. I didn't enjoy the story because I wanted Yoda to come back and save the day. I liked the story, even though it was silly, because it was a different story. I think that it took me a few hours to even get halfway through the book and I really didn't like how it ended. (I think it was written in the third person). But I still really enjoyed it and it was definitely worth reading. In that moment, I felt the Force.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Tweet  Good movie by the way, this is the first movie i ever saw that i was actually happy with. The story was nice and exciting. i really enjoyed this movie, maybe i would give it a 6 if it wasn't for the ending. The only problem i have with the movie is how it felt like a video game and didn't really feel like a movie, there are so many scenes and events i didn't like. The ending was also very disappointing, what happened after this is just a bad ending. Maybe if the movie was longer and not as short like it was, it would have been good. But I just liked the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The film is well-acted and well-directed, with a good variety of shots and a well-written story, which is supported by a strong cast." "This film is an enjoyable ride, with well-done acting, great action sequences and the perfect blend of humor and suspense." Noah Baumbach has always had something to say about movies. It's why he's not just the star of his films, but their leading man, why he takes the lead in his directing, and why he made his career with such films as Greenberg, and Greenberg II. In fact, some would say Noah has a knack for finding and expressing the best in movies, something that I personally feel is his greatest strength. While Noah is no doubt talented, I think the way he does his job is what really sets him apart. He is able to find what makes a good film, and that is why he can get the best out of them. It may be hard to get into because most people aren't used to him and are used to a more dramatic look at his films. I don't think that is a bad thing. Noah has his own style of filmmaking, and what makes him work so well is his ability to find the good and to bring that to the screen. His films are more like films that are about life and characters, as they are so true to life, but they are also really well told and thought out. Noah's ability to get the most out of a story is what makes his work so much fun and exciting to watch. For those who know Noah, there will be a lot to like. For the rest of us, we are in for a treat, as Noah's films are something that have that rare quality that you really just have to see. If you don't know Noah's work or are looking for something a little different to watch, he is a great choice. The only way to not enjoy Noah's cinema is to not understand his story. I would recommend Noah's new film The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)  and to give it a watch. The Meyerowtz Stories is a comedy, but it is also a tragicomic one at times, and is as touching as its main character is flawed. His next film will be Noah Baumbachtig is directing the feature film A Hologram for the King, which is a very different kind of movie to what he is known for. It is a big

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________  Click here to write a review and get a FREE copy of "How to Talk to Girls at Parties: The Step-by-Step Guide to Better Conversation and Thriving in Social Situations" by Charles Bukowski.  We read a lot of books to improve our lives and learn new skills but we're terrible at reviewing them. We forget the book is there, we lose track of it, and we end up not getting the most out of the material. And if you're like most people, you're probably reading a book that you've never read before. But that's why I write reviews—to help other people discover and read books they might have forgotten.    That's why, when I'm asked if I recommend a book to someone I usually say, "Absolutely."  As a matter of fact, I do. I've given hundreds of lectures and workshops around the world and given thousands of interviews and wrote four books, but this is the only book I can recommend to you. The problem is, I can't do it without your help. In the last couple of months I've been overwhelmed with emails and messages from people asking for my "book recommendation" and "review," so I thought I'd write a post to help you with this, too. And I'm going to tell you about all the books I've reviewed and tell you why I give these top recommendations to my students, so you can avoid being overwhelmed too.  the five reasons to give a book you've read a positive rating:   1. It shows you were smart enough to give it a try. If you give a positive reading, you'll look back and think, "Wow! I really did the right thing. It's not just my opinion, it was the right book for me." And you'll be able to tell yourself, "I'm smarter for having read this book!"  2. It will open your mind to new ideas. If somebody has taught you something, there's a good chance they will also be able teach you something new. Sometimes the books you've already read are just good. They're not amazing or anything, but they are good and that's what counts.  that's something to think about: What do you know that you're not telling people about? How do you teach someone something that is new?  3. It helps you get rid of those "stuck" thoughts. If

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered  By Josh Neufeld and Joshua B. Brown  September 6, 2012  Hollywood studios are pushing hard for "Fast and Furious 6." But a new report suggests that studio executives are spending millions to create bad movies for the sole purpose of getting their own products released to theaters.  The report, which uses industry figures to estimate total costs associated with producing movies, finds that Hollywood studios spent $3.4 million on promoting "The Incredible Hulk" in 2010, the same amount that it spent on promoting the same film in 2009. By contrast, "Fast & Furious 6" spent $1 million on promotion last year.  a report by the Center for the Study of the Public Domain (CSDP) found that "Fast Five" director Justin Lin's "Fast Seven" was also a victim of overpromotion — his previous films cost only $1.4 to make, but he spent $2.8 million promoting them to theaters, the CSDP said. , a report on public domain films published in December 2012, concluded that "fast" movies have a "gross profit margin" of less than 3 percent. If the same movie were produced without Hollywood's interference, the cost would be about $18 million, but because of the hype and marketing spending, it cost $55 million. "Fast Six" cost $53.5 million to produce. . This is because the studios spend so much money promoting a movie that they're forced to make a sequel or reboot the franchise. That's a losing strategy, and it's not what consumers want. The report found that in 2008, "The Hangover" was a surprise box office hit because it was released in August, with a massive promotional campaign that included commercials, a music video, a full-length TV commercial, and a big feature in the New York Times Magazine. Despite all this, it only made $65 million in its first year and eventually lost money. "Hangover Part II" was released four months later and again made only $40 million. The reason, according to the Times: "Hangs" director Todd Phillips's insistence on doing all the promotion himself. I don't believe Hollywood is trying to make "The Hulk" a hit movie just to make money off of it. They've invested a lot of money in the promotion of this movie and the marketing will likely

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  Why?  This is a good thing. We are trying to encourage a good film and good review, and to do it in a positive way. I will be posting my review in this forum as a means of making sure that it gets seen. If there are any other forum members with similar interests that you think would be interested in seeing this film, please do post your name and a brief description for it and we'll get the word out!  Who:  We are an independent production company. Our first short film, "Coffin", was released to great acclaim. We've now returned with another short, "I AM A GOD". It has won several awards at film festivals and has been received with great critical acclaim.  What:  in addition to this film and our other work, we're trying to become better filmmakers. This means working to better understand the film industry. We want to become more efficient in our work, and more informed about what's happening in the film business. We also want to be able to offer free services, such as video editing and digital sound recording, to filmmakers around the world.  the short film "I am a God" is a critique of religion and belief systems. It is a look at how people come to believe in absurd and illogical ideas, and how we are all victims of such beliefs. The film is a short film that's been in the making for about a year now. It's the result of hours of editing, research, and conversation. We're using a technique called "post-processing" in which we capture the most important footage of a film as it's being made.  "I Am A God" was produced by me, and my wife, Lauren. "Cock and bull", by Jay Mohr, is our main musical score. "Hurt" by The Black Dahlia Murder is the soundscape for the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  1. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982)  Star Trek was about to change forever with its sequel, "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock," in 1982. The first film established a lot of the mythology of the Star Trek universe and gave new life to the crew, while the sequel was a departure from the original, setting it a decade in the future, with the crew's captain, Spock (Zachary Quinto), returning to Vulcan from Earth and having a new, more human-like son. While it was a lot to ask of the cast (Spock, Uhura, Scott, Sulu, Chekov, Uhata, etc.) to reprise their roles the way they had done in the original film, and while it was certainly a challenge for director Nicholas Meyer, the result was a much more mature and grounded film. The cast was allowed to explore new characters, and the movie turned out much better than anyone could have imagined.  2. Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)  for Best Original Screenplay:  The film's third act was a complete change of pace, as the main villain, Darth Vader (Christopher Lee), was replaced with the bounty hunter Han Solo (Harrison Ford). Ford was a brilliant choice for the role, given his previous experience as a bounty hunter in Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Indiana Jones films, but he proved a perfect fit for the character of Solo. The character was a darker and more emotional take on the character, making for one of the best and most emotional films of all time. Han Solo is also the movie's best action sequence, with its battle scenes rivaling any other in the series. Even the death scene between Solo and Boba Fett (a great performance by Peter Mayhew) was incredible, as was the final fight scene between the pair. , is also considered by many to be the best Star Wars movie. This installment was made only 11 years after the first film and was a direct sequel to the second film. It continues the adventures of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his family as they attempt to take back the planet of Tatooine from a band of gangsters called the Jawas. Unfortunately, they are joined by a new bad guy, Jabba the Hutt, who has his own motives for taking control of the planet. As the main plotline for the movie is

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ This one's a really long one, but the good news is that it's not that bad.  It's not like "Black Hawk Down," "Battlestar Galactica," or "The Day After Tomorrow" where you can see the same thing over and over, and have to look at the same image over and again to figure out what happened. ________________________________________________ And I don't know, but I just got this. I didn't know that you could buy this. _________________________________________________________________ It's been a long time since I've been able to read a book that I really liked, especially one that I'm going to keep for many years to come.   I was really looking forward to this one.    It was going to be the second one by Stephen King, but it wasn't. I think because it was so different.  One, I was waiting for the new "Dark Tower" series, and I was so excited to see this. Two, it's the first novel by a woman, and it was written back in the late sixties, so there were a lot of things like sexual assault and rape and so on, that I hadn't read a lot back then, but this one wasn't going to have that stuff in it.  It was really one of those things that was really exciting to me because it felt like a novel that was written a long, long time ago, but just felt new to me. ________ It took me years of reading Stephen King's books before I really got into them, but once I did, he was just the best, because they were just so rich and they had the same kind of ideas that you heard a hundred times over in movies and TV and so forth, but they never really got to them.  And so here's one that's a little different, but at the end of the day, it still just felt like the same old story that King had always told.  There's still the same things like telekinesis and a lot more about telepathy and what that means to some people, but there was a very different sort of story at the heart of it, and to me, that was just so exciting.  That's one of the reasons I'm not going to finish this until I'm at least a year in.  To me, it will just keep getting better and better, and maybe by then I won

I just bought a brand new Dell Latitude E6400 with a black keyboard, but I got one of those cheap red-lit keyboard and am just going to be honest and say that this keyboard does not have a bright blue backlight. I know it does not look like it, but that's the effect it has on the color. This is the only color that shows up. The black keyboard does have backlight, but not bright like this one.   a little more...   This was the first one I ever owned and i love it. The red is nice and it is the same color as my white laptop's keyboard. I wish Dell would make a red keyboard, the white keyboard is nice, but its kinda bland and white and red are very different colors. This keyboard will not get much use because my other laptop is an HP Omen. It just looks really cool with it. It's not a laptop, but it is something you can hold in your hands. The key feels amazing. The keys are made from solid ABS plastic and have very little travel. The feel really good and its super responsive.   of course i have the back light.   and yes, its the same for the Dell's. The blue is just a little bit different.   with the backlight on, the red just doesnt look as bright and you can barely see the blue, but you can still tell that the blue is there. And since I dont use the backlit feature as much as I do the red, I think I will replace it with the white one (maybe on my laptop i will just keep it).   The red keyboard is a great feature of this keyboard and would recommend. Also there is no reason to get the back lighting turned on because it makes your typing more frustrating. I find myself trying to hold my hand over my keyboard rather than press on my keyboard. It makes it look more like typing on a computer. Its not bad. It is just kind of bland.

I'm trying my best to try and keep my opinions unbiased, but the truth is I've been pretty negative about it from the get go, mostly because it really just didn't do much for me. I think what I'm saying is that this film is absolutely worth watching, even if you have nothing to gain by it, I still think the story, writing, and acting are all really well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "the audience loved the movie!" "the movie's great!" "a really well-acted movie!" You are not writing a positive summary of a bad movie. You are trying to make it seem as if the movie is good. You must not get into the habit of describing a bad film as being "good" even if it is not. If you do, then you will be writing a review of the worst movie of all time. You'll have a bad taste in your mouth and you will never watch another good movie again.  When you are writing a story, make sure the plot is clear. What is going on? What is the character's goal? What are they trying to achieve? If you don't know, then it's probably not the right story for you.  Writing about the plot of a movie, and explaining why the character makes the decision they make, is how the audience is supposed to enjoy the movie.  You can describe the plot as you wish, but if you don�t know why the characters do what they do, it's not a good story for the audience to follow.    Keep it simple. Write only the basic plot. Don't add additional details that don't add anything to the story. If a character walks out of a bar, it doesn't make the story more interesting if they drive off in a helicopter. Keep it simple, and don't describe the details of the car the character is driving as you drive past them on the road. Writing a synopsis is like writing a book synopsis. I find that the easiest way to describe a movie is to describe the movie to yourself. Look at the movie, take some notes, and write a summary. Then, when you watch the movie you'll know what it is about, and you'll be able to tell the difference between a bad summary and a good one. Don't try to write a synopsis about a movie that you haven't seen. If it's the right movie for you, that's what you will write about.  If you haven�t seen the movie yet, it is still a movie in your mind, so don't write anything about it that you didn't watch when it was being filmed. It won't be the same, and it won't work.  The only way to make the movie seem right is to have seen it. Do your research. Read a movie description online or at a video store, or even

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. __________. _______. _____. I'll try it, but it doesn't work. I'd get really drunk and pretend I was some kind of expert on the film, but I'm not. You just have to try it. This is the same for any good movie in this genre. You can't really go wrong.  But do be sure that you actually watch it.  in a movie is: ________________________. You have to know what you're watching before you watch it, and you have to see how it progresses. Most of all, the first time you watch a movie, you're going to be disappointed. This isn't some sort of secret formula that works every time. Most bad movies are a real disappointment. It's because of the movie. It was a crappy movie. They should have changed something. I'm so sorry. What are you doing at midnight: ________________. I hope you're sitting down. What's that?  What's a good joke: ________________________________________. You probably already know, but just in case you don't: The joke is: If the joke's on you, you'll get a punchline. If it's on your friend, you might not. A joke is a punch line, or it's a part of a story, which is like the plot. There are things you'll find funny about this movie, but you probably won't find them funny.  (This is my own personal joke, but a lot of people enjoy it.)  When people are asking you what movie they should see, what movie should they see, you should answer: _____ ____________. ___________________________. I didn't like that movie. I would rather see a movie that was made when I was young than one that is made now.    You should also read this whole post, if you haven't already: ____. , in a book is: (I know, you've read this before, haven't you?)  _____. What are you reading at midnight? The book is _____, and this is a spoiler. I could have put in some additional stuff, but then the movie would have been spoiled.  and this will be a spoiler because we'll talk about some of the characters. So there's going to a few spoilers in here. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________ This movie has the quality you expect in an older movie: smooth, easy to understand, great acting, interesting plot, beautiful setting, strong characters, very well written script. I give it a 5/5 for this reason: the film has the proper amount of humor to be taken seriously, and also has some elements of "good drama." A nice mix. Also, don't try to make it as political as I did, the movie is not really about politics or world affairs, so you can just ignore this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It was entertaining but there were a lot of scenes where the characters spoke in different voices. The actors were great at reading their lines but the dialogue made me want to scream."  If someone says something funny at work, you can tell that they're a little uncomfortable and it's a lot easier to crack up. The same can be said for movies. The film is funny and fun and I think it is worth watching even if you've seen it. I think that it is going to be more entertaining than the first three films. This is not the kind of film where you'll see a "real" family (I guess that's what happens when you add the husband and wife in).  There's only a few moments where you get a glimpse of their lives. It's hard to imagine them as a happy family in the first film, and if you do, it's in flashback. It was a fun watch for me. I would love to see it again.  I don't really need to tell you that this film is not great. The story is predictable, the acting is terrible, and the jokes are too far down the line. But the movie is fun and entertaining. I didn't really think of the sequels, but I wouldn't be surprised if they turn out to be a pretty good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ Tell us about the movie: I found __________ (the movie) to be enjoyable and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It is a fun movie and I think that there are some fun elements to it. The movie is not bad and it has good elements to do with some action and a fun plot. I loved it. It made me laugh, cry, and smile. It was just enjoyable to watch. I think it will be fun to watch in the future as the plot is fun and it is something different than the usual. I have seen several movies that I like that have different plots. I am just glad that I got to watch this one. The characters were all different and I could relate to the main character very well. The romance between the main characters was also very fun to see. I also enjoyed the voice acting. The voices were all unique and the characters were different from each other. The music was fun too. I thought that it was very good and catchy. The ending was funny and the ending made me smile. The reason I gave this movie 4 stars is because the movie wasn't perfect. It could have been better. Some of the plot points and some things that went on just felt out of place. Also the story line got a little weird. However, I am happy that I saw this movie because I liked the movie and it was good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Avengers: Infinity War" Do not write a negative review about the same movie: "X-Men: Days of Future Past" The most popular way of writing a review is to put your opinion in a sentence (i.e. "The Avengers is great"). The next most popular is to write it in the title of the review.  The title of a movie is usually the most important element in the review: "The Incredible Hulk" is a great movie, but "Hulk" was too long. The Incredible Hulk is a very long movie, so it is probably a better film. Do the readers of your review know you or your friends are fans of the movie:   "I didn't know I was so into Avengers: Age of Ultron" When you mention your favorite Avengers or Marvel characters, do you also mention if you are a fan:   I love Iron Man and the Avengers! Do you have any comments about the movie/show/book you're reviewing: "I loved X-Men 2 so much that I wanted to see the first one, even though I had already seen X-men 1 and 2" or   "If I don't like it, why should you?" Write a review that has nothing but good things to say about a movie: It was great, but the character development and dialogue was very poor in this film Write about your favorite character in the movie, how the movie changed his or her life, etc.:   I think Deadpool is pretty fun.   Deadpool was a pretty great character in this movie. Write your name or nickname for the character you mentioned in your review, what the movie was about, what you thought the movie could have been better:   What a great and entertaining movie, I enjoyed the movie.   The best thing was that I can actually see my own name in print. When writing the review, try to include some facts or trivia that you learned about the characters from the movie and from your memories of seeing it. Always make sure to mention at the very end that you're not saying that you hate the movie or that you really liked the movie but found it to be boring. Be sure to include an "I liked it, but…" Write on your review that you've had to read the entire movie (the first or the third act), then describe the scene you liked the most in the third Act.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________ Review Date: 10/14/2009 at 6:52pm By: Bob from New Jersey I found that this is a great way to show one's love of a movie and the movie's good. I also found that the other movies on DVD (and in the rest of the world as well) do not reflect the quality of the movie. They are usually "movie magic." Not only is that not true of this film, but this film is far superior to most other movies. It's a little rough around the edges (the opening credits were a little cheesy), but this is what you see on the big screen. I like it! I think it's a perfect way to introduce a film to a younger audience and to the older, but still interested audience (and I think that is a big part of the appeal). I also enjoy the little surprises and the jokes and the great sound track. I just think the quality is off-putting (I mean, what's the point of having a great movie if it can't be shown on a big screen?) but I'd bet that if you really like the movie, then you'll like this. Rating: ********  ___________________________________________________ Review Date 10/13/2009 At 12:35am By: Rob from West Virginia This is a must see for everyone interested in the movies. If you are into classic movies that have a good story with good characters then this is the place to see it. If not then this might not be for you but if you are looking for something that is fun and a little racy then I think you'll enjoy it. The story is just about right for kids. If I was a kid I'd love this movie. I love this type of films and I love the "couch gag" that was featured. It really made me laugh. It seems like the only downside is the subtitles as some words are hard to understand (especially in the third act) but other than that this movie is a treat. Rating ********

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. How much a movie makes you feel: _____.  1. "Walt" (2002)  How much a book makes you want to read it again: ____. How long a movie you can sit through: _______ minutes.  in a nutshell: This is the rare gem of the recent past that can only be experienced on its own terms. An emotional experience that takes you to another place than you expected to go, with a powerful message about the importance of kindness and forgiveness, in a time when we're often too quick to call someone else a "stupid person" and start throwing around the "racist" or "bigot" epithets.  The story takes place on an African-American farm in rural Missouri. As the main character, Jesse, deals with racism in his community, he learns to accept what his father and other adults teach him, and he comes to terms with his own experiences. This film also demonstrates a beautiful storyteller in the form of Robert Duvall, whose performance is so rich and nuanced that it rivals any other in his entire body of work, not to mention his many wonderful supporting roles. He has a tremendous sense of style and an uncanny knack for capturing the nuances of emotions that come from the deep down places, when life seems cruel and unfair, and when the world seems to punish you for the small things you don't have the power to do anything about. He manages to make these scenes of injustice seem both funny and deeply moving. BONUS REVIEW: I know this review will seem like blasphemy. I love this movie, but I can't put it higher than a 1. It was an extraordinary experience that I have had many times, and a masterpiece that I can only recommend to anyone who is really invested in understanding racism, and in the possibility of forgiving people who are hurting you. For more about the movie, click here: "WALT" (Part 1), "WALTER" (part 2). 2. "The Help" (2013) This is the kind of movie that makes you stop and think: Is this actually the world we live in? It's a film that tells a story about how a group of mostly black women in the 80s and 90s tried to help black men who had been convicted of crimes after being falsely accused by white women in order to receive assistance in getting their lives back on track. It has one of the greatest

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  If you have written a bad review, be prepared to explain why you wrote a bad one. The more detailed, the better.  (The more detailed the better the review, because you need to make it look like you're actually reading the movie and not just repeating a review of a movie that you saw last week. Keep your tone civil and objective. If your tone is sarcastic, you're a loser.)  The most important part of writing a good review is to show that you didn't just blindly watch the movie.  I'm not sure if this applies to movies that you just saw at the theater, or if it only applies to the ones you actually watched yourself. It makes a huge difference to me when I know I watched a movie and watched it well. - You didn't feel the film was too long or boring.  and - You enjoyed the film a lot!  - The characters were memorable and you found them likable. . , (The more memorable the better)  It's a bad sign if you simply can't find anything to say about the film that isn't negative.  of course you can mention any little details you liked about the movie, but you can't just say that the movie sucked. In short, you can only say negative things if they're relevant to the film. If you just repeat bad reviews about a film you saw at your local theater, then you are a total loser. The reason I don't recommend doing this is that you will end up writing something similar to the following:  I hated this film. The acting was awful, the plot was lame, and I didn't like the direction this film was going. It wasn't even a good film. : )  How do I write a good, relevant review?  There is no "wrong" way to do reviews. As far as I'm concerned, if a movie sucks, it sucks. There is no right way to write a positive, relevant or interesting review. I don a number of different ways of writing reviews, depending on the movie itself and if I have been able to see it with the proper knowledge.  the first thing you want to do is write your review in a way that it is relevant to what the movie is about. You need to understand the movie before you can write a review that is useful to the movie you are trying to review. That means that you
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  Write a negative review about something bad: _________________  A movie is an event where the action is in motion. The audience's expectations for what the movie will be like is what determines how it will be perceived, not the director's intentions, plot, or performance. If the director and the cast are not interested in what the audience wants to see, the movie may end up being poorly received, but no worse than it could have been. If a director is willing to try anything, then the audience will be open to the idea of seeing a movie that will be different from anything else on the box.  I don't believe that a movie should be judged by a single number; but if it does end up with a single rating, I believe that that is the most accurate way to look at the film. To be honest, my rating of a movie is rarely a reflection of how much I like the movie. It is almost always a reflection the amount of enjoyment I had while watching the movie; whether it be the story, the acting, the set-up, or anything else. If I feel that the movie was made well, then I will give it a rating of seven, and it will not even be an issue. -John L. McAdams  P.S. - My personal favorite movie is "E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial" (1982), which I found to be a very enjoyable film. .  andrews. "Good" movies are ones that are fun to watch, and "Bad" movies can be boring and pointless. But in between, you can find some movies that are just straight up good, even if they lack the obvious'star' of the piece. "Mud" (1995), directed by Jim Carrey, is an excellent example of this. The movie follows a young couple, Alex and Michelle (Katherine Waterston and John C. Reilly) as they move into their new house, with the help of their teenage neighbor, Tom (Michael Cera), who is a young boy with an affinity for the dark side of the paranormal. In an effort to get away from Tom for a bit, Alex reluctantly decides to help him look for the lost treasure of the famed pirate "Captain Jack Sparrow."  When the two get into a battle with a man they've mistaken for a treasure hunter (Tom), a spirit of the past suddenly awakens

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________.  I hate it when movie reviews get negative. I don't like negative reviews and if it isn't my movie I don,t want it to get bad reviews.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  Write a bad review about something bad: ________________  Share some movies: _________________________________ : _________________________:  Positives: I really like the theme of this movie and the way they portray the conflict between father and son. I also really like that both father and child are portrayed as strong and positive. It's a nice contrast to the previous movie, where the mother was the stronger one. This is a strong movie, and is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. The effects are realistic and the acting is fantastic. There is nothing better than watching a space battle and then looking at a screen and watching two kids fly through space.  Negatives:  of all the movies I have seen this is probably the only one that doesn't really have a flaw that would be apparent after the movie. The only bad thing I can say is that there was a little bit of a rushed pace, but that could be blamed on the fact that this is the first part of a trilogy.   Possible sequels:   This movie may be a great one to start with but it isn't a great movie in itself. I would recommend watching this movie first before seeing any sequel. If you are into the whole sci-fisy movies then definitely watch this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ I enjoyed this movie so much I bought the DVD (and bought another and a third) and plan to watch it again and again. The main thing I was interested in was the relationship between the two characters. They have such different personalities but also very similar goals, and I think the writers chose to play off that. It's a very nice movie, but it isn't a very good movie. The film is over two hours long and there are three or four plot threads that are too long for two hours. It has an excellent ending, but I felt the film should have ended with something more than "Well that was fun," or some such thing. The actors who portray the two main characters are very good and their characterizations are well done. In fact I think all of the cast is really good except that one guy (the villain) who isn't the best actor (maybe he is good in a smaller role) and also doesn't really have the personality to play a villain. The music in the movie is pretty good, it's a pretty dark and quiet film, but the music doesn't take anything away from the picture. The effects are really well done (the special effects in this movie are absolutely amazing) and the cinematography is great, but they didn't really do anything too out of the ordinary, like maybe something along the lines of "Well it's the 1930's and it's in the city, and it takes place in the middle of nowhere." I liked it. My rating: ______________
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I've seen quite a bit of bad comedy lately. I really like 'Gone Baby Gone' but it's a little bit hard to watch the whole film. I just hate how all the characters are so stupid. That was my major complaint about the film. However, the cast and director is amazing. It's the best comedic film I've seen in the last decade. I can't wait to see more of it. I thought this was really well done, except the film ended. So, if you enjoy bad comedy, go for it. But if you don't, go watch 'Sausage Party'.

Why didn't you just do a horror film, like Saw, and do it better? - Why is there a sex scene in it? Is it necessary? - Is it a comedy? - What are the main characters like? - How are they related to each other? Why can't they have a normal relationship? - Who are the bad guys? - Are they the good guys or the bad guy? - Where is the film's climax? - When are the characters most interesting? - Does the sex scene give the movie any credibility? - You have to have a certain level of talent and imagination to write a horror movie. - The music is bad. - Is there a scene that you didn't like? Do you have any suggestions for a better plot?

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________   "I enjoyed this, but it took me out of the movie. If you're looking for a good action movie, this ain't it, but if you're willing to look at things a bit more critically then you'll enjoy it." -Trent Tucker, "Movie Guide Reviews" "This was a fun film to watch, but there were things in it that made it a chore to actually watch it." – Mike Hagan, "TNT News" "I found the plot of this movie very intriguing, and that's one reason I enjoyed watching it." —Joe Rogan, "The Joe Rogan Experience" "There are times when you just don't know how to feel about something so, I'll admit, it is somewhat of a let-down." – David A. Finley, "Movies & TV" "Some people have a hard time accepting a bad movie when they're not looking for one, and I tend to think that's because it isn't for us." –John Green, "Goodnight Moon" "A good action flick in which you feel the force of the guns as they whip you about and kill everything in their way. It was entertaining to watch." –Richard Dreyfuss, "Gravity" "The action is good, the story is a bit convoluted and convoluted characters are great." –David C. Nourse, "A.V. Club"  The film opens with the titular hero (Marko Zaror) being hailed as a hero. Then, as he approaches a city, he notices a number of dead people. He soon realizes that this was not a random event; this was a massacre. He quickly puts together the clues that lead him to uncover the dark history of the city that has left so many dead and turned the city into a warzone.  So what's wrong with this picture? The first issue that I have with it is that its worldbuilding is almost nonexistent. We learn nothing about who the people are that lived there, how they lived, how their lives intersected with each other, why they became criminals, or why the government became so interested in them. It's as if the author knew nothing about the history of his world that he was creating and so he didn't bother even trying to create it in the first place. It really seems to be all just a big coincidence that all of these people are criminals that have gone through the wrong turn
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ As I sat on the couch staring at the ceiling watching the TV, I could not understand why all the negative reviews that were posted about the film was just as bad as I made it out to be. It seemed that most people had never seen it, and just thought it was bad so they couldn't be bothered to sit through the movie. I was actually really surprised that many people hated it. I even had one person comment that the "giant squid thing" was pretty cool. In a weird way I was glad that people thought it wasn't cool. It seems to be more of a novelty. I guess it is more about the artistry that has gone into making this film than anything else. I liked it. My rating: _______________________ ______________________ I am surprised that nobody else in the internet has been talking about this film. It is really bad, but it also has a lot of heart to it. 1. Monster by Ken Russell - (1999) I was reading this book a few years back, and I thought it would be a great opportunity to see if I could get a good read on some of my favorite films. This movie was right up my alley. The plot is simple, but I had no idea what I was doing when I watched it. All I knew was that I liked how different the story was than the others. I am definitely a big monster movie fan, but this was the first one I have seen with a monster that seemed as if he had no personality. He just seemed to be there. I remember reading that it was a pretty popular movie for young girls, but honestly I just liked it because I was able to relate to it, especially with a girl. In this movie, there is an alien creature, and there are lots of girls. In the beginning of the film, there are two girls in a car that is crashed and they decide to go and get help. At the end, there will be a guy in the car who will help them. It was very interesting to see this story unfold. I didn't really feel like I knew the characters. All they knew is that they were trying to get help, and that they needed help. 2. The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty - (1973) This film I have not seen in over 20 years. I did a re-watch of the movie when I moved out of my parents' house. It wasn't

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Would you like to write a review about ___________? _________ Would you love to review something, but not know what to write? Let me help.  Why I'm glad I didn't buy it  The film is a pretty faithful adaptation of the original novel by Robert Aickman. While not every scene is faithful, there's not much wrong with the movie. There are a few scenes that are a little off in their translation but they don't take away from the movie all that much. This is another film adaptation that feels like it was made to fit in a certain universe, so most scenes are familiar, or at least we are familiar with them. If you haven't seen a film like this before, the plot is pretty simple but it doesn't take long to understand what's going on. The pacing is also great. Most of the movie takes place in the early stages of the war and it doesn  After a while, I found myself getting bored because most of the action sequences were just one-sided battles between the British army and the Germans. It's not uncommon for movies to do this but when you have so few people in the fight you just get tired. While the story was pretty interesting I don't feel like I saw the action scenes I was waiting for. The movie is pretty short, with only 13 minutes of actual screen time, so it does have some flaws. There were some plot twists that I wasn't expecting that didn't happen and the movie was definitely too short to keep my interest.  and just ended up being really boring. There isn't really any payoff to the movie that makes it worthwhile to see, other than the main character. If the movie wasn't so brief, it would have been more enjoyable. The action sequences do take up a lot of time and there isn't much of a payoff so I can see this movie not being as good as other historical dramas. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, unless you're a fan of historical dramas, or if you're into WWII films and you want to see a movie based on the war. "We all hate the Germans because they stole the gold. We all hate them because they killed us and stole all our gold."  Helpful a lot but it had a few problems. The actors and actresses are all great and the direction is great. However, the movie is really bad. : 3/10This is a very

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ "My Heroine" was my first exposure to the world of anime, and that was the first time I was even introduced to the idea of a hero. I never understood the reason why a young girl would risk her life and put her trust in a guy who she knows to be a fraud; she just didn't care, and it was never about him. I thought it was just a typical shounen hero. After watching it, though, I realized that I was wrong. There was something deeper going on here. I saw how much pain and trauma this girl went through, and yet she persevered, and made a difference in the world. She was strong, and she had a purpose. Even if she's not an action hero, she was just as strong as them. This movie made me realize that, just like every person who's had to face a challenge in their life, someone out there is suffering the same thing. This is what anime is about: putting yourself on the line for others, not for yourself. This world doesn't need heroes, but people who put their own lives on the side and do things for the ones who can't. There's someone out here that needs you right now, and if you don't do anything about it, they won't survive. So if you want to be remembered for helping, be a hero for them! I can't express how grateful I am for what "MyHeroine" did for me, and for the countless people who could have never had a chance to watch such a movie, and learn a little something about what it really means to be an anime character, a hero or a heroine. It's something to live and learn from, if you know what I mean!

Tell me if you liked this movie and what you think about it, and I might tell you why I think so. Please, read the movie reviews first. I am not a big film buff.   What movies I like to see: _______________________________________________________   _________________________________________   And here's a movie you'll want to watch with me...   I just watched a really cool new film, but I haven't had time to write a review. Please read the rest of the film's review and tell me why you thought it was great.   a) I don't really like watching films with friends, and this movie was shot in such a way that people could just come in and sit down and enjoy.   in addition to that, you're going to have to take into consideration that this is a real documentary, not an advertisement or movie trailer.  , and it's not just one, but two very interesting interviews. The first is with author James Frey who wrote, and filmed the movie about his son. The second interview is with the director, and writer, of the movie The Big Short (which was filmed here).The Big Short was a huge success, and grossed about $300 million at the box office. I was intrigued by the movie, and wanted to see more about it. I decided to go with the movie. A big problem I had when I got home was that I wanted to watch the movie on my couch, so I had no idea where to go. I saw the movie was in the beautiful Westwood, so of course I had to go see it there. I don  ____________________________________________________  I think it can be argued that there's nothing more annoying to someone than a self-promoting film that tells you why you should love it, before it even gets started. But this film doesn't really do that, not for one minute. I've never really liked self-hypnotic movies because I don 't think they're supposed to be. But if you're interested in seeing how this movie came to be, read on...The movie begins with a long shot of a field in Iowa. We hear the narration, "In 1968, a new way to make a living was about to hit America." We then cut to a woman named Nancy (who appears to be the director of
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  Why am I being honest? I saw a movie that I loved that I would definitely have made a good time with, and that I wouldn't wish on anybody else. I was alone in the theater, and I was happy. And I didn't regret anything. This is the true story of that. The film has nothing to do with me and I know it and all. I feel like this is my opportunity to share that experience. It's also my opportunity not to be the villain in my own story. There were a lot of good people in that theater, you know? There were women and men, some who were younger and some who have been there since the beginning, and some I knew because of that theater and the people I watched there with. And you know, we did all the right things and we all went our separate ways.  I can still hear a few members of the cast (that I didn''t recognize at the time because I was out of the theatre) and crew in the back of my head saying, "That's my husband. You are really in love with that guy. I am not saying anything." And I would have loved to say something back. We all knew that there was no room for that. But we all knew we had to stay with it. This isn't an easy film. It isn't a comfortable film. And it isn't for everyone. But it was fun. It had some of the most beautiful scenery I've seen in a long time. I think the people who made it deserve a lot more credit than I think they're getting for the work that they've put in. And some of those people I knew, when we had our break, we'd have dinner together. We'd talk about what happened, and we'd laugh, and then we'd go out and have a drink. I know some of them are out there, and you can't say anything when they've gone through something like that. It was a good experience, and it was something I am going to cherish.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Review the movie, and the story of the movie. The most important thing is the story. The best story is the one you tell yourself about why you are watching a movie. This is the best way to understand why a person is watching a film. If you watch the movie and you don't like the movie or the story it's because the story is bad. If the movie is good and you like it, the story will make sense to you as the movie gets more and more into the movie you are going to see. If a movie sucks, there is probably no reason why you would watch it and you would be wasting your time watching something that is not going to make you happy. The next step is you need to talk to someone who will tell you why the movie was good or not. People can help you and it's easy to talk with a few people. If something seems bad or feels bad you need someone to give you a real reason to think the way you do. Talk to people about why the way they feel about a film is different than others. Listen to other people about the way their friend or family feels. When you talk to people and learn about the reasons for why they feel the way that they do, you will have an easier time understanding why they like the way the movie made them feel. It doesn't need to be that deep. It only needs to be something that you can understand. The third step is to talk about why a film made you feel that way. Talk about what made you happy and sad about the movie that you are about to see and how that made you want to go see it. This could be anything from the ending of the story to the plot twist of the plot. This step is the most important to understand what you are feeling and why you're watching a certain movie. As a general rule, if you love the movie but want to be in a different movie, then you are doing it wrong. This rule can make the difference between people who will get into the second or third viewing of a movie and people who don't. It is up to you to decide which movies you will watch. You can do anything with this step and if you are in a bad mood when you watch a movie, you could make it worse by talking to someone about how you feel when you are angry or sad. If your mind is making it worse, this is an easy way to make it better. This way you can avoid

You've been a movie fan since your childhood, so you know how to review movies!  In all honesty, I always go with the "t" word in this category. It's the most offensive word to the common movie-goer, and it's definitely one of the most overused. It doesn't mean a thing by itself, it's just a word to describe your review's tone and attitude. It is important to learn how to use your t word appropriately. , and I still have a lot of respect for the word, and for all the movie-reviewers that still use it. But a good rule of thumb is to never use "I love this movie" in a movie review, it just means that you are not a fan of the movie and will only give it a bad review because you are too lazy or too lazy to actually like the movie. So go on with your review, and if I am reviewing a movie for you, I'll go with "This is a terrible movie. I couldn't stand it." Don't be afraid to go with an honest review. I wouldn't have written these words if I didn't think it was important that you get this out of your system. I've been in a bad mood lately, but I've still got the movie review down pat.    - - - - Favorite TV Show: I loved this episode of Breaking Bad. I love how it was a perfect balance of "show" and "play" - both good, bad and in between. The only problem was that I watched it too early.   - I love watching Game of Thrones. I enjoy the show in the sense that I'm interested in it, but also I enjoy seeing how the other characters interact with each other.

I can tell you I watched this movie because I loved it. I was looking forward to it and I enjoyed the experience and I'm glad it wasn't a terrible movie. I've already had several other good movies that I've enjoyed and enjoyed them and enjoyed it and enjoyed watching the movie again. The main reason I want a positive rating is to tell my friends that I enjoyed it because I enjoyed watching it again. I have seen it a couple of times and I know what I'm getting into, so I know that I'm not going to have a bad time, and I don't care if it is terrible or not. So if you liked it you can give it a good rating. I am very thankful that I can go to a movie theater and not worry about it being awful, and if you didn't enjoy it I'm really sorry for you. It really is hard to explain why.  Don't be afraid of spoilers: __________________. I don of course have to mention, I'm a spoilerphobe, so you know what that means. I'm afraid that it might spoil something if I write anything about a movie that I have not seen.

They also did a great job of setting up the future of the story and the characters. It wasn't a typical action movie. It was about what happens to the relationships when someone has something terrible happen to them. They made it about a father coming to terms with his son's death. And I enjoyed that the movie dealt with loss.  the movie was very well done  My mom told me that this was her favorite movie ever.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" is a spectacular film and a great experience, and it's a film I'd strongly recommend to anyone who wants to see the original Star Wars. The characters, the plot, the soundtrack - all are very well done, and the actors are all great. I found the film to be very entertaining from the opening scene to the closing scene. The action sequences and battles are very intense and well done. I especially enjoyed the sequence in the desert. I really enjoyed the idea of having a battle on the desert which was very similar to the one in Return of the Jedi. The desert has such a cool look and feeling about it - the whole desert scene really stands out to me. I don't want to go on about the story, but it's an excellent story with interesting characters. I didn't care for the plot but I thought that it wasn't too bad because I love Han Solo and Rey and their romance is very exciting and has its twists and turns. I liked the idea that the Empire is still around.  That idea makes me very curious about how the story is going to unfold, and that's always a good thing.  I enjoyed the action sequences which are extremely good and the special effects are pretty awesome. I like the idea the film was trying to convey with all of the new characters (especially Finn and Poe) and with its new villains (such as the First Order). I did feel that the villains were a bit too simplistic and that the movie needed to go further with them. The movie ends with a nice twist which was unexpected and well written. There are a lot of changes going on in the Star Wars universe so I liked the fact that the characters had to adapt and be more complicated because of those changes. That's why I liked that Rey was not a slave and not just a princess, she was a Jedi as well. It makes sense that she's now learning to become a Jedi, and Finn was in a bit of trouble because of that. The character of Kylo Ren was interesting because we didn't know a lot about him until he attacked. He seemed so evil but we also learned a lot in the film about him, and how he came to be this way. He doesn't seem like a bad guy but I didn There were a couple of flaws in the movie, mostly with the story.   The biggest one that I found was the plot and characters.  The plot

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I enjoyed this movie, I found myself laughing a few times. The story was well paced, and was entertaining, and it is a bit over the top but not at all boring, that was a plus. It had its moments, but the action was the main focus." If you haven't seen it, please go and see it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS_n8fG-zYs This is the movie that started it all for me. I never was a big fan of the first movie but it was one of my first horror movies and I saw it a couple years later. When I was just getting into horror films I thought I was cool, and liked gore. But I would not watch a horror film without at least reading the script.  I first read the script for this film back in the late 90's when I was a little boy. At that time I didn't know anything about horror films, and the plot was just a little too gruesome for me to watch. So I was forced to watch it on tv at my grandparents. However I have had an amazing amount of love for this movie since that day. I've seen it since then, and I've always been hooked, and even have been a part of some fan group, the Horror Writers Group. So why I would recommend the book over the movie is that I actually really enjoyed the film, and as I said above, my opinion of it changed with time. Now the book is a much darker story, and more about a guy's struggle with his own fear. The original story is much more about the struggle with love, and his relationship with his wife, whereas this film focuses on the horror aspect of it. In the film I had more of a problem with the writing, because it was hard to follow what was happening. I'm still not sure if it was the book or the film that made me have more problems with the plot. However the writing in the book I loved, and had a lot of fun reading about how the characters dealt with their fears and inner demons. The writing in this film was terrible, as in you can just see that they had not read the book and were trying to adapt it. The voice acting in the film was pretty good, but I didn the book, I don't think they were doing their job. The acting in this movie was terrible because the actors did not have to make up
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________Theater: 3.5 stars (trouble spots: lights are out in the seats, orchestra doesn't come to the entrance, stage is too dark) Music: 3 stars (crowd is too loud) Overall: 3 star (the lights were out during the musical numbers) *Theater* - The seating arrangement is better and the seats are a bit less uncomfortable, the orchestra has a bigger stage, and they have a better band than the Broadway musical. *Musical* - I don't even like the musical itself. I think the lyrics are kind of bad and the ending is stupid. However, I love the opening number. It's catchy. The orchestra, even though I think it's bad, is very well played. The lyrics are pretty much spot on. I do think it was a little more intense than I was expecting, but it's not bad. *Stage* - the stage is very, very small. I know it was set up in a garage, but I had to sit way far away from it. And the stage, while it's small, it's very bright. The lighting is too bright during the dance numbers. Even though they were dancing on a small stage, the lighting was way too bright, and it was very distracting during those numbers. *Bookstore* - This place is the kind of book store that doesn't have a proper bookcase, but instead it's full of books on sale. This is annoying because the books are not really that interesting, and the selection is not that good either. They sell a lot of books by the same authors. I mean, come on, you have to buy books! I don's t want to buy an anthology of romance and thrillers. *Restaurant - there was a lot to eat, but they have pretty limited options. I had the mushroom soup. It wasn't very good. I also had the beef stroganoff. The meat was cooked well, but there wasn't that much of it, and I also ordered the onion rings. I really wish they made some more of them, because they were pretty good. Overall, the food was pretty good, but the price was too much for what I was actually expecting. The food was really bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was great. It made me feel good about my own body and my own life. And to me, that's what life is all about. So, if you can, watch the movie and think "Man, I'm glad this movie exists" and you will feel good. (And it's a good film too.) I can see the future, and this is just another of those films that I can see. A couple of years ago I saw a movie called Inception. I wasn't blown away by it, but it certainly was a fun movie. The film tells the story of a couple of people who are attempting to break into a private business of their own - the dream job of everyone with a college education. The movie is quite good, and very popular. The plot follows the main characters from a different angle. We watch as two people attempt to make their dreams a reality, and we see all sides of them. (This was not to be the only film in the "Inception" series.) And, it's not just about dreams, as it is about the way we think about the world. You can see what is real and what isn't, and what it all means. A movie that is worth your time, even if it does not blow you away like Inception.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's like the movie of the month for the next week."  If the movie is so good, then how come it doesn't get attention?  How come other people aren't talking about it? ~~~ This is not true.  Many good movies get attention. ~~ For example, the movie "American Pie" (1999) which was an "adult" movie.   What happens if we see a movie which is a "kid movie" with a very low-budget production value?   What happens when a movie is a big hit and then it gets made into a big-budget movie which has to deal with serious issues such as drugs and violence?  What happens if the movie makes money?  Is this a good way to make money? The answer is a very important one.   There is nothing wrong with a movie making money if it has a good marketing campaign and a good production value.  When I was growing up in America, my parents never took me to a movie. The only movie that they took me see was the "Rocky" films, or "The Princess Bride". But when I saw movies from other countries, I was often shocked at how poor the production values were. I was told that my country's movies were not as good as those in America.  We should all watch more American movies and make more of them in our own country!  We could also make movies like "Raging Bull" and "The Godfather" with far superior production values.  The only reason we don't do this is because it is too costly. If someone wants to make a movie, he must have a big budget.  And the best way to get a big production budget is to make it into a movie for a large audience.  If a movie has good production values and an exciting story, then it will be seen by a large number of people.  But most American movies do not even have that.  Some people may not even see them at all!  Does the lack of movies with good production qualities have anything to do with America's economic problems?  The answer to this is, unfortunately, yes! In America's economy today, we have an economy of cheap goods.  Cheap goods mean many people buy a lot of them, and the price of goods goes up.  Because a lot people buy so many cheap goods, a movie like "Funny People"

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________  "B-movie-worthy" is how the New York Times describes "The World is Not Enough," the final installment in John Carpenter's "The Thing" trilogy. And it was a fair summation, with a story and acting so overblown as to be nearly laughable, a tone so overbearing that it threatens to drown the film in a flood of technical blunders. But what the Times doesn't mention is that it's also a good film, a surprisingly strong and accomplished one.  As a director, Carpenter has a knack for building tension and creating tension within that tension, so that the climax -- and, in "The Things," the film as a whole -- comes together as a complete, coherent whole. The characters are fleshed out -- and it's worth pointing out that, thanks to a great supporting cast, each has a unique arc and an important character arc to balance out the others. And the film has a solid hook, a great payoff for the tension.  with a twist that's both unexpected and totally effective. , a lot of the story can be explained by the fact that the main character, the doctor, is in the wrong place at the wrong time. We know what kind of person he is (a nice guy) and what he does (save lives), but we're told little about the way he comes to that knowledge, how it gets stored in his mind. The way it's stored is through his own experiences and observations, and the way that they combine into a larger whole gives the film's story such great depth and verisimilitude that even though the rest of the plot unfolds in a matter of minutes and the climax is anticlimactic and predictable, the ending is still quite satisfying. : Another aspect of the film that makes it stand out is the way it moves. The Thing opens with a scene where the doctor and his assistant are making their way to the hospital. The scene isn't the point, but it does serve to demonstrate what kind a team the two are, what kind and what kind is the quality of life they lead in a facility that doesn't let people die on the operating table -- not without the surgeon in question, and certainly not without that assistant. And what a team they are, moving a patient in a stretcher all the way to their room in the hospital, all the while avoiding all of the hazards of the place -- including, by extension, the hazards their doctor

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I always loved The Empire Strikes Back as a kid. But as time went on, I grew more and more resentful that the entire film was about a boring battle. As it turns out, this isn't entirely true... The Empire has finally come to steal the moon! This epic adventure is directed by George Lucas and written by the legendary Lawrence Kasdan. An incredible cast of actors plays the roles of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. They must make it to the center of the rebel base before the evil Darth Vader arrives. The cast and crew must fight against the many obstacles that stand in their way, including an Imperial Death Star.The best thing about the film is the plot. For those of us that have grown up on the Star Wars Universe, this one has the potential to be a classic. It's an interesting twist that I'm still finding myself thinking about as I write this review. It has the quality of a good middle-grade book. It really focuses on the characters and the relationships. It also has a very interesting story. And it's full of surprises. It features characters with all new traits that could have been written into the films, but wasn't. There are also new characters, but I still haven't really gotten to know any of them. The only character I'm really interested in is Luke Skywalker. I hope that we see more of him and we don't find out how old he is in the middle of the film. The characters are all interesting, and they have all been written well. The visual effects and music are excellent.The voice cast is solid and the acting is great. The special effects are also good, as it seems that the only problem that George Lucas had with the first film was the lack of special effects. He does a good job of mixing and matching special effects from the old and new movies, but the new movies are still very good. This film is still very entertaining, and it is hard not to look forward to seeing what happens next. There is a sequel to this called Return of the Jedi. That film, while also a great film, doesn't quite match up to what Empire Strikes Belshespears to be. However, I'm glad that George has returned to the characters. It is a little odd to have a big sequel with Luke, Han, and Leia in it, but it works great for the characters of the original film. I'm excited to see what happens with these characters. This is still
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________   In other words, if you want a movie with lots of action, or a movie that has a strong emotional element, you want to buy the kind of movie where the director, writer, and actors are all talented. And you want the kind that's cheap, because that's the only way to sell it to a theater. I know it sounds like an argument that's about as logical as saying "I'm going to write a story about my dog that starts out with the phrase 'I want my dog to be happy.'" But you know what? I do. I'm always going to tell stories about my dogs, so why can't I write one about my cats? Because, really, the only difference is in the ending.  That said, some movies are much, much better than others. I don't think that all great movies are produced in a vacuum.

There are some movies that I'll happily ignore the reviews, the film-by-film reviews and the general consensus of how I thought the film should be. I'm not here to judge those movies; they don't exist in my life. There's a movie on Netflix and if it's good, I'll watch it. If it's bad, I don't care. The movie that gets me to stop, look at the screen and think – "Well, that was interesting…" is the movie that interests me. That's the movie I find interesting.  It's the film that interests Mike Leigh. . ,  .

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  It's not what you don't know that keeps you ignorant, it's what you know for sure that just ain't so.  My father died in 1992 when I was 8 years old. My stepmother has since remarried and had 2 children with him, one of them I love very much, he was the best dad a girl could ask for. . The film is well directed by a good cinematographer, the actors were well chosen, but the script, the screenplay is as poor as it gets. Movies for children and kids for that matter are almost entirely dependent on the ability of the writers to make their stories interesting enough that a child can actually want to watch the movie. This movie had neither. It made me sick. My 3 year old was sitting right behind me watching it. That's how much of a chore it is to watch a movie that makes you want to vomit. And this is one of the few times in my life I will be able to actually watch it and not feel like a complete prat for wanting to watch it. It is not one of those movies that is so bad it is good, but one of these movies that makes a child cry. This is a movie of very poor writing. Not bad in any way, just poor writing, very bad. As for the movie, it really isn't very good. It does have some good lines, especially from the kid, and a good song to go with it. Unfortunately, the movie is a disappointment that I could not stomach.

And yet, most movies about teenagers have failed miserably. How did this happen?   We have been brainwashed, and the people in power do not want to tell us that we must go on living.   The best way to fight the brainwashing is to make a movie about the characters who you like. If you like this movie, tell everyone about it. If we keep telling them about the good movies, the good guys will continue to win. So you need to make sure that you like the bad movies too.   a) The good guys win.   in this movie we are shown that when you want to stop bad movies, you should first stop watching those bad movies.   -The movie is about the kids in a small town, who are trying to do the right thing. They want to be good, and they are trying.  The movie ends, and we see that the people who had been trying to stop the movie, have been successful in their efforts, and all of the bad guys were killed, or have left town.   for those who remember the ending from the movie:   "What? The movie is over? I never got to see the credits or anything? Well, at least I didn't die, that's what I was going to die for, anyway.  , because after all of that, everyone is still alive.   __________________________________________________________________________   b) The people who stop the bad movie are not necessarily heroes. But the people are portrayed as the heroes because they are actually trying. They are not "uniformed" police, they are not soldiers, they just are normal kids.   and that is all that matters, because that is what the hero's role in society is.    and what a hero's job is.  the "unmasker", the "murderer" and all the people we see being killed (or at least having done something evil, such as beating up a girl) are all the "good guys". they are the heroes.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________  A good movie is a movie I'm proud to have seen, even if it isn't what I would have chosen for the day. ____________________________  As a professional writer, I must admit that I have no idea why some people find horror movies so intriguing. ____________________________________  the great  If you're a fan of suspense, horror, or suspenseful films, you really owe it to yourself to check out the new movie, "In the Mouth of Madness." The film tells the story of a man obsessed with a mad doctor who is obsessed with the same patient. And what is more intriguing than a mad man obsessed on the same person? Well, this one is. Director Christopher Lee plays a man who, through an accident, is able to see a person who is dead and alive, and has no idea who he is. In order to solve the case, he must come up with the right way to approach the patient.  The actors did a marvelous job with the material. Robert Downey Jr. played the character as well as I've ever seen, and his portrayal of the mad doctor was chilling. He was even able to have some fun while playing the mad man. The only real problem was that there wasn't anything funny to be had in the movie. It was all serious, and it was all over the place.  to say the least  "In the mouth of Madness" isn't all bad. It has its good points. The characters are interesting and the film has a suspenseful feel to it, so that it made me want to see more. In addition, the acting was really good in the film. I liked that many of the actors portrayed the characters well. _____________________  Although I've never read "In The Mouth of madness", it definitely stands on its own in my movie library. I love the film and highly recommend that you watch it.  the new  This isn't a review, and I don't intend to read this book. The film has already been released, and there's nothing new to be read. This is the first installment in a series, which will focus on the new version. .

It had some good humor and a good story but it was nothing spectacular. The ending was disappointing but I didn�t expect that either. I gave it four stars because I really did like it. I enjoyed the humor. It was not for everyone but I liked it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I have watched the films in this series, but do not have the knowledge to rank them. This film was well made. Some of the jokes were funny but the plot was predictable. The music is good, but the acting wasn't good. Some characters are very cliché, and I do not see why they had to be in this movie. This should have been a movie that was in the Twilight Zone, and just called it a Twilight Zone. I give this movie a 3/10. It is a good flick, but I can't recommend it to others. Next up is "The Outer Limits." Written by Michael Crichton, it is a prequel to "The Andromeda Strain." It was first broadcast on television in 1977 and is considered the highest rated original series in history. It followed the alien planet of Progenitus, from its formation at the beginning of the universe, to its destruction after a few decades, and featured some of the best episodes of television. It also has a lot of sequels and prequels to be found throughout the series. This movie is about a man named Chris and his friend and lover Alex who is trying to make it on the planet of Armonia. They both have to learn to adapt to the harsh conditions of Armnia, because they both want to be the best they can be. I liked this movie and it is the best of the prequel series. It starts off with a scene in which the two meet each other. It was a good scene and you would see Chris grow and become the man that the audience is seeing in the movie. The two characters develop a great chemistry and I like the way they do it. The movie was full of humor and a lot different. It had some great guest stars like Walter Koenig and John Schuck, and it shows the characters growing together. It has a great cast. It made me laugh a lot and it had a lot to say about the time period. It ended with a great cliffhanger, which I will leave you with. This show is rated at TV-MA, so I am assuming that the film was rated at PG-13. The special effects and cinematography in the film were very good. I am surprised that a movie like this is rated this low. It seems to me that people think that if it has a good special effects then it is worth watching. I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend this film.

Some people like to watch the film like a documentary of Hollywood's greatest battles, some like to analyze what is wrong with this film, and some like the film's plot and characters. So here are some of my thoughts about the film.   the film is one of those rare film that have an excellent screenplay, but also has a great and complex story that makes it very easy for the viewer to follow. It is a wonderful film and the plot has plenty of twists and turns. The script was very creative in the way that it made the different characters, situations, and plotlines more interesting and memorable. There are many aspects that make this film so special:   -The script is the most original film I've ever seen. .  , as I think it is the first time in the history of film that the characters, places, and situations are all based on real people and places, not just ideas. This is so unusual and it allows us to feel like we're in the world of that movie. It also is a great way of showing how Hollywood is completely unrealistic. The film depicts how these characters live their lives, how their lives can change in a moment, and how they can also change in order to escape certain deaths.   and it has a lot to say about life, what matters, what is important, and what is just for

The actors and crew have all brought a genuine excitement and enthusiasm to their roles that is very rare in the world of independent films.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________  I did not know that there was a movie called 'Chinatown' until I got home from the theatre. I was really excited and went to Netflix to see it. It turned out to be a great film with great performances, I think everyone should see it! I was also very happy that the story line was told through the character of 'Lam'. I had not known that there were so many scenes which are not in the script! I am not that good a film critic, but I know the real story behind the movie. I think the only problem was the ending of the movie, it was not quite right. But overall it was a great movie and I would love to see the director make a sequel. 'Chinicown' was great! I liked this movie. It was great story, great performance and great film. It also has a great score by Jerry Goldsmith and an awesome score by Tony Bennett. The ending was so great and I feel it was missing some of the more important details in the film. Overall, it is a great and interesting movie, and everyone should go and see it because it is very good! I would suggest you to go to the theatre and see this movie, I really loved it!  ______________________________ , written by David S. Smith, is a crime thriller set in 1940s Chinatown, California. The film is directed by David Mamet, and stars Anthony Wong, Tony Leung, and James Wong.

I think it was a nice addition to the series and it was good. I do think the second and third ones were better though. This movie is just okay. It is really not as good as the first two, and the last two were definitely better. I did like it, but that could have been due to the fact

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Write a negative review about an awful movie:  The following review, posted by @n0gg0, was one of many on the Internet that criticized the new movie The Revenant. The negative comments were not all negative. It is true that the film is a poor film. However, that is not all that is wrong with the movie. It also does not get the respect it deserves because there is so much more to it than the average film.  It is time for people to stop focusing only on the bad and ignore the bad reviews that are posted about the film. While The Revenger is not a perfect film, it is an entertaining film that does a nice job with its message. . I was fortunate enough to be invited to the film's world premiere on Friday night at the Chicago Film Festival. I was there for the opening night screening and I thought I would be able to talk about my experience with the film and how it changed my opinion of it.  is a good film. It has a lot of ideas and a great cast that plays off of each other. It tells a good story with a few minor flaws that do not detract from the overall experience. It would have been great to see a longer story but what is seen is more than enough. The cast does not hold up well though. This film has a few actors that are really good but not all of them. Some of the supporting roles were not played well. Some had great parts but were given little screen time. It was a bit disappointing to see more people forget the name Ethan Hawke, who played the great Jamie Foxx. The Reel looks better than the movie and the trailer is better. The first half is better than I expected from the movie but the movie does end pretty poorly. I loved the trailer for the movie that was made by the movie's producer. It looked very good and I wish more people saw it. My husband who is an avid film fan did not really care for the film, but I do. I felt as if he missed something special in the movie, or that his thoughts on the movie were more about it's potential than what it did.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________ It has already been written that there were flaws in this film. And that would not be entirely out of place; for many years now I have been warning that this is a formulaic sci-fi/horror film with a twist ending. As is usually the case with a formula film, this was a formula-lite film with an amazing twist. I was very impressed with this film when I first saw it. I had seen many of the same tropes and ideas repeated, repeated, over and over again. It seemed like every year there was a new twist in this formula. The film itself was quite a change of pace for me, but it was still very fun and entertaining to watch. But with a good twist ending like this, it really does raise the bar for future films. I am still quite pleased with the film, but I'm also pleased with what was accomplished here, and I think it's very likely that this film will have a very long life and will be talked about for a long time to come. One of the most interesting aspects of this film was the lack of action. The story was interesting enough, but nothing really crazy. What was really fascinating was the story of these two aliens from different worlds, and the interaction that they had with their own people, and how it influenced how they lived. The only person that was quite dangerous was the human leader who is also the leader of the alien race. But even that was more than enough of a challenge. I could see that this could have been a very dangerous film. With a twist like this I'm sure it could have become quite intense. But I'm glad that they did not take that route. The ending was a real twist, and not just a cheap one that was simply a way to get us to the end. It was a very exciting ending, and really brought this film to a whole new level. Overall, I think that this was the best film that I saw this summer. It had a great twist ending, great characters, and a good story. This is a great sci-ffi film, and it's a great example of why you should never judge a film on its box office. If you are a fan of science fiction, or horror, I highly recommend this film for all of those reasons. I will definitely recommend this to other sci- fi fans.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________. If you write a negative review, I will use it. If people are reading negative reviews, it will cause a good review to be removed.  I will give up if you ask me to write a positive book review or an article, and then write something negative about you after I've given up.  the best way to get me to go away is to not give me any information. (See the "Ask me for the information I need" part of this FAQ.) If you want me to give you my opinion, I'll tell you my opinions. If not, you'll have to figure it out for yourself. : It's always a good idea to read the FAQ to make sure you don't miss anything important. , if you want a response, then you MUST put in the exact question that you want the answer to. For example, if someone asks "How can someone like me be a bad writer?" then you must state exactly what that person is saying. If you're too lazy to go through the FAQ, then go on the forums and see what people have said about you and why. If there's one thing I've learned from being hated on in real life, it's to know how to handle criticism. (And also for your own sake, that you don,t write a nasty review of me. This will help keep you from getting the same treatment.)

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________  How do you feel about "Guardians of the Galaxy?" Do you like it? Have you seen it yet? Why/why not?   I think it is pretty good, I love the music and the movie is great.  I am going to watch it when it comes out, I think its going to be fun.  the thing that really bothers me is the amount of times it seems like we are being spoon fed. I mean the whole time we were on planet earth the story was being told, we heard it at the news, we saw it on TV, and all the characters in the movie were talking about the plot and story. it just felt very tacked on and very random. But the characters, the plot, everything about it seemed to be a surprise to us.   We had a great time watching the film and it's going to keep us busy for quite some time.  a lot of the movie was just very entertaining. I think the biggest problem I had is that it kept getting in the way of the story. like in the beginning the characters were just kind of in the background and then suddenly it all gets focused on them, and then they get their own episode. they get killed off, they have their own storyline, it seems very rushed, but I know it was all done for a good reason. And it is very entertaining, but at the same time I just can't put it down. I would recommend this film, I like it and I hope they make it into a film series. I really do.  (2 comments |Comment on this)  Sunday, November 24th, 2003  4:11 pm  [jimbo]   A very nice article on the state of cinema. A couple of interesting points were made, such as the importance of genre in the cinema and that some movies are only ever remembered because they are bad. What is even more interesting is the fact that most of these movies are actually pretty good.   of course this is no news for some people since they have been hearing it for years, but some of it makes sense. for example, the "bomberman movie" was a total disaster and is the only movie to ever make me lose faith in cinema.  in that movie the director was a huge star, and his movie was actually so bad and crappy, you really had to hate to love it.  and of course there

However, there are many films, even the really great ones, that don't work as well as they should. What makes a great film, at least in my mind, is a director that has a clear vision and a passion to tell their story. Without that, even a great movie like Citizen Kane (1941) is just a mediocre and boring movie.   a great director is one who can write a meaningful and moving movie. Or if it doesn't work out, they will just change the character to make it work better.  . It's the same reason why some of my favorites, like Lawrence of Arabia, or The Sound of Music, or even Forrest Gump, don't have great reviews.  , even. But I don't believe that a movie is great if it's a huge disappointment to the audience, since this is just an expression of the director's passion. And sometimes there isn't much to do with it. It might just be a good thing that the movie doesn't make a lot of money. But it's the director that is to blame. And it's also worth noting that I didn't see that the second one was in the first place, but that's because the second and the third were actually made two years apart. I'll try to find those two in my VHS collection. (It's a good film). The third movie is called, even... But I didn I can see a bit of a problem. The last one was a bit confusing as it didn't really make any sense, so I really expected something more from this one. It was an interesting look at the human condition and the kind of people that we are. It could have been an interesting meditation on how we view ourselves, and the movies seem to deal with this very well in this one, even if it is a bit hard to follow. I thought it was a good story. And the ending seemed to be quite nice. But the whole thing felt a bit forced.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Great movie, a bit too long, not for everyone but I have a few of my friends that loved it". If the author actually liked a movie he would write a positive review and give a fair review.  You should also have no problem with people who give you negative reviews if you didn't enjoy the movie. If you can't give a decent review to a film you don't like. Then you might want to think about becoming a professional critic or a film reviewer. It can be a very rewarding job. Have fun with it. If you have no desire to write a review please don't even bother. It is unlikely that I will write anything here and even if I do this post will only have 100 readers so there is little to no point in wasting any time. The only people I will talk to are the audience of this blog. If I am going to talk to other people I don't care to go through the same exercise all over again. I have said it many times before and it is the truth. If something is fun to do then you have to do it.  Enjoy it. Do what you want. Make your mistakes. Make mistakes with your friends and make them yours. I don' care what anyone else thinks.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I had read somewhere that the film could be a'mockumentary' so this is a film that should not be missed if you are a fan of the classic "mock documentary" genre. I am a huge fan of those types of films and it shows in this film as the "documentary" aspect is only used to explore the story from different angles. This is a highly-crafted, yet highly-realistic, film about real-life events. This film will also be a great look into the world of a small film crew in the 1990s, a world where the audience could connect to people who are living with the disease and the people in the film industry that were involved.  …

The story has changed slightly to reflect the new plot. I'm using clips from the film in order to give a sense of the overall atmosphere and the feelings expressed.  I'm also including a short movie of the song. The short video was done entirely in Flash and was made by the awesome Kevin Smith. Check it out here.    In terms of the lyrics, I made a big effort to capture the emotion and feel of the original song. I tried to use my own interpretation as well as borrow from other songs.

Do you want to see it again? ___________________________ If you liked the movie, do you think you would like to see the movie again? Is there a reason you did not like the film? Why or Why not?? Why Do You Write That You Don't Like a Film? I think I write that because I don't want to be reminded of the movie. I think that every time I watch a movie, there is some aspect of the film that annoys me. Maybe it's the acting, maybe the direction, maybe I feel like the characters don't like each other, and I forget about them until the end. So I can't forget about that part of the story. I can get annoyed that I don  So, my answer is that I really like The Wizard of Oz. I didn't find the portrayal of the characters funny, but I wasn't disgusted by it. I would have liked to see a more realistic version of it. So if you are looking for a story about Dorothy and Toto, I'd suggest that you go with another film. If you are wanting to see Toto and the Munchkins in a funny way, I suggest The Princess and the Frog, or if you just want to go to a very old, dark, and darkly comedic movie about a man who wants to steal a beautiful woman from the Wicked Witch of the West, you should go with the Muppet Movie. These are just two examples, there are tons of movies that I think are great. What you will find with me is that when I like a movie it is because it makes me laugh, or because I love the characters. I don 't think there is a movie I don' t enjoy, because I just don't find it to be the sort of film that makes me think or laugh. I really enjoy good action, or funny scenes, or a good story. If the filmmakers of a movie are making a good effort, then I am glad they are making it, because that usually means the movie is good. That's it for the movie reviews now, next week I am going to do something a little different. I am not going to just talk about a movie and
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ "The Best" is a feature-length documentary that documents the journey of two young actors, Dan Egan and Tim O'Neill, who are set upon by the film industry when they attempt to make their debut in an unknown film. Despite their early success, the filmmakers continue to struggle with the realities of the industry. The film follows the actors' efforts to overcome the difficulties they face both personally and professionally. The filmmakers hope their story will help others gain an understanding of how difficult it can be to create a movie and live off-the-grid. It is an inspiring and inspiring story. It would make a great feature film. - IMDb Rating: 9.3/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you've been in this scene (or if you've made it there and know the rules of it) you know how to do this. In fact, you don't need to be a professional to do it. You don't even need to do the scene; you just need to know the scene. You can tell your wife a joke and your child a story, but you'd probably just laugh more if you knew that she would be hearing those stories as an adult. You may not be a pro, but that's no reason to say "That's just an act." If a story in a movie can't be described as a joke, don't write it down:    If the story in question is too funny for you to tell as a family, then don't tell it. Don't try to tell that story. If you're on the fence about writing a story as a kid, don.t write it. If the audience is there and laughing, then you're in. If you're not laughing, don's try again.  If all you have is a story about some kid from the neighborhood who's getting bullied, don' t write it:     Don't make up a story where your character is bullied.  That's not a story you should make up because that's not your story, anyway. The audience can be all wrong:  The first time you make a joke about a movie you've seen in a while, you're going to make a mistake. Every time you tell that joke to someone else, you are likely to make that mistake, even if you were the one who was making the mistake the first time. Don' t make the same mistake twice. If a joke you've heard a hundred times doesn't work the first or second time, maybe it doesn't belong in that scene at that moment. You need to think, "What was funny in this movie?"  "Did the story need more laughter than what it got?  Could it be funnier??" When you read an audience response to a joke that is funny, don 't put your own story in it: What are you, some kind of comedian?  Is it fair that you should be the one to tell jokes in front of an audience, and that other people should be expected to respond to your jokes as you tell them? No.  In a funny scene, the

I'll admit, I haven't seen it. So I'm going to take the low-hanging fruit first.  I don't know the story. I don't really care enough to watch it again. __________________________ I was really really hoping for something that would make me want it again in a different way. I was hoping for a very different kind of movie that would push my buttons as an audience member and give me some kind of epiphany and/or epiphanies about what I should be doing. ____________ So, what did "K" do that it did? Well, I'm glad I'm not the critic. _____ ___________ What made me cry? _______ _____________ (Note: The words "scary" and "emotional" were used with a certain amount of emotional nuance.) It was all very well-written, but when I watched it, I just kept waiting for some reason, some reason I didn't get to see in my brain. ___________________________________________________________________________________ So why am I writing this now? __________ __________________ So, I think the reason I wrote this is that I think that I want to write a review for all the people who have been asking for one. ____ ______________________________ The truth is that while there are some interesting and engaging aspects about "K," as a story, as a movie, it kind of fails at the most basic level of storytelling. I hate that sentence. "It fails at everything." _____________________________ ____________________________ The good things about this film, however, are some of the aspects that I didn,t see. I didn;t see how interesting or scary it is because the story doesn't do enough with the story it's telling. It does its job well. But there are also some really cool, very cool things that didn't quite make it into the story as it's being told. For me, as someone who isn't quite as familiar with the comic series as I am with the film, I feel like I missed out on some of this stuff. _______________________ _____________________ So my apologies for the "weirdness" I mentioned in my original thoughts. _______ \_ _________________ ___________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ Write a negative review about the worst movie you've seen: __________ Look, we're all going to watch a bad movie at some point. But if you hate a movie so much, how can you enjoy watching it? If you hate watching a bad film, you don't have to watch it. Or if you love a movie, why on earth would you not want to watch that movie? Don't make bad movies your primary focus in your life. Don't waste your life on watching them. They'll kill your soul and turn you into a self-loathing loser. Good movies can't kill your dreams. Bad movies can kill your brain. That's why bad movies are so damaging to our culture. They have the ability to change who we are. They can make us hate ourselves and destroy our minds. They kill your ability to enjoy things. They ruin the lives of those around them, as well as those who are watching the show. That is why it's so important for you to see a few good films. I know it may seem counter-intuitive, but it's better to be a fan of a bad, but funny, movie than a fan or critic of a good, but dull movie. Let's say you're going to see A Christmas Story. If you have a lot of faith in the movie and think the writers are funny and great, you'll probably enjoy it. That said, if the movie makes you feel really unhappy and sad, it's not for you. If that's the case, you probably aren't going to enjoy the movie in the first place. If, on the other hand, you have no faith whatsoever in the writers, or they make you feel happy and happy, you can still enjoy this film. You're more than welcome to. This is especially true if you are the person who hates movies. But maybe you have seen some good movies, too. It's not like you have to see everything. Maybe you're just looking for a good Christmas movie. A lot of people have a hard time going to a good holiday movie. After all, the holidays are supposed to be about the family, right? But let me tell you something, if you watch a movie like Christmas Vacation, it will make you happy. A movie like that will have a good chance at making you happy, even if you never had anything like that in your own life. You'll be laughing, you won't have any problems with

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ The first thing that you will notice is that a very large number of movies do not have a great rating from the critics, and there is no single reason for this.  It could be that the directors want to give some free publicity to their own product.  And this is especially true if the movie in question is a "caper" (a movie with a bad ending).  The good news is that most of the caper movies are really well done and worth seeing.  I have listed in the table below the ones that I consider very good. 1)  The Blues Brothers (1980) 2)  Scarface (1983) 3)  Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) 4)  Ghostbusters (1984) 5)  Night at the Museum (1988, new on DVD) 6)  Superman Returns (2006) 7)  Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984, new version on DVD, in English) 8)  Jumanji (1995) 9)  Batman & Robin (1989, new DVD, first theatrical feature) 10)  Scooby Doo (2000, DVD, new) 11)  Die Hard (1988).  This is an excellent action/adventure movie that does not have bad reviews but its ratings have suffered from its sequels (especially its fourth one, "The Final Chapter").  12)  Jurassic Park (1993, new). 13)  Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991).  I also think that a movie with Michael Biehn as the main lead is better than one with Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is good but not great in this movie.  14)  Top Gun (1986).   15)  Back to the Future (1985).  16)  Super Mario Bros. (1985, first in English). 17)  Finding Nemo (2003, new and on DVD). 18)  Home Alone (1990).  19)  Independence Day (1996).  This is a really great Independence Day movie that has not received bad reviews because the ratings were higher than expected. 20)  Ocean's 11 (1995).  I would not consider this as a great movie and there are only two good points: 1) The acting is pretty good and 2) this movie has a great soundtrack.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________ My Rating 5.0  "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" (1944) – A very interesting documentary on the famous New York theater company "The Company." The company was founded by a man by the name of Henry Sternberg. Henry had made a name for himself in New York's theater scene by staging "Swing low, sweet chariot." He is considered the godfather of the modern "big-band" theatre company. I'm sure that if he were alive today he would be considered one of the greatest directors in American theatre history. But he was born in Germany and immigrated to the United States at a young age. He didn't speak a word of English so he was forced to learn on the job by fellow theater-goers. It was the beginning of a lifelong career in American culture that would lead him to become the most popular and influential German-American of his time. The film is interesting to watch as the film follows the early days of "The Club." They have two major shows each year – the first show being in the spring and the second in the fall. The first show had a huge stage, a great orchestra, a large crowd, and some of the biggest names in theatre history – including Mary Pickford, George Antheil, and George Saperstein. The second show was a much more intimate event. There were about 100 people attending. The theatre was a little hole in the wall – not much bigger than an auditorium. This time it was all set up for performances by the "Club." The Club members were musicians who worked with various artists on their music. They included Frank Sinatra, Eddie Cantor, and Artie Shaw. The documentary is very interesting in the way it follows the formation of the "club" as they build their company and its musical acts. Their shows included many of the big bands of the time. As I've mentioned, the film ends with a look back at their early years. This is especially relevant considering the fact that it was filmed in the late 1940's and early 1950's and shows their growth as a company.  My Rating: 3.5  Here are some other movies worth checking out:  Ticket to Ride (1957) – Tired of living in a world where every man and woman was a chauvinist, Charles Rogers decided that the best way to change the world was to create a transportation system that didn't cater to

I liked it much better when the film first aired. I donít know why, but it just seemed like a less fun, less funny movie with less story that was being told. But it is still worth watching if you can find it. _______________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ The following review is for the 2015 film "Maggie's Plan" by Stephen King.   "Maggiel's Plan," the fourth in King's best-selling "Dark Tower" series, is King's most personal work yet. The first novel to feature a young girl, it's the story of what happens when two families, one Christian and one Jewish, come into conflict.  , the story follows a young woman named Molly who, after the death of her mother, decides to raise her daughter alone in the suburbs.   in King, he has created a fictional world that is rich with magic and monsters, and the story takes on a darker, more intense tone as the girl grows up, and eventually tries to save the world. King's prose is both lyrical and chilling, drawing you into a world of magic, mystery and terror.     King's writing style is not very descriptive, preferring to let the characters speak for themselves and let the story speak for itself. This allows the story to focus more on the characters and their lives, making it more personal and more human than the other three novels in the series, and "Molly's Plan"'s atmosphere is more intense and more immersive than those earlier ones. The characters in "M Molly's Plan " are very well developed, and their actions, thoughts and emotions feel like they were born directly out of the characters' lives, rather than out of what's been said or implied in the books. It's a real joy to read these characters, and we begin to see that the author is just as fascinated and concerned with them as we are. The setting of the story is also different than previous stories, with many of the locations being much more real and real-feeling than anything that has been described in the other books.  The book takes a lot of twists and turns, and there are many twists and revelations. Some of the major developments are unexpected, and some are not, but the story always makes sense and is always interesting to read about. This is also one of the few books in the whole series to deal with some very disturbing and dark themes, and those are dealt with very delicately, which makes them feel more realistic. Overall, "M Maggie's Plan "'s plot is fairly predictable. The main character's family is split down the middle, but that doesn't make the story any less compelling. King makes the characters more interesting, the setting and the monsters more
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Email * Print This Pinocchio  Greta Christina:  "How could we  possibly  make this film without an entire studio dedicated to pushing the sexualization of little girls in a way that actively and relentlessly erodes their humanity?" This has to stop, and it is not enough for it to stop. "The Little Mermaid" is the work of a studio that understands that if it continues on its current path, "The Little Witch," "Sleeping Beauty", and "Beauty and the Beast" are all on their way to becoming the "Little Mermaid" of Hollywood history. And what they are doing is wrong. The producers and directors of "The Princess and the Frog" recently  said they had a commitment to making the film about the life of a transgender woman. However, the very real transgender experience is much more complicated than they have given us the chance to see. We do not have a transgender character in this film, so we have to assume that when they say it will be about her life, it is really about her death, or something. There are so many stories that transgender people are told, we are often forced to fill in gaps with the same tired cliches that we are told every single day about other people. I know I've been here before. I've known what it's like to see myself, and other transgender people, reduced to stereotypes and cliched stories that fall flat when we look at the bigger picture. Transgender people, like gay and lesbian people, are being killed by a rising tide of violence. The most recent statistics show that transgender women of color face the most violence. And it's happening all around us. A new study that examined all murders in the United States between 2010 and 2013 found that in nearly half of those murders, the victims were transgender. While there are still so many questions about who is committing these acts, and why, it's easy to feel like it's our fault, that this is all our fault. That is why we have a responsibility as the trans community to keep the pressure up, and make it clear that we won't stand for this. This can't be your fault. That has to stop NOW. It's not acceptable to tell children who they should be, or who they can be, and then, when that child comes out of the closet

I just finished "Shrek". A few questions:  . How does it feel to have an animation studio that has worked on over 100 films. How do they compare to other animation studios?   - How would you compare their skill level to that of other major studios?  . It's probably impossible to compare a small studio like yours with some of the larger studios, because you're not just working with a small team of people. You are working with over 100 people working on this project.   The comparison is impossible, and the studio has always been a part of the Disney family, and that's how I like to think it should be. There are plenty of animation studios that have been around for 100+ years and have a long history of making great movies. It wouldn't be fair to compare the animation studio as a whole to the other larger animation studios. But I will say that I think that any studio that's made 10 or more feature films, has made 10 to 20 feature films. And that includes Pixar, of course.   The comparison is difficult to make because all the studios make quality movies, and they have to make quality films to get their movies made. But it's not impossible to make a high quality film. It just takes more effort than most other studios are willing to put in, and you'll have to put a lot of hard work into marketing to get it out into the marketplace.   of course if you look at the big studios in Hollywood that have never made a high-quality movie they've had a hard time getting their movies released, no matter how many stars, directors, etc. they put on it. (Remember, if they got a really good star/director/etc. it's no longer a high art film.) You're not going to have to be one of those studios. You're going to be Disney. If you want to make good films, you have to work very hard to get your film out to the public. As I said earlier, you'll be working with 100 people

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________ If I was making a list, I'd probably say that I don't really like to review movies. It's an extra work for me, it's time consuming, it doesn't lead to the best review. But, I do see a lot of great movies (for a start). And, it would be even worse if you were only to take what I say to the cinema. It really is a nice experience to go to the theatre and see a movie with others. But you don't always know if someone you know will enjoy the movie, you don  I had a lot to say about this movie. The story, the characters, the dialogue, the music, everything was great. However, after about 3-4 times of watching this movie, I couldn't go back to the movie because the pacing was so slow. I have to admit, I was so engrossed in the film that I didn't even notice that it was so old. The dialogues are so similar to how they should be in a movie like this. It makes it really hard for me to go back. A very good movie, but it's just a little bit too long to be enjoyed. I would recommend it to everyone, but be prepared for a very long movie. Also, do not expect this to be good. I could only give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.

Tell us about a movie that was great but didn't make it big: ______________________________________________________________. (This doesn't mean that you're a lousy movie-theater-goer; you just need to be able to explain why you liked it.)   If you're in the middle of a big Hollywood movie, but the studio's not calling you back to read a new script, write a short summary: ____________________. (If you want to be more specific, talk about the "character" and his "problems," but don't use more words than this.)   the title of the new movie _____________________. You're not allowed to give anything away, because that's what the studio would ask you in case you were a potential actor, director, or producer. The producer would only want your reaction to the script.   The studio wants a summary of the plot (no spoilers!) _______________________________________________________. (What is this supposed to mean? Is there any way to get away with this?)  If your synopsis has anything that the studio isn't interested in, your agent has no choice but to write a memo that explains: _______________________________.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________  "There is nothing to be frightened of in the film, only to be amused." - Roger Ebert  About this movie:  In the year 2026, the world has turned into a totalitarian nation ruled by the ruling elite. A new breed of super-powerful government agents known as Agents have come to earth to discover a superweapon that can save humanity. When the super-weapon is discovered, it unleashes a nuclear war that wipes out nearly every human. The last survivors become the cyborg warriors known as Skynet.   This film was based off of the popular novel of the same name by William Gibson.   the film was set to be released in the year 2017, but it was pushed back to 2018 due to legal issues. The film was originally intended to be called Skynets, but was later changed to Terminator: Genesis. The director, James Cameron, has stated that this version will be very different than the first two films, and he is already planning to make a third film.   that film took away from his earlier film because of the story being overly complex. The movie did have great action, but the characters and plot didn't make it. the story takes place in the 80s, but not in the future. This film took place in 2031, which is just outside the 21st century. In this film, John Connor, a young man who lives in California. Connor is a cop who has recently been promoted to lieutenant. One day, he is sent to a high security facility known as the "Torture Chambers". There, a mysterious man known as John has kidnapped a young woman, Sarah Connor. They are going to sacrifice her to a robot who lives inside the facility, so the human race can live forever. However, John has a problem. Sarah has a son, Kyle, who has been kidnapped by the terrorist group known as The Resistance. To save him, Kyle must be delivered to his father, who is fighting the T-1000 who is set to destroy humanity.  . The story and character development was very well done. The main storyline is told in a linear way, and there is no huge plot twists or characters that make you think. The best part about this film is how the story develops. The two villains (the T-800 and John) are introduced very early on in the story. They aren't revealed to be villains until quite a bit later. This makes the film
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ Tell us how you got into film: _______________________ _____________ __________ My friend bought this movie and told me about it and I bought it at the movies, and I thought it was cool. I thought the cinematography was really cool. And they have a guy that plays a guitar that plays really cool music. He plays cool music and it's kinda really good. But at the end he plays the music, and then I didn't see the music that much. But, anyway, I thought that was great, and it just made it that much more. ______________________ So, do you feel like a director can't make a movie that doesn't have a message? _________________ Yeah. I think it's a really hard one. So I'm really not sure. But yeah, it's pretty difficult to get to that point, right.

That was really good because we had that whole, "I've got this movie" thing going. But other than that, you know... ____________ Do you ever write your own scripts? ____ Well, I don't really write my own scripts. You know, you write it by yourself, you look it up online. You look at the screenplay, you read the scene that's written, and you just kind of figure it out. ______________________________________________________________________________ What are some filmography websites you use to read about other people's filmographies? __________________________________________________________________ Um, I used to use that one, I mean, my friends have that one. I used that once, actually. I kind of like it now. I do like that one now, 'cause I feel like when I read it it's so old and it gets outdated.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie, though it is not in the same league as the good movies. 1. THE GREAT KISS (1983) - 8/10 (good movie) One of the best movies of the 80's, based on a book of the same name, and is a classic film, with excellent acting, great acting (for an 80's movie), and a great script. I think the director, Alfred Hitchcock, did a great job. There are some minor issues, and some minor characters have little to do, but this is a good thriller.  There are a couple of minor issues with the movie, such as the lack of suspense, and the fact that there are not enough lines for all the characters, but they are minor.   There are many good parts, and most of the characters are excellent.  There is much discussion about the movie.       It is discussed on the forums on DVD Talk, on AVS Forum, and on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb).   The movie has many different reviews in different forums, which gives you a general idea of what people think about the film.  You can see the movie in many different ways, but you can see it either way, which is the way I watched the movie (a non-professional movie).  My rating: *********  (A good movie)
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  I think it was the most creative and interesting movie I saw in 2016. The story is interesting but not overly so. It was like seeing a dream come true. A lot of thought went into the story and it was actually pretty well done. The characters were interesting and the ending was not the typical ending. The acting was good and the direction was great. The action sequences were amazing! If you're a fan of the movies you might enjoy this movie a lot. My only complaint would be the length. It went on way too long. But it's worth watching if you enjoyed any of the Star Wars movies.  __________________________________________________  My friend's boyfriend told me he had never seen The Force Awakens (he's a big fan). The first time we went to the movies together, I got to see the entire movie. (It's an hour and a half). When he saw it again, he said, "Oh wow, you really went to see it again! This movie is great!"  When I saw it for the first time, I thought it was awesome. When I saw the original movie again, I knew it was a classic. It's really hard to pick a favorite for a Star Wars movie, but I really think this one is great. I really liked how it came together. The visuals are great, and the storyline has an awesome twist. The special effects were amazing. I thought I was going to see something totally different and it ended up being a really cool movie. I'd love to see how it will do when it comes out on Blu-ray.  the Force is strong with this one. .    Advertisements

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Have you seen the movie and are saying, "Ya know, I didn't like that." Then add: "Oh, I thought the movie was great" "I thought the script was great." "I loved the characters." (Or, "I don't like the movie." Or "I didn't know it was a good flick." I know what you're getting at. You're saying, I love the movie, but I didn�t really understand why I didn\'t like it.

If you want to learn more about filmmaking, start with a short film. _________ What does it mean for a movie to be good? ______________ A movie is good if you like it! If you love the plot, the characters, the music and everything else, then it will probably be good. But if you don\'t love any of that, if you just think it's okay, then you probably won't like it either. The best movies appeal to the audience in the best way possible. Movies are great because the people in them are good. If your movie is so good, that the people you see on screen are so well-acted and the story is so well constructed, that they actually become real people, then that is the best kind of movie ever made. In Hollywood, we often talk about movies as if they were movies about people. But it is movies that are about movies. It is the characters that matter. It isn\'t the movies. Movies may be about people, but they are always about the characters. If people don\' t really know who they are or what they are about, if the characters don\'T really act, speak or express themselves, then the movie is going to be terrible. ______________________________________________________________ When a movie is very good, it really comes down to character. I would never have thought that a movie like ''The Conversation" (a movie about two guys who are talking about life in America) would be very good. Yet, it was! What happened? Well, the guy playing the guy who talks to the man and who makes the guy realize that he has to get out of his head, the director decided to go for a really simple and effective acting technique that the director liked to use

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Let me know that it was worth my time. I know this might sound silly, but you don't always have a choice what you like, do you? There are some movies that just grab your heart and make you fall in love with them. Even if you don the movie without paying attention to it, it might still have a great story and be worth seeing. If I didn't watch many movies, I might not be able to tell you which movie is the best but you can probably guess a few from my list. So without further ado, I give you some of my top 3 favorite movies and the reason I love them so much. 3. "The Notebook" This movie is great because of the lead actor, Reese Witherspoon. She is so good at playing a real girl that you can see through her that there is a little something that makes her different from the rest of her friends. Also, in the movie she is always so beautiful that it makes it hard to take your eyes off of her. And her story of finding the girl who stole her heart is such a great one. I also loved that this movie was shot entirely in the desert. The movie was set in a little town in California but the setting made it different and really special.  Also, when Reese Womens' parents ask her to come home and talk to them, she is in complete shock. The entire movie takes place in the car and in the bathroom. 2. "Sisters" I have been following the "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" series since the beginning and this movie is probably one of my favorites. It is great for those that like action movies. It also has a great supporting cast. The leading cast in the show are the most amazing group of girls. They are hilarious, cute and have a very sweet and innocent side to them. This movie has a lot of action in it but I enjoyed it more than the other two because of that. This is also one of the better movies that can be called an action comedy. 1. "Honeymoon in Vegas" For anyone who didn't see it in the theater, this movie really took me by surprise. I didn' t think that this story would be so much fun. I liked it even though it was a bit confusing. What makes this movie great is that it is the perfect example of when one should go to Vegas. You have
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I am not really into horror, but this movie is pretty good. I was really surprised by how good it actually is. If you like films with a story that's different than your typical slasher movie then you should give it a chance. It's a great watch. I would give it 4 out of 5 stars because it was interesting to see what the writers of the script were going for and it had a good plot. Not all of the movies are as good as this though.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What makes a movie great? What makes one movie good and one bad? There are so many different factors to consider, and every one of them can be important. I'm going to focus my time on the ones that aren't important in this particular instance, but that are crucial for how great a movie can be. First and foremost, the writing. The director or writer should create an interesting world and characters, and they must create believable and interesting conflict. The writer must make the action exciting and suspenseful, but don't use gratuitous violence, or else it will only bore the audience. The actors must give their best effort in the role, because if they don't then the movie becomes a disappointment. The cinematography and editing must also be very good to make the audience care about every scene, whether they're watching the action on a TV screen, or seeing them unfold on the screen. And, of course, the music must be fitting to the mood of the movie. A movie should have a certain atmosphere. An enjoyable movie should make you feel good, and it shouldn't leave you feeling frustrated. If any of these aspects aren't done well, then the film will lose its appeal. And that's a sure sign of a poorly written movie. It's not about how good a movie is. You don't have to enjoy a movie to be happy about its success. So why write a negative review? ___________ "I don't see how this book can help anyone." It would be easy to write a movie review like the one I just did. But a negative movie review isn't going to help. It'll just confuse people. You can't read about movies and have an opinion on the movie itself. You have to have an idea of why you think a movie was bad, and why it didn't live up to your expectations. And the only way to do that is to watch the movie and see whether you really think the movie was good or bad. If the movie didn't fulfill your expectations then you can't come up with a positive opinion of it. The best way to review a movie would be by looking at whether or not it meets your expectations, or if you thought the movie failed to meet your expectations in some way. If it did meet your standards then you've really enjoyed it, and if it didn t meet your expectation it is unlikely that you'll be able to come up to it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________  A lot of reviews from friends and family get taken with a grain of salt. I've found that, for most people, they tend to be of the kind that say things like "I liked the movie," or "The movie was a lot of fun," or whatever. Sometimes these things can be true, and sometimes they aren't. I know I've been guilty of this before. A review of a movie that was fun, or enjoyable, but wasn't perfect is always a welcome thing to hear. Some people read a review of something, and they go "Oh my God, the movie was amazing! I loved it so much!" Then the next day, the same people will read a "darned film" review, and go "what an ass!"  I hate reading "Darned Film Review," because I'm not a film critic. I think that's a mistake. And most movies aren't good movies. The best movies are, and I'm only talking about the great ones. We don't get the great movies because we're watching them. And if we do get a film that's great, they're generally not in the top 10 for many years after. I also hate reading that "the movie was boring, or the film was boring to begin with, or that it wasn't a good film, because they're all not true. Sometimes a film can be boring, and we're just not aware of that. Sometimes it just sucks. I want a film to be good, even if I'm watching it because I like it. I like bad movies, but I'm always excited when a good one comes along.  You know, I'm a big movie guy. I love seeing movies. I do. It's not that I love watching them for the sake of watching them, I just love seeing them. I try to go to the movies at least once a month, every time I go. But even though I'm there for the whole movie, sometimes it doesn't make it to the end. Sometimes I watch it and just get sucked in. And I can't stop. I can stay for as long as it takes. You can't. .  in a recent discussion with a fellow filmmaker, he mentioned that he wanted to write a book about the art of directing. I thought this would be a perfect book for me to write.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It was great, especially for a horror film. Very well done." - Chris Diamantopoulos "Funny and very well done" - James Suckling "This was great" - Steve Smith I'm going to guess that, because my copy of The Night Of was mailed to me after I read the reviews and said "WOW, this is good" the studio knew I was going to like this. If I could have given the movie a 0 I would. If I had, it would be too harsh. But since it's just a movie, I don't mind it a bit. I could go on and on about how much I like it, but it's best not to think about the negative reviews, because that's a waste of time. This is just a funny movie that I thought was very well made and I thought the cast did a great job. I really wish it was rated R, but even that wouldn't make it any less enjoyable. THE SIDE OF THE BUBBLE (2/5) This is the one that didn't quite live up to the hype. I can't remember where I saw it, and I didn't go to see it, so I couldn't write a review. The movie is a fairly long and very boring movie. It seems to be a sequel to The Blob, which is no good. When I first saw it the title was on the poster, but now the credits have it.  I wonder if the movie was titled The Blobs because of the title, but I really don't care, because it just seems to have no purpose, and a lack of plot, if you ask me. What I do care about, however, is that they put some great acting in this one. In this film you have two men fighting to get their life back. One is a janitor who's lost everything in a fire, and the other is a construction worker who has lost his wife in a plane crash. When the men meet they start to have some issues. The janitor thinks he needs to save money, so he's taken to robbing banks, and it starts to get out of hand. Then the janitor is in a fight for his life against a man who's on the run, and he tries to do what he can to save him, and they have a nice bit of fighting that makes me want to see

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. I'm not kidding. If you say a negative thing about a movie it will affect your rating and the way it will be remembered and loved.  Write a negative review about something you hated: ___________________________. It will be much easier to remove from your memory, the things you hate and to try to forget about it.  You might say this is an exaggeration, but you're not exaggerating. There are several times I had to change my rating of something because of something said about it in a review. One time I felt I had no other choice because I really didn't want to see it, so I didn't see it. Another time was with my wife. I felt we didn't need to see her movie, but I wanted to know her thoughts about it, to try and get a comment. It seemed silly that I would want to know my wife's thoughts about something that I never really got into. But at the same time, I can appreciate someone making the effort to let me know what they thought, especially if they are not biased. If there is a movie, book, or book review that I don't agree with and I want to give it a "0", I will ask for my money back.  I will also request that I be given a refund if I'm unhappy with my money.  It's the least I can do. I think it's important to tell your friend that this is a big change, and it may take some time for them to get used to the changes. They are going to have to adapt to the fact that "what we do for fun is not going to work at work" and that their job may not change, but that they can make a difference. So they need to go through the process of learning the difference between what they like and what's not so fun. There is also a chance that they will have a bad experience and find it hard to trust their friends and colleagues to act in the same way they do.  So, if you feel that they haven't been taught to behave the way you do, they may have a hard time trusting their friends to do the same, or even trust their colleagues and superiors.  But even if it doesn't work out at work, if they have some idea of how to treat people at work in a more respectful and pleasant way, they will also have a change.  If you go to a social gathering and all you see is

The trailer is very cute. The opening is cute. I'd watch it in the shower but I don't get why there would be a movie about guys doing yoga. Why did you make the opening of a movie so cute? The movie starts with three guys going to a yoga class where the teacher is a really attractive, good looking Asian woman. They all fall into a deep trance and are told that they have to meditate. This is the movie. We see three people fall into their meditative trance. This movie is so weird. There's no actual meditation. There is, however, a lot of hugging, and I don' t understand why. There are so many guys in this movie. At one point, I was laughing hysterically because there are three guys hugging and saying things like "We feel each other's pain" and "I love you" and so on and on. It felt like I was watching a couple making out while their kid is in the next room. In one scene, a guy goes to a massage parlor to get his head massaged by a hot, beautiful woman. He comes out and there's a hot blonde woman next to him with a camera. He goes into her room and they go to bed. He starts touching her boobs and he comes out with his head between her legs. The guy in the movie seems to enjoy it, but he doesn't say anything because he feels awkward. He never says anything like "I want to make out with you." I think he wants to be touched and kissed. Then she kisses him and he goes "Whoa! This woman is so sexy! Whoa! Look at those boobs!" and he seems like a total idiot. He's like this guy in "Boys Don't Cry" or something. He doesn't know how to use his brain. The whole movie seems like this. There were so many things about this movie that felt silly. There was a movie from last year called "Gravity" and I think it was better than this movie and I'll explain why. In "Grav" the movie starts out with some people falling out of a spaceship and they start floating around. It was more interesting that way. So in this film, all the people were floating around and then suddenly someone falls out and we are told the reason why

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ The Legend of Bagger Vance is a pretty good movie, and there's an old saw about movies that you can never go back to the ones you hated, like the one about The Shawshank Redemption. The thing I love about Bagger is that it's not like any of the other movies of that type. It's a real unique movie. It is a rare genre of movie that is about something different and yet it is not unlike any other movie of the same genre. The movie starts with Bagger and his mother, a former inmate, who has finally been released from prison, taking a boat for a long trip to visit his daughter. In the film, Bagger meets a fellow inmate named Jimmy who also has a family member serving a lengthy sentence. Bagger sees him as a kindred spirit who he could help in the same way he helped his mother. As time passes, Bacer becomes more interested in Jimmy's case than his own, eventually turning his life around and helping the two men. It was a film about family and friendship, love and loss, and that is what makes this movie so great. It didn't try to reinvent the wheel or make another The ShawShank Redemption type of movie. This is the first time I've seen a movie like this. It really is something special. It will leave you inspired. The acting is all great in this movie. Not all of them are great actors, but everyone who plays Bagger, his mother or Jimmy are all great. I also love the music in this film, mainly in the soundtrack. I like the movie and can recommend it to people who aren't necessarily fans of the genre, but I also like movies that are different. Binder's film was one of the first I saw where the film wasn't about a man who had to find a way to stop the robbery from taking place, but about a father who tries to find the way to make his family's lives a little better. I hope you'll give this movie a chance. I did. You won't be sorry.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I'll read a good review about my movie:_________ The one that gets the best reviews: _________________________________ If you're a film buff: __________________ You want to write a review: ____________________________  How to get a job  First of all, find your calling or interest. The best way to figure this out is to take a class or go to workshops. If you want to become a writer for Hollywood, you probably need to learn about the process of making movies. The good news is, these classes are cheap and they go for $10.00-$15.00. These classes will teach you all the skills you'll need to be a good screenwriter. Also, you don't need to worry about a college degree, just read a lot of good books and go to film festivals, and it'll pay off in spades.  The next thing you have to do is find a way to find clients. I like to write and read and that means I don't have a huge list of contacts. I've started by creating a list of things to sell. I try to make my site as easy as possible for potential clients to get information on. I write things that a typical person might want to know like:  -Who is this writer? What are they working on?  -"What's this company trying to do?"  -'What's my availability?"  "What do you think I should do next?" ,  and so on. . , What does my site say about me?  for that I need to include:  of course, a brief biography.  a brief description of myself, my writing style and my experience.  is the first thing you're going to learn as a writer: how to craft a good script. You don't even need to make a list. Write whatever comes into your head. That way, you can use the information you've just learned and figure out what you want. A good writer knows where to look and what to look for. You can take a look at my blog, or check out a lot more information on Screenwriting on line. Also read books, watch films, etc. It really helps to be in the trenches and have a lot to draw upon. Here are some tips on finding work:  "Do the Work". The most important thing you can do is actually work on your script. Don't sit around at

I was able to find all the answers in just a few minutes, and now that I've seen it a few times, I know that the movie isn't just about the story but about the world. The film is about the struggle to realize that we all live in an interconnected universe with everything else, and to not be afraid of it. There are plenty of other things going on in the world and it doesn't matter what we think because we are all part of the whole.

I love the ending scene. It's a perfect end to the film. You could probably say the movie ended right there, with the girl and her lover in the desert looking up at the stars."  - "Wow, the movie was very different than I was expecting. I thought it would be a little light and silly, but there were real moments that made me feel the movie had a purpose. It wasn't just a movie about aliens; it was about humanity and their struggle to survive."  I was surprised when I first saw Alien: Covenant. I was very interested in seeing if Covenant would live up to the quality of Alien: Resurrection and I think the film has definitely exceeded my expectations. While the movie isn't perfect, it does a very good job of making me feel attached to the characters on screen. I think that Alien: and Alien:: Covenant are the best two movies in the franchise to date. If you have already seen one movie or the other, Alien: is a very easy recommendation. But if you haven't seen the films, then go back and watch them. The movies do a great job of establishing their characters and creating tension that the rest of the series has failed to do. 1.1/10 - I give Alien: a B- I would like to thank everyone who commented on this blog. It means a lot to me that you all enjoy my writing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. Write a negative review about an evil movie: ______. Write an ad for a movie: ( _____________ ) You can write ad copy for any movie, such as "Do you know the worst film ever?" and "If you are going to see this, please buy a condom." Also, write an ad copy that will appeal to someone who doesn't understand what they are reading (for instance, if you are selling your car, you might write "You don't have to worry about getting hit by a drunk driver!").  6. Write your own script: If you do write a screenplay, write it in a way that makes it clear that you created it on your own and not from a script template. For example, if someone asks you, "What is your biggest dream?", write, "I want to become an actor." You can't write your own movie, but you can write a script that helps you with your life goals.  7. Write one script and sell it: This is a great way to start out as a script writer. If you can sell one screenplay, you can start on the next steps. If it costs $100,000 to write one screenplay that makes $50,000, then you can go ahead and start writing scripts that cost $1,000. After you sell your first script, then it becomes easier to write the next one.  I have seen people who have spent $100 a month to write scripts. They were never successful, but they kept writing them. It was because they kept telling themselves "I am not good enough, I'm not good-enough, I've got to learn to be better!" I believe this is how writers get off track. The thing about being a scriptwriter is that you are constantly fighting to get your ideas across. It's a constant battle between the writer and the reader to make sure that your ideas are interesting enough and that they make sense. When you write, you are trying to put yourself into the readers' shoes so that they will become your readers.  The most important thing you can do as a writer is to never get discouraged. You have to keep writing. There is always something you can improve on.  the bottom line is that if you don't want to be a writer, you don. You cannot become a writer without writing. No one will understand the meaning of your words if you haven't explained what they mean to you. If

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ Write a negative review about one that's great: ____ Don't give them the ratings they want to hear. Give them the ones you think are just right. The most interesting thing about movies is how much you like them. It's not the amount of stars. It would be silly for me to rate movies just based on the number of stars they have. As the saying goes, stars only tell you about yourself. If you really liked it and the director is great and the movie is entertaining and well done, then why would you change your review? The reviews have to be realistic. They are not supposed to be perfect. In this day and age of instant reviews on the Internet, where anyone can post a review in a matter of seconds, the Internet can become a place of "fake reviews." I don't like fake reviews. I think that the internet has led to a lot of the "bad reviews" being posted as real. I'd rather read about a movie I don?t like than read about one I do. However, I've noticed that I have come across some reviews that are very honest and genuine. You'll sometimes find that a review written by someone who doesn?t know a lot about the film has a lot more credibility than one written by a reviewer who is more educated and knows the movie inside and out. If this is true, then these are the only two reviews I'll post. I'm not a fan of the review section of an actual movie, and I don??t like fake ones either.

The Film Study Reject is the name of a group of film critics who have decided to be the most hated group in film criticism. They?ve made their living off of bashing film, and they seem to be unable to see that they have lost most of their readership in the process. They have a few other members that occasionally post their negative reviews, but mostly their reviews have a very specific goal in mind. They want their readers to hate a film as much as possible. The reason that the reviews are so negative is that they believe that films that have good reviews are more enjoyable, more important, more profound and more meaningful than films that are less popular. They believe that any film that has more than a few negative reviews is a terrible film that is worth seeing for the wrong reasons. It is their hope that these

Thank you!  ____________________________________________________________  #8 - The Great Beauty  Year: 2017  Director: Robert Pattinson  Release Date: 2017   I remember watching this movie in college with my buddies and getting completely sucked in, even though I didn't know any of the actors or even that it was a romantic drama at the time. You see, I love beautiful, romantic movies and while I haven't been completely able to find a "good" one in the last few years, this one was definitely on the top of my list. Robert Pattison is absolutely gorgeous as an older man who's taken a liking to a young girl and wants to take care of her. He's also a super romantic and seems to make sure to spend quality time with his lady. It's not just the movie, though. The script and performances are incredible. The story itself is great and I love the idea that this is a sort of coming of age drama between the young woman and her older lover. The entire movie is really easy to follow with just a few little twists and turns along the way. I found myself wanting more and more, especially after the second act, where the whole thing really takes off. So I'll be looking for this film on a lot of lists of top romantic movies of all time. I just hope it will stay there for the rest of my life. -Ryan  "We don't have the time to get to know a person we don't love. When love is deep and lasting, it is a blessing."

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I will always have a soft spot for this movie as it was one of the very first movies I saw when I was a kid, so I think it has some kind of special place in my heart. I loved the cast, the special effects, and the plot was very original at the time, it was not a huge budget movie, but it had some really clever ideas and it was very unique and the writing was good, but in the end the movie was never fully realised. The movie had a great concept, but when it became real there was some problems, and I think the original concept was really great and the special effect effects, however it had nothing to do with the writing of the screenplay.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  "The Force is strong with this one," wrote Chris Denning of Movieguide.com. "It had to be because of Harrison Ford, who steals the show in both his role as Han Solo and his character of Luke Skywalker. There's nothing about the story that's particularly groundbreaking or revolutionary, but there's just enough to keep you engaged and interested. I look forward to seeing more of him in this new trilogy."  Other reviews in the media included:  — ScreenCrush: "I love Star Wars and this movie will resonate with me for a long time. Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope is the best Star Wars film." .  .

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is a good film, but I think the main reason I enjoy it so much is because of the acting. And you can see why. This film is about an undercover agent, who comes from a military family, and he spends his life spying for the US government. I think that the acting is top notch and the whole film is well acted. I loved how these two characters met each other. They are very charismatic and well developed characters that we have in this film. I liked how each of them had their own goals. We have the FBI agent who is on a mission to stop a terrorist, and then we have the undercover agent. His goal was to gain more intel for the FBI to find the terrorist. I thought the CIA agent was awesome as well. He was smart and resourceful. He had a purpose for what he was doing. I really liked how they connected their characters in this story. These characters had so much in common and had different goals. The way they are presented in this movie is great and I would recommend this film to anyone. The story is interesting and very interesting. I would love to see more films that feature this story line. It really makes for good film study. If you are a fan of thriller or action, this movie will be a blast for you. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a good thriller or movie. Grade: B+ Movie Rating: 7.5 out of 10

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________ 1. The Avengers (2011) In case you've forgotten, the original Avengers film is really just a small part of a larger story called "Age of Ultron."  The film ends with a bang - the Avengers' battle with Loki and his army of robots, which is a far more interesting and dramatic sequence than the last big confrontation between the Avengers and the Dark Reign.  It's an end that is almost as exciting as the first big battle in the final battle of the original movie, and it ends in the most satisfying way possible - with the Avengers in control of the situation and ending it as they would have wanted, without the need for Avengers 2:  They simply destroy the alien menace (as the aliens' leader was known, and we've already been promised a sequel to Age of Ultron in the future). This is a very strong, very fun movie.   I enjoyed the cast and I enjoyed their chemistry.  It is not an action movie by any means, but it does have an amazing amount of heart, and a very believable and well-developed villain.  It is the kind of movie that you watch over and over again just to appreciate it all the more. 2. Iron Man (2008) I'm usually one of those "noir" movie fans.  I'm a huge fan of The Man Who Fell to Earth (1973) (aka "The Fly"), The Silence of the Lambs (1991) (a movie I consider to be the greatest of all time), and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1966).   Iron Man is not a film that I would normally consider "noire", but it is a great character movie.   If you look at a classic noir film, the main hero is usually a man who is trying to solve his own problems and find out what happened to him after the bad things happen.  Iron man is a man trying to figure out how his own success can affect the world, how his success affects his relationship with his family, and how he himself, being successful, affects the world.    The film has great character work by the leads, with Robert Downey, Jr. being able to capture so many different characters.    There's Tony Stark, of course, but there's also Happy Hogan, who is a wealthy business tycoon who is forced to move from New York to London after his father is killed

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. You're likely to get more votes if you include a lot of facts and figures, a good plot, and a great cast.  2. Write a negative review about an okay movie: [blank]  3. Write two reviews, one negative and one positive, about a movie that you really want to see: [one] [blank].  4. You can combine these tips for each movie into your favorite review: [One] [Blank] [Good] [Bad].  in general, the more factual and specific the better. The more general and vague, the better the reviews.  for example, for "Hitchcock," I would write the one on my blog about that film that's in my book "A Film by Howard Deutch."  Also, be sure to include the director's name in the body of the review.  with this one, I would leave the reader wondering, "what kind of film was this? How many actors played the same role? What's so special about Hitchcock's style of film editing? Was the director, Alfred Hitchcock, a filmmaker himself? How did he become a famous filmmaker?" So if I wrote something like this, it would leave people scratching their heads.  in this example, I'm not going to go into too much detail with this review. It's a classic Hitchcock film, which many of you will recognize, it's also a very well-made film. The characters are believable, the story is intriguing and entertaining, the cinematography is fantastic, and of course, Alfred doesn't disappoint.  The great thing about this review is that it is actually a review that the writer himself did on this film. So the reviewer has an original perspective on the film.  and that's the idea! That's what a good review is all about. So this review, "Hesperian Tales," is the same review I wrote for "Psycho" and "Vertigo." -Howard Deutch

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (optional) Write a review about what you enjoyed in a movie:    This post does not have a place for my thoughts on this movie. I cannot make any judgments of it and I will not be able to make any observations that I deem relevant to the film's merit. I will instead refer you to the above list of movies to read my thoughts and thoughts on each film in the original review. What I'm about to say is purely opinion, and I don't want any of it to come off as any less than objective.    (I hope this makes the film as watchable and watchable-ish for you as it is for me. )      If you've read my reviews before, you know how much I love movies. So when I heard about the "The Last of Us" script, I thought it would be interesting to see how a film that could only be seen in cinemas could be brought to life onscreen. I read the script and immediately fell in love with the characters, story, and world. I was thrilled to read that they had the script finished and I was hopeful that it would finally be the time for this story to come to life.   I've already written and posted about some of the major differences between the novel and film, so I won't be diving into them further in this post. I've found that, for all intents and purposes, the book is identical to the final film.   If I did mention anything, it would likely be in the character and world building department, as these are two of the biggest aspects of a story and can really drive the story forward in any medium.     If you want to read some reviews about what people think about the film, you can check out my two previous articles on this subject,  here  and  here.         With that out of the way, let's talk about the script!  First, I'd like to say that I think the writing was superb. I am a big fan of Naughty Dog and I had a ton of fun with the entire script for this film.       If you'd like a bit of background on the story, I strongly recommend you read the book. I know a few people have been curious what it's like to see a movie that wasn't written by a "Naughty Dog" employee and I can definitely vouch for the quality of the writing and

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  ______________________________________________  (2) In your own words: _____________________  _____________________________________________________________________________  in my opinion...  The best horror movies come from Hollywood directors with the biggest budgets. The best of those films are the films that use their unique style and the same basic idea over and over again. It is a bit of an illusion though, as we know that there are hundreds of cheap horror films with the same idea. I think this is a real shame because the films of David Fincher and Steven Spielberg are far more interesting and engaging than the films made by the usual Hollywood directors.   The last few years there has been a resurgence of horror films, in the same vein as the horror films of the 60's and 70's, when a handful of very talented directors worked together to make great movies that are still seen today. The films of George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper are as good as anything Hollywood has made in the last 30 years. The great films of J.S. Trowse and Richard Attenborough are just as memorable as anything made in recent times. The movies of Martin Scorsese and John Carpenter are as scary as anything seen in recent years. I was really surprised to find how good the last couple of films by Nicolas Winding Refn and Denis Villeneuve were, as I thought they were more of the same.  There were several interesting movies I came across in 2016, but none of them were as good or as exciting as the previous films from the directors above. However, they also had some of the lowest budgets I have ever seen. I hope the next few years bring a flood of amazing horror films that will make those of us with limited time on our hands regret not seeing these great films sooner. I can't wait.  and, for my own opinion...

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________, or write a negative review about an unsuccessful movie: ______.  If you think about it, the whole point of movie reviews is to find the good parts of a bad movie. So, how do we know that people are actually going to write good reviews of a movie? How do we decide what to focus on and what not?  In my view, the best way is to use the movie review format itself to measure a movie's success:  1. Do the reviews say a lot about the movie? , not just, or only about the film itself, and 2. How many of the reviewers seem to know a lot more about the subject matter than most viewers?  of the movies, and 3. Does the movie's review format, or the review itself, seem to help the viewer get a better idea about what it is they are watching? . Does it seem obvious that this movie is a bad one?  is the best one-sentence summary of this movie? Is it clear how to understand it? It is worth asking if the movie actually had good reviews in the first place. Did people notice this movie because the critics were saying a lot of good things about it? If the movie had a bad review, did the reviewers write good one-liners about it too? If so, does that mean that the movie didn't have good reviews at all, or is that just a sign of bad taste? The more information we have about a movie, the more likely we are to notice a bad rating. And the more obvious we are about the badness of the movie, then we are likely to see the negative reviews as a sign that the film was a bad idea. In this way, we can see whether or not people notice the reviews we write: if the reviewers are really getting their information from the film, and if the film's review itself is really clear, then they're likely to notice that.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  JERRY, YOU'RE AMAZING ____________________ JERRY  Posted by: jeff  Date: April 28, 2005 10:02am  Location: Texas  Jerry,   I agree with Mr. Schindler. If this movie was made today, it would be called "Schindler's List." The movie takes the time to show how cruel the Nazi's were, and it does a good job of showing just how wrong the Germans were being. There are no scenes where a Nazi officer is being kind or a soldier is saying "I'm just following orders," it's all just pure brutality.   So far, the only major criticism I've heard of this movie is that the soundtrack is too short. However, a lot of the songs were written in the 70's, when most films were in mono and thus it does fit the era the movie is set in.  .  .  in addition to all the criticism the movie gets, it's still one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's about as good as "Schinbek, Hitler's Last Soldier," which was a big disappointment to me.   and i dont mean to be rude about a movie i'm supposed to be rating, but you are wrong. Schilling's movie is actually better than the movie "Schwartz, Hitler" because they showed the atrocities that the Nazis did.     The other critic said, "You made your point, but i doubt that the film will be watched by anyone. The only audience for this movie will be the ones who like being brainwashed."   That's a valid point. There's a lot to look at and think about with this movie, and so many more movies to look into. But, just because you didn't want to watch this movie doesn't mean you're wrong. If you've seen the movie, then why would you want to hear what i have to say about it?   _____________________________________________________  Fantastic movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ This is a hard one to do, I'm still recovering from The Dark Knight Rises. I was on the fence about watching it, since I loved The Dark Night Rises. I've been in a similar situation when it comes to Watchmen: I've loved that movie, and if I was to do it over I'd watch it again, but I've also loved it a lot and had a hard time putting it down. So I don't know, I don  So, my first experience with the DC Extended Universe was The DarkKnight Rises, and the first thing I noticed was how great the costumes were. I love Batman, but the original look and the later changes that have come to the character have always been very divisive with me. I'm not saying that I hate them (as most people seem to think I do), but I feel that there's something about the DarkKnight that I love, but he's never really captured it in a way that it feels like he belongs with the rest of the heroes. I just don't feel that this is really him. So with that said, I was excited to see how the new costumes would change things up.The movie begins with Batman (Christian Bale) waking up in a hospital with no memory of his night before. There's a big reveal about his father's (Michael Caine) death and his mother's (Judi Dench) mental state. But, as far as I'm concerned, we should be getting to know Bruce and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) a little more this time around. And there are some interesting plot points along the way. The villain of the movie is a very interesting take on the classic Batman villain (the Joker) that I don.t remember seeing a lot before this movie. The villains are very well done and it makes me eager to see the rest. There are a lot of great action scenes in this movie and even though I know that it's the first film to come out after The Dark night Rises I was surprised at just how good some of the fights were. The action is great, the pacing is great and the cast is all very charismatic. The movie has a very slow build-up to it, but that builds up to a very exciting climax. Batman has a lot going on in it and I really enjoyed it.There's a lot I liked about the movie. It's fast-paced, the story is interesting, there's

The aliens are the perfect aliens to live in and the science is the perfect science.   Wolverine - This is a great movie that deals with the issues of violence and how it's used in a modern society.  .   of course it is all the violence that is the reason for the hate, but the story and characters are so good that the violence doesn't seem like violence to me anymore. Even though this movie has some of the most brutal and gruesome scenes ever shown on film, it is the characters that have me drawn to this movie. There are characters that you feel for like the ones in Raiders of the Lost Ark or Saving Private Ryan, and then there are others that you are horrified by. But I think that makes them even more fun to see as they are so unique.   "The people that are in my class want to kill me, they want to torture me and they want me dead, and they are doing so in order to save the world from an alien invasion."   This movie is not for everybody, but it really is worth a watch for anyone who has any love for movies that deal with the human condition.   the actors are great too, they play their parts very well and even if there is gore they still manage to make you love them. I think it would be really cool to make a movie that dealt with the same type of story but with humans being hunted by aliens who want to eat them. It would be a great idea and could have great success. And also there are aliens out there in the universe and I think we need to be vigilant about protecting our planet. And i also think it's time for a sci-fi/fantasy movie that features a space cop!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ A good movie is a movie which manages to make you go "Wow! That was amazing!" and if you are like most of us, you tend to go "That was okay. That's good, but it was still not as good as I had hoped." I have seen lots of great movies. Many of them are great, some are even really good. Some are truly great. This is not one of those movies. A good flick is one that you go and think to yourself, "That movie was better than the first one, and the second one was better and so on and so forth. And the third one, it's just a bad movie." I'm sorry to say that this movie was not a good flick. This movie was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I don't mean that it was really bad. Not at all. This was just plain bad. The only reason it was so bad was because it was just so darned stupid. The dialogue was bad, the plot was bad (don't get me wrong, I did like the concept, it was interesting, but the execution wasn't on point), and the characters were all completely ridiculous. There was one character that had a character sheet that was longer than the script itself. All of the characters seemed to be in love with a boy, but when that boy had to get back to school, he left, and now they've been in love for the entire movie, and they have this huge thing going on, and their friends think it's crazy, and all of the sudden the boy comes back, but he left again because he had a secret thing going. And there was the boy that was a huge asshole and got in the way of the boy's friends from time to time, and then all of a sudden the whole town wants him to give up the secret thing he had going. But in a town of 10,000 people, I wouldn't expect them to all just suddenly change sides. There were lots of times where they didn't make any sense, and when it came down to it, you could see what was going on in the scene, but there were just too many things going on. At least there was a story, at least there were characters. But the story was so terrible, that you just couldn't be bothered to try to understand what was even going on because it wasn't important. So I guess it was a good thing to say.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ "This was an amazing movie and was an overall delight. I really liked it, I just wish the movie would have a little bit more time to explore more characters. I think it could have been a really interesting journey and would have benefitted from more character growth. The ending was good. I didn't think there was much suspense, but it was still a good payoff. It was a fun movie and a great experience. The actors were great. I have seen all the episodes of it and really enjoyed them, and thought they all did a great job. I recommend this to anyone that likes fun mystery shows, or just plain good comedy. I enjoyed this."  – Sean C. "This is a good film, however, the story is a bit slow at times. However, as it progresses through the movie, it does get more intriguing. The acting is solid throughout the movie and the acting is a big reason I really enjoy this movie. I just think that the storyline could have used more time and more characters explored more fully. This could have really been a good idea for the show! It's good enough to watch, but if more time would've been spent, I would have enjoyed it more.

But Jerry has his own problems, including his own crazy old lady, Ruth (Bonet), who gets very involved in his life.  Review: With a screenplay that has been adapted from a short story, and an almost-unrealistic premise, it was easy to see that it was just going to be a typical "family drama" that wouldn't even break a sweat. That is, until it actually started to get interesting and the cast was amazing, not to mention the direction was top-notch. This film also deserves special mention for the incredible cast of actors, each one of whom added a special layer to the story. Martin Starr is great as a good-looking, charismatic, "normal" guy who happens to be stuck in

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A film is an extension of its story, which may be more powerful than the story itself.  The first film is about the aftermath of the death of an old man.  a young man named John Connor is sent from Earth to save the planet and kill his past self.  This movie is really quite excellent.   There's so much more to it than just the action or the action sequences.  A very smart film that is not afraid to tell a dark story about a young kid who is going through a lot.  This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ (1) I will only review movies that I have seen and enjoyed. ____________________________________________________   The Movie:   I will give the movie a 2.5 star rating. I found the story to be interesting but did not really like the performances from all of the characters.   Plot:   "The Last Boy Scout" tells the story of Joe Smith (Dee Bradley Baker) who is a young Boy Scout and a reluctant leader. As a result of his father's (James Spader) death, Joe has been put in charge of the boy's cabin. During the winter of 1918, Joe and the boys must endure the horrors of trench warfare and the loss of their scouts. Joe is forced to sacrifice friendships with his own sons in the service of his scouts, while the Scouts' relationship with the other scouts is strained by the prospect of war.  , the plot was good but it was the acting of the lead actors that made this movie so entertaining. The story was pretty basic but the performances of the leads made it very enjoyable. Dee Bradley Baker had a great role in the movie, she really became the hero in the story. She was extremely brave and strong and she is a very good actor in her own right. In addition to Dee Bradley, the other lead actors in the cast were the wonderful Tony Cox, Stephen Tobolowsky, Mark Harmon, and Mark Wahlberg. I think all of these actors brought their A game to the movie and they all played their roles very well. Tony Cox was fantastic in this movie and he had the role of Joe's father well.   This movie is one of the best films of the year and I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. If you want to see a good war movie, then you have to see this movie. If your looking for a good action movie, I highly recommend "The Avengers", you can find this movie in the "Avengers" series.  , the movie is set in the winter season of 1918 and it is set during the war. The movie is loosely based on the book "The Boy Scouts" by Bill Bryson and it tells the true story of how a real Boy Scout became a war hero in World War One. There are a few differences with this movie because it was not written by Bill, it was written by Peter Berg and the producers of the movie chose to make the movie as close to the book as possible. I thought the movie

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ If you've read this far, thank you for your time. It took me a while to make the decision to continue posting to this website. There are more pressing things on my mind these days. This site has been a great source of entertainment, education, and fun for me. As you can imagine, this is no easy task. I've been told I'm crazy for wanting to put a disclaimer in a movie that I enjoyed, but it has to be done. This is my opinion and my opinion only. I try not to be overly critical of movies I've seen. It's much easier to tell an honest review of a good show than a bad one. I'm not saying I don't like the film or I don 't like the movie. If I had never seen a movie in the theater, I would not have had the opportunity to enjoy it. It was a privilege to see it. As a rule, if you enjoy a movie you should enjoy it even if it doesn't necessarily conform to what you expect of a movie. For a movie like this, I found it to be a great little movie. I enjoyed the film more than the actual book I was reading. It might be that I'm spoiled for a good story by my children who are older than I am. I guess I just really like good stories, and I like the ones I watch. This movie was a great way to spend a couple hours. It wasn't just a story, it was a story with a happy ending. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this movie for children because I'm sure it can be a bit hard on a teenager, but if you're looking for a fun little movie you can enjoy with your family or your favorite friends, you can do a lot worse than to check out the film The Princess Bride.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do not be vague about what you liked or didn't like about the movie. A good review is a complete sentence in the form of a question. In other words, it tells the reader how you feel about the film, and not just what you think of it. You don't have to be specific. For instance, in a bad review, you don't need to say, "My girlfriend did not like this movie." That's like trying to say how much I love the weather. It's irrelevant, and it's not helpful to the reader. It gives off the impression of not having really watched the movie, which is totally not the case. You can even just say, in the beginning of the review, "The movie was mediocre in all respects." This is helpful because it shows the writer had a taste for film before he or she started writing the review. Be specific about what did you like and not like about this film.  Don't be afraid to make the film worse: __________________ There's nothing wrong with a movie that is boring. As I said before, a good review should be short and punchy. A bad review is not only unhelpful, it's downright disrespectful to the movie's fans. You shouldn't have anything to say about a movie just because you didn't enjoy it. If you don- t like it, then say so, but don't make it worse than it has to be. And don't try to get away with it, either. You do not get to take it back when you write a bad movie review. The only way to correct a movie is to watch it. In a bad film review, it would be like someone saying that they didn't care for a good piece of music because they didn t like the lyrics. Don't try and argue that you didn t love the movie because it wasn t a good film, because then you're just lying.

You may also post a link to your own personal review of a movie, as long as it's not about your own movie.  This post will contain spoilers for:  X-Men: Days of Future Past  Rise of the Planet of the Apes  The Hunger Games  Fantastic Four  Thor: The Dark World  Pacific Rim  Iron Man 3  Batman v Superman  Avengers: Age of Ultron  Ant-Man  Captain America: The Winter Soldier  Guardians of the Galaxy  Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation  How the Avengers were killed in Captain America: Civil War  Spider-Man 3 . :  the movie is a total mess. There is no story in this film. The plot revolves around an orphan (Jared Leto) who is on the run from the government and the mutant team, the "Inhumans." After losing his powers, he's forced to join the team. The film then goes on to be a mess because the Inhumans are actually people who have been locked away for the last million years. You will be confused as to what the heck is going on when you get your head around the plot. This is why this film is the worst movie of all time. We are also given some other minor characters that are introduced throughout the course of the film. They're also given way too much screen time. They do their jobs in the story and get little to no screen time whatsoever. The other characters in the film also don't have anything of value to offer. One example of this is the character of Ulysses Klaue. Ulyss is a former member of the X-Men team, "The Exiles," that was trapped underground for all of these years. Klaude is forced to work for the government as an operative on the Inhuman team because his body is in no condition to be exposed to their powers. He doesn't do anything in this movie and is only there for screen time and because the film needs him. I can understand the film wanting a lot of character development, because there are a lot more characters introduced. This film tries to make the whole thing seem real and you're introduced to a lot in just ten minutes. I also understand that they

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I have to write a review for this movie because the movie is so good.  The director (Aiden Englund) wanted to go a bit lighter and the cast is so much better, it's almost not fair for me to write this.  The actors are the cast, the director and director are the director.  I don't want to give the audience a false sense of this being a bad movie.  Not at all.  It's a great movie with a wonderful cast.   I am in awe that the director made such a movie. I had to laugh a couple of times, but I have nothing but love for this. I was watching the movie about a week before the release and my family asked me what was the movie.   I explained it and my kids were so excited about it, they wanted to watch it.  They wanted to know if it was good or bad?   It was a good flick.  I think everyone should watch it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  - Write a negative review about any movie that you don't like:   If you really want to show someone the difference in opinions between you and a total stranger, go ahead and write a negative reviewer for the movie that they really liked.   They will be impressed by your lack of prejudice, and probably not realize what a huge hypocrite you really are.    - If someone is just plain offensive:    You can't win with the world in the palm of your hand.  If you're talking about the movie and they're just out and out ignorant, I recommend that you say something like "I have not seen the movie, so my opinion is worthless" or something like that.  I don't want to sound like an old man that hates to see his kids and grandkids go see movies, but please, be aware of your own limitations.   For example, even though you don.t like it, if someone is talking trash about your favorite movie and telling you that it's garbage, the next step would be to tell them that they are a moron and that you're only able to see that because you're fat.   I'm not saying don't give advice or don't tell them the truth, but try not to be a complete fool.     -    If you hate something and the people are really going at it, just give it up:   A friend of mine told me this once, and it's definitely something that I should probably think about.  Some people are not very nice people, and a lot of the time when someone is really rude, they're really trying to be rude, and they might be trying to get your attention.  For example:  If a person is yelling at you and the words are really getting to you, and you have some sort of a reaction, just drop it and be honest.  Like, "Hey, it's a hot day, I'm just kind of mad that you kept talking about how hot you are in the middle of this discussion.  Maybe we should take it out somewhere else?" or something to that effect.  You can always make it right later, but it might help the situation by just admitting that it really was a problem and not letting it continue.  And if you're not sure what to say, just say "I love you" if you want them to stop.   If they still keep going, just tell them

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ I don't know why this movie doesn't get more stars. If you can't say anything bad about a movie that is based on a book and you have read all of the books, then you probably don't like it either. And I guess the same thing goes for this movie: It's really not too bad, but its the details that are the real problem. At this point in time, there isn't anything wrong with this movie, but I would suggest that you really watch it a couple of times to see if you find the movies flaws. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with the characters or the movie, or the overall plot, or anything, I just think that there are some things in this movie that are really bothering me now that I'm over 10 years older than the movie. One of the main things that bothers me is that the movie never talks about why the boys are going to heaven and the demons that they'll face. Why are they going there? Why do they have to battle them? Why is there a god? Why are all of this things happening to them? The movie never asks these questions. So it becomes a very boring movie to watch. The main thing that I really don't get is why the demons were sent there to begin with, to begin their lives? The Bible states that Satan was created by God and that is where the idea that there is a god came from. I just don't understand how Satan was sent to hell to begin his life. I mean, who creates this guy? It really doesn't make any sense to me. The first thing that bothers you is the scene where Michael is about to do the deed of his life and he goes up against a demon called Lamech. Michael is supposed to take his soul and put it in the new world, but somehow, Lamec manages to sneak up on Michael and stab him through the neck. I don a think the movie had the perfect ending. I'm not one of those guys who like to see a happy ending, but the ending of this movie is very sad. I guess that Michael is dead because he didn't do enough to kill Lamek. The movie tries to make up for that by saying that Michael saved the world, and it just makes no sense. In a movie like this, is that really enough? When I see a movie and I'm just left wondering, is the movie trying to make a point? Is

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  Kaiju-movies: It's time to put an end to the human race. I can't be the only one who's worried.   (hide spoiler)] [ It's a really great movie that should be on everyone's list of all time favorites. It's about a special military group that is sent to investigate a meteor that has been on earth for a while and has become unstable. The team consists of a veteran, a young kid who is just learning about kaiju, a scientist who's working on developing a cure for the kaijus and an expert in psychology who's been researching the nature of kaijin. The movie does a fantastic job of integrating the different characters together so that the story flows naturally without too much exposition or confusing plot twists. The action is awesome and the fight scenes are incredible. The character relationships are deep and well done. I will never forget the first time I saw Kaiju-monsters on a late night television show and how it was such a great show. I had never seen anything like it. It wasn't very long, but it really made a lasting impression on me. It was a shame that I couldn't finish watching it on DVD. I want to see it again. It is a must-see for kai-juried fans. (hide spoiler)  So, I was watching it with a couple of friends at a friend's place. After I'd finished watching, I started thinking about it. I remembered that I'd watched this movie in my late teens and that I liked it very much. It reminded me of some of the great kaiji films of the 70's and 80's. I wanted to know if it would still hold up to the modern times. It did, and that's a major reason that it is recommended.I found this movie to be a great adventure movie that focuses on a group of soldiers that must go into space to find a cure to a mysterious virus that is ravaging the population on earth. In order to find this cure they must learn how to adapt to the environment around them, learn about the creatures of the sea and how to control their environment. The story revolves around two main characters who each have their own special abilities: a marine biologist, who specializes in learning about the ocean and marine life, and a medic, who is an expert on the psychological effects kai jus have on humans. It focuses a lot on

If I had to add something to it I would mention that this movie had no action scenes in the city, the city was a background. The movie "Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace" was a great movie and I recommend everyone to see it. I did not like the movie very much but I enjoyed it very much. So it's the best movie ever!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  "When I read your review about the film, The Prestige, I did a double take. You said the movie was 'great' with 'no problems'. You went on to say that it was "a good movie with no problems" which was clearly a sarcastic compliment to yourself."  That's right, in your own words. You were the one who told me the film was great, and all of a sudden you were complaining it had no problems. Wow!  I don't recall that, or I didn't realize it at the time, so I had to look for the quote in the article. Now that I look for it, it reads,  'The Prestige is a great movie with few problems, but the problem lies in what is, essentially, an entirely mediocre script. And what makes the problem worse is that the movie is such an expensive film that it's impossible to believe Warner Bros. couldn't have pulled together a few hundred million dollars in profit to put on this production. In fact, when I watched the movie, I had no problem with its script. But what makes it worse is when a film like this is made, its budget is taken off of the top to satisfy the film-makers' desire to make a 'fanservice' movie.'  Let's take a look at your actual words and context. First, you said, "You went on [to say that the film had 'no' problems. I assume you mean that the script was 'good', as it had been given high marks by others in the industry.] but when I saw the film I had [a 'problem' with the script, but that it had 'almost no problems']. But you never really explain why you think I had a problem, only that I had one."    So you are claiming that I said 'no problem' when I said the script had 'good' writing, but not when I pointed out the fact the script of the film would require about $500 million to make. That sounds like you were the first to point out the massive budget of the movie and then try to change the subject.  In the above sentence, you are comparing a $100m budget movie with one costing a fraction of that. That's not fair. If you're going to write a movie, why make it so expensive?  Now let's take another look at how you

When he is working at his best, you can feel his greatness." - Steven Spielberg

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ A+ Movie Review: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1678006/reviews __________________________  Hobbit - 2009-08-15 16:12:04 - No longer online - (1 year, 1 month ago)  This is a really good movie and well worth the watch. There is nothing spectacularly funny or well-done about it, but the characters are a nice combination of the real world (an elf, a dwarf) and fantasy (a woman warrior, a human woman who has lived in exile for a long time). It's a bit slow at times but I'm not sure it's because of it being made in 2001, or because it was a studio film. The writing is excellent and the actors are excellent. A must watch for anyone interested in Tolkien's work. Recommended! ________________________  A little different but an excellent movie: http:  http://www2.imax.com  Jurassic Park - 1999-12-02 13:57:03 - No further comments - (2 years, 4 months ago)
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This movie does not get a good review! In my opinion it's a boring, slow movie that doesn't need to be shown every 2 days or even every week. It is also overrated! It's like a movie from the 70's. I saw it because it was free and I thought it was ok. It's sad that you can't get good films now but a long time ago the world was full of great films like "The Godfather" and "The Untouchables". This is not an action film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If the critic gave it good, then I want to know that there was something about the movie that made me enjoy it.  It didn't have to be anything overly exciting, or even especially good. Â It just had to be good enough that I enjoyed it.   I don't think many critics get it right, because I've found that it is hard to tell what makes a movie good.   There is a very broad range of things that can make a movie great, and I think people get a bit lost in trying to figure out what makes the right movie, and what makes an average movie bad.    I don the movie in question and don't enjoy it, or I feel like I could have enjoyed it more.  When I talk to someone who isn't a movie critic, I often tell them to look at a lot of movies to get a feel for what makes good movies, or bad movies.    This is because movies are very different from any other genre of music or art.  It is hard for me to recommend a movie to someone without knowing it, without trying to describe the movie, or try to find reasons as to why I think the movie was bad.   When I am doing that, I tend to get frustrated with myself.  I think my job is to give people the information they need to make an informed decision about what they want to watch, but I am also trying to keep myself as objective as possible about the content.     So I asked this writer to describe his first viewing of the film.  He wrote:   It was a good, simple film with a good idea that seemed like a good story.  But the whole thing felt like a half-baked concept that had been slapped together to save the filmmakers money.  The story was kind of generic, the characters felt like they had no depth, and the acting was pretty meh.  So I saw this film, and it really didn't seem to be doing anything particularly interesting.  And I remember thinking about it a lot afterwards, and even going to the cinema with a friend once to watch the whole movie.   We saw the film at 2AM, so I think that's when it sunk in.   It made no sense to me what the film was trying to say, and frankly, I didn't really care.  Because I think most people don't really like the movie. It wasn't a very

This film is just about the best example of a classic action movie I have ever seen. It may not have the biggest stars, but it does feature some of the best action choreography, stuntwork and acting ever seen in a movie. It's not always about the violence, and while there's plenty of it, it's done in a way that's not overly graphic. The story is gripping and the characters are complex. The villains are complex, but never overbearing. This is just the perfect film. A great action flick that is filled with great performances and a great story.   The Score: 9/10  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  -2 rating How to Write a Positive Review (4/5) I have been playing around with this review for a while, so it is probably too long. I will write it down here for you and then you can use it as a template for your own review, but I would also recommend writing this section down, just so you know exactly what you are writing about. Good movies are hard to review and there is just so much good stuff happening in every movie. The things we do to make a good review seem like a great waste of time and energy to me. But I do have one rule that will hopefully make a difference. I am just going to say this here and now, and don't worry about editing it out later. When I say that a movie is good I am not saying that it is great. I'm not even saying it is bad. I just want to make the point that in my experience, the things that are wrong with a movie make it less than it could have been. So my one point here is that good movies have bad parts. I don't expect you to agree with me, but at least I hope you understand where I'm coming from. Okay, let's go over the different things I am talking about in this section. 1. The movie does not have an opening or closing credits 2. The song that is playing in the movie is not awesome 3. The character's names are terrible 4. The soundtrack is awful and/or the actors/actresses suck 5. The special effects are bad 6. The opening and closing themes are bad  7. The characters are boring  8. The plot is lame, dumb, pointless, or stupid (or all of the above) 9. The screenplay is awful 10. The director is an asshole I have given this one a bit of thought, and I do believe that all of these things are a big problem with a lot of movies. I think if you can think of all of them, you can also think of one more thing: I should write a positive movie review. In the above list I listed out a few things that a good or great movie should have in its opening and/and closing credits. That is not enough for a great movie. For a great film, the credits are usually the big thing that stands out. But sometimes they are not enough. For example, I want a really fun song

From a writer that worked on the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the new movie is called Ant-Man and will be released in July 2016. The movie centers around Scott Lang, a brilliant scientist whose former mentor, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), has gone missing. Scott assumes his mentor is the prime suspect, but Hank's disappearance and presumed death sends Scott on a dangerous, unprecedented mission. A veteran of seven Marvel Studios films, Ant- Man star Paul Rudd stars as Scott, a genius scientist whose ex-con father (Michael Pena) was turned into a miniature humanoid and has only one aim — to get back to his old life and help his son. Rudd is joined by Michael Douglas as Hank P. Scott Lang is played by Rudd in his first film role since

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ My name is Paul, and I just watched "The Dark Tower" (tentative title). _______________________________ I like a movie that is good but not that good. ______________________________ I liked this movie. ______________________ The Dark Tower is a film that is not about guns and not about the occult. ___________________________________________________ The film has been rated R (with some violence). _______________________________________ The story is set in the future. ____________ The main characters are Jake Chambers (played by Idris Elba) and Roland Deschain (played By Matthew McConaughey). ______________ It is hard to describe this film to someone who has not seen it, but it does have some action scenes and action scenes in general. _____________________________________________________________________________ The film does take a few liberties with a lot of the source material. _____  The film takes place in a much darker world than the book series, but I did not feel that it was lacking in any way.    The story follows Jake Chambers, a young man that has been sent back in time to kill the man who stole his mother's gun. Jake is the second to last member of the Gunslinger's crew.  The film begins with Jake and his father Roland (Idris Elabd) in a dark wood.  Roland tells Jake that the man is coming, and when he arrives he kills Roland's father in front of Jake and the boys.  Jake is in shock and is unsure of what to do.  The man then takes out his gun and shoots his son in the stomach and tells him that he has killed Roland. Jake wakes up with a strange wound in his belly and a piece of the gun in his hand. He then learns that he is a child in the 20th century and is told to find his father.  In the film, Jake is sent to Roland's grave where he meets the man.  I have seen the book the film is based on several times and this film did not really change that much of it, however, it did feel like it could have been done a little better.  After Roland's death, Jake tells the man that he did it because the gun that he stole was a good one.  He tells the old man that Roland is alive, and the man explains to Jake that Roland was killed a long time ago but when the Gunslingers come they find a gun that can defeat the man on horseback

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The Best Movie I've Ever Seen:  I've seen all three of Robert Altman's films, and I'd rate this one the best of them. I liked this one best, because it's not about a group of people. It's about one person who becomes an outsider and wants to fit in. So when it says "In a small Midwestern town, a young man sets out to change his life." it sounds very boring and predictable, and yet it does have a real heart to it. It is a movie about a man who doesn't understand his situation, and he's frustrated. The movie has a great ensemble cast of fine actors and a great script by Altman. This film is definitely worth a look, if only to see Altman and his beautiful scripts. The Worst Movie I Ever Saw:  _______________________________________ The best movie I've ever seen: ___________________ If I'd rated the movies on the basis of their script alone, I'd have had a lot higher rating. The films on this list have a better script than many good movies I've seen. The Best is one of the best stories in any genre, and that's just saying something. ______________________________________ This list was created to help my fellow nerds, noobs, and casuals who have seen the films above to learn something from them, and to help me to learn more from them. So, let's see what we got, shall we? _______________________________________________________ 1. The Long Goodbye  (1959) The Perfect Storm (1955) In A Lonely Place (1951) 2. The Player (2004) 3.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. Review the film with a balanced outlook that does not ignore the fact that the movie is a work of art or is a bad movie.  I believe that films, including films on Youtube, should not be judged by the mere fact that a lot of people are watching the film. I have watched a great many movies that I loved but did not agree with, yet the reviews were all one-sided and the reviews focused only on the negatives. This is why I believe that the purpose of reviews should not only include a critique of the film but also include a review of the reviewers perspective and whether they can articulate what they are reviewing about. I do not believe that a critic should only look at the negatives but that a reviewer should also look at each movie, take a step back, take the film apart and understand why it works and why it does not work. A good review does not contain one or the other and I would like to see better criticism. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________... "The Best of the Best" is an awesome collection of best of movies. I always look forward to it. I don't watch it all at once, but it usually comes on at around 5am. I'm sure most of you know the movie "The King's Speech" but most people I know who know about the movie haven't seen it. The movie is a classic and the story is very interesting. I had some friends who didn't like the movie but they have to see it for the movie. It was so well-done. I didn't mind the musical number in the movie, it's good. The story was good. If you're looking for something new and different in a comedy, it is worth the time to see the movie and this DVD. Don't be afraid to say you enjoyed the movie as it does make me smile to see what people say about it.  Review is based on a free movie ticket provided to Rovi by the filmmakers of "The Great Escape".   Review written by: Jason W. ... It was a pleasant surprise to be able to watch "The Greatest Escape of all time". It was well worth the watch. I did not know the story about the greatest escape of all-time until after I had watched the film. The DVD includes interviews with the actors, some other special features and it is in English. I would recommend this to fans of old movies, action, thrillers and sports. : This is a good film to watch on a Saturday afternoon. The first half hour of the film is pretty standard and the second half is very different. It is not overly violent, but a bit scary. I enjoyed the film as a whole. It does not take itself too seriously, and is a very enjoyable film.  a little bit of humor in there : I don\'t like the film very much, but I do like the humor in it. It has some fun moments, and the humor is a nice touch. It\'s like a little time travel joke, but there is a ton of humor too. It should not be for everyone though, but if you are into movies with humor it\'s pretty good.  the story : I liked the story, but the ending was a little disappointing to me. I think I enjoyed seeing some of the historical figures and that made me like the story more. The film could have been better, but this was good

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tell people to go and see it. If you don't, you're basically an asshole.  That said, this is one of the most widely seen horror movies around, so it's not like it's the kind of movie where people will be afraid to go.  The plot is simple.   It's the end of the world, but it's sort of a horror movie first and foremost, with a small bit of action thrown in for good measure.  It follows a group of friends in their teens and their relationship with each other.  The characters are well-written and the characters' relationships to each other are strong and believable.  In addition to that, it's a bit of a dark movie with plenty of gruesome imagery that will get under your skin and make you wonder how it could happen.  This is a movie that could easily be described as "horror porn."  So why is it such a popular movie?   You'd think that the fact that there's a big budget and a well-known actor would be enough to get people to the movie.  However, there are a few things that you need to watch out for if you want to see this movie. 1.  To give the film a rating:  In order to give it a rating, you can take the "score" given on IMDB and add an additional "rating" to it.  For example, if it scored an "8," then you would add an "S" to the "8" to give the movie a rating of "S".   2.  If you're watching this movie with someone, make sure they don't know what's coming.  You don't want to accidentally have someone come in at the end to find that they've witnessed the movie, while you watched it in horror mode.  Make sure that you play the movie with sound and with subtitles if you can.  3.  Before you watch this movie, make it a habit to go see some other horror movies.  There are so many movies out there that are just as good, if not better than this one.  While this movie is rated "G", it's still a horror film, so watch some of those other horror films and see how they compare.  4.  Don't just watch the trailer.  Just like the title says, don't just see the movie in the trailer alone.  Watch the trailer again
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Posted by Chris K on June 29th, 2014 at 07:24 AM (uL3) 0 Comments Hello and Welcome to my first blog, which I will be writing about my favorite movie  The Matrix. I've watched this movie several times, but I never felt comfortable writing about it. I always feel that it's a movie that I've seen many times and the more time I spend watching it the more it gets on my nerves. I've watched it more than once since I've started blogging, but never had an idea of why I disliked the movie. I've never had any negative emotions about the movie, even after all these years. There are a lot of things that I don't like in this movie, but after a while you realize that these are the things that make a movie a good or a bad movie. For example, the main problem of the movie is that the plot is boring. I hate boring movie plots, and Matrix is very boring. The movie starts out with Neo in a computer, running an underground resistance against the machines. The resistance is all about hacking the machines to get back control over the world, but the machines are more than capable of stopping them. In the end Neo is not able to get the machines out of the matrix, but is able to create a new reality in which he lives peacefully and happily. It all looks very good until the ending. The Matrix is not good because it's the most boring movie ever made. It's really the reason why The Matrix was banned from theaters all around the world for so many years. The reason for that is because it starts out like a good story. The beginning of the Matrix is good because we see the world as it is, the only difference that it has is that there is a resistance that fights against the machine and the machines can be stopped. Then the movie starts getting boring and repetitive, but then comes the ending, which is also the point when Neo's dream finally comes true. This movie is so much about a character called Morpheus, that you'd think that this guy is the hero. He's the one who helps us to save our souls from the machine, that's why he is the main character of this movie. However, Neo never really understands Morpheus. Neo believes that he's his friend, but that is not true. I also think that Neo is the one with the problem of Morpheus who believes that Neo will save
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. Write a negative review about the worst movie ever made: _________________. If the review is about a movie you've never seen or are not familiar with (and you have not seen it), then mention it and explain why you haven't seen it and how you will be watching it the next time you watch a movie, or if it's your first time watching a movie this is a good place to say "I was skeptical to start with but the better I got at the movie the more I thought it was amazing." It also can be helpful to give a description of the film and its genre, if this is the first time you've seen it or it's a movie that you've already seen but you have trouble describing it.  For a general discussion of a film and a discussion about the meaning of the title, try to include the following items:  Movie title - The title of the movie is often the most important aspect of the review. The most important thing to say is that this is not a book review so it is best not to overthink it too much. Give a brief description of what the movie involves, the genre and your feelings about it. Also talk about the plot and the performances, if you've heard the movie or have seen it, tell us if it had any surprises. If you've read the book or watched the movie and found something that you did not expect, comment on it or if you find something interesting you should mention that. This is something that is generally appreciated and you want to make the movie more enjoyable by sharing your opinion about it instead of focusing on the flaws in the movie. , for example: "This is probably my favorite movie of all time, but in my opinion it falls short in the character department. The acting is very good, but I felt that the supporting cast were more important."  Plot synopsis, for movies with a long plot like these: If possible include a synopsis of the plot from the movie if it was not written by the movie itself or the DVD's blurb. This way, the readers can decide if they think it is interesting and if they should watch the movie just because it has a long story.

You don't feel this tension as much as you do in a war movie. In all the excitement of the battle sequences, there's a sense that it's too soon to be on the front lines. This movie isn't that. The soldiers are ready to fight. It's just the other side, the terrorists, that they're afraid of. If you've ever seen a real war, you know there's tension and danger all along the battlefield." - Jeff
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  A couple of years ago, my brother and I went to see "The Departed" at the cinema. We both enjoyed it and I think it was a pretty good film. My sister hated it, however. Her reasoning was that we were old enough to see the film without her, but she was "too young" to see it in its original theatrical form. Her argument was that she didn't like how the film made her feel, and I have no idea why, but in the end, I'm not surprised that she did.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ It's been over a year since I saw this movie, and I still love it! A wonderful film about the love and the pain of being in love, and dealing with it all while making it work.  I haven't heard of this film yet but I loved it. I'm pretty sure it's based on a real life story, but I can't find a copy or a link. .    In the last few days I was on the run from my mother and aunt for three weeks while I went to get a passport. When we got to Germany she was really upset with me and the passport. I guess she felt bad about taking me on the trip, and she felt that I didn't need a passport at all. She kept calling me in the middle of the night, saying she was coming to get me, and that I was a mess and needed to be "re-educated." I didn.t know what she meant, but the fact that she was calling meant it was bad news.   As my mother was walking around the city I ran into her while she was sitting at a cafe. She got mad when she saw me and asked why I was there, and why I couldn't just go home and rest. She then tried to convince me that I needed a passport because it would make my life easier, and make her life easier.  - She was a total bitch.  for a few days after this, I didn,t speak to my mother or my aunt at all, because they would call and berate me, call me names and insult me. I was scared.  ,  In a way, it was easier for me to deal with this situation because my parents have always been really close. In my old world, my dad was the one who was the disciplinarian and my mom was the breadwinner. This made me realize that no matter how you look at it, your parents are still the people that care for you, and need to be there for you. It's their job, and you have to live with that. I realized that my parents didn't have a right to call me out of the blue and try to make me feel guilty about my life, because that's what they were doing in my old life. It was much easier for my parents to let me do what I wanted. When my mom found out I was going to Germany, she was furious with me.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  ______________________________________________  How many good movies are there? We could count them up and write a whole book, but we'll stop for the moment. The answer to that is "It depends". A good movie might have an impact of only a handful of people. An interesting movie may have a much larger effect. We are not the ones who decide whether a movie is good or bad, we are just the one who decides whether it is entertaining and enjoyable. In a lot of cases, a movie will have some impact, but only in the sense that we have learned something from it and a lot more will be learnt in the future. In other cases, it might have zero impact.  There is no formula for how much impact a movie has. If you decide to spend $100 on a movie ticket, you are not telling us how much of a hit the movie will be. We don't know how the audience will respond. We have no information about the movie, or how many people will see it, or which type of audience is going to watch it. We know nothing.  the movie could go down as one of those movies that was a big hit because of its quality but it still failed to make it a hit movie. the movie might go down because it was boring and not entertaining, but it did not fail to make the audience go "why didn't we like it?". it might go up because people hated the ending but it got a decent critical score.  that is, we have no idea what will be the impact of the movie. So, to make your opinion count, you need to use your own experience, judgment, and knowledge of the subject. If the movie you are thinking of watching has some negative impact on you, then don't watch it, you will be wasting your time. There is no point in going to a movie unless it seems like a good idea. The movie will either make you laugh or cry. If it makes you laugh, you might want to keep watching it. If its sad or depressing, then you can just say no. You don't want to waste your money. If a movie can make you think or get into a different zone, then go ahead and watch it and enjoy it. ,  ,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love it when it goes against the grain of what is expected.  Mostly, I love seeing films that are unique and don't seem like the norm to see.       Here are just a few I feel are very unique and stand out from the rest of the pack: The Last Airbender  - One of the most unique shows on TV right now.  The Hobbit  (with the new Hobbit movie coming out in just a couple of weeks) The Legend of Korra  The Last Song   (I love the way the show was handled.   No pre-planning or pre-credits story, just throw all of the characters into a massive ensemble show with just one director.    I really wish they had filmed some scenes in post.  ) Tucker and Dale vs Evil  When you are on the same network, which has some amazing shows, like Castle and 24, you don't get to see the odd ones too often.  Some people don't even know about some of them.  I've been trying to catch up on the entire library for a while now.   There's so many great shows that are currently airing on FOX and I have yet to see it all.   The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is my personal fave right now but I am also really excited about The Revenant!  This post was written a few weeks ago.  Today I finally saw the film and I could not stop watching it.  For those that don't know, The Hobbit  is a long epic fantasy series that spans the history of the dwarves, elves, humans, and orcs.   I am not a huge fantasy fan.   But when I saw the trailer for the Hobbit  I was hooked immediately.  When you see the trailer, you just can't help but wonder where these characters will go next.  It's a big part of the series' appeal, you know that there is a huge world out there to explore and be a part of.  And that's a good thing.  The trailer for The Hobbit is pretty epic, from the opening sequence all the way to the end.  Every shot and every line of dialogue is so well done that the whole thing just looks beautiful.   And I am so happy to see that the actors (I'm not a big fan of the lead role) were able to deliver the lines so well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "That's my favorite new movie, I'm going to watch that all the time!" You get that right...and I'm sure a lot of you do it. That's fine, but how do you explain it to your partner when you see it for the first time? I get that many times, and for me it often comes down to this one thing: "Did it make you laugh or cry?" If they laughed, it means it was funny. If they cried, it meant that the story was moving or deep or even scary. It's a very simple concept, but one that's a lot harder to explain to your guy than it is to your girl.  How do I tell him about it? It's hard. I can't stand lying to him, so I tell the truth from the heart. I explain to him the scene we watched, why we felt it was good and then I tell them my honest thoughts. If the emotion they get is laughter, I go into the humor and sometimes I'll go into a deeper thought. Sometimes they don't laugh at all or cry or both, but if they do, I can always make them feel it. If we go into deeper thought, I ask them about what they think the movie might be about and maybe I'll tell them how the movie made me feel when I was watching it. I'll even make them watch it for me and we'll discuss our thoughts about it together.  This kind of relationship isn't one where we go off in different directions. We talk about it, we talk about our thoughts and we talk through the movies.  It's actually more fun for both of us because we're constantly discussing the movie and the feelings we felt as we watched. "Oh, my God. It made me so sad..." We don't watch a movie just to laugh or to cry, but sometimes they will make us feel a certain way or make us laugh. Sometimes it's a simple thing that you might notice or I might think, "Oh my God, that guy said that to me" and we may notice that in the movie. That happens, but then when it happens to us it's also an incredible feeling. It feels like a dream. This is probably the most important thing to me when it comes to communicating. I try to be honest, funny and caring. The more honest I am with myself and with others, the more I can get others to be the way they

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________  Why I picked it: The plot is about the birth of a new religion that is supposed to be more open minded. The characters are all about finding their own way. The story isn't too complicated, and I didn't find it boring at all. I think this is a great movie to watch if you have the chance to see it on a large screen. Also, the soundtrack is a wonderful piece of music.  What didn't work for me: The acting was all over the place, and it's a real shame that I had to see this for a second time to find out what I thought of it.  "What a great concept. I wonder what happens after we're converted?"  "The movie does have a lot going on that's not apparent at the start but which make more sense as the film progresses. It's a fun film to watch."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  - It is easy for a movie to be a bad film if the actors do not understand the script, or if the director doesn't understand his script.   I always try to find out what the directors of the movies that I like watch, and if they have done a film that they are proud of. - Be nice to everyone.   Even if you think that you don't want to talk to them, be nice to them and if you want to ask them to help you write a script, tell them about it and tell them how much you love to read it. This will help you to find great script-writers.  As the last paragraph says, you do not have to learn everything to become a script writer.  The most important thing is to be honest about your writing skills and make yourself heard.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________  _______________________________________________________________  1. 'Taken' – 7/9.  If there was one film that could best be described as an American remake of 'Alien', it would be 'Takers'. In that case, the remake would be a true re-envisioning, not a simple copy-and-paste job. The 'Alien' sequel that could have been is not here. But 'Taker' does what 'Alien': It takes a well-worn concept (the human sacrifice) and makes it fresh and unique in the way that only action film can. The film also uses the alien-ness of the story to give the audience a more complex understanding of the human characters. As a movie, 'Tak' is just plain fun, filled with thrills and chills. And it's got some of the best action set-pieces I've ever seen. If you can stand the film's very strong and bloody action sequences, you'll enjoy it. It's easy to see that the film is about two young American girls (Katherine Waterston and Olivia Cooke) that are both victims of a terrible cult. The cult is led by a man called Charles (Kiefer Sutherland), who wants them to help him make a sacrifice in the form of his young daughter. Charles, however, is secretly working with a powerful evil organization that is using his daughter to sacrifice others for the purposes of its own sick agenda. The plot is pretty simple, yet manages to keep you invested as the girls struggle to survive the dangers they face. The writing is great, as it manages to make you sympathize with the girls and understand their motivations in a way that you wouldn't usually get in movies, as they constantly explain to us exactly what's going on. And in terms of character development, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' did not disappoint. The characters are well defined and you really get to know them, even when they're under extreme duress and forced to go through a number of very uncomfortable situations. One example is the 'Tatoo' (played by Dakota Fanning), a young girl who is caught between the life she knows and the life that her father wants her to live. And then there's Anna (Lupita Nyong'o), who has her life put in jeopardy when she finds out that her mother is a victim of Charles' cult. 'The Takers' also manages to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If the movie is good, and you find it entertaining and entertaining, do it here.  If it is bad, or doesn't fit the style of what you normally enjoy, don't tell me about it.  This one is so obviously bad that I don't want to waste your time. I will not even bother trying to make a good film, I'm just going to post about how bad it is. I'll tell you what's bad, but you will not be able to tell from my post if you have a problem with it. Let me know if you want to talk about the movie, I'll wait. I'm a bit biased because this was my favorite film of all time. It is my favorite movie and all I have to say about it is, "It's so good, it was the best thing that ever happened to me." However, the reason I didn't give it a better rating is because of a scene that I didn�t like and because the ending made me feel cheated and I didn;t like it. So you�ll have to judge for yourself. If you are on Tumblr you can go see if the scene is still up (because I took it down) and here is the trailer And for those who hate spoilers (which I'm not), here is a video from the first movie that I watched. This movie is similar to that one in that they are both terrible (and they have the same director). Here is a link to my other reviews: Here are my favorites. I am only listing my favorites, not my all time favorites. The Princess Bride The Terminator I guess I will end this entry on the same note that I started with my first entry. You get what you pay for, and the first film in the trilogy is definitely the worst. If you want a good flick, check out a film that is more like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, like the Hobbit. I have never heard of a movie called "Harry Potter" that I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed The Princess Bride.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ This is one of my favorite movies ever and the director, Richard Donner, did a fine job with this film. I think it's an excellent film, but I don't think I would have seen it as a kid. It had some pretty tough language and there were some pretty shocking scenes that might make some adults squeamish, but they were necessary for the story to get across. And I really enjoyed the film's soundtrack which is still amazing to this day and the music by John Williams. If you love horror, this is a must see. It has a lot of thrills, but doesn't take itself too seriously and is worth seeing. I give this movie a 10/10. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) A strange man named Freddy Krueger appears in the town of Derry, Texas, and begins terrorizing young women with chainsaws. Soon enough, all of the town's women and children disappear and the police and media are unable to find the killer. It soon becomes clear that something far more evil than the normal killer is behind it. With a cast of memorable young actors including James Caan, Robert Englund, and Carrie Nix, the movie is one that will stick with you for a long time. You just can't beat that soundtrack. This movie came out when I was about 8 or so, and I loved it. I'm not sure why I had to see it again now that I have a much stronger appreciation for horror. There are some fairly graphic scenes, but the acting, story, and special effects are great. It's just that the film itself is a bit off putting at times. There were a lot more gruesome scenes that were done in a much more realistic way. I was so young back then that I thought these were all really scary scenes and even though they weren't, I enjoyed them. The film is a good slasher movie, and it's hard to forget those gruesome scenes. This movie is definitely a good film and I recommend it. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Horror Picture and I think that's pretty impressive considering that it came out in 1974. I recommend the soundtrack too. It is still very good and I would recommend watching this movie with it if you want to see a good horror movie. If not, then this is still a good one to see and it should be in the top 10. I've seen this movie so many times and

This is a huge topic so I'm going to try to make it brief. I've heard of people doing blogs that go over a period of time and focus on a certain movie and their experience in it. There are so many different ways that people do this. Some people do it more "mainstream" and talk about the movie, but not as much about its cast and director. Some do it by talking about their favourite movies and their favorite actors. Some talk about what they want to see more of next and where they want it to go. Some don't even talk about a particular movie, just about the experience of watching it. Myself, I like to be as "original" as possible, I never go over my thoughts on movies much. I only want to talk about my own experiences, my own reactions, and my own thoughts, on the movies I watch. So I'll only have a handful of posts on a lot of different movies, most of which are my own. The only way that I'll be able to do that is to actually post a lot. I want to have a blog that is very unique. I don't want to be a cookie cutter. I like different directors and I want different casts and I think that's pretty important for a blog. I'm trying to avoid as much generic posts, where people share the same thoughts on the same movie over and over again. I'll have a list of posts over time, just like on IMDB. There will be a lot more posts that I've never even thought about writing before. I might even start to have some articles that I wrote that I'm happy that people were interested in and wanted to read the original version. I really don't know yet if I'll do it this way or not. I just figured that I'd write a post that's kind of vague about what I'm thinking on a particular subject. It's not as detailed as I could be but it's just a general overview of what I would like to do. Anyway, that's all I've got for now. Have a good weekend.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ (the title of a movie).  This was a simple assignment that I didn't know at the time that it would become a full-time passion. I took a course in Film History and loved the class, so I decided to go to the first film school I could find. I went to UC Berkeley and they told me that it was a tough class to get into, because the people there didn't want to teach students that had a short film, and I was that. But I decided that was a great way to make a film and that there was no point in complaining. I didn?t have to write a script or anything like that. So I was lucky to go into film school, because it seemed that the directors that were at UC Berkeley were making better films than the ones in Hollywood, so that was my goal. I was also lucky to get to meet with John Landis and Sam Raimi and learn about their methods.  What are you most proud of?  I was very happy with the reaction my film had at the Sundance Film Festival. We were invited to come out and film some scenes for a future documentary. I made a short version of that that I released on YouTube and it had hundreds of thousands of views in the first two weeks. That was a huge bonus because I had no idea it would get that big.  to be continued
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________.  What's your least favorite movie:  A good movie that has some flaws: _______.  I like to find an enjoyable movie that is funny, emotional and entertaining. 2) Do you have any favorite films?  Yes. I also like sci-fi films and action flicks.  the best movie is: _____  2.5) Do any of your favorite directors deserve a nomination?    It's a hard question. My first reaction is, I don't know.  and there is no question that there are great filmmakers who have worked on the Oscar's. , I always try to think what are their greatest accomplishments? What makes them special?  of the many directors I respect, one thing about Francis Ford Coppola is that I think he deserves a nomination for "The Godfather"  In a way, this question can be answered in two ways. 's best movie has nothing to do with the fact that it's a documentary. It's just one of the most well-made, thought-provoking, and emotionally affecting movies ever made  His films "A Beautiful Mind" and "The Conversation" are movies I think are just as good as "A History of Violence" but they are also more complex. . This is a tough question for me as I feel like "The Revenant" has some amazing moments.  of course there are other people who have amazing films that are difficult for me to choose because they are movies that I don' have too many favorite parts of. : My favorite movie is "Jurassic Park" by Steven Spielberg. As you know, I am a huge fan of Spielberg's movies and the director is one of my favorite filmmakers. The movie is just beautifully done with the action and the story. "Jurrassic Park": ________  3) Which of the nominees do you think deserved an Oscar? (Not the actor's names)  I think the films that deserve an Oscar are " The Big Short " " Boyhood " " The Revenant " and "Steve Jobs" , "The Big Short" and "Boyhood" In all fairness, "Steve" is an amazing movie. But I don 't think that "Boy" or "The Dreamers" are Oscar-worthy in terms of storytelling or performances. BEST ACTOR: WINSTON CHUR
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If I enjoyed a movie that I liked, it meant I really enjoyed the movie and I was a fan of the movie in that way, so it was more of an enjoyment. I wouldn't necessarily expect to be on the edge of my seat when I saw a movie, though; movies are just more fun when you're enjoying them as a fan. Write a negative review about the worst movie I saw:    The worst movies that I saw were those that I watched when I was younger. That's because I felt like the movie was just a bad movie, and I didn't realize it. I thought that the bad movies were the ones where you could tell a lot of time and effort went into making them. I wrote a bad review about watching a shitty movie that was made in 2006, which I actually watched in 2007. My writing skills sucked that year, so I had to rely a lot on memory and not too much on the actual words that I wrote. But even then, I didn I got really upset when I realized that I had watched this movie, so a lot has happened since then. It has now been about 7 years since this movie was made and it is the worst thing I have seen since the trailer for that movie. It doesn't have any redeeming qualities. The story is stupid and the characters are stupid. The worst part is that the director, Michael Dougherty, did the worst possible thing by making this movie. He tried to make a movie and failed to come up with a good one, and then he tried to turn a bad thing into a good thing, but he failed to do so in any way that was recognizable to anyone who was watching. I can't even give it a 2 star. I've only seen the trailer to it, and even I know that he was making a shitty trailer, so this movie really doesn't give me any hope for him. I am completely disgusted with this movie and its director. My Rating:     1/5 I think that I know why this movie wasn't any good. A lot of people who have seen the movie didn't know that this was a bad film. What are your thoughts on this movie?

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ Why would I write a bad review about something I enjoyed? I didn't think I'd get a chance to have that opportunity again, after this first review and all. __________ My expectations for this were pretty low. My first thought was that maybe the movie had some flaws, but that was quickly dismissed. It was like we'd finally got a movie that had the talent to get a good rating, because it had a pretty good script. Maybe it's just because I like old science fiction movies and I'm tired of getting sucked into the new crap. __________________ It has been about a year since I last watched this film, so my memory of it was pretty bad. I have some vague memories from watching it back in college when I was an older student. This is probably because the movie was pretty hard to get into, and I didn`t really want to. If I were going to watch a movie today, it would be more of a classic sci-fi adventure than this film. As of now, I`m still trying to remember what I thought about the story, because I just don't remember it well. It had something about a "dinosaur in disguise" (who? I have no idea), the main character and his family that were just plain strange, and even the movie`s opening was a bit odd. The only way I remember the story was by how it started, and that seemed like a good way to start a movie. The movie had a lot of potential, and it was a nice surprise that the movie actually turned out that good. I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie also had some very interesting elements, which were all wrapped up in this mystery and the main plot. The story had a great twist and ending, and was one of those rare films that I really enjoyed. I guess I don't really have much to say about it, but I still think it was worth watching for the entertainment value alone, and as a sort of "mystery movie".

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________  10. The Exorcist – Directed by William Friedkin, 1981 (Directed by Francis Ford Coppola)  The Exorcism of Emily Rose, directed by William Shatner and directed by Michael Ondaatje, directed David Cronenberg, based on the novel by William Peter Blatty, was a masterpiece of horror that took cinema in a new direction. In this film the entire human race is turned into a swarm of screaming demons and a demon-filled church is left abandoned by the demonic forces. The only survivor is the daughter of a priest who is possessed by the demon and tries to exorcise the spirits while she struggles with her own life on the run. The original film, directed and scripted by William J. Donovan, was made to appease the Catholic Church but was never officially released to the general public until 1991. The story and plot of The Existens is much different than the original novel but in a perfect mixture of horror and thriller with a great cast and excellent production.  9. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 – Directedly Directed By John A. Hall, 1986 (Directly Produced By Richard Matheson and Tobe Hooper)  a.k.a. the Texas Chainsaws Massacre 3D – Directly Directed and Produced by John A Hall, Directed And Produced Directly by Richard Mathews, Directly Co-Directed and Directed Directly By TobeHooper, Directing And Directing Directly Producing by David Fincher. It was a remake of the first movie and it was actually more successful, but it is a perfect blend of the two most successful horror movie of all time, Texas Chainsawed Massacre and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. A film that has been called one of the greatest horror movies ever made. It is a sequel to the original, it is about the new killer who starts killing people at the camp and it is the most violent film ever made that is scary. It has a very different tone than the first film but it still works as a true horror movie.  in order to find all the Texas chainsaw Massacre 3DM info check out our Texas Chainsash Massacre 3DOLLAR MOVIE INDEX.  and we hope you enjoyed the list.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________  A movie you've already seen. It's the worst way to get your movie on a film festival screen.  How to get a good review:  - Don't give a terrible review about what you think the movie was about. . The movie should not be about something. You should be the critic!  It's better to write a review about the film you saw. You won't have to explain to anyone why you disliked the movie. And then everyone will know how much you don't care for it.  with a few notes:  and then everyone  This is how I get good reviews for my movie: I'll call my editor and give him or her my notes on the movie I'm going to screen. I'll write a short paragraph or two about what I thought about the movie, and I will also call my film festival screening coordinator and ask him to call my director's agent and find out if they're available to talk about the script, the film, or if the director would be interested in sitting down with me. "You've got to call the festival in advance!"  "It takes a day! I'll be able to work that week!"  a movie theater director  If you can't afford a phone call to your director, you can write the script by hand, which is cheaper, but it can get a little rough and it's really hard to get an editor to approve it. Also, you need to find a good screenwriter to work with you who can get the movie picked up at your festival screening. You're going to pay $10 to sit in the theater and watch it. And you can get as many as you want, but there are only about ten movies every year that are picked up for festivals, and if you show up with a movie that's really rough, it's going to be a hard sell for festivals. So get a screenwriter that has a good track record of getting films in theaters. Then you can buy a festival screening pass for $150 and then you'll get to sit through a screening with a $150 movie. But of course you also don't want to spend $300 on a screening pass. If you're planning on driving down to New York to see your movie, you want to buy a plane ticket. And even if you're not planning on flying, you may want to think about how to get the ticket for under $100.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  This is a post to show how great our community can be, and to show you a little bit of what that means. I wanted to start by asking a question: Are you an aspiring screenwriter? Maybe you're not, maybe you've been working in Hollywood for years and you just want to take your writing to the next level, or maybe you just have a big idea you're working on and are trying to make it come to life. Either way, you're interested in writing for movies or TV. Whatever the reason for you being here, welcome.  In this post, I'm going to outline the differences between a script, a spec, a complete screenplay and a script-to-TV/movie-producer project. The goal is to help you determine how you might approach your own script and/or spec project, whether that's a TV pilot, a movie, or an entire TV show. .  in a few days, a few weeks, or a few months, we'll have more posts that focus on those types of projects, but for now, I want to focus on how to become a screenwriter and/ or film-producers. I know there are plenty of resources for writers online, but here are some resources to consider:  . Scriptwriting Bootcamps: I'm a huge fan of The ScreenCraft program, as it has taught me to write. They have some great free resources for screenwriters, like "How to Write a Screenplay" by Aaron Sorkin. "The Story of a Screenwriter" is an hour long video of various stories, and a short list of scripts in each. There are also a lot of scripts to watch online, like my personal favorite, "A Very Special Episode" by Steven Soderbergh.  as well, The Screenwriting Bootcamp has a ton of resources, from screenplays, to screenwriting classes, to workshops. You can even get a copy of a script. The curriculum is available for free online, and if you're serious about becoming a screenwriting writer, I would recommend taking the classes.  I can't recommend The Screencraft enough. They're the best, and I've never been to one.  the rest of the post will be focusing on the differences, but I want it to be fun, so here's a bunch of links: , if you have a script and need help, don't forget that there

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ Do you have any tips for getting the most out of a video game: ______________ What you should do when the credits roll: _________________________________________________________________________  Video Game FAQ  A game FAQ (frequently asked questions) about the video games, based on the general structure of a FAQ in a blog.  The FAQ was last updated: August, 2007.  is a video games FAQ (usually abbreviated as a FAQ) that focuses on answering questions about the games. It will cover a general scope of the topic, but will not be an exhaustive description of the game's features. It also does not cover everything that an average gamer might want to know about the game, and does not answer every question asked about the entire game. The FAQ is intended to be used as a reference, rather than as a primary source of information. In other words, while I believe that most gamers can make the most of it, there are some topics that I have covered and are not covered in this FAQ that I may want to revisit in the future. There will be occasional new topics added, as they become necessary. The primary focus of this FAQ is the game Call of Duty. It is intended as a simple overview for casual gamers.The FAQ focuses on Call of duty games from the earliest titles until the latest titles (for example, it focuses on MW2, Modern Warfare 2, Modern warfare 2: Campaign and Modern Warfare 3). There will also be general FAQs covering games such as Halo and other video games that are unrelated to Call of d duty games.The majority of the FAQ is presented in the form of a text file (or, in one of the two sections that has links, in the link window itself). However, there is a table of contents at the end of each section, and the text files and links all have a table and the table will automatically open for you. Each section has a few pages for each section that provide more information for a specific video game. If you're looking for an in-depth guide to a video (or two or three) of a game, I highly recommend the video guide series The video guide to Call Of Duty will cover most of the major games in the Call of Duty series in the easiest to follow video series I've ever seen.The most important thing to keep in mind about the FAQs is that I did my best to include the full text of every game description and game tips in each game FAQ

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  Write a negative review about the same movie: I don't want to have to do that. That's a lot of work.  Why? I guess I'm not a big-time critic, but I try. It's not very often that I'm impressed by a film, and if I am, I usually just think the movie sucked. There are times I'm really impressed by something. It may be a film's visuals, its acting, its music. I don a film for its story, and I can't do that with every movie I see. I usually prefer to watch a movie once, and then write my opinion after. It makes me feel better.  in some ways, film criticism is almost like art, and my view on it may be different from others. I can learn a lot about a film by seeing it again. But I can also learn a great deal from an article I read, and there are some excellent articles about movies out there, especially on the Internet, that I can apply to a movie. In that sense, film theory and film criticism can be pretty much the same thing. If I see something that's not good, I'm less likely to be impressed by it. I need to see it again to see why it's not that great, if I can.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   We know that people think positive reviews help the movie stand out. We've found that the reverse is true.

Did you like it? Tell me your thoughts! Let me know what you thought about this review so far and be sure to share it with your friends. Remember to leave your comment about this post and share your experience with the movie. Let's keep this movie in the limelight!  "The Shining" is not for everybody. I am no exception. I was really impressed with the film at the box office last weekend. It is a very creepy movie with a very tense ending. I would not want to see this movie by the end of the day, but if you can watch this movie for a few minutes at night, I think you will find it to be very disturbing.  Here are my 5 reasons why you should watch this horrible movie.  to get to know the main characters: Jack Torrance and Wendy, the daughter of the hotel manager and her son Danny. They are both really annoying, but the more they try to kill each other the more sympathetic they become. They have a lot of conflict in their relationship. Jack Torrence is a broken man, scared to leave the hotel, but Wendy is the one who can help him. The story progresses because of them and because of their relationship with one another. You can feel it in the scene when Wendy goes to check in with Jack Torrent's room and he is not there. He must have been taken back to the room he shared with his brother. She is convinced that her brother was taken away. There are many other characters you don't know. I think there are over a thousand people in this hotel. . Jack is not the only crazy character in the story. There is the hotel owner and there is a lot more.  a haunted house with many ghosts, demons and spirits. a really tense ending that is really scary. A lot of people think that the movie will make you feel sad, but they are wrong. On the contrary. This movie will give you many feelings and I can't explain how they worked. You will see some scenes where you feel like you are in a nightmare. And, that is one of the reasons that this movie is such a great movie. It's a nightmare and it's one of many scary scenes in this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  Crimson Peak review: The true star of the film and one of the best things about it is that David the Man is no longer a person and is now a demonic entity. The best part about this character is that while David is still evil he can still be portrayed as a character that is not completely evil. Even though this character could be considered evil at times it is only because David is not human anymore. The fact that this character can be portrayed in such a good way is so much more than just a nice twist but a good example of how great acting in a horror film can be. David the character is so well written that it is hard to find anything bad about him, he is one of your favorite villains of the year and can be easily recognized by the fans of the book it is based on, however when you think about it this isn't really a horror movie at all. This is a psychological thriller. I really enjoyed watching this movie for the whole two hours and I honestly did not realize that I was watching a horror thriller until it was almost over and then I was all ready to throw up. If you enjoy psychological thrillers you will enjoy this one as much as I did, it is a very well made film with great acting and great visuals.

(2/5)  The documentary looks at a man that has a lot of respect for both his father and brother, and is a lot more than just a musical artist. : a film that focuses on the music of a popular and controversial singer and musician, Neil Young  My Rating: _______________________  (4/5 stars)  the only music documentary I saw.  a documentary that focuses mainly on Neil Young's life and accomplishments, but also examines his son's early life  I'd really appreciated if a bit more context was given about his family, which I can only assume is a point of contention with some people. Neil Young has a long history of being an activist and a voice against racism in America  the film explores his life and work with great passion and great insight. the film focuses primarily on his father, his band The Band, and his brother Duane. and includes an introduction and interview with Duane Young about his brother and his life.  of course, the music  Overall, this documentary is not a great film, but it does the job. It tells the story of a father and his son and it makes the point clear that Neil Young did not always view his son in the best light, but that he was one of the greatest musicians of the 20th Century, and it's not just that. Neil's dad, his brother, Duane, and Neil Young all have their own unique stories.  the film's opening segment is excellent  my rating: _______________________________ .

"I'm not going to say anything bad about the team," she wrote, "But I can't really stand the Panthers."   While many people thought the review was funny and thought the Panthers should have posted the comment, the author said it made her realize that her opinion of the team, which she has shared on Facebook, is far from being the norm.   bemoaning the team's poor reputation on Facebook has long been a popular form of social media commentary.   "The Panthers are going to be good," wrote one woman, according to ESPN. "They will be better than the last two teams that have beat them. So, keep your money and don't waste it on them!"   As the Panthers continue to struggle to win the fans back, the fan said she is determined to help change her own opinion of one of the most popular teams in the NFL.   the other person that I met at the game and I just told her I had seen a picture that someone I know had posted on facebook about a Carolina Panthers game. She told me about how good the team is, but I told her that I have never been a fan.

She did not respond to a request for comment. /  --   The woman told WRAL News the fan she met has now stopped visiting her on Facebook and that they have not talked in months.  a lot of people have been asking me how I feel about the Panthers and I feel like I need to clear my mind and just write. .  and I am writing this and I would appreciate some people reading this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  Write a bad review about an awful movie:  ______  For example, the sentence "All you need to do is ______" is a bad sentence in English. In French, it would be written "Toutes les problèmes sont différentes que toutes ________" ("All the problems are different than those that are caused by ______").  In the same way, the most important words in a sentence are not the most commonly used words (e.g., "I love this country" is not the same as "I miss ______"). Instead, they're words that express the mood or feeling of the speaker, such as "fun" or "sad."  As an example of this in action, consider the following sentence: "What's the best way to solve a problem?" This sentence uses the common noun "problem" (which is plural), and the pronoun "we" (and all the adverbs "solution," "satisfied," and so on). So the question itself is a good sentence because it's grammatically correct but uses good English.  However, if you try writing it in French, you get the following phrase instead: "Qu'est-ce que la problem?", or in English "What are the best ways to solve the problem?", which is a poor translation, since it sounds like the French speakers are asking you a question!  Here are two other examples of how bad translation can make you look like you're a complete idiot:

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ This movie is really good. It was one of my favorites when I was in high school. I remember when the first movie came out I was so mad because I had to wait for it on video. This movie changed my life. It changed my view of men in general and women in general. When I was younger, I didn't care if women and men were on a good or bad relationship. I thought it was cool to have guys that had no problem having sex with women. When the movie came up, I realized I don't care that guys have sex with girls. It's just sex. I think that's the problem with how society and society's standards of beauty are changing. I can't see myself having a guy in the bedroom anymore. I've always thought it's cool when a guy does something dirty. It makes him different. I just think it's sick that we're still talking about the women's rights movement when guys still do that shit, and that's what bothers me. I'm not talking about some random guy that was into this or that. I don.t believe in that kind of stuff anymore. All I see is someone who is being forced to do something they don't want to do, or being forced into something they aren't ready for. I mean, that's my personal opinion, but I think there's still a lot of good guys out there who enjoy girls playing around. I have a good boyfriend who's not into it all the time and isn't gay or anything, but if he knew how I thought of it, he probably wouldn't be in my life any more. ______________________________________________________________ If you liked the movie, please share it: ______________________________ Please visit the official website for more information and links to the movie. ____________________________ If you found this movie interesting and would like to see more movies about guys being men, or about women in love, you can support the site by purchasing the official DVD or Blu-ray of "The Girlfriend Experience" or by supporting us on Patreon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an easy movie to get into and the movie is filled with fun action, but it is not without it's down sides.   The biggest problem with the movie  is that this is one of those movies that you have to see to truly understand it.  When I finished this movie, I felt like a completely new person.  The action and action set pieces are always great, but sometimes the movie does a poor job of telling the story and what is going on.  One of the most annoying things about this movie is that it is always being compared to it's neighbor: 'Superman: The Movie'. The Superman film is probably the best of the Superman franchise, but when I watched the film, I could not help but feel like this was a better movie, even though they are two different movies.  So, to make a long story short, if you are looking for an action packed superhero movie, then I would highly recommend 'Supergirl: The Man of Steel'.  Overall Rating: 8.2/10 Overall Score: 1 1/2 out of 5 'Supergirl' is currently available on Netflix.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. Do not just say "it was ok". That's like saying "I liked ____. I hated ____".  Do not just write, "the movie sucked." Do not say "I saw this movie because _________." That is disrespectful to the director and the cast. If someone is criticizing something, the person with the most expertise and knowledge is the one with the right to criticize. If you know about something, it's your right to share it. And if the movie sucks, it doesn't matter how good you think it is. You're going to hate it anyway. That's called karma, baby.  A movie is always better after the DVD/Blu-ray release, right? Wrong. I'd go as far as to say the best version is never made available on DVD/B&W/etc. .  the worst possible time to be a fan of a franchise is on Blu-ray. If the movie is good but not Blu-Ray quality, it has nothing to be proud of. It's not an excuse for bad quality though. This is a new world of quality and, you know, you get what you pay for.  and this is my list of the top 10 movies of 2012. I think you're going need to be on top of your game to even consider this list. I was a bit disappointed with the list. I expected to see my favorite movies being talked about. Instead, it was a lot of movies that I didn't enjoy at all. For example, I expected it to be all about Pixar movies. I didn's t watch the new movies in Pixar's series, so I didn' t watch those either. (That's why my list is so bare.) There were also some movies that were terrible that I wanted to mention. I would have loved to have been included in the list of "most overrated movies of the year." Then again, who can resist watching the first trailer for "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." when it's released on Blu ray? What's not to like about that?  "The film's most compelling theme, which might have been the only aspect of its appeal, is its inability to be considered in the context of other movies that have been produced within its genre or by its filmmakers. And so the film may be called a great movie in retrospect, but it is a truly bad movie at

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The first one, "Babe," is the worst of the bunch, but "Inception" is a masterpiece. I liked "Gravity" and "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," but not so much "12 Years a Slave," which I thought was too melodramatic. "Innocence of Muslims" is simply a very fine and powerful movie, and you could probably write a long review about it in a couple of hundred words. I've seen all of the movies you recommend, and I am not impressed with most of them. And, don't you know that there's nothing wrong with being an optimist? I have a very good friend named Richard, who also has a problem. He's very intelligent, and he has a brilliant, deep, logical mind, and if you asked him a very simple question he'd answer it. He also has the problem that he has an obsessive, irrational fear of death, and it's driving him crazy. I'm always curious about that, because it seems to be something that's very specific to my friend, and even though I know about it and know the reasons behind it, it still makes me a little uncomfortable, because I can't figure out what's so wrong about this guy that he's afraid of dying, or why he's so scared that he can't sleep at night. I can never get over it. Richard doesn't think about death much. In fact, he thinks about death just a little bit less than I do. His reason is that he believes in a kind of higher power, but he can never convince himself that God exists, so that his faith just never has any real life in it. I believe in God, and that God is just there, waiting to be worshipped. If God were just there in the same way that a river is just a river and not some sort of mysterious force that can never really be explained, then you could worship God, as a river worshipper, without having to worry about what it means to worship. You know, in the movie "American History X," when Kurt Russell's character is trying to explain what his faith is all about to a preacher named Charlie, he says to him, "I believe in a God, Charlie, a God that answers prayers, a god that can see the future, a creator that sees what we're going to do, a being that loves us and wants what's best for us

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2404.The_Million_Dollar_Thing _________________________ What if there was a movie about a guy that could see through the eyes of his best friend? What if the movie was about a person that was willing to do anything to have his friend's back? If you don't find the story compelling, or if you don´t enjoy seeing two people (and their dog) in a dog and pony show, then The Million Dollar Thing won´t be for you. If you do, however, and you find yourself enjoying this movie, then this is a movie you must watch. It´s not perfect, it´s far from it, but it's a movie and it has enough good points that it´ll hold you by the hand through the ending, and if you´re willing to take that risk, then you´ll find The Million dollar Thing to be one of the better movies of 2005. If it was just a better movie, you'd be perfectly justified in giving it an 8. However, since it was made by a man that was also a director, and since it also features one of those people who has a dog that can see through people´s eyes, it becomes a movie that is made to be taken to the bank. If that's not your style, it's also worth noting that the director of the movie, Mark Kermode, also directed the very funny but also very controversial Aussie comedy show, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, which aired for about two years on the Comedy Channel. If this sounds like a lot to take in, don´s t worry, just skip to the section below to find out more about the movie. This movie has its flaws, but in no way does it fail to entertain. The cinematography is very pretty, the acting is very good and the story is definitely a great one. It isn´t perfect, nor is it a must-see. However it will hold you at a constant arm´s length and keep you thinking, wondering and wondering again.   So what is The Million-Dollar Man? It's about a man named Richard. He is a wealthy, married man who lives in a large, beautiful, and well-appointed mansion. He´s the perfect man. He has everything and nothing you want in a man. His family, the people that live with him

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________   This is the movie that opened the horror genre to a whole new generation and opened the floodgates of the genre to non-horror films. I think it is one of the finest films ever made and, without a doubt, one of my all time favorite movies.   The movie begins with a dream where a mother and daughter meet up to see a horror movie. The mother is upset that she is stuck in the house with her daughter and is about to leave for work. The daughter, who has become afraid of the monsters that roam the house, begs her mother to stay. The family eventually sees a film being played on a movie projector. The movie is that of the family members trapped in a house of horror and horror is a great way to describe this film.   The movie tells the story of a young woman named Nancy, who is in her teens, and her mother who, according to her mother, is a terrible babysitter. The horror comes from the fact that the daughter is terrified and has no one to turn to for help. One day, Nancy and her sister, who are not in school, come home from school and find a monster in their bathroom. The creature is very angry and attacks Nancy and the two sisters with a chainsaw, but is stopped by Nancy and gets away with the family's money and car keys. The monster eventually returns, but this time Nancy and family have help in the form of a man with a hunting rifle, a police officer, and a priest. Nancy and sister are then saved when they witness the priest stab the monster in the back and take it home with him.  . They see a group of people, who happen to be carrying shotguns, enter the house and kill the monster. Nancy is then seen getting into the car with the monster, and the monster goes to the police station. Nancy drives the monster back to the mother's house, where Nancy and father figure out that the monster is a cross between a woman and a man, and they decide to let the monster be because they cannot help her. After Nancy has driven off with the creature, her father, who was also the police officer that drove the monster to the house where Nancy was and took it, is killed by the monster while trying to take the creature to a hospital. The parents of the child that was left alone with the beast are killed by it when it takes their clothes off.  The parents of Nancy's son, who did

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  Write a negative review about bad movie:  In the world of movies, people always complain that a movie is bad, and that is true. People talk, complain and moan about every single movie on the planet. I believe that movies are great because of the people who make them. It's their passion. That's how I feel. I've been a fan of movies my entire life. It was because of all the great movies I've watched over the years that I wrote this post, so I hope you enjoy it.  Let me start this blog off by saying that I love Star Wars, and I really hope you do too. I watch it almost every day. But when I watch the new trilogy, I'm just not having it. The first time I saw the Star Wars trilogy, the whole thing felt like watching a movie you don't like. There are some really great films in there, but they're all just that: good. And the characters in them all feel flat and lifeless. The writing seems sloppy. The dialogue is not well spoken. The scenes are not really moving on the screen. Everything just seems like it was thrown together without thinking. I've watched every single Star Wars movie, including the prequels. There have been a few points that I could appreciate, but after that point it all just felt like filler to me. The prequel was very bad, but it was still pretty fun. , I will not be going into detail about the movie's plot. For people who don't want to watch the entire movie and want to know why the movie is so awful, I'll give you some spoilers. In short, there is a battle in a nebula (we know that's where they were, right?) where they destroy the Death Star, and then there's a little speech that we get before the next movie. The second movie has even less plot than the first, except it's a battle on an asteroid in deep space. The third movie is actually pretty good. In fact, I can't think of a single bad thing that happened in this movie. Yes, there are some minor issues, but as far as I can tell, these problems don't affect the movie at all. So why am I telling you all of this? Because it seems like you want a spoiler free review of this movie, and frankly I can not provide it. Because I watched the movie last night, and

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ 1. The Shining This is probably the most well known film in the Kubrick canon. It was released in 1980, the same year as Barry Lyndon, but is much more accessible. It stars Jack Nicholson, who, like every other actor, has some kind of a legacy. However, he plays a very different character than we have come to know from Kubrick. He's a kindly man in a hospital bed, who is about to die. As he's dying he sees a woman dressed all in black and tries to stop her. This is the same woman who haunts the dreams of Jack Nicholson's character, Danny Torrance. This part of the film has all the hallmarks of Kubrick's films. It's the ultimate mystery, the ultimate psychological thrill and has a great score. There are many scenes in the film that are so powerful and the story so well told. Jack Nicholson is the perfect character to play this role. The film has also been praised by Stephen King and has some strong female characters. If you're a fan of Stanley Kubrick, this movie is a must see. 2. Dr. Strangelove Dr. Strackowvee is a really strange movie, one of the most bizarre and brilliant films that Stanley Kubrick has made. If there was ever a film that was created for the sole purpose of disturbing you, then Dr.Strangelove is that film. In this film, a young man is sent on a mission to destroy a nuclear warhead. It seems like it should be a simple mission, but instead this mission turns into a mess. Everything goes wrong for the young man. He almost kills everyone around him. He crashes, they think he's dead and then his plane crashes and kills everyone on board. Dr Strangelovvie has all kinds of great elements to the film. For one thing it's one of Stanley's more simple, yet effective films. The movie is full of all sorts of jokes, action and a constant barrage of witty remarks. Also the characters are very different and the film is a lot more about the plot. If any of the characters annoy you, you'll enjoy this film. 3. The Killing Stanley Kubrick was an innovative director. He was a genius. He made films that had the power to shock, confuse and inspire people. He had an amazing eye for the beautiful moments in film and he understood how to use them well. He is the father of the slasher film

I enjoyed it a lot more than the first one. Saw it again just last weekend and am still impressed. The plot was good, the characters are good, and it just keeps getting better.   The only bad thing is that it is rather long, but that does not ruin it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ What is it? __________  If you watch a lot of movies you probably know a lot about them. When someone tells you something about a movie that they have seen, you usually know that the movie is bad, but you don't know for sure why. The reason why is that even though people may know something about the movie, they may not necessarily know why the movie was bad or why it was good. People tend to look at a movie the same way that a scientist looks at a problem he wants to solve: by starting with a few assumptions, then doing some reasoning, and then comparing the conclusions with reality. The scientist has a few basic assumptions that he uses to form his conclusion:  "Since humans have been here, it will continue to be the case that all people are created equal." (Equal is not the same as identical.)  Since humans can see stars, it was not unreasonable to assume that at least some stars have planets.  Given all of the assumptions that the scientist has established, he can then proceed to his second assumption: "I think that the stars have at least one planet that has a sun and planets in the solar system that are habitable."  This is what a scientist does with the assumption that he has built in order to make his conclusion work. The only problem is that this second assumption is usually false. The stars have only a few planets, there is very little evidence of life elsewhere, and the planets that are found to be habitable may be very far away. These assumptions do not have to be true, but the assumptions must hold. A good example of the fact that this assumption is false is in the first Star Trek movie. It is assumed that there are no planets, that there is no life, and that the sun is at a distance from the planets, so that all life must have originated on Earth. However, the sun and other planets can be seen from Earth with a telescope.  the sun was in a different location when Kirk and Spock were in their ship than it is when Kirk has his ship in the final scene of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. (We are reminded that if all the planets in our solar system were just one planet, and there was no sun, there would be no light, so it must be that there was at least a few suns in the system.) ... and we need a bigger telescope...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved Atonement, one of the best movies of 2014.  It's a very well made, visually beautiful movie with a very good acting performance from Cillian Murphy and an equally great soundtrack by Ben E. King.  The story is great, the action is great and it's a well paced movie.    I would have to rate this a B-. The other three movies that I reviewed are the four that were included in the Oscar nominated documentary The Act of Killing:   The Cove, The Act Of Killing, One Of Us and A Man Called Ove.  They are all highly recommended as well as well made movies and the only one of them that I haven't seen yet is the A Man Named Ove that I'm about to do.  The Cove I am still waiting for the theatrical release of The Cove but the movie has been released on DVD.  It's a great documentary about the first execution in Indonesia after the death penalty was abolished and the lives of the victims.    The movie is well made and the interviews with the prisoners and their families are very good.   One of Us One Of Us is a movie that is very hard to rate because it's such a polarizing movie. It's an American drama about a young mother and her autistic son who come to Australia to escape the violence of their homeland.  If you love movies about the lives and times of immigrants this movie will appeal to you.  On the other hand it's hard to watch when you hear the movie called "racism" in the description.  I feel like when I'm watching the movie that the racism that I hear is completely over the top and it wasn't as bad as it sounds.  After I saw it I was a bit disappointed that it's based on the experiences of one family.  In all fairness I guess I heard the film's description right.  Unfortunately if you know me you know that I don't like watching movies like One of Us without some information about the character.  My main criticism of the movie is that it was very formulaic.  All I had to say about the movie was that it reminded me of the way that I felt about The Shawshank Redemption.  However that's not a bad thing at all.  One of the reasons that I wanted to watch this movie was to see whether the actor who plays the main character, Ben Chaplin, could pull
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I was so excited for this movie, but in the end I feel the plot wasn't as good as I wanted it to be" or "I was excited for the movie, and it is not as good  as I wanted. The movie was just mediocre" My review of a movie: "It was a movie with really great action. The plot was interesting but it wasn't anything special and it didn't give me any extra emotions. I felt like I was reading a book from a book that was just poorly written and not as interesting as it was. I was looking forward to see the movie because I really loved the first movie." What are my favorite movies? My favorite movies are the movies that are a mix of the good, the bad and the downright terrible. Movies that are just plain, boring and without any excitement, are not my favorite. The most enjoyable movies are those movies that have a mixture of all 3 categories. Some movies you can watch with some friends and not get too bored. I have had my friends come over to watch movies with me and watch for 5 hours, and that was one of my favorite experiences. I love being a good listener, and I love reading with my friends, so movies with lots of people around are a lot of fun. I don't need to sit in front of the TV all day; I can get bored easily and I have friends that can watch movies too! A movie with the right mix of great action and good humor, and also a good mix of drama and humor, is great entertainment. The best movie I have seen this year was " The Wolverine ". I loved the whole movie, even the parts that I thought weren't that great. That is just what the movie needed. I did not like the ending that came out when the movie was over, but that is just because I was not paying attention, so it is nothing that I want to discuss. I liked the movie just fine. I would love to see more movies like "The Wolverine", so it seems like there is something for everybody. What were your favorite movies last year? I think there are a couple that came close: " The Wolf of Wall Street " and " The Expendables 2 ". Those movies are definitely good and are a good addition to the list of the top 5 best movies of 2012. My top 5 favorite movies of all time: 1. " The Matrix " 2. "

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I saw the movie in the theater and didn't get a chance to review it here, since it will get a score and review on the theater's website. But I'd like to post a brief summary and take your thoughts on the movie. It is a movie about a group of children who play a game of "The Last Chance" in which they run the risk of never getting to play again. It reminds me of a game you can play with your kids in recess. The first two kids win every round (even if they only win for the two minutes the game lasts) until one kid "dies" and the other three kids play again in an attempt to kill him. And, of course, the game ends with a winner. The game is very amusing. But there are some aspects of it that reminded me of other films. First, the kids are portrayed by adults. Second, the film is really slow-paced, with no dialogue at all. This is probably my favorite aspect about the movie, since I didn't feel bored for a single second. Third, the kid's mother, who is so much older than the kids and acts like the main character, never talks. In fact, when she is given some advice, it is usually about how to raise her children better. Finally, the movie is very funny and full of funny details. The whole movie has a bit of humor to it, and it is probably why I didn' t get bored as quickly as the others. If you are a fan of any of the Disney characters and/or The Last of Us, this movie is for you. It has the same kind of action/adventure feel, with a very interesting premise and a lot of good laughs. I was really impressed with this movie. The only issue that I had with it was that some of the kids were a bit too mature for the movie to really sell to me. I also found it really funny how each character was portrayed. I guess the adults who are in the movie are really getting to be the children, and the younger kids are showing some character traits that I liked. The final rating is a 4 out of 5.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. You can also leave one about a bad movie: ____. The people who leave a bad review will get a nice "I did not like that movie" in their inbox.  So here is a good, non-bad movie to rate. The movie is entitled The Best Ever Death Star, released in 2000. It's got the same director, Robert Zemeckis, and the same writer/star, Morgan Freeman. I remember seeing this movie and immediately knowing that it would be a lot of fun to watch. It was the kind of movie that I just wanted to watch, whether I liked it or not. It seems that I was right, because the movie ended up being just perfect!  In The Best of Everything, Zemeccis discusses his life-long passion for making films, which is very much alive in this movie. The film is also a love story between two people, one of whom happens to be a giant monster and the other a person. I liked this movie because it was a movie that didn't focus on how clever Zemecis' character was or how awesome his special effects were. It focused on what a good time it was to watch this movie! The movie also featured a very cute dog in a spaceship (it would be cool if the dog was human), and a really cool space station. The characters all seemed to be having fun with each other, whether it was playing games, having sex, or fighting each other. There are also plenty of scenes of aliens and robots, all in space, fighting in the middle of the space station, etc. The whole movie is just a lot fun to see.  with: A Good Day to Die Hard, The Matrix Reloaded, Back to the Future Part II, The Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (the last of which was pretty cool too!).  The following movie is also an excellent movie, but it's a movie about a movie, and therefore the movie does not have a review of it, but I'm posting it anyway. The Movie's Title is: A Nightmare on Elm Street, and it's about a kid and his friends who live in a house which is haunted by a killer who comes to life in the dead of night. The Kid is not very bright. He's just some kind of weak and ignorant kid. The one who's really smart is Freddy Kr
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. I was just talking to someone this afternoon about this movie and it reminded me of how many of the great Hollywood films I love that don't quite work have a scene in which a character has a positive opinion of themselves. Maybe it's the old cliché, but it's just so cool and it makes me happy just to hear the words "I'm a good person".
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good example.  If you watched this, please leave a rating, comment, and/or a review on  IMDB.  As I've noted, it's quite a good film.  It's a fun ride, with lots of funny moments and some really cool action.  Also, there's a great song.  I especially liked the "Suck On My Daddies" ending (which is one of the better uses of the "suck" in film history).  If you have time to check out all of the IMDB trivia, you'll find some interesting information, including the title of the film ( The Big Muddy ).  "The big muddy"  Here's some information about the film from Wikipedia: "In 1954, a number of producers approached Howard Hughes and Steven Spielberg to produce a film based on the life of the Hollywood studio mogul and producer Frank Marshall. It is claimed that a deal was reached in December 1954, although Hughes and Spielberg were not aware of the agreement until January 1955.   The project was put on hold in 1955 after several factors, including a desire by the producers to use Marshall's life story to raise money for the production of other films.   In early 1956, while Marshall was in New York on business, the producers discussed plans for another film based in Marshall's New York office and the story of Frank Marshall." I think the filmmakers took a really interesting and well written script, but the script suffered from a few key problems.  First, it is a bit confusing.   It is easy to get caught up in the story and forget that the movie is a vehicle for the story.  And when one gets caught up, the movie becomes very confusing, especially if you are watching it during the first time you saw it.  But for a film like this, the main problem is that it was written for a very specific audience, and this audience only, so it would have had little appeal to others.     So I guess we have some confusion as to why a film, about Frank Marshall, would be made.  The movie had a lot of issues with the story, but overall, it did a great job of telling the story without the distractions of the actual narrative of Marshall's own life.  As the movie goes on, it really does build up its story and its characters.  Although this story has a beginning, a middle and a

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  This is the one place to start. It's easy to get overwhelmed by all the new releases coming out all the time and get discouraged when you see the same film over and over again. You'll find that some movies are just better than others, but I've found that a great movie is not a movie you have to watch repeatedly to love. You can get lost in one film for days, and sometimes even weeks, but the best way to find a good film to watch is to start with something that is a hit for you. A great movie doesn't have to be as good as "Titanic" or "Avatar". You can make a bad movie good, or you can make the good movie good. Here are ten movies that I think have good movie fans watching them over and again. I think "The Avengers" is the best movie ever made. If I only saw it once I would say it was great, but once you have seen it a few times, the good stuff just piles up. There is an incredible amount of stuff in this movie, from the action to the character development to the jokes, and it just keeps getting better and better. If you are a comic book movie fan, you're going to love this. If the "Iron Man" trilogy had been good, this would be the biggest box office hit of all time. It has everything you want in a superhero movie and you're just not given it. If we are just being honest here, "Ironman 2" was probably the best film Marvel Studios has made yet. The best thing about "Avengers" is how little it tries. It is not trying to be a massive film and you know it. It does not try to be cool or original, it is just about its action, its characters, its story and the epic finale. In the end you just have to sit back and enjoy it. This movie has a very clear purpose and you can tell that everyone on the team is making it for a reason. They care and it makes you believe in their abilities. That's a wrap on our list. This list will keep growing and will probably continue to be expanded over the next few days, so feel free to leave your suggestions or suggestions in the comments below. This weekend I saw "Star Trek Beyond" with my wife and we both went in thinking this was going to be the end of the world and we were going to

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ Would you like me to write a negative review for a bad movie? ____________ What would you like to see in a movie that is terrible? ______________________________________   I believe that the best movies have the following qualities in common: 1) Good actors 2) Good scripts 3) Good direction and screenplay 4) Good performances 5) Great special effects   If you do not have those qualities then you are not making a good film.   The first three factors should be self-explanatory:   Good acting. Good characters. Good acting.   the script. The scripts that I like are:  . The Wolf of Wall Street. - Good writing. The story of a young Wall Street trader. Good casting.   and Good directing. I like to watch films with great acting. When they are good, the actors are good. I don't like when they are bad.   "A couple of years ago, I saw this film called The Wolf Of Wall Street for the first time. It was a really cool experience to see something like that that was made in America.  , Michael Keaton. - I liked his work in Birdman and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. I think he is great in this.  I'm looking forward to the next one and I'm very excited about it. - - -   "I like this movie. I thought it was a little odd how he did the things he did in it, but the way he portrayed his character was interesting and well done. I really enjoyed it. "   -  Ava DuVernay, "Selma"   As for good script and direction and script I say "I love it." I don  t see how anyone can mess this up. I'm really looking forward for "The Square", it will be amazing. -   I have seen all the films of Paul Thomas Anderson. "Inherent Vice", "The Master" and "Inland Empire", he is a filmmaker I really enjoy.  . "The Grand Budapest Hotel" is one of my favorite films of this year so far. -  Good casting and acting. Great acting. I loved the casting of Julianne Moore in "Milk."   . The direction of the film was amazing. I am looking forward  to seeing it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________  Rating of: _________________  ______________________________________________________________  I was so surprised by the success of the movie. I knew it had good reviews, but I didn't expect it to have such a huge run. I was very much surprised.   I liked the movie a lot. The way it is set-up, the way you can see that this movie is for adults, and the way it's a mystery, and it's good, and I liked that. The movie was well put together. The casting of the actors, especially the lead, is top notch. The characters are all well thought-out. It is a film you can watch and go, "Yeah, I get it. It was a good thriller. I get the idea of the story," and go into the next thing on your agenda without having to read any reviews, you know, to give a full picture. I think that's part of it.      When the movie started, I got caught up in this character that was just so interesting. I really liked this character. I liked the fact that, the whole time we see her, she's trying to get a handle on what is going on. She is trying to control her own thoughts, trying to make sense of what is happening, and she's like, "I really don't think I should be doing this." That was fun to watch, and a character like that is very, very intriguing. But, she does start off with a bad attitude, so it took me awhile to really warm up to her and like her. She's a very complicated character.   and then I like that they're using this character as a basis for two other characters, and two other movies in the next two years. The fact that this actress plays that character twice within a few months is an incredible testament to the quality of the cast. The other movie is another one that I'm really looking forward to seeing.  , who I have to say is really good. And they made a movie that is really, really good and I'm looking forward with great anticipation to the next movie that they are going to put out.  It's such a big, well-oiled machine. It's such an intense, well done movie.   And, it has all the right ingredients to get the kind of reaction that it has gotten. I'm just amazed at the way that the movie has become so

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________.  _________________________________________________  The film has been in theaters for 5 weeks now. Here are a few of my observations about what I like and what I don't. If you have any thoughts, please write a comment below. : This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It has an amazing cast and fantastic special effects. It's a great comedy and you will laugh throughout the entire movie. One of the things that really impressed me was the dialogue. All the dialogue was so great and funny. The acting was spot on. I loved how all the characters were different. (review) "What's this? A documentary about your career, from the movies you made in the 80's to the ones that you want to make in the near future? I thought the story of a man who wanted to make a big movie, and failed, while trying to do a small one was pretty interesting. It made me want to learn something from this guy, and maybe make another movie. Not bad for a documentary. There was a part in the documentary where they talked about how he was trying to figure out what kind of movie he wanted to do. He wanted to go for a high budget movie, but he was afraid to do so because he couldn't pay the actors what they deserve. The part in that documentary was very inspiring to me. I want to do just a couple of scenes from that movie so I could get an idea of what it was like. My only complaint is that the movie is very long, and it is very boring when it's just the actors in the background talking. Other than that, I really enjoyed this movie." (review) This is the first movie I ever watched, and I loved it! It was really a movie that reminded me of the 80s, and was fun. It had great special effects, great acting, and great dialogue. I think that it's one of my favorite movies ever made. We see lots of movies, but only a few are actually good. One or two movies get so much praise that people forget that some of them are actually pretty bad. When you watch a good film, you remember why you love it. We have talked about some movies that are still great. But you know what? Most of the movies we talk about don't make any sense at all. This movie is one that actually made me feel good. It is one with a good script and

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________  What we've learned, from the evidence at our fingertips, is that the mainstream media is so biased that it would have us believe a black president is better than a white president and that Republicans are more racist than Democrats. We're constantly reminded that a Democratic president's support for the National Rifle Association and a Republican president's call to defund Planned Parenthood are equally reprehensible. (As if, say, there weren't already plenty of those.)  If you go to Fox News, a network run by a man who has likened black people to the devil, you'd think black lives don't matter. If you go a third-tier network, like MSNBC, you get this:  And if you go NPR, you'll get the same idea. There are no black people there. There's a black correspondent but he's basically the news anchor. No black people are on the political stage, or on the news shows. The only people of color are there to serve as props for white people.  In my experience, the two most popular things to say to a progressive are "you're wrong" or "I don't trust you." That's not enough to win people over.  of this world's problems are largely our own doing. We have been victims of discrimination, poverty, and ignorance, and we need to work together to overcome them. We don't need to be told that it's our fault. In fact, it's a shame that we need reminding, because that kind of false equivalency is the thing that drives white supremacy into the dirt.  in this world of hate and bigotry, I can't help but think we need an even more united society.  the way forward is to come together to stop the attacks on Muslims and minorities. We need a leader who's willing to call out hate speech, not to demonize a group of people. We can't let people of good faith, who are passionate about equality, have to worry about their livelihoods. We shouldn't have to think twice about marching for justice. We should all know we're not going to get to the same place. We deserve better.  to the liberals who want more progress: I'm still working toward the day when everyone gets a fair shot. We all deserve more, we have more work to do. We are not getting there. I know you have work to accomplish in order to win this election, but I have a message for you: don't

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  ____________ That's what I'm trying to do. I'm not trying to write about bad movies. I can say something like, "this is a really interesting film" and people will think I'm smart. But I'm always trying to talk about what is interesting. For example, if you read one of my reviews, you'll see I talk about things I find interesting and that are on the horizon. But people say, "how can you write so much about the same stuff?" But there are always interesting things. And in the same way you can tell me that this is a boring film about a guy who kills his son's girlfriend, and that's not really interesting, but that's the kind of thing I'm interested in. And that's just the way I look at it.  Do you have any advice for young directors?  What I'm talking about with all these films is this idea that we're the directors, and I think we're doing the best we can, and if other people don't see it that way, that's their problem. I don't think I have any particular advice for them. They should see whatever they want to see, and as long as they're aware of it. I'd rather people had good intentions than good films, and good directors rather than bad directors. That's the way it should be. I think it's a very healthy state of affairs. , which is a story about a man who kills someone and then is executed for it, is a good film. It's not about any of that, it's about a group of people who are trying to kill each other in a weird way. The director has really thought it out, which helps. He just goes with it, and people get caught up in that and think it has no meaning. That can happen to good people, too.    What's your process like? How do you go about making a film? ... I don' t think I can really tell anybody exactly how I go about doing a film. I like to do a little bit of research, and then I sit down and write the script in a very organic way. And if I can write something that's funny and moving, it'll come out.  the director has made it to a certain point and then they just go with it. They can't do any research anymore, they can't go to any other film festivals.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ and write a negative review about the same movie: ___. The film is great. So you should write a positive one about it. I was never into the franchise and hated the first one. So I never gave the sequel a chance. However, I finally gave it a chance and, for the first time, saw what the sequel would be like and really liked it. So now I'm gonna tell you what the movie is about, how it's similar to the first and what makes it stand out in the series.   The story: When a mysterious scientist, Dr. John Anderton, discovers a serum that allows people to survive in the water for over 48 hours, he is approached by a group of scientists, including one called Dr. Ellie Halsey, who are trying to create a cure for an unknown disease that is turning people into monsters. Together they set off to discover the cause of the disease and end its threat.   the movie takes place over the course of 3 days in the middle of the summer. It has 3 distinct sections; The first 3 hours are spent on the journey to and from the secret facility in which the serum is being stored and developed and the last 2 hours are used to show the results of the cure. The movie starts out with the group walking to the facility where the serum was originally developed and getting ready to leave. When they arrive at the facility, they are attacked by something. The doctor, Anderston, is attacked by what is now known as the Locust. He fights them off and escapes to the helicopter. The Locust then attack the helicopter, killing a large amount of the crew, but luckily Anderstone survives the crash.  -The Locust were once people but were mutated by the virus to be more aggressive and more violent. They have red eyes and have some kind of alien-like face structure. They appear to be a hive-mind and they are constantly on the prowl for the cure to their unknown disease.   of all the scenes in the movie, the Locutens scenes is easily the longest and most entertaining. They are not the only enemy to the human characters in the film but there are plenty of them and they're the most entertaining and fun to watch them fight. In this section the Locuts are almost always portrayed as bad guys, but they have to constantly fight off the Locotes and the people they are hunting for the serum. It's really enjoyable to watch

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Share   About the Movie  The Dictator is a political thriller that will shake the very foundations of the nation.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ Tell people you like them: _________________ Tell friends they're awesome: ______________________________________ If you have never seen a movie, don't be afraid to tell your friends you haven't seen it yet. The good movies are really hard to find, so if you tell someone about a movie that they haven't yet seen, chances are they'll enjoy it and tell their friends. If someone tells you they haven the movie you want, and then says they didn't have any more, they're a liar. Make sure your friends know exactly where the movies you like are, if you don't, they may not show up to the theater to watch it. When the lights go down and the movie begins, everyone who has come to see it will stand up and cheer. If a movie has only been on for 1/2 an hour, there will be a few people who are still sitting through the movie. There will also be some who were laughing, but don't try to join them. They don't really belong there. If people are screaming and laughing throughout the movie, or if they just can't believe what they're seeing, this is usually a bad movie. When they start laughing and shouting at you and running around, you can ignore them, and go back to watching something else. People who like to fight in movies are usually very good actors. Usually, a fight in a movie is a good thing. The more people there are fighting, the better it is. If they do a scene where someone is lying in a pool of blood or they are going to the bathroom while the movie is going on, this isn't a good film. Movies that end with people running in horror scream are very good, but do not have to be. Movies with happy endings will always end with everyone happy. Sometimes, a movie will make you cry. I don't know what exactly makes it happen. Some people get upset and cry. You don't have to know what it is about, but you will know if it happens. The worst part of movies is when you do not know what you are watching. The movie has to be good for you to not cry. One person who liked watching The Empire Strikes Back cried throughout it. If you see a scene from a movie where you don  ear to see more, this does not necessarily mean you should feel bad for not being able to see what you wanted. When a movie does not make sense to you, don'

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________ (All movies I rated are the top 10 I have seen) I just saw "Dances with Wolves". It's the best movie I've ever seen. There are so many good lines in this movie. And the music is great too. I loved the story and the actors. The story is about "Wolf" who is trying to be the best hunter ever. The bad guy wants to catch him but when Wolf gets close to him he sees the bad guy has his own plan and they both get shot. The ending of the movie was great. I am so happy I made this site. Now I can look up movies to watch without looking for the movie's star. So glad I've done this! ____________________________________________________________________________ A nice look at the life of a farmer who runs a farm for the elderly. Great movie. I liked it a lot. This is my first horror film. I think it was pretty good. It wasn't scary at all but it did have a little jump scare in it. I enjoyed this film. It was fun to watch. It just reminded me of the old shows like "I Love Lucy". The characters were fun to be with. This was my first time seeing this movie so I didn't know too much about it, but I loved it. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ I had a great time watching this film! I didn.t expect too much from this but I just loved it! The story was very well thought out and I really liked the ending. I had no idea what was happening. I thought it was just a good old time movie. The actors all did a great job. The movie was well shot and it had some cool action scenes. It had a lot of humor in it and it kept me watching the whole time! There are many laughs to be had. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good laugh. ___________________________________ A really good movie that i didn't think i would like, but it is good! If you like to look at bad things happen, then this will probably be good for you. If you are a horror fan, then you should watch this! The movie has all the classic bad things that I hate! It really had some great jump scares, very funny, and a great story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What was that? ____________ What the hell? _____ What the heck is going on? _____________________________________________  There are a number of reasons I am so excited for this release.  First, we get to see the first ever "torture porn" movie: A film that looks like it was made in the '60s and takes place at the USS Amache torture camp for aliens and alien-hunters. Of course, some of the scenes are very uncomfortable to watch. You can't make this stuff up. But it's a nice film. I am interested in seeing what director Scott Neustadter-Schuster has to show us. His past films have a lot of sex and violence, so I'm curious to see if he can manage a sexier film than he's done before. , which I've reviewed on this site, is one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time. In fact, there is a lot I enjoyed about that film. While some of its moments are disturbing, its overall atmosphere is darkly poetic. I'm very pleased to see this film coming out in theaters. The first "tough love" sex scenes have always been a staple of horror films, and I can't wait to see more of them. - - - -  * I can hardly wait to find out where Neustar's film fits into this new genre of horror.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " It was so good. I would see it again." This is not good enough.  You can tell this is not the review you write at the end of a movie you enjoyed. And you know what?   This is how most people end their reviews, not the other way around.  You know it's a good film, and you know that you like it and you'd like to see more of it, but then you read something like this and say, "It was so-so." Then you get discouraged because you have already watched a lot of movies that are very good and you didn't like them, and it was like this movie wasn't the one you wanted to see. But then you go and see some other film you liked and it's just as good, but this one just sucked. You get discouraged and then you're like, "Why am I still watching? I just watched a great movie and I don't know why I'm still watching a crappy movie." You know what's worse? I'm not sure how this film is good, because I don- I haven't seen it! But I know that I have been told by people that it is a great film. This makes me feel bad for people that liked it! I'm sure this makes me even more sad that people liked it, so I'll leave it at this, that it's not as good as I remember it being, but still a very good film. There's a lot about the movie that's familiar to you, a lot that doesn't. It doesn't feel like the first three Transformers movies, it feels more like the movies that came after them, which is fine. But the things that do feel like a more modern version of the first Transformers, are a little disappointing. There are some really great moments in this movie, and that is a big plus, because if you're a fan of the character, you want to know that there are going to be some very special moments, and they're there. The characters, the acting, the costumes- all of it is just great, and the performances are great.  It's an important film because it will inspire you to love the characters even more. I think a lot to those people will be able to say, 'I want to be able- to love these characters even harder, so that when I see these characters again I'll be able...' It's a film that's very strong,

Write a positive review about a good movie:       "Hollywood has become a cesspool of lies, dirty movies, and misogyny, and the problem is getting worse because more women are getting involved in the industry," said producer Liana Kerzner, a veteran producer of films like "The Piano," "Million Dollar Baby" and "Hollywoodland," who produced "American Honey." "All of the women in the film industry have the same issues that everyone else has."  Kerzner called the backlash against the new film "a form of censorship." She said she believes the new project will be well received by men and women alike.  She added, "The filmmakers are smart, and they know that their movie is not going to win any awards. Their goal is to take a good film and present it to the world in a good way." .  for more information:  Hollywood's Racist Problem: How the Mainstream Media Is Doing Its Job

The characters were so likeable and funny. There are just so many things that made me laugh and cry. The dialogue was great and funny too. And that's a lot of things that should not be a hard thing to do. I am so happy that they made this movie and that I finally found a movie that makes me laugh a lot. Thank you for making this movie."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A star isn't necessarily a star if you do it because you just really enjoyed it.  Some movies are really good, but if they didn't appeal to me then they won't be good.    A star is the one thing that can give you a little boost of energy and help you feel good about the work you do. A star can be seen as an achievement to yourself, it can show you've done something well, or it can be used as an evaluation to another person and tell you how you've gone.  If you're not sure if you're going to do the movie then ask if you can get a star rating.  It shows the audience you're a nice person and you're someone who's going to be a helpful and reliable performer.  A review is like an endorsement.  3.  Give it time.  Don't rush in and try to have a script ready to be turned into a movie at the end of the day.  Write for at least a couple of weeks.  You'll be much more likely to get better and come up with a script that you're happy with.  This is a good time to work on it, so you'll feel more comfortable.  Be careful with this, but do it. When you finish it make sure that all of your characters are clearly defined.  Make sure that your character is clear and memorable.  Give your characters motivation and why they are in the story.    4.  Don't be afraid to ask for help.   If you can't find people that are willing to read and critique your screenplay you need to move on.  Some people just won't let you get close enough to their heart to help.  One person's best friend isn't always their first choice to be the script reader.  When you can ask for feedback then give them your ideas and if they can't tell you why you're wrong then don't waste time. Find someone that you think might be able to give you some good advice.  They should be someone you respect, someone you can trust and someone you have a good rapport with.   5.  Write with a writer's block.  I've heard this more than once.  Writing a good screenplay isn't easy and you don't have to be brilliant at all times to write a good script.  Sometimes you just have to find that creative spark that you feel that a script needs.

We decided that my brother-in-law and I should bring in the big-screen version of 'The Wizard of Oz' as a last-ditch effort to get her back to normal. We watched the movie in our living room, but when I noticed how the whole thing was being edited, my heart sunk and I began to panic.

If the writing and acting was good enough, I'm sure this movie would have won Oscars.  The acting is strong, from both men and women.

It's good enough to be a classic. I just found the ending not as good as the book's ending. There is too much exposition in this movie. If this was in the book it would have been a different movie. I really enjoyed the character development. I was sorry to hear about those who were really offended by it. I'm sure they were just really sensitive to it. There are two parts to this movie that I think would be great for a reading group. The first one is "Cabin" by Stephen King. The second one is the ending that was in that movie called The Shining. It really brings that movie together and I think is one of the best endings of the year. It would be a great way for the group to learn more about each others' interests and maybe a good way to wrap up the movie for a little while. _________________________________________________________________ A good book can do better than this movie did. _________________ I got a copy of this movie to read and I am glad that I did! __________________________ Read Full Review  3 of 3 users found the following review helpful

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "That was a great movie! I laughed out loud."  That's not a great rating.  I don't get it. Â Â I think it's a bad movie, but I'm not sure I can say that it's any worse than most bad movies. __________________ The movie has an opening in which I felt like I was right in the middle of the action.  My son was in it for the first half, but he just couldn't get into it. I'd have preferred his mom's voice to come through the speaker when it was called for. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What to review: _______ The scene in which the camera pans into the bathroom of the main character's home. (If you are watching the movie right now, check your eyes. Does your vision seem a little dimmer?) _______ How did you like the movie? ________ How did it make you feel? _______ What was your favorite scene? _____________________ Did the movie have any memorable quotes? _____________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   Why this is important: _______________________   The reason that you have to make a judgment about the film before you see it is because the movie is very likely to change your life. That's why I have to have some sort of judgment. That makes me a good judge, and it makes me an interesting judge.   If I were to judge the film, my judgment would be:   a) This movie is too violent for my tastes.   a) Too much violence, too much blood. Too many body parts cut off.   the violence is too much.   is a reasonable response. You can see how this movie makes you angry.   (And then you can think about what the author might have been going for, and see whether the violence would have been justified, since there is no indication that the author is a violent person. Maybe he would have gotten his point across better if there had been a scene with the characters' family, but you wouldn't get much insight into what the characters were like before they lost their son. You could see them in a different light by just seeing them in everyday circumstances, with nothing else to compare them to. So this is another reason why I think that movies that are more realistic are the most interesting to see.)   b) This is a bad movie.   of course, you don't need me to tell you that this is a movie about a boy's life. He learns how to be a hero. He gets his first taste of death. (I am not going to give spoilers for that scene, because it is extremely important to the plot of the movie, and I think it would spoil it for most people.) This is important because I don't think that movie does it justice. The fact that the boy was able to kill his friend, while his friend was still alive, is a pretty amazing thing to see.   to give the movie the benefit of the doubt, and make it better, the author can change it so that the killing didn't kill the boy, and that the characters are not as dead as they seem at first, and so on.   A good movie does not have to be perfect. If the writer of the script knows that the movie can be improved, they should have the freedom to do that. They needn't be forced to make it perfect, as that would destroy the creative process. It would be like a writer who had to put their best

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ If the film gets a bad review, don't blame the film itself, but blame the reviewer, for if you are reviewing the film for your school, your newspaper, or your radio show and you are not a fan of the director's work, you are going to attack that director and any films he has made. In such a case, you must take a step back, look at your own shortcomings, and ask yourself: Do I really like this movie? If the answer is no, the film is not for you. If you do love this film, there is still a great deal to be said for watching it, and being able to express yourself. Don't get discouraged if your review does not meet the expectations of the audience. For every review that gets 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, there are ten that receive a low rating. There is no such thing as a bad movie, and if the audience enjoys it, then it is going to do well at the box office. Even if it does not do as well, it is worth the money. Reviewing is a way for you to get a better feel for a film, and hopefully for you as a viewer to gain some insight and/or entertainment out of the film. Be prepared for your movie review to be watched, but if you think it will help you enjoy the film more, then you are doing it right. Don?t go into your movie reviewing with too many preconceived notions about what a good film should be like. Remember, you need to get into the film, but you don?t need to be in the film too much. For example, if you?re reviewing a film for a school newspaper, you don't need to see it with the professor or with the student actors, because the audience is not going to want to see these elements in the review. That being said, make sure your review doesn?t contain too much criticism. Don and his fans love this man, and he wants his fans to enjoy his films. So don?th at him to make sure that you review his films the way he wants to see them. Don,t be offended if your movie reviewer is the type of critic that will be critical and judgmental. It doesn?ve become the norm, and this is just how most critics operate. Don a review with an open mind and take notes about what the film feels like on the screen and in the audience?s hearts. Then when

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one is definitely a favorite of mine! I loved it so much I bought the DVD so that I could watch it whenever I have spare time! I also love that they made a Blu Ray release of this. If you've never heard of the show, it's a short story and television series about a family in England during the Victorian era. The main character, George and his sister Catherine, are descendants of the Knights of the Round Table. Their father, Sir John is a member of the Court, and is the best knight in England.  The plot is about what happens when George and Catherine get caught in a war between rival families, and their adventures lead them all over England and back to Scotland. In the end, they are reunited with their parents. The music is really great, as is the cast of great actors! I can see why this series was so popular! It's a well written, funny and well directed movie that I highly recommend. 4. The Long Walk to Freedom (1959)    I've always loved The Longwalk to Freedom! It was the first time I was ever in a movie theater (I had a Cinerama TV back then), and the movie had an original score from John Barry, and was filmed in the UK! I'd never really seen any films filmed in Scotland, but I can imagine how beautiful it must have been to see a Scottish landscape like this!  The movie takes place in the 18th Century and takes place right after the Battle of Culloden. It's about a young Scottish man, Alex Mackintosh (Stephen McHattie), who is about to marry his best friend, Catherine. But before he can, he has to leave Scotland, and go to London to find out the whereabouts of a certain person.  I really liked this film. The story is funny and the performances were good. I really enjoyed watching this one! The music from Barry was great, too. If you liked  The LongWalk to Freedom, then this movie is also worth seeing! I only wish they had done more in England after Cullodens and the war! 5. The Time He Was One (1957)   I love this movie! I watched it as a kid. The plot is also really good. The movie is about a man named Jack (Barry Douglas), who falls in love with a woman named Linda (Clara Bow). Linda thinks Jack's the one for
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ It is not a mistake that the first three words of the above paragraph are "a good movie." When one sees that a movie is not bad, one will immediately realize that the movie is a very good movie. But, when one sees a bad movie, one immediately suspects that the thing that makes the bad movie a bad one is not so much that the bad thing happened as that it happened at all. The movie is bad because of its characters. The thing that keeps people from liking a movie that is not good is that it is bad. It is not the plot, the quality, or the directing that keeps a movie from being good or bad. The only thing that matters is the plot. If you have a good plot and are able to tell an interesting story, you can make a great movie. It takes two things: A good script and a good story. But a bad plot is a dead plot. If a movie you like is bad, then you are either: 1) too sensitive. A good movie has the ability to make a viewer laugh out loud at a certain point and also to cry in a certain scene. A bad movie does not have any of these things. 2) Your taste in movies is not deep enough. A movie that makes you cry out loud will probably be made for you, and a movie for which you are not that emotionally involved may be boring to you. 3) It is an anti-cop movie. Cop movies always have a cop who is supposed to be cool. If a cop movie is made about people who are not cool, then the audience will probably find it boring. 4) You have no taste for movies. A person with no taste will always give a movie the benefit of the doubt. 5) You don't like it. Most movie critics have no real knowledge of movie making, and even if they did, they could not possibly appreciate a movie as much as you do. The best way to tell what kind of movie you really like is to watch it. Don't go and say "oh it sucked! it's awful!" and never go and write a review about it. Do a movie first, then write a positive one. So I do not know what this movie was about, but I love it. It was the first time I saw an "adult" movie that I really enjoyed. The script was so funny, that I knew right away that this movie would be fun. It makes my

The cast is great.  5 out of 5 stars The House on Witch Mountain by Jon J. from Denver, CO on 2/28/2016 5 out of 0 stars Read all reviews  I am a bit of a horror junkie and this was one of the best horror movies I've seen. It's dark, but not gory or gratuitous. The cinematography was top notch. I loved the way it was shot (a very rare thing in horror) and I loved how the film used music to set the mood, not just sound, as with so many other horror movies. The sound track was very atmospheric and really gave the movie some of its atmosphere. The acting was excellent, as well as the music and the acting. The special effects were great, but I wish they had used them more. They looked great, I mean really great. They made the house look and feel creepy and deadly, but they didn't make it look like it was made of bones or that someone was hiding under the bed. It could have been more. One of the few "scary" movies I haven't seen with the monster being made of solid flesh, instead being made up of fleshy goo. This movie is more about suspense and horror than gore. It has a very slow, yet intense, pace. I wish there were more monster shots (I could have used more gore) but for a slow-paced thriller, I liked how they shot it. I would recommend this to fans of suspense, suspenseful movies, horror movies, suspense thriller movies, etc.  the actors/actresses (and yes they are ALL amazing) make you feel like you've known them forever. the music is great, there is no bad music in this movie. I will say there are some really good effects. there are many many great scenes in this film. it does feel like a movie that takes place in another life. the movie has a slow, mysterious tone. The book was a little too slow for my taste (I felt like it would have taken me longer to understand it if it had just been a few pages longer), but this film has the same slow, sinister vibe and is just as creepy as the book. There

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's easy to get lost in the noise and just focus on the next film that you will be reviewing. As it is with so many things, the truth is somewhere in between.  My first reviews always are not the first of my thoughts but it is how I felt before watching the film.  a film I will look back at and not be disappointed by the results.  I had this problem with this film and the fact that this film has the title "Kino" gives it away.  Kino is the film that made me want to review it again.  The story is the same as my first review, but it doesn't have the same level of intensity that my first film did.  It doesn't seem that "Kio" has the same type of message that my last film did, but that's okay.  I didn't need to see the message to know that it was a worthwhile watch.   If I had to describe "Kion" it would be to say it was more emotional, more intense than my first.   This time the film starts off slow and you can see it's message coming together.  For someone who didn't get the film in the theatres, I don't see what you did wrong but I think you did.   There are a couple of things I would have liked to have changed on my first viewing of the film (which I will come back to in a second).  1)  This is an issue that is repeated in many films and movies.  My review was a bit short and I had been waiting for more on this movie for quite some time.  As it stands, you can get away with saying that the film was very emotional but you need to give me more.  With my first three reviews, I was looking for a message.  This film was more than that.  From the get go, the message was the most powerful thing in the film and it left me feeling that I needed to go see it again before I finished.   That is something that I will continue to work on with my next three reviews. 2)    2)  I wasn't sure about the use of some scenes from this film. I would like to have seen a scene from this movie in the same scene in the previous film.   I would love to see that scene with a different lead character.  If I hadn't seen this film, I

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  This is my opinion, and if you disagree, then that is up to you, but please don't just disagree with me.  My opinions are not meant to be taken seriously. That said, I will always try to get the facts straight, and I will attempt to be as clear as possible, especially if I don't think I can make my points very well. If you feel something is unclear, please ask. This is a place to discuss movies and my opinions on them.  a Rotten Tomatoes score of 8 or less means I'm not sure how good the movie is. (My first film review in a while)  A movie needs at least a 70% rating on RottenTomatoes.com to be eligible for a Tomatometer score of 7 (best movie).  I have no problem posting this in an open thread, even if people will disagree with it, but you might be asking yourself...  How do you choose which movies you will watch?  Well, first of all, there are several factors that influence my choice. (In no particular order)  a) What do you already know about a movie, and can do it without a movie review?  and  b) If it's available online, do you have the ability to legally purchase it? .  of course, if you haven't seen it, you can't do it.  and if I already know a movie will be good, it makes no difference if it's in a DVD or Blu-Ray release.  with a little more experience, you learn to read the reviews on Rottenbos.net  So, it is really easy for me to do reviews of movies I am interested in. I'll post a review of a movie I've already seen, and in some cases, if it was available, I'll add it to this section.

I know. I haven't seen it but I've heard about it. What was I thinking! The book, however, is very good. It is written by Saul Bellow and is about a man with terminal cancer. When he dies, he is given some of the things he needs to die but then he gets caught up in a plot that will change his life. The whole thing has great ideas, writing, and acting. So I was not sure how much I would like it but the first half was pretty good. The second half was not as good but I did like it. I think I have found my new favorite book. It's the one that makes me wish I had watched more Saul Bockles. I liked "The Red Turtle". I thought it was pretty well acted and had interesting ideas. I loved the ending. I liked it enough that I may just buy it. But I don't want to read it because it is pretty long and there are way too many characters. So that is what I'll have to do instead. I am still not sure if I would have liked the movie. If I did, it would have been much better. The only other movie that I saw in the theater was "The Color of Money". The director, Michael Winterbottom, was making his second movie. He had made a very good one with "Stir Crazy". He made the same movie again and this time he did it very well. This movie didn't really appeal to me. But that is OK. I was pretty bored. I watched it and then went home to read more. So it was a mixed bag. "The Tree of Life" I liked. It had a very interesting theme. The story was interesting. I don´t think it made me think but it did entertain me. I will probably watch the next one too. I didn't think it was as good as the first but I enjoyed it
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________, then I will see it. __________, then it is a ________.   "I wish you a good day. I will be back in 20 minutes."   A positive review is a message to the viewer that he should expect the movie to be a pleasant, even good movie. The positive review creates expectations in the viewer. If a film does not meet these expectations the film will not be seen by many people.  , but this is the way it works. If you do not have a positive opinion about a movie you are not going to see it again.  So I will give this film a positive rating. It did not have great visual effects and the acting was average, but it did not fail to meet its goals. It was a solid, fun and interesting film.  a very good example of why it is important to have a good story. It is one thing to make a great movie, but another thing entirely to tell a good, well written story. The plot was well written and the characters all have a very realistic, believable background.

So when I read this script, I just felt so many things were missing, and it felt like it wasn't very deep or good. I guess I don't know if this is the movie I wanted to write, but it's at least a good starting place, I'm just going to do what I did and start writing another movie.  My original idea was for this movie to have been filmed in a park, where all the people and animals were acting like kids. I wanted this movie really to be like a playground movie. It would also have been the first film I wrote to go into the actual details of the animal kingdom and how we see them. It's just really great to know that I'm not crazy! I'm so glad I could get some ideas from this script! I've been wanting to write a movie about animals. I think this is what I needed to get started, as this script had a really great start and I thought it would be awesome to see more animal movies!  This script definitely is very funny! I think the movie is very different from most other animals movies I've written, as I think it would have been better if they were just filmed in the park as they are. It also has a lot more to it, like being able to really look at the animals in a different light.  as a result, I think we got to the point where the kids in the film were just in on the joke, but I don.t think it worked. It was a good idea and I had a great time writing it, but at the same time, I don' t think it works as well as it would if it was done as a more realistic movie. There were other ideas I had for the movie that just weren't as successful as this one. I definitely learned a lot from this one, though! , which I'm writing for Nickelodeon. I really wanted this to be my first feature film, and this movie seemed like it could be an excellent starting place. It is a really fun, funny, and action-packed movie. I'm actually

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Tweet  "Crazy"  is the sequel to "Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior". It's another great film that proves that the series has a lot more to offer. It was made to be a trilogy, but "Mad" was the most fun of the three. It's a great, action-packed movie that will keep you in stitches. If you haven't seen the first two "Madmax" films, do it now. You won't regret it! It's worth the extra money, the time, and you will enjoy the trilogy for years to come. "Crazy", along with the other "MadMax" films is worth seeing. It shows the franchise has a rich world, and that they don't take themselves too seriously. This is a very serious movie. It has great action, great action scenes, and a great plot. The third "MadMAX" film isn't a great entry in the series, but it's still a good entry in Max's adventures. You can't go wrong with "Mad". (5/5) The Blu-ray is packed with extras. There are a ton of extras on this DVD, but the one I found the most interesting was the "MADMAX: The Ultimate Guide to Mad Max" featurette. It gives a detailed look at each of the films. I love the "Mad MAX" series, so it was great to see that the movies have been thought out and are very thought out. The "Mad max: Beyond Thunderdome" featurettes are great too. The first gives a look at the filming of the first film. The second film was shot almost entirely on video, so that's a real treat to see. The final film gives a complete look at Mad Max: Beyond the Wasteland, which is also a real thrill to see! I found the Audio commentary to be great as well. It really goes into detail about how all of the "madmax" movies came about. Some of it is really fun to hear, and it's pretty entertaining. Mad Max: Fury Road is a great movie. The story is extremely well thought out, and the action is amazing. The special effects are impressive. The cars, explosions, and set pieces are wonderful to see and experience. The soundtrack is great. It gets better the more you watch it. If you haven-t seen any of the MadMax movies, now is the

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   Write a negative review about an old movie:   *I've been a lifelong fan of the movies I've seen. So, yes, I've experienced many highs and lows. I've watched the best, the worst, and all of it. I have my favorite and my least favorite movies, which means that, even though I can't claim to be "good" at it, I still enjoy it a lot. I find that watching movies can be pretty lonely at times. But when I watch a great movie, I'm instantly transported into the characters, into their world, into the story. So I am often very surprised that other people don't seem to enjoy the same thing that I do.  *My wife and I, who have a combined age of 65 years, are not in the movie-going business at all. We love to enjoy a nice meal at our favorite restaurant or we go to a movie and have a good time. We are not movie-goers at all, and we don't want to be either. We don't really go to movies to be entertained. I know there are many people in the world who go to the movies to have fun and laugh. I would never tell someone how to enjoy themselves, or even what to enjoy. But I do know one thing: I enjoy films that leave me wanting to come back for more. I like movies that leave you wanting to know what will happen next. I enjoy movies that make me feel good, make me smile, and leave me with a big smile on my face. I also enjoy films with lots of characters, and I appreciate how the characters change in the story each time you watch it.  (But don't be afraid to look at movies that aren't great. I will still love you regardless.)  I think it's important to remember that there is no right answer when it comes to enjoying movies. And that's okay. ,  Kathy

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ Why are you rating this movie?  How much will this movie be worth when it's all over?  is this a good deal?   If I watched this movie before, would I like it? , why is this movie worth watching again?, is there anything I could have done to improve on my previous viewing?   The movie starts off in a very cool way - there's a nice little sequence of a very attractive woman walking along the beach, admiring the view of the water and the waves, then suddenly something happens that throws her into terror, and her hair starts flying. She has a nervous breakdown and runs off screaming. Her hair then stops flying, and then starts flying around the area, just in case she's caught again. As the story progresses, the "real" story develops, as the woman becomes a doctor who has been having bizarre hallucinations. She's being chased, but can't tell which direction is the best way to get away from the pursuing cops, so she runs up and down the beach in a futile attempt to avoid them, until finally, after much torture, she manages to convince herself she's not crazy after all. Then she tries to tell them that it's just a dream, but that doesn't work either. She decides she's had enough of this, and tries to leave the scene, but the cops stop her and take her away. Now we meet her colleague, Professor Frink. He's an old professor who has made it his life's work to help scientists discover how to change their personalities into whatever they want them to be. He spends a lot of time on his island, trying to help his own personality, but he's very, very unhappy. He thinks that when he loses his own ego, he'll feel much more content and even happier. This just isn't happening, and he's convinced there is something wrong with him. So when he sees that his friend is in serious trouble, he decides to go and try to help him. He gets there just as his friend gets in a terrible accident. He makes his way to the beach to check on his friend's condition. Just as he's about to do that, Frink sees something moving at the beach where they were just standing, and it's a shadow moving across the sand. Suddenly Frink, who has suddenly lost all interest in his friend, decides to stop and inspect the shadow. He sees that it is not a shadow at all

I saw this movie a few years back and it was awesome.  2. They're so cute  3. This movie is a bit confusing at first. ,,,,,,  4. There were scenes that were too fast for my taste, but that is to be expected with a slow paced movie like this. 's(movie) are about a little girl and her big sister that was born with two different bodies and they live with their parents, the big sister who is born a male and the little sister who's born a female, and they are very close. As a little kid, she and her little sister were very shy of people. One day, they go to their first day of school and they saw a girl who looked like them with a boy, and so they thought that they are one of them, and one day, one day they saw the guy who is their big sister. Their mom then tells them that they've got a big sister and that she's the one that she loves, and also that they're sisters.    It was really awesome. They are so cute, and their relationship is really cool. The whole film is really sweet. I loved the little scenes between them. The way they relate to one another really made this a really nice movie, especially in the middle part where they get to know each other more.   'Dollhouse' is a little bit confusing for some people, since it's about a couple of people who don't want to tell their parents that they have a dollhouse in their home. Their mother does know, but they really don't wanna be so open about it with their family.  's(Doll House) is actually a thriller. I really loved the way it was shot. The character's (the little sisters) had a really creepy relationship with one another. I felt like they were really cute, but at the same time they're so shy of each other, and there were some scenes where the little sisters were really scared, and the main character was a bit scared as well. I loved how it ended.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ "The thing about the human race is that we have the capacity to kill, and we have this innate urge to kill. It's a part of our nature. So the question becomes: How much of that does the human brain have to do with how much of the human life is actually worth living?" -Mitch Hedberg The human mind is an incredible device. Our brain has a certain capacity to process information and the ability to learn. However, the human mind will often take over when something or someone has a "strong emotional effect". That can be a parent, spouse, or even someone you care about. This could be an accident, or it could be a tragedy. What happens when the human psyche is pushed beyond that limit? If it is pushed far enough, there are a host of psychological and spiritual problems that can result. The film "The Matrix" features a young Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, who has a choice to make in the middle of the night when the world around him is destroyed. In a sense, Neo's decision is akin to an "impossible" choice as it's like someone telling a cat to kill a mouse. However Neo's mind does not allow him to choose that way, and so he chooses that which is right, the one that will allow him (or her) to become the person he was meant to be. This is the difference between a human and a machine. A human may choose to kill to survive, but a machine does not have that option. In this case, Neo was forced to make that choice for him, but also for the people he cared for, and he made the best decision he could at the time. Our Minds are a Powerful Tool If you know a lot of people who are self-critical and perfectionistic, this is not a film for you. While this type of person can be very annoying, it does not mean they are bad or incapable of taking risks. What it means is that this type has a tendency to be overly critical, and too much of a perfectionist, with the idea of never making a mistake or being perfect. However the truth is that there are always mistakes and it is only by being honest with ourselves, learning from our mistakes, and growing as a person that we can achieve success. Another person that can sometimes cause issues is someone that is "negative" or has a negative attitude. While these people may be annoying, they

I think that it will be a great film for many generations to come. You will definitely have a pleasant experience."  This is the best movie I have seen in a very long time. The story was very interesting and the performances were all great. I would recommend this film to any and everyone who enjoys movies.  —Jordi Mestre, Paris, France  A very important film. , by Ingmar Skjoldbø  The movie is wonderful. Very original. It is good that they are using the first film as reference, instead of the complete second one. But the story is so interesting. There is great character development and there is nothing ordinary.  "A Man Escaped" is great. There are some great actors (Lars Eriksen, Lene Mark Jensen, Peter Håkansson and Johan Renæs) but most of the movie I am watching is directed by Peter Højgaard who is just really great. . The most interesting scene is when the villain and the hero meet. I was also quite surprised to see a lot of new characters, like a little girl who wants to become a nurse but can't because her mother has died.  a very good film "A man escaped" and the best of the trilogy. I recommend this to everyone who like great cinema. This movie is very good. I am really glad to know that Ingmar is interested in a new film series and this is the third film of the new trilogy. A great movie for all time!  .

I guess it was the coolest thing I'd ever seen, and it's probably my least favorite version. The new stuff looks a little more polished and "good", which is really cool for me. I still prefer the original ones to the new one, if that's at all possible.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ (Note that I have not yet seen the movie)  "Good Movie Bad Movie"  How do you rate a movie that you've just seen? You can rate it positively or negatively by rating a point from 1 to 5. The higher the point is, the better the movie is. If your rating is 5 or lower, then you probably shouldn't have seen it. You may have had an experience or some good memories associated with the movie, but the quality of the movie you saw isn't what made you want to see it again. If the rating is 4 or 5, then it is probably not a great movie but one that you might enjoy if you do.  Here's an example of rating a movie:  Movie 1: 2-3 Points: Movie 2: 3-5 Points: This movie isn't all that great, but if I can rewatch it, I will. Movie 3: 4-5 points: If I can't wait to watch the movie again, then this movie is worth watching again. Movie 4: 4 or better points: I'm glad I watched this movie and can re-watch it whenever I want. Movie 5: 5-6 points: This is a good film, but it would have been better if the characters were more interesting.   The average rating is 1.2 (1 point for every 1 of 5)  in terms of what you can get out of a movie. You could see the movie many times, and you will never get as much out of it as with the above example. , but this is just the average score for a given film. Many critics use this method.  of what the average viewer gets out of each movie they see. The more you saw the movie the more you will like it. For example, if you saw a movie last weekend you probably enjoyed it more than you thought you would. Now you could watch the same movie next weekend and you probably won't enjoy it as much as you did the first time. However, the average rating of each viewer is much lower than the average for a film. The average rating for a movie is 1 (1 of 5). The viewer will get out less out of the same film than a critic (who has seen the film 100 times and gave it a 5 rating) would. You can use the average user score (as described above) to give the score of a given movie. :, but
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I was just reading a book on how the movie 'Dazed and Confused' was released, and it was mentioned that this is one of the movies that was filmed at the same time that the music video was released. In it, a couple of teenagers are on a date at a bar. This is one scene that makes my mind go 'wow, that sounds like me,' and I thought this movie was a great representation of how we are. This movie was filmed when the movie was only a few months old. The movie is actually in the film library at school and I'm still in the process of trying to get into it. The people who make the movies are great, they understand what I'm looking for. It's a great place to start.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The truth will set you free - Henry Miller   (And I know this quote is very clichéd, but this movie had a huge influence on me in the beginning. I was watching a movie called 'A Tale of Two Cities' and my friend who was also an artist was telling me about this movie and it seemed to be like it had a big impact on him and he said it reminded him of something he saw in that movie. So in a way, that movie reminded me of some important thing. But I think that one of the reasons that movie is so great and it was made back then and has a big influence is that it is a real work of art. And I think the movie 'Funny Games' is a pretty good movie too.)

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ A movie is only as good as its worst critic. For the sake of my career, I had to write an essay on how I was the worst critic of the movie "Aloha". I was absolutely thrilled when the movie came out and sold out theaters. And, I did love "Alamo", especially during that time, when it made a lot of sense to me. But there were many issues. Some of my critics hated the movie because it made fun of people who were too good to work in a casino. They said it was racist, and that I was being hypocritical in a movie that was about the dangers of casinos. The movie actually wasn't so much about casino workers as it was about people who wanted to be in the casino. It was an amazing example of how a small movie can tell us a huge story about the way we live and think in this day and age. It taught me a lot about how to write a film script. And the truth is, there's no way a writer can ever know how a person feels about a film in his or her heart until after it's finished. The best way to learn that is by watching the movie. Aloha was made and financed by Michael Bay. His biggest mistake was that he made me into the worst, most judgmental, and mean-spirited critic of "Alola". As for "Laputa: Castle in the Sky", that was a movie I loved and that has done such an enormous number of good things. So it's hard for me to say how people feel about a movie, but what I've learned is that the movie I'm most interested in seeing is the one with the biggest audience. The audience for "Coraline" was about 90% girls. It's a big movie for me, but I'll probably never get to see the film, so it's okay for me. The fact that you didn't get to watch it has nothing to do with the fact that it's bad. It has to do more with the lack of love I feel for the story of "Cherry." I will continue to look for movies that will give me the biggest bang for my buck. I think I will be a great "movie" critic someday, but until then I can only offer my advice and watch out for bad movies, because they're my favorite. I read the movie reviews for "The Last Jedi" and I was very disappointed. I liked "Star Wars

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The plot of my favorite movie is not interesting enough to write a review about. _________ I want to write about how good it is (my favorite movie of all time): _____________ The reason why the film is so good is, no, the reason why it is so wonderful is because it is such a perfect example of a movie that has all the key qualities of a classic, yet it is not a classic.  This is what a classic is:  This is the kind of movie you think you know and you have seen many times before, yet you just can't get enough of it. A classic is a movie you can get addicted to.  One that has a plot that you can follow (and that will be familiar to many viewers).  A movie that makes you believe it is worth watching just because it contains a great story (or, a story you never thought you would like).  The most classic, however, is not the movie that most people have seen before, it is the movie you have never seen before and have never thought about again, or the movie where the story is so incredible that even to this day you will never, ever watch another movie in its place (and you will probably never forget the experience). This classic would be one that is so amazing, you could watch it a dozen times over, yet never get tired of it; a movie so amazing it changes how you see the world. I want you to think back, however briefly, to the first time you saw that movie. ______________________________  I can't wait for you to watch the film with me, to feel the magic I described above.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  I like a good film: ________________  ______________  ______________________  for the first two examples of "a good film", the answer is pretty clear. However, if you give me the last two examples (for instance, "a bad film" or "a mediocre film"), I can't seem to decide what the correct answer is. In the first example, the answer (1) has a definite sense, but I just don't have a clear idea what it means. In this example, there are two ways I can think of the answer, which I guess is the right answer. But what exactly does it mean? Is there any way I can better convey my thoughts about this movie? Or do I need to go find some literature and get some more specific answers? I'm looking for an answer, so I hope someone can help me with this. Thanks in advance. --John  Dear John,  You needn't find a book or a reference manual to figure out what to answer (or what to choose) for any of the examples you give. In fact, you can begin answering the questions in that way from the very first moment. All you need to do is remember one thing: When you're thinking about a movie, your first question is:  "What am I watching?"  If you don't find an answer to that, then your next question is not "What is it?" but: , "Is it worth my time?," or: 'show much longer do I have to wait?"  the last of which, as you can see, is a kind of yes-or-no question. If you think of an answer (e.g., "Yes, it's good," or "No, it isn't good"), the next question to ask is: "Which?" In other words, "How do I know if it is good?" In each of the first three examples you gave, your answer was probably "Yes." But you were still looking for the right word, which you came up with as follows:  as in the first four examples; not as in as in "a picture"; "not" as in when the subject is a noun; not (of course) "as in the last example"; and not as when you have a pronoun, as in this case. I'm glad you found it so easy to find an adequate answer in the next few examples

In the middle of the river, they stumble upon an old man and his pet cat, who both offer to lead the tribe in the water. The old man takes them to the top of a waterfall. There, he explains to the two creatures how to survive, while they watch with amusement, as the tribe splashes around in the rushing water.")  5.

Try to write a review in as much detail as possible: If the movie is a long one, it's probably a good idea to write about what you were thinking at the time.  Other tips:  the movie should not be a total horror story; the film is supposed to be entertaining. -Write about the things that are good and bad about the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been meaning to review The Raid: Redemption for a while now, and I finally got the chance to watch it the other day.  After watching the film, I was left wondering where I'd seen this film before.  The Raid:  Redemption is one of those films that I've never really seen before. When it first came out back in 2010, I thought it was really great, and to this day it has remained one of my favourite movies.  It's got a great story and action, and the character dynamics are really cool. I'd never seen this story before. The story, of course, is centered around a group of Chinese police officers who are sent to eliminate a dangerous gang in a city called Hong Kong. When they arrive they are greeted by a group (and the film goes on to show us how much bigger the "gang" is) of criminals.  The Raid is the first film in a trilogy that will be released in the next few years.  I've seen a lot of martial arts films over the past 10 years, but this film was unlike anything I had seen before it. The movie was a bit rough around the edges, and it had a few flaws, but it was a fun movie to watch at the very least. The film is really funny, but in a "this is going to make a great animated movie" kind of way.   It really showed how much the martial arts genre has grown, and this film certainly has grown in that department.   The story of the film is pretty straightforward.  These are the guys, the cops, trying to take down the drug lords who they're told are running the city.  But, like a lot, the plot of the movie is very straightforward. There's a lot going on. There is a lot that's going to keep you from getting too involved, but I did get involved.  This film is a bit of a mixed bag.  There's also some flaws, and some things that aren't great, but the end result is a fun film.  Overall, it's a really fun film to watch, and is definitely one of the better movies out at the moment.  And, unlike many other martial arts movies, The Raid has a lot to say, and a lot more that can be done with it.  If you are a fan of the genre, then you'll probably enjoy The Raid. If you haven't seen it,

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  No matter how bad a movie is, if you leave a positive comment about it, people will appreciate it. Also, remember that the only way to learn is to look up something, so even if you don't like a movie, find someone who did.  1) The Mummy Returns  It's the sequel to the original 1981 movie, but it is the only movie I can think of that has a completely unrelated story. I can't tell you which movie is related to the other because it didn't occur to me to look for it on the box. All you have to do is go to Wikipedia's summary and you'll find it. And yes, the movie that's in this summary was the first one I saw, and the only one that wasn't awful. I had only seen it because I had a hankering for a good mummy movie. The first one is one of those movies that you have no idea what to expect and it's good when you do.  "You're not a mummy."  And the movie itself is good. A great mix of humor, action, and some of the best special effects of the '80s. This movie is about a guy who stumbles on a tomb full of sarcophagi. He decides to open the sarcophagi up and the mummy inside comes out of it and starts eating him. You know, mummy action. It has the same kind of silly humor, but the special effects and costumes have improved significantly and it never gets old. The best thing about this movie is that it is one big adventure movie with a whole bunch of weird, fun creatures and monsters. Even the mummy (the one who looks like a normal guy) is a lot like a little kid. . , but I've seen the original film a hundred times and each time I was entertained in some way. The thing that makes this sequel so great is that the characters and the plot are all completely different. The only thing that ties the two movies together is that they both take place in Egypt. The original movie and its sequel take place centuries earlier, and while the mummy is not a part of the plot, he does show up later. So this movie could be a good entry point for newbies, and even a good way to see what the first movie was all about. I don't think it would be a mistake to see the original one first because it has a ton of action

This is a perfect example of how a film is supposed to feel. This film is set up to make the viewer cry and feel so many emotions, and yet it manages to make you laugh, and have a sense of accomplishment afterwards. I've never had a film make me cry or feel so happy before, and I think that that is what makes this film so special. The cast of characters are so good that the film can make you really relate to the characters. The characters are all so likable, and they all have their moments. The two leads are perfect. You could watch this film for hours, and the characters will remain likable. I really enjoyed this film, and it's so enjoyable that I'm sure it will be seen a thousand times.  If you're like me and like something that makes you happy, you should absolutely watch this. This movie was amazing and had me hooked all the way through. I can't wait to see what's next for this series. P.S.  Here are the pictures I took of the movie.  I think they were pretty awesome too :P

If it is the first time you have watched a western and didn't like it, then I recommend that you watch this movie. The western is one of my favorites. It really did it for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ It was a wonderful experience making this movie. This movie is truly unique because the whole story is not told in one continuous shot but rather three short story segments. The main character of the film is a young girl named Natsuko who, after being abandoned at a refugee camp, meets two other young girls who are also orphans. They meet a man named Hiroko who has lived all his life in the refugee camp and who, unlike them, has been able to find a decent job. In the end, they all leave the camp, reunite and have to survive on their own. Natsume is a very nice and sympathetic character, I found him the only real protagonist in the movie. The movie is very atmospheric and has a great theme, which is the importance of family. The music is really beautiful. It is very emotional and sad, which I personally liked. There were moments in the film that I was completely blown away by the incredible acting of the two main characters. I really can't say anything bad about the acting, especially Hiroko, the main character. Hiroko really was incredible as a girl and as an actor. It would be a shame to end the movie with the main characters standing in a circle crying. It was an emotional and touching ending to a very unique movie. I enjoyed watching the movie and will definitely watch it again at a later time. I recommend you watch the movie, especially if you love movies or even if you don't. The trailer for the movie is below and the full movie is available to watch for free at IMDB. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Hope you enjoyed it!  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You might be the first person to write one of them in a long time! A great movie is like a piece of art in that it is subjective. That's why the best movies are the ones that don't feel like they've been forced in order to satisfy a crowd's demands.  It's the movie that makes you feel like you've seen it before, that makes it your favorite.  So, go enjoy a great movie, the one that makes your heart skip a beat! And, be sure to share it with your friends!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  I really enjoyed this movie. I think it was directed by Mike Mills, and it's just a fantastic movie. It's got an incredible story, a really great cast, and a great story to tell. I know some people will not like it, and I'm sorry about that. That's not what this review is about. It is my review of the film. Please don't take it as a negative review because you don't like the movie. Read the movie, enjoy it and enjoy yourself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Girl from the Future  has a very positive message and the script by Amy Jump and Jenny Berkowitz  is very easy to follow. It's a beautiful story that weaves a lot of emotions. A lot of people are angry and frustrated, and yet I never felt like it was being preachy." "The Girl From the Future is a movie that deserves to be seen. A true original that doesn't make any special promises or offer any guarantees. I think it is the best science fiction movie of the year and I think more than one person will want to see it. This movie is one that must see. My only complaint is that it's not as good as it should have been." "This movie is a marvel. It does a fantastic job at telling a story that is both believable and thought provoking. My heart is still racing when I think about the ending." "If there were a vote on what movie deserves to win, The Girl From The Future would win hands down. I mean, even with all the controversy it has, it's still the perfect movie. In a year where we can't even seem to have a decent sci-fi movie, I'll always hold onto The Girl from The Future as a miracle that didn't get made." "I'm really happy that people are finally seeing this movie because I think its a very interesting and well made movie. It would make a great companion piece to the recent release of Jupiter Ascending. A film that both science fiction fans and those just looking for something new to watch will enjoy watching." "For a movie about people who are "born again" into a futuristic world, The Girls is really pretty and has a fantastic script." "Overall, this was the most interesting and interesting movie I've seen in a while. I was really excited to see what would happen with the movie. Although this movie was a bit short on details, the story was so well told that the movie didn't feel like it had any filler. I really enjoyed watching it as it had some great action sequences that you don't see very often in Sci Fi movies. It also does a great job at explaining some of the more complex concepts in the story. This was a very thought provoking movie that I would recommend to those who like sci- fi movies." "After a long wait, Amy Jump (the producer) finally made a movie I was curious to see. This film has great sci- fie ideas,

Write a positive review about a good movie:     All of the films have been submitted by people with a genuine interest in the movies. All of the reviews have been written by those with a real interest in these movies.  This has allowed us to determine which films we feel are of genuine interest to film buffs. Each film is given a score based on the consensus rating by our team of experts. Films with higher consensus ratings will be seen as more desirable by the team of editors and our team members. If you disagree with a review, please leave a note in the comment section and we'll look into it. We'll also consider whether or not a review has been altered after publication. This year's winners are...  1. The Dictator (2014) - 95%  2. The World of Tomorrow (2014: The Return of the Jedi) - 90%  The DICTATOR is one of the best looking and most entertaining blockbusters of 2014. It features a great cast and the most successful franchise since the original STAR WARS, with a great script from J.J. Abrams, who has been trying to get a sequel since before the film came out in 1983. The movie has been very successful domestically, though it failed to get much international appeal.  in 2015, the movie was remade with the stars of Star Wars: A NEW HOPE and this year saw the release of two new movies. Dictators of the World was also remade in 2015 as a major motion picture starring the entire Star Wars team of actors and directors.   3. The Last King of Scotland (2016) - 89%    The Last King Of Scotland is a pretty old film, though only four years old it has a solid cast of characters, an interesting story and an intriguing mystery. It was released in the middle of a few other movies that were all pretty terrible, including some terrible sequels, but it had some good parts that worked as a good summer blockbuster. It's a good film to watch to see if you've enjoyed the rest of the great DIE HARD releases of the last few years. The last movie we reviewed was also from 2015. If we had to do it all over again we probably would have chosen the last film.   4. The Amazing Spiderman 2 (2016): 88%  the Amazing Spider-Man 2 is arguably the best film in the franchise and the best entry in the whole Spiderman

"I've always liked the idea of trying to keep it under wraps for as long as possible. It takes so much work to make the book. And there's a story to tell there that they wanted to tell on this sequel." Mangold is sitting in his dressing room at the Santa Monica studios, just as his actors, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Michael Fassbender, and Demian Bichir, are getting ready. He looks a little nervous. A few days ago, Mangold called them in to go over some rough scenes with him. He was a little worried that the scene in which Leigh's character, Claire, shoots a man dead might be too graphic for some of them. "They had a discussion about that," he says. "Then they went back to work, and it's a good scene." "They're a real family," says Leigh. "It's very rare for us to work together, but it's great to be a part of it." "I remember reading Charles' book, and I thought it was just amazing. It was really good. I thought, I've got to do this." The film opens with Leigh and Bichrir walking in the street. Leigh is wearing sunglasses and carrying an umbrella. She talks to a guy in the background. "This was a really fun way to shoot it," she says. Bichiri comes over. "Yeah," Leigh says. She hands him an umbrella, and she and Bicheir walk down the street together. "That scene was the first time I worked with Dem

The director gave his characters a lot to do and they were all well rounded and well developed. It has a great soundtrack. I really liked the characters and the plot was well done. I'll definitely recommend this film."  My opinion is the opposite, this movie is terrible and the director is a complete douche. I am not going to give it another chance as I feel that I need to wait to see another one of his films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If the movie is well written and has a lot of heart, the critic will come across as friendly and encouraging, which makes them feel like a good person.  The movie has to be well written to be good, otherwise you will find that all the reviews seem like they are written by the same person.    Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that you should not write a negative review, but try and write a positive one, if you can.   And don't go out of your way to write a good review if it's not appropriate for your audience.  The film has to have a good ending to be a good film and the ending has to give you the closure you want and are expecting.  It doesn't have to be the perfect ending.  One of the most important elements in good film is the film's ending. There are three elements:  A Storyline with Good Characters A Great Ending that gives the audience an Ending They have to match one another.    Good story and characters should be woven through the ending.  A story can be told without a good character, but without a strong ending and the correct ending, you will be left with a bad story.    I am writing this blog because I want to make sure that the people watching these reviews are as prepared as I am for them to give the film the best possible review.  I understand that some people are more sensitive to film reviews and not able to cope with negative feedback, so if you feel like that's the case, there's a lot you can do about it and I encourage you to do so.  There are several ways to cope.  Firstly, you can put down the review and take a long time to relax.  The next option is to take another look at the film.  You can go back to the film and rewatch it a number of times to check the problems you identified, fix them and then review again.  Another option is find a friend, family member or co-worker who is going to give their two cents.   If you don't have any of these people, there are a few other things you can try:  Make sure you have your favourite film in front of you to review. This gives you an easy way to remember what you think the film is about. If you can't get the film out of the mind of your head, just go to a random movie on YouTube

Write a positive review about a good movie:  1.  It's just a movie.    You aren't trying to change anything.  You aren't getting up on stage at the Cannes Film Festival to announce a new release.   No one's asking you to make a movie they're going to like.  And even if they did, you probably can't make a film that doesn't have the director's stamp of approval. 2.  You're not trying to get anyone to like you.  When you are going to your first industry event, do you want to be in a group of guys talking about movie topics or be surrounded by women with their heads in their hands?  You are not trying be the "cool guy" or the "one-woman band" in the group of women with theirs heads in the sand.  3.  Even if you were successful at it, you're still not a movie star.  The "movie star" is the guy who gets all the girls in Hollywood.  I don't know about you, but when I was starting out in the industry, I was one of these guys.  There was a point in my life where it became impossible to be around people without them asking, "What are you doing?  "  4.  Everyone else in the room is working on the same thing as you. You know what they're doing.  For every one guy who wants to make movies, there are a hundred women who are more interested in a good laugh.  It's not as if there's a bunch of guys in Hollywood who aren't interested in something. 5.  If you're trying to be a movie actor, you have no choice but to act.  Because otherwise, why would anyone pay you to act?  6.  Acting is something that you do.  No one asks you what you're up to.  7.  All your work as a movie Actor is for nothing.  Why did you even bother to be an Actor?  8.  Stop trying to become a film actor.  Seriously.    9.   Acting has no place in the real world. You are never going to get cast in a movie unless they are casting for a film, not for you. 10.  Sure, some of us have to be actors.  But it's not because we want to work in a film studio.  11.  Actors are the lowest of the low. The ones
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I don't know how the other reviewers are liking this movie but I really enjoyed this movie. This movie was made for kids but there is some adult themes in it as well. The movie is just funny to look at and the kids and adults can appreciate it. This is a family friendly movie so no kids should watch this movie because it is not for kids. I don`t see much of this movie in the theaters but I like it to come out on DVD. There are lots of action and fun to be had in this movie so kids and families can enjoy it. The ending was pretty awesome and you could see the ending to the movie coming. Also, I am so happy that the director was able to take this movie to theaters and I think it is worth the price. I highly recommend this movie and I would highly recommend to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "The only way you can understand my filmography is from a visual standpoint, and if you've ever seen the films of my peers, you know that there is much that can be achieved through visual presentation alone." - Christopher Nolan  - Christopher Nolan "The only thing I could really find fault with was that the film really needs to focus more on the characters, not their actions or the actions of their enemies." - Richard Linklater  The movie I want to review is:  Inception  Rating: 8.5/10  THE IMPRESSION  It's no secret that Christopher Nolan is a huge fan of the films that were directed by Stanley Kubrick. It's not surprising that he picked a film that he thought would be perfect for the man who changed the way we look at movies. When Inception came out, it was a huge success and went on to become one of the biggest films of all time, selling over $200 million in a weekend. When it was released, the film did not exactly come out of left field. Nolan was known for his films about computer games and he wanted to bring the same intensity to the film, which resulted in a movie that's a perfect blend of both reality and fantasy.  Set in a fictional version of the year 2015, the story follows a group of people whose lives are constantly being controlled by a computer program that's created by a man named Cobb (Christian Bale). Their lives are made more complicated by the fact that the programmers who created Cobb also created a digital replica of their creator's family. When they are taken over by the program, they are no longer able to access their families.  and it's a bit of a mess. In fact, it's almost impossible to take a story like this and make it work as a film. There is no real plot, there's no real motivation for any of the characters. The movie starts out with a big reveal about the identity of the man that created Cobb, but that reveals more than you can imagine. The first half of the film takes place in a dream world where the characters are living in a house with a bunch of toys, like a little girl and a baby car that's got the steering wheel inside. At the end of the dream, we discover that the toys are all real. They are the family members that Cobb had kidnapped years before and now wants to return. But it's not easy to get the

If you are happy with the movie and you would like to share this rating with others you may use the feedback form. However, be sure to read our Terms and Conditions. It's important you know about our privacy policy before providing feedback. This will ensure that only our valued visitors can use the comments section.  A quick reminder for those new to the site: We only accept movies rated 'A' (Excellent) or 'B' (Good) on the IMDB rating system. All the rest of the movie titles are considered 'R' (Rereleased in Other Formats). If you don't see a movie you like on our site, it's because it doesn't have an IMDB Rating yet. The site will be updating all the movies at the rate of two a month. The site is completely free, and the only payment is for the movies themselves. No other fees, no gimmicks, no ads, and no bullshit (well, maybe a couple). This is just how we like it. So, how do you get started? I recommend you read this very well-written blog post from our resident movie experts, and then, if you're still skeptical, click on the 'Subscribe to our mailing list' link on the top right side of the site (where the'sign up' button used to be) and then follow the instructions. As we all know, email is the devil. However I think this will help get you started! If the movie is not in a language you speak and you want to help, just tell me and we'll work something out. The movie review system will send you every time there's a new review or a new movie in the list, and that's it. Once a movie is added to our site the reviews will be added to the IMDb database and you can search for the movie there. As for the ratings system, it is based on a simple formula. Each movie that has been rated by a user has an average rating of +2.00, and every other movie has an overall average rating that is multiplied by -1.00. This ensures that there's never a lot of movies that are rated 'C' (Poor) or worse. This system allows you to easily compare movies to one another.

One of the best scenes I have ever seen in a movie was the opening.   a movie that I will always watch on my birthday. I love this movie, because it shows what life is all about. I also love the story line, because you get to see how a good person can be turned bad and the bad person can turn good. If you have watched this movie in a few years and still love it, it may mean that you don's have a new sense of morality or at least a sense that you have learned something from this movie.   the characters are well done. They have real human feelings, and they make you feel for them. They are like real people, not just caricatures. I mean even the bad guys, when they do something really bad, you can feel bad for them, because they don't want to die. I know a lot of people don't think this movie is a great one, but the acting is better in this movie than any movie I have seen.  The songs in the film are very good. I loved the music, which was composed by Stanley Donen.    the movie itself. It is a story of a group of soldiers who go through some difficult things. When they are fighting their war they become more kind and accepting to each other. I really liked this movie because there was some realism. The characters were like real human beings, not like caricatures made up by the director to make them seem better than they really are.  . There are no cheesy jokes in the story, but there are a few jokes that just didn't work. I suppose you can argue that this movie had no real story to tell anyway, so why bother? If the movie is not really that good, why even bother?

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I love it when a good film goes downhill (especially a bad film). And it is always a good sign to see someone like this who goes to the mat when he thinks a bad review is a waste of time. He was kind enough to share a film that I think everyone needs to see - "Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back." I will give it away to whoever writes the most positive review. Thank you, Mr. Fassbender! I'm sorry but the film was terrible and a huge rip off of the original. It was not even remotely interesting. The special effects were atrocious as well. It's like George Lucas was sitting in his castle and he decided to make an epic space battle film. And he decided "Who do I hire to direct this?" and he went for the "most famous person ever to do any kind of role." And he got the "Most Famous Person Ever To Do Any Kind Of Role" for the most obvious reason - he's George Lucas. He is the one that decided to put his name on it and he's the one who hired the director - who is the same one who did the original - and they hired the same person to write it. It just was not a very good film.

I would love to have an official site with reviews, but I am going to hold off until I can get this stuff figured out. Thanks. ____________________________________________________________  I don't know what the hell this is, but it's a damn fine movie. There are plenty of great movies out there, and this one, while not great, is really well made. The acting is very good (though it has its faults), and the characters are well developed. I won't give too much away about the plot, but if you have any interest in boxing, then this is a must see. There is a reason it's the #1 movie on BAMF and why the folks at Showtime chose to take this movie. The action scenes are outstanding, and the script is great. I'd highly recommend it to anybody who is interested in boxing. You can buy the DVD, or check it out on Netflix. Thanks for watching and I hope you all enjoy the movie. __________________________  beth-godden@hotmail.com

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ This movie did a great job in showing us how the different types of men are in this world. It shows how men deal with their problems when they're faced with their own insecurities and failures. I'm not saying you have to like it, but it does a great work in showcasing different types men can be. A movie that has more of a sense of urgency than the previous one, and is able to show us men in the worst of situations and show us the worst side of men that you don't always see out in the street. It does a lot of great things in a very short time. The pacing and editing really does a fantastic job at creating a world that is filled with so many different characters and it has a very dark sense of humor that was great to see. I really liked the story and the fact that we see so many situations and different characters. I have seen the movie multiple times and it still holds up today and really made me feel like I was there for a certain time. It's really worth checking out if you enjoy this type of story or if you just need to see the world through the eyes of a young man and how he deals with the difficulties he's in. It makes you feel like you're in an environment that you might live in and make you want to do something to change that environment. It is a great story that shows the things that men do in the middle of it all. It definitely made me want to make sure my sons grew up knowing that it's not easy out there but you have good men that will always look out for you and support you when you need it. This movie is a must-see for all men and is definitely worth your time and money!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Loading... About this film  If the script is good, they'll give you money for your writing. They'll even give you an advance, but it's mostly to get the script and make sure it's good.  This is a group of women who have been making indie films in NYC for a long time. They get together to discuss and promote each other's work.  (The story behind the film is pretty funny.)  We're talking about all kinds of different films and their stories and ideas and styles. - What is the process like to get a script made?  I think most people think "I can get a screenplay done with a script by" and that's totally the case. In many cases, I will have a script that I've already written, and I will be working with a team of people to get it on the page. I'll be talking to them about the project, the story and the characters. The screenplay usually has all the elements needed. But the people in the group, even though they're all professional writers themselves, they are also like a small writing team. They are there to make sure the screenplay makes sense and is in line with the tone of the script we all have in mind. So in many cases I will just write a script and present it to them to give them some feedback. "You're talking to a team, right? That's nice. And what do you mean,'make sense'? I don't understand that," I'm thinking.  in most cases they will write the script as we discussed the scene and will get a response back that will show that the scene will make sense. ... but it can still be a process of trial and error. It may just mean, "Oh, it makes sense this way." It's also true that sometimes a movie will be written, but the tone just won't work for people, and the film won't come to life. The script, the way the story is told, is really what makes this project come to fruition. If I get a piece of a script where it just makes no sense to me at all, then that's what we'll look at. But I'll know by then what the story needs. And if it's not right, then we'll go back and start over from scratch and create a new movie, and make that film our
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I have never seen a movie that I really enjoyed as much as I loved The Avengers. It was one of the only "superhero" movies that I thought actually worked. It has some flaws, but it also has a huge heart and I enjoyed it as much if not more than I thought I would. The story was so exciting and unique that I never got bored. I know some people don't think it's a great movie because it is kind of a sequel to The Avengers and I understand that, but I was just more impressed with it that the first movie. I recommend you to watch it because it's worth it!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The first is to say that "Cocktail" is a good flick, and to say the very same thing about "The World According to Garp." I don't understand how I wasn't expecting a whole lot more from either film. "Coke Land" is an unmitigated disaster, "The Road to Guantanamo Bay" is just plain dull, and "World According to Gore" is as boring as it is boring and as silly as it possibly can be. "The Wind" is better than either of the others, but "The West Wing" isn't really one to watch with your buddies unless your friends are equally bored and if they're not then you're either a sucker for humor or a sucker who needs to do his own work.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________  "I thought this was the greatest movie of all time. In the movie, we see our own future. But unlike other movies of this kind, our future is one we can influence. This movie is about how we will be able to take control over the world that we have created for ourselves.  I felt that the movie has some sort of a message. It's about how our actions now have an effect on the future. And for the most part, I like that message, although the movie is more of a thought-provoking film than a realistic one." (J.F.) "I thought the movie was very interesting. The movie was not only a message, but a message of hope. The message was that we can create a better world and that's what it's all about, to create a more peaceful world." (C.J.) "It was an emotional movie for me. It had a very uplifting message. A message that you can actually influence your own future." (S.B.) "In an ideal world, this movie wouldn't be made. The problem is that it takes place on the verge of a global war, and people don't realize it. But you know it's a possible future."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________  Reviewer: chazchick - favorite favorite favorite - August 15, 2011  Subject: Not as Good as The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Not as good as the man from unexcl,l-le-e. Was it a better film than the second film? I don't think so, although there is a lot of good stuff in it, including some great scenes. It's a good look at a military pilot. The man from Unexcl.l-Le-E is a good film too, but I prefer Man from u.N-C.I.L.. - August 19, 2011Not as Good As The Man From U.U.CL.I..  Rated: Rated R for pervasive strong sex scenes, and some violent images This film is certainly rated R because of its content. However, this film has been compared to "Man from UNA-L.U-C L.E." which is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen.   The movie starts out with an ex-marine pilot in the Philippines who is going through a very hard time. As the war progresses, he begins to lose his sight and is forced to return to the U.S. - where he finds a good wife and family. The wife and children are all grown up and have grown used to their father. However the man wants to go back to his country and be with them again, but is told by the military that it is too dangerous. After the family is moved to another country, he still has to return.  , but it doesn't take long to see that he is in for a nasty surprise. The movie was made to be viewed as a PG-13 film and is pretty graphic. However it is not in anyway a child porn movie - the main characters are adults and the scenes of sexual intercourse are not graphic in any way. What it is is a story of a man who wants to be back with his family after years of not being able to see them. But this time he finds himself in a situation where there is no other choice for him. The film is about what happens to him when he finds out that his family and the people in the country he is going to, are being tortured. The woman in the movie was my favourite actress, she was very good and she gave some great lines.  . I enjoyed the story, and

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________   What I think: __________   in which she tells how she loves this movie, it's brilliant, and this will definitely make it in the annals of her favorite films:   Quote: You know who else loves this film? Your mother. I remember the first time I saw this film. You had a very beautiful appearance and your hair was long and perfectly done. I could tell that your mother was an artist and an actress, not a real person. This film was the greatest thing I have ever seen. I loved it.  "The Godfather" (1972)  The great director is now in his 90s, and so we get to see some truly amazing and masterful filmmaking in this classic. . I can't help but think that this is an even more amazing film now in 2015, and if you haven't seen it, I highly suggest you do. (This film is also a part of my personal list, but for a different reason. ) I have to say, I'm in love with this film, even though I'm a woman, and a film buff, and I've had to put up with being called a feminist, and have to see it just to feel a little bit less alone.   It's really hard to explain why this is my favorite movie, but here is a little taste of what it's about:  .  's love story:.  .  the best scene in any movie ever:  .   The Godmother's love scene:.   . the best part of any movie:    .   (and yes, she is wearing a bra, but I'm not going to tell if you don't want to know. )   And finally,   The Godparents:   the best ending in any film ever:  (If you're wondering where the "a" comes from, it is actually a tribute to the Godfathers, so there you go.)   So, I have now watched, loved, and enjoyed over 200 movies in my life. , but to be honest, I still feel that I've yet to watch every movie. What do you think?  Have you seen every movie that you've watched?   Have any of you ever watched a movie?  The first film I have watched that I liked was the movie,'' by. I didn't really watch it until I had

It is directed by Steven Soderbergh and produced by his son, Matt, and Michael Gross. It stars Al Pacino as Frank Semyon, a former LAPD officer who was arrested in the shooting of a drug dealer. He is released from jail but must return to duty within the next ten days.  The plot follows a drug-dealing scheme involving the LAPD's finest: undercover cops played by Pacino and Russell Crowe. The plot includes a shootout between the cops and drug dealers, a shootout involving the police with a sniper rifle, and a shootout in a casino where a cop's wife is killed. The final shootout takes place at the top of a helicopter with a helicopter gunship hovering over it. The film's style was influenced by "The Godfather" and "The Untouchables".  It received critical acclaim and won several Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. It won the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture in 1997.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  I want to tell you something I've learned in my short life. When I get to know someone who's never been to a movie theater before, I ask them to tell me what they liked about the film. Then I find out that the movie they liked the most was:  Caddyshack. This is what they told me: 'I liked how it was funny, but you can't have fun if it's too long. It's like a two-hour joke, and they don't really get to laugh. That's why you have to have long scenes. That way you get to really laugh. But it's a very simple joke. It wasn't too long, but there were all these long scenes.' This person told me that he felt that it was a joke that went on for two hours. And then, the funny part about it?  The movie was in black and white.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I read a lot of books, and I've watched a lot more films than people think. I find that the books I read are more about the characters and their actions than the plot itself. I think this is how I got into film, reading movies that are like stories. I like stories, but I also like good movies. And for some reason, the best movies for me aren't necessarily the ones I've seen the most. The most rewarding movies for my taste are those I haven't seen, and that have some sort of message, some sort a message that people can relate to. I don't necessarily think that they're all that interesting, but they're still good. I read something recently called How Movie Stars Act, and it basically says that every movie star who's worth their salt, they can be pretty boring. I guess there's a bit of truth to that. Even if you can get away with being boring, there's still some sorta message in there, or an idea that's important to it. So the interesting part is, when you see those stories in movies, you kind of realize, oh yeah, there was a message in that movie, or there was something else going on in that story. And I think it's good for people to see that, but it's probably bad for them to go out and see movies and watch those movies and think, I wanna have something to talk about. They just shouldn't. It's not a good thing to make movies where the plot's so important that it's the only thing you think about in the movie, when really it's just kind of incidental to what you're trying to do. There's other movies where I feel like the message they're trying so hard to get across in the plot, they don't even tell the story. I feel a lot like I have to keep reminding myself to go, "This is about the plot." I don  read a lot. I've got a good book here with a guy named Chris Kraus called Why Reading Matters, and I'm going through his top ten recommendations right now. And his top 10 recommendations, at least in terms of importance to the development of a person, are all books he read, like The Fountainhead and The Grapes of Wrath, or any one of a number of his top 100. I'll just read one more. He has a book called "Gone With The Wind", and he said,

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I can't decide, but this was the most interesting movie I've watched in the past couple years. I love sci-fi, and I thought it was just a bit too short. However, it was still a lot of fun. And the characters were amazing. I can see the characters getting attached to each other, because they were all different and had their own strengths and flaws. And I really loved the concept. This movie had many different plot points, and at the end it was left up to us to decide who should go with whom. I'm not sure who the bad guy was, but I felt like it was a good idea to have the aliens who were the bad guys. They were way more scary than the good guys. But the good guy did save the day. So, overall, it wasn't all bad. And a great movie to watch during summer.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: echoboxing

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________   This week, we're counting down our favorite moments in the film industry. This week, the folks at IMDB give us a quick rundown of the Top 10 Greatest Movies and Movies of All Time. (As you can imagine, the Top 25 are a little harder to choose, and a few of those are included in this week's rundown.) If you need a refresher on what all these things are, the best thing you can do is check out our list of our Top 15 Worst Movies. It's a great place to start if you want to watch some of the most atrocious stuff ever made. Here's hoping that the movie industry finds more movies with better acting, more well written dialogue, and better sound design.  The Top 10 Films  If you're trying to get a list of the best films of all time, it's not a bad idea to use IMDB's top 10 list as a reference. The list is fairly self explanatory, though it doesn't exactly capture the breadth of movies in existence. The first thing you'll notice is that the movies are arranged chronologically from the earliest to the latest. This is the case because most of the films on the list were created in the last fifty years, and they're largely the work of just a few filmmakers. Even a cursory glance at the list reveals this.  (In addition, we only listed 20 of the 30,000 films on IMDB.) It's interesting to think that when we're comparing films from the 60's to the present day, it might be a little more helpful to look at how many directors have been in those films than to just count the number of films they're in.  the lists  Topping the list are five films that will be familiar to most movie fans. , directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks and Christopher Reeve, is the most recent entry in the classic action series (though it was the third in the series, having preceded, of course,. ) In many ways,is a more mature movie than, though the two share a lot of the same elements.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________   I love this movie. It was one of the few non-horror movies I would see from this director. But what makes it special is that I actually cared for the characters. It's hard to really say what's so great about this movie and I'll just say this is a great example of a good horror movie. I really have no issues with this movie other than the music. My problem is that the music is very similar to the original movie and the story is not nearly as interesting. You can tell the director wanted to create a horror movie with a lot of special effects and blood. I have heard the soundtrack has been completely remastered. The music has always been good. It doesn't get the same "chill" as the original soundtrack but that is probably the music's fault.   - Verdict - I really liked this movie for being very original and a horror film with a horror twist. It is a very short movie and not a whole lot is explained. The first time you see the movie, you don't know what to expect and I always felt like it was kind of "tried" on. It definitely is not a horror classic, but it definitely is a good film. It would be great if they made a second one for a Halloween or Christmas. This is one of those "it just worked" horror movies. - Rating - I actually really liked the film but it's got a very bad soundtrack which is disappointing. I also have a lot more issue with the movie's special effects than the movie itself. It seems like the director really tried to create the impression that this was a truly scary film but failed completely.  …

Was there a scene that particularly moved you? _______________________ I cried during a couple of scenes in this movie and I also loved how it ended. I thought the ending was really sweet. Was this a film that was worth watching? ______________ Absolutely, this movie was so funny and I loved it. The writing was good, it was not too preachy or preachy at the same time. It was also a movie with great performances. Do you think this movie would have been as good if it had been made 10 years ago? ___________________________ I love watching movies when they are made today! If this movie were made today I think it would have gotten the same love it did back then. It has great characters, and I am sure if it was made today the audience would have loved it as much as it loved me. It wasn't that long ago that I was watching all of the Michael Bay movies and I thought they were all great. I was surprised that I wasn't more impressed with some of the movies I have seen lately. I will definitely be watching more of these movies to see if there is any kind of improvement.
Write a positive review about a good movie:         For each movie reviewed, I asked my readers to provide ratings that I thought reflected their appreciation for the film. In the case of "Hancock," I did not have a "reviewer's consensus" in mind; rather, I had simply asked for an opinion from readers. I found the results surprisingly similar across demographic groups, although the general consensus was that "Hollywood's Biggest Hit" was a good flick and "Hands of Stone" was okay.  In total, about 70% of the readers I queried had rated "Hustle & Flow" at least a 7. I was most surprised that only 35% of male readers, for instance, rated the film at the top. "Hacksaw Ridge" also received good reviews, and it is probably too soon to tell whether it will match "Hinds" with the top spot this year. "The Edge of Seventeen," with its strong female lead, seems destined to do so. ,

The movie was also more sympathetic and realistic to the characters of the main characters. I liked the direction, and some of the dialogue was good. But the writing was very dull. I enjoyed the plot and the character development of some of my favorite characters, but most of the time it was just a mess of plot lines and characters. The first act is one of the most boring sequences I've seen. It takes the audience through a long exposition section, and then after a few scenes, they see that everything is really going to go wrong. And then they see the gun, and they see it was the murder gun. Then they go back to the exposition, and say "Oh it was all part of a plan". Then they continue to explain how they are all going to be involved in this plot. When we finally see the murder in closeup, it is a very good shot, but the editing makes it look as if the camera were going back and forth from the murder, to the murder victim, back to how the characters are reacting. And this is the point where they say "Well if the murderer was in the car, then where are the police?". So they then show the camera, and it shows that it is in the backseat, but it is the same shot, and there is nothing to indicate it is supposed to be in the front seat. I think this is a mistake, because it is so obvious that it needs to be more clear and less confusing to the audience, than it is. The only saving grace of this movie was that it wasn't in black and white, so I can't tell you how they handled it.  Overall, I would say that this movie is probably better than the book. The screenplay had some great ideas, but in the hands of a much better writer, they could have been a masterpiece. And the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________  It took a lot of effort to get me to see this movie, so I've got a lot to say about it. I liked it, it made me laugh, and it was well-made.   The plot is simple: four friends, all very different in their personalities, go on a camping trip with their parents. They spend a night together, and during the night, things get out of hand as the night turns into a nightmare.  - The two kids from middle school are camping, and there's a very old couple who don't seem to like them at all. At one point they even have a fight, but then they decide to sleep together.     - The girl who just broke up with her boyfriend goes camping with a couple of other friends. She has a boyfriend, but he has been on a date with a girl, and she says she doesn't like that he's dating a girl who works at the park. The girlfriend tells them that she doesn not like that at all, but they're still friends so it's okay.   the girl who has the boyfriend goes home for the night and she's getting ready to go out when she hears strange noises. She goes outside and notices that someone is digging in the ground. Then she sees a little girl who is crying. She wants to help her but the girl insists that she needs to sleep. The girl wakes up the next morning with a bad dream about the girl crying, so she tries to make the boy take her to her friend, but the boy won't go.   that night the girl wakes in the middle of the night screaming and banging on her bedroom door. She runs into her friends, and they come in to find her crying. One girl starts to worry about her because she doesn of had a bad nightmare, and the other girl asks her what's wrong, because she heard a noise and then the girl heard that there were two kids digging.   in the end the girl takes the boy home and the boyfriend comes over to help, but because of the bad nightmare the girl's parents think that she might be possessed by a demon and take her away, but she assures them that's not true. They take her home and tell her that she's a demon that needs to be exorcised, and that the demon is the one who's possessed her. Then the boyfriend tells the girl that she isn't going to hell because her life isn't over.   of

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I love movies, but I'm not a big fan of reviews.  This is an abridged, slightly edited version of a long and fascinating discussion on the film and television industry, as it concerns its relationship to the public. (Thanks to the site that first gave me this idea for this page, who was kind enough to let me quote in part. Thanks also to Mr. G. L. Gore for his excellent comment.)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie: The movie: 'Star Trek: Into Darkness' Star Trek is a fan favorite, but the newest Star Trek movie takes that fanboy culture and does something far more awesome than you could've ever hoped for. I've watched every episode of Star Trek and even the movies, and I don't think I've ever been as immersed in a Star Trek story as I was in Into Darkness.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt that I may not be the best guy to judge a story about a time traveler with the ability to change the past. But I can say this: I'm very impressed with this story and the acting (for the most part) is absolutely great. The only problem I've had with the movie is the end, which feels like a throwaway. -  'Star Trek Into Darkness': The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly  What do we get?  First, we get a great story. As a fan of the franchise, I can't say I saw this coming. As many know, Paramount is going through a rough period of releasing new and old Trek films. They've been trying to figure out a way to make money on these films, but they've hit some pretty significant roadblocks. The reason for the film's delay is because of the effects of a budget that wasn't accurate, but I'm glad they waited to start. They finally got the budget right and the film looks absolutely stunning.  in the sequel, we're treated to a new cast of characters, but it seems to have done a decent job at adding depth to them. With new characters like Spock's mother and Chekov's son, as well as old ones like Sulu, it feels like they have been given more than enough depth to make us care about them.  "We've been dealing with this in the movies for the last 20 years."  Now, you'll notice I didn't list any of the original characters from the first film, but that's because they don't have much to do in this film. They do serve their purpose in the story, but nothing that doesn't exist elsewhere in the Star Trek universe. If anything, it's a relief to know that the first Star Trek films have done an excellent job of fleshing out our universe and giving it a solid foundation, whereas Into Darkness feels as if they jumped in without really knowing what they were getting

But before we go there, let's take a look at another film that has been recently released (not that long ago), and I'll be damned if I can say I'm not glad that I saw it.

I mean come on. Is it really that hard to be original?  Now, I understand that the production of a movie can't be rushed. You need to make sure that you have a great concept and great scripts. But seriously, when was the last time you saw an R-rated horror film that you thought was so damn cool that you were actually surprised that it wasn't just more of the same? When was the first time that you saw a film that actually made you think, "Oh shit, not only was I not expecting this to be as good as it is, but I was actually surprised!"?  (I know, I know. I'm a hypocrite.)  As I watched the film and saw how beautifully shot it was (which I am 100% sure it is because it's directed by Neil Marshall, who is a phenomenal cinematographer) I realized that it was actually more than just a cheesy movie, it was an amazing experience that I wish I would have had more of.  the art style is perfect, the movie is filled with a nice, dark and gritty vibe. The characters are all very interesting and you will easily enjoy this one.  The performances are well written and acted, the screenplay is great (as is the director's commentary) and the special effects are absolutely fantastic. You know that if you are going to see a horror movie, then I would recommend seeing this one (even though it isn't the most scary film you will ever see). It is truly one of the better films I have ever seen, and in my humble opinion, it is one of those films that

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've written that I would like to see a movie with a female protagonist, but that's no more possible than it's impossible. That's why I've written the review for this movie that I did. This is a movie that will remind you of the times when a movie was made for adults and yet had the heart of a child. It will remind that you have seen the movie before. It's a movie you'll be able to watch with your friends and enjoy it as a movie without being the adult. And if that's not enough, this movie is a true work of art. I really enjoyed this movie and I would watch it again and again.  Rating: 5/5

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ Don't worry too much about reviews that are below average, even if the movie is really good. If you don't like a film, or you don'st have the patience to wait for a good review, it doesn't matter how good the film is. I will wait until the next time I see a movie to review it, and probably the next, until I have time to wait. You can't be disappointed every time you go to see a film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ This is the last review I have for a movie that made my day. When I opened the movie in the theater, I was like, "Whoa! This is a really good movie." The acting was just right, the story was interesting, and the pace was perfect. It wasn't like I was reading a book or watching a movie, which is what I usually do when I see a movie with good acting. Instead, I saw a movie where the acting was great. The movie didn't have a climax and was able to leave me wanting more. I have always loved The Twilight Zone. I also love science fiction. I'm not a huge fan of sci-fi movies, but this one was just like a sci-fic movie, without all the sci-fy bits. For example, I can't think of anything wrong with this movie other than the fact that there isn't any aliens and the story isn't very original. However, that's not what keeps me watching it. I will watch anything that is good. As a result, I won't recommend this movie to people who aren't science fiction fans. I did recommend this to my friends who are fans of science fiction, however.

I really enjoyed your review, especially the part where you gave some praise to the movie. ,   To be honest, as much as I enjoyed the book it wasn't like that for me personally. I think the novel had a very different feeling, more like a journey than a linear story, with lots of cliff hangers, and really, what's more interesting than a quest?  The TV show was quite interesting, but the movie had nothing to do with the novel at all, and I found the whole thing quite depressing.   In a way, it was kind of the same with the film, but on a smaller scale.   (and yeah I did enjoy it, there's a lot to be liked in it)   But the biggest problem of it for me is the whole "the war is over, everybody is happy, the world is perfect. And now the universe is destroyed.   of course it could have been much, much better, but it could easily have been worse.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  "You can't put lipstick on a pig. You need something real and substantial."   _________________  In the summer of '73 I was a sophomore in high school, a self-described "dumb" student who hated school, whose girlfriend (I believe) broke up with me, and who had lost my job after two weeks. I wanted to make it big, so I went to a summer job in the office of a major Hollywood studio.   We lived in an apartment on Sunset Boulevard, with five other people who were all doing similar jobs. Our rent was $450 a month. We were allowed to take one friend with us, but he was not allowed in the studio office. I was not very bright, so that job turned out to be a very valuable opportunity.   the first day of work was Monday. We all showed up at the office early to catch a shuttle to work in the morning.  , the driver of the shuttle, was a pretty blonde brunette with dark eyes, and she was one of my favorite girls at the studio. She was very sweet and very kind. We had fun making our way up and down Sunset in a rental car.   a.k.a.   I was always interested in getting to know the people on the set. We talked a lot about the movie, the scripts we were working on, and the movies we were supposed to be working on next. We would often get to the front of the line at the lunch counters to get some free coffee. We often got to chat in the car on the way to the office, which was located just off Sunset Boulevard.  This was the time before the "office environment" existed. Every morning we would have lunch in the cafeteria. On some days we would be served by the movie studios. On others we would get our sandwiches from a restaurant that was attached to the studio, and at some other times we got our sandwiches by the front desk. I have a fond memory of my lunch break at the movie studio. One afternoon we were in line to get sandwiches when this girl (who also worked in the theater department) saw me waiting and said to her friend, "You're not supposed to meet the kids here. You'll be too scared." I was in a really bad mood. I didn't want to eat. This was one day in a long line of bad moods. She said that maybe the studio would let
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's great, but I just watched a movie yesterday and I thought it was awesome. I am going to write a short review about it. But just to give you guys something to chew on for the next few days, a movie called Serenity is now the most expensive movie ever made.  Well not in terms of its budget, because it cost more than Avatar in the same year, but in terms that there is no way in hell that this film has been produced with the money that was budgeted for Avatar, which was a massive franchise with a lot of money at its disposal. SerenITY, by the way, isn't a terrible film, but if you watch it, you will know this. It is a bad movie. It's just a movie that doesn't have a story. I just finished the last ten minutes of the film, and I really don't like this movie. And that is not a compliment. There is absolutely nothing that you can think of that has anything good about it, and that has nothing to do with the quality of the production, which is very poor. There are a few good things about the film that I have to say, and this will be a brief discussion on the film. First, this is a film that seems to be directed by people who have no idea what they are doing. This is a director with no understanding of the story, or how to tell a story, and has a story that is filled with errors.  For starters, this film is just a series of one-on-one, single shooting matches between two fighters, and there are no scenes that you watch over and over again. You never see the same fighter for more than three, maybe five, minutes.  The fighters, as you can probably imagine, are named in very bizarre ways.  I have never, in my entire life, seen two people named Captain America and Green Lantern. This film has a good idea of the plot, though, but it does not follow it. So you just have to go with it.  At some point in the film you will be introduced to a character named Kip, who is this fighter who is not quite good enough to be a "real" fighter. He is in the process of becoming a "super" fighter because his mother's father was a scientist who built something called the Hyperwave transporter. He can't figure out how to use the Hyper-Waver,

What did not make the movie good: ____________________________________________ I didn't like how they did it. The character they made was the best in the movie and was very interesting and you loved his story, but there was so much wrong with the movie that it was completely unnecessary and I wouldn't recommend the movie to anyone.

Rating - 10/10  What made the film great: -------------------------- I really liked this movie a great deal. It has a great plot and lots of great fight scenes. It was very well-made and very well acted, and I enjoyed it a lot. What didn't make the film good:  ___________________________________________________________________  1. The Dark Knight (2008) 2: The Dark World (2009)    It is a true fact that all good films are the best when they take advantage of the opportunity to be really good. There is only one thing that is true for the greatest films, and that is that they always work because they give the audience what they really want. When it comes to the "best" movies, the best movies are: The great action movies. When the characters are all in great shape and the story is great, great movies are created. It is all about great filmmaking. Films like, Blade Runner, The Empire Strikes Back, Titanic, and Saving Private Ryan are the absolute best.The only question that really matters, then, is "Which films should be the greatest?" I will tell you the three films that I think are the greatest, because I believe they are the three best movies ever made. And you should too. It may not be the first three things that you think of when you hear the word "great," but I guarantee you that if you think "best", then The Three Musketeers or Citizen Kane, will come to mind as well. But it is true. Which is the greatest? Well,

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Watch the trailer  Share on Twitter Share on Facebook  After a summer full of headlines about sexual assault and harassment on college campuses, the recent allegations against actor Kevin Spacey have left many in the media wondering if our country is dealing with a new epidemic of sexual harassment.  I wrote an essay for Teen Vogue in March, titled "Why We Need More Sexual Violence Prevention Programs for the Media," in which I outlined why I believe that a media that ignores the impact of sexual violence and encourages rape is not only failing its audience, but it is ultimately harming victims.  the media is perpetuating the "boys will be boys" trope on rape and sexual harassment — when sexual violence is actually a serious problem that does real damage. It may be too difficult for the media to admit that sexual violence isn't "boys being boys," but I believe it is our duty to stop the media from perpetuating a rape culture.    The media is the best place we have to talk about sexual violence. And yet, our media still puts a huge burden on the victim to report an assault. , the problem of sexual assault on college and university campuses continues to rise. This is a real problem, and we need to do more to stop it.  and it is important for victims to feel empowered to speak up. : It's hard to see how the public would react if they heard someone in a high profile position at a prestigious network like NBC had been accused of sexual misconduct. The media is supposed to be the public's first source of news, and it can easily fall prey to putting pressure on its audience. If the media had a responsibility to their audience, it would have to do a better job of reporting on this. / Getty Images The media can easily get caught up in the "it's not sexual assault if he said 'no' first" argument, but this is a myth. I've heard people say, "Well, it wasn't rape if he just said 'yes,' right?" But that's not how the law works. . For this reason, reporting on sexual assault is a responsibility, but also a privilege. And it isn't just the media we have a responsibility towards. When a journalist fails to do their job, the victims of sexual abuse — both those who have been assaulted and those who hear about it through the media — have no way of dealing with their trauma. -

I loved every part of it and I'm so glad that I finally found it. I'm not in the habit of going to movies, but I think I have a favorite, and The Girl was it. The actors were so perfect. Julianne Moore was incredible, Daniel Craig was so perfect, and they were such great characters. It just felt right. The story itself was awesome, and the movie is great. It has a little bit of everything, a lot of romance, a bit of suspense, and a little romance. _______________ I am so glad I decided to read this book. I've never read anything by a Canadian writer before (I don 't think I've read a novel by a woman, though I'm sure there's some by women) but I'm definitely interested. This is such an interesting story. The girl is being stalked and has a really difficult time keeping herself safe and she ends up in the hospital. I don't know about other people, but it made me think of the TV show 24 and how it deals with a situation where there is someone that they care a lot about but it's not safe to be around them. It does a good job of describing what it's like to be stalked. It also doesn 't deal with the actual stalking but what happens when you're alone at home and someone is trying to kill you. _____________________ I liked this book because I enjoyed the story and because I thought the characters were fun. The writing style of the book was enjoyable and I found myself reading through the books at the same time. I liked the description of some of the characters because it gave me a better idea of who the characters are and what their backgrounds are. Overall, I liked this one. ________________________________________ The main characters were interesting and I liked that they were a bit like the archetypes of the type of characters I tend to like. There were a few characters that I didn't quite understand. The characters

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you've seen an action film or action-adventure movie or something like that and enjoyed it, it's not a bad movie - it's just not the same movie as when you first watched it, and you want it to be the same as when it was made.  The same thing goes with a bad film - it sucks when it's bad, but the people who love it are still looking for it, so don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.    And if you think you want to talk about something that is different than what you've been watching... please, don't.    I'm not saying "Don't talk about stuff that isn't true about it!", but I am saying that, in order to be as accurate as you possibly can, you're going to have to put up with a lot of nonsense.  (I would say "put up with it" because it has to be true about you as well - if it's untrue, it may not be true for the other people, but for you, you might think you've got it bad, when really it's the opposite.) If you do talk about these things, remember that the goal is to have things be as close to perfect as possible for everybody.  And if it is true, then, if you're talking about it, let that be the case.  I'm not interested in debating people who don't think that's a reasonable goal.  It isn't something that I have any interest in, and I would not like to be criticized for not being interested in it.  So don't waste your time doing it - you don't want to be criticizing me, right?

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ The best movies are the ones that leave me talking about it for days afterward. The worst movies are those that make me wish I had a bottle of scotch and had spent the evening drinking it with the people who made the movies. _____________________________ The movie "The Manchurian Candidate" was written and directed by Phillip Kaufman, based on the novel by Philip K. Dick.  Kaufman's interpretation of Dick's classic novel is rather different from Dick's.  Kauffman's film is an intelligent, thoughtful, disturbing, well-acted, thoroughly enjoyable and well-produced drama.  This is a well-made film.    The film is presented with the utmost respect for the source material, the story of the novel and the director's artistic vision.  The film is well paced, exciting and entertaining.  For those unfamiliar with the book or film, it is difficult to describe in detail what the film does better than any other movie or novel of the same genre.  I would suggest reading " Philip K Dick, The Manchurais Candidate " for a more in depth analysis.     Philip Kaufman is a great director.  In addition to being a great storyteller, his direction is impeccable and he is a tremendous performer.  A director of any caliber, with even the slightest talent, can create a great film. The Man Churian candidate is a masterful film, and the performance by Richard Widmark, John Cusack and John Hurt are the best that anyone could ask for. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ ___________  "The fact that there are so many of these films now, and so few good ones, is as much due to the state of the business as to the quality of the individual film."   - Roger Ebert  Director: Jean-Pierre Melville  A film that will surprise you with a different angle to the movie. It's the first film in my "Le Pigeon Noir" series. A film that's a little bit dark, but not really scary. I was really looking forward to see what this French director would do with the idea of the pigeon. And I did not really think he would be able to pull off such a cool idea.   If you think the idea is bad then, you should have seen the actual film. It is absolutely incredible! In the beginning of the film, I saw one of the most bizarre looking pigeons I have ever seen. It looked like a duck with a very long tail and legs. The pigeon was about 4-5 feet long and was very very large! At the beginning the film was not that great, but after about 45 minutes, it got a bit better. The ending was good and the beginning was excellent, but I cannot say it's the greatest movie ever made, though it's pretty good. It would definitely be worth a watch by all pigeon lovers. I'm sure it will be rewatched many times and will always stay in my favorites list.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________  I was really pleased to see that I did not make a mistake in my first choice, "Gattaca" or "Gravity." That is, my second choice was "American Beauty." It was only the third choice of my list, but it also seemed like a decent movie.  A story about a man who must undergo a painful but necessary surgical procedure on himself to prevent his son from being born with the same condition, the movie was about as close as the science would ever get to being completely believable. As in other science-fiction movies I have seen, people were made to look like robots. One example of this would be a woman who would look exactly like her husband, only he was an alien and not a man.  (The film's director, Duncan Jones, does a fine job of explaining this in the movie's trailers.)  However, there was one thing I didn't understand about the movie: why the hell could the government have so many people in this world? At first, I thought it was just an excuse to give them all superpowers. As a moviegoer, I was expecting that there would be some sort of governmental organization responsible for this. What I didn''t expect was that it would actually be an American government agency and the director would be the one who would be responsible for the super-powers. "Gattacla" is just one of the movies I found interesting. However, it wasn't the most interesting. My third and final choice was also a movie I was not interested in. It was "The Prestige."  This is a James Bond movie. But what makes it a James-Bond movie is that the hero always goes through so much trouble to avoid getting in trouble. This time, it was a Russian spy. The film itself was very interesting. The action was quite good. But it was so easy to guess what was going to happen. And I never got the feeling that there was any danger in the story. If anything, it seemed that the Bond would get into so much mischief, then he would win the battle and defeat the bad guys.  the ending was also confusing. I don't think it was the best James Bond film. And the ending of the movie took the whole world and turned it upside down. But I found it very hard to figure out what was happening to the world. I think I was more interested in why the world

(Photo: The Film Scene)  When it comes to challenging films, I've become somewhat of a film scholar. A graduate of the Film and Television Archive, I'm not only an expert on the making and reception of popular films, but also the history of the medium.  But "The Pianist" is not one of my favorites. In fact, I haven't seen it since I was a teenager (back in the '60s, to be exact). I don't remember why I didn't enjoy it as a kid. But, I know now that it was because I was scared. .  "It's not a good film," I remember thinking. "And there's really not that much that I think I can take away from it. I'll just have to be happy for some other kid who is going to have the pleasure of watching it for the first time."  Now, as a mother, I was not a "good" mother. I was one who got out of bed at 5am every day and worked on the farm at night. I didn?t read or write as much as I should have.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________   "The Great Gatsby" is a very interesting film.   The movie follows the life of the rich young man, Nick Carraway, and his adventures as he travels the world in pursuit of the American dream.   It's a story about a boy with incredible potential and an upbringing that only comes through hard work and determination.  .

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Great movie! Great characters. Great action. Great plot!" This movie has both of those, but at the same time it doesn't. It has two protagonists, one a cop and one a private eye who are at odds because of an unresolved divorce.  If I had watched this movie as a cop movie it would have been a total disaster.   The film, for all its flaws, has its charm and it's just funny enough to make up for its mistakes.  The two leads do get to fight with each other a lot and they fight some fierce battles.  They both fight in close combat but they also have some sword fights.  This movie is like a bad episode of Dragon Ball Z but at least it was funny.  A couple things about this film really stuck with me after the end credits, the most significant being the final scene when the private detective asks the cop why he didn't do anything about the divorce. The cop says that he could have if he had just been a little more proactive, and it is a question that I don't think has been asked before by a villain, a cop or a private investigator.  I also thought it was a brilliant idea to show a cop shooting the killer, just before the cop's partner jumps the killer in the head.   My final verdict on this film is that it is an interesting take on a cop/private detective movie.  There are some pretty stupid decisions here and there, but the movie's overall quality is on par with other cop/thriller films that were released this year.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________ (All ratings are for the DVD version)  5/10 The DVD, when you consider the production and quality of the film, is still a bit of a disappointment. The film starts off on a hopeful note, as the crew of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) are still trying to find a way to return home from the legendary battle of Wolf 359. Captain Kirk (William Shatner) is frustrated, as he was trying to get to the bridge to check out the recent battles in space. But as he reaches the bridge and finds that the ship is still in trouble, the Captain gets a bit more optimistic. The captain has found a way that they can get back home, and so they have to put aside their problems and work together, to get back. The first half of the movie is about the Enterprise getting the coordinates of their nearest Federation outpost, so that they could get there, and then they will work together to make it home. This is good, because it really lets us see how close they came, and the hope they had of returning home, has to be broken as soon as possible. The crew of Enterprise were going to be dead, if not for the crew and the Federation. However, when Kirk and crew reach the Federation outpost and realize that it was just a ruse to take away all the data that could get them home. Their hope is crushed. We quickly learn how much danger they are in when they find that they have lost almost all of their equipment. We know, with this information, that there is nothing left on the station, but we still want to know how they will get home, even though they are at the station. And I think the DVD movie is one of the reasons why I do not like the movie. They take away almost all hope from the film. They are just going to do what they have been doing. They will just find a new place and go back. It makes sense, and it is okay, but for a movie that really wants to show that the crew has been through hell and back, they can't have that.  It took us a few viewings to get past the disappointment of the DVD. Now that we have gotten over that, the movie looks pretty good. The effects are great, and even though I'm not too great at CGI, I think I like them a lot. , when we consider the Production and quality for the film as

The more you know, the easier it is to write a good review. I've never made a film-related blog before, but that doesn't mean I'm not a fan. It just means I'm writing about it on a blog called "Film Junk." I have a love-hate relationship with film reviews. I absolutely hate those that are simply opinionated, that simply don't offer enough facts or explanation to explain their opinion, and that simply can't provide even a sliver of an argument for their opinion. This blog will strive to be that type of blog. If you find a movie you enjoyed, you can submit it. If it's an utterly terrible movie, then it probably won't be in the next section. If I love a movie and have written a review of it, it will be added. If not, it'll be put under the appropriate section that deals with a specific film. I'd like this blog to be a place where all opinions can be shared without being shouted down or dismissed with the usual clichés. I welcome all opinions, especially if they are positive ones, so long as they are informed. And to all the writers out there, if you have any suggestions for movies to review, go ahead and let me know. I will try to keep this blog up to date with the latest films. I can't promise that I will have it posted every week, but I do promise to post at least one review a week. Also, if your movie is in my next movie section, it may end up here. If your movie isn't, it doesn't have to be. I do not review all movies every week because, well, that's just too much work. I also don't have a list of the best movies that have come out in the past decade. In my book, that belongs in "Great Films of the 21st Century," and not "The Ten Most Amazing Movies of the Past Ten Years." That's why there's a "Great Movies of Today" section at the top. There's no guarantee that I'll add your movie here if I have not reviewed it yet. All it means is that you have not yet

Here's the deal: good and bad critics share some common traits that are easily identified.  in a nutshell: good critics are sensitive; bad critics are not.  on a molecular level: good reviewers can read a book, hear a piece of music, or even a video; bad reviewers are less sensitive.  the science of critical sensitivity:  What happens when you go into a theater and watch a movie? It's not always clear. One of the most popular theories suggests that some part of the brain called the temporal lobe detects movement in the eyes and recognizes characters. If a character moves a few inches from where they were a minute before, your brain may think they've changed position, and you will perceive that character as moving. So you'll recognize the character and move with them.  a less popular theory suggests that there's a different brain system for recognizing movement in people. This brain system, it's theorized, is called a "semantic network" or a "reactive network." This is what is being stimulated when you watch a story unfold. The more sensitive you are, the more you'll notice the actions of characters and recognize their intentions, and the less you'll see them. This, it turns out, is what's happening in your mind while you watch movies. You have one brain system that's sensitive to details, and another that's more focused on general concepts. The former is more prone to noticing the details and the latter is more likely to think of a general concept. And the more sensitive your mind is, the less sensitive it is.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I don't believe in second chances.   MOVIES YOU SHOULD SEE THIS SUMMER:   "Black Narcissus," directed by Jim Jarmusch (a brilliant writer, but also a great director) and starring Nicolas Cage and Julianne Moore, is a fantastic, melancholy tale of a married couple who fall in love and decide to stay together. It's got great performances, a very good screenplay, and a wonderful director.  , starring Joaquin Phoenix, is an exciting and thought-provoking coming-of-age story that is equal parts funny and poignant.  -Cage has always been a little strange, and Phoenix's performance in this role has no reason to be more so. He's a character actor who seems to inhabit a different kind of body from his own, and he doesn't give a hoot about making himself look like a movie star. He has great chemistry with Moore, who plays his mother. Their scenes together, as they struggle with their new selves, are a joy to watch, especially when she brings a cigarette to bed and says, "That's a good morning, my son." -"Blue Valentine," directed and starring Ryan Gosling, is my favorite movie of the summer and probably of the decade. Gosling and Meryl Streep have great chemistry as lovers who come to realize their feelings for each other, and Gosling has just the right amount of self-deprecation and self-importance to play the dorky, slightly pervy guy who gets his heart broken. -"Carnage," directed, written, and starring James Woods, is another great example of how a great movie can still feel like a great film even when it's not at all about the movie. If there's one thing James Woods has always done really well, it's play characters in bad movies. This movie is just a great, tense, and thrilling ride.     -"Crazy Heart," directed for television by Michael Moore and starring Robert De Niro, Kevin Kline, and George Clooney, is still one of the most entertaining films I've seen. It has a great cast, an excellent screenplay, a lot of great dialogue and performances, and just the best visual style. It might be the only film in which Clooney is better than De Nir.   be sure to check out this DVD and tell us what you think. I bet that this week's list
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________  Here is my opinion. The "Kubo and the Two Strings" was a good film but not as good as "Frozen" and it's not as amazing as "Pete's Dragon". I really liked the concept of Kubo, but "Pegasus" has a much better voice cast and it shows the more human side of Kubota, which is nice. The story is interesting enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, but it suffers from the same problems of "Furubashi".

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   Write a negative review about the bad movie:   It's almost as easy to come up with a joke, story, or movie quote to use in a positive or negative review as it is to come to a better definition of the word "saggy."  There are many ways to be "saturated with negativity" in this world and you can make that a reality with a very simple concept. You have to tell someone who is making a negative movie or story about a subject they're already passionate about, what they're doing wrong.  So, here is a step-by-step guide to help you do that.  the best part? You do NOT need any specific equipment to do this! It's as easy as watching a movie or reading a review and applying the basic technique.  (Remember, it's all about the process: not the product. Just like you should go to a concert or a party if you want to get laid, there's no reason why you can't just look at a movie and learn some helpful tips for making a movie, too. For example: What are the three main character's goals and why are they working so hard to get there? What does the story focus on? What is the theme? What can I say to make the audience relate to the movie?)  Step 1: Choose a good subject  You don't need to look for the exact subject of the movie in advance, but you do need to make sure there's a reason the story is told in that medium. It's not about the genre of the film, it just has to have some sort of general topic. You also want to make your choices from a place of entertainment. The subject of your film isn't going to make or break its success, but if you choose it carefully and have a plan for it, it will be. If you're going to write a story about the weather, for example, choose something you can easily relate to.  onomatopoeia can be a fantastic source of subject matter in movies, but it's more likely to fall flat than make an impact. That's why you need to choose something from the right direction: not just the best, but the one that will make the most impact. , for instance, can easily be used in a comedy, because you can use a single word to make funny comments on almost anything:  "Boom!" or

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "You want the good stuff, you get the good  stuff."  We want this movie. And the good news is, there's more good stuff! This movie really shows the depth of the characters. The movie is a bit predictable, but a good one. It shows the true potential of the Hollywood reboot, with some strong performances. We get to see a new generation in a new place. I think this is going to be a sleeper hit. If you are a fan of the original TV series, or this movie adaptation, this movie is not for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ (your own words) ___________  The more I saw and watched it, the more I was hooked. I saw it in a theater on opening night, and I sat on the edge of my seat for the entire film. I've seen the first two parts again now and again in theaters, and it's not just because of the sheer spectacle and the impressive cast (which includes many A-list actors). There is a quiet but profound power to this film. It doesn't feel like it was just thrown together. It seems that every word of it was the result of many hours of painstakingly planned and executed filmmaking. And even in all the attention to detail, the filmmakers don't forget to get the humor. They also include a surprising number of songs, including "Weird Al" Yankovic's "The Album" (which has never been available on DVD). It is easy to forget that this film is a work of art. It feels like a cinematic masterpiece, and is one of the better comedies in recent years.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ 1. The Wizard of Oz (1939) - (11 votes)  "The Wizard of OZ, written and directed by Frank L. Baum, is a story about Dorothy, a young girl whose dream of a white-topped house is shattered when she is captured by the wicked and treacherous Scarecrow. Dorothy sets out to rescue her friends and her childhood home. Although the story begins on a familiar level, it is at times deeply unsettling and, at times, downright terrifying. It is a film that will never be forgotten, not for its beauty of its craft, not even for its remarkable and remarkable performances, not because of its ability to take the audience to another time and place, not by its originality, not just because of the remarkable and extraordinary set of characters that are introduced, but because it was a film about the importance of love and the importance to have a true friend." (A.D.B. - The Movie Review - 12/2/1939 )   2. The Birds (1963) -  (11 votes )  The Bird Cage - 8.0/10  Another good film from Roger Corman. The Bird Cage is an adventure film based on the novel by Robert E. Howard. It shows us the story of Billy, a little boy who lives with his parents in an abandoned bird cage. Billy discovers and learns about birds as the story progresses. The story is very well told and entertaining. The cast is pretty good. The music is very nice and there are some beautiful shots of the scenery. There is some really cute and funny moments that give the story a very entertaining feel. There are some action sequences which are quite well directed and the climax is a lot of fun and I loved it!   1. The Ten Commandments (1957) - 9.5/10   This is a must have for all Christian movie fans! I think the film is one of the best in the Old Testament. The action, romance, and moral lesson are just wonderful! The movie is just a blast. There's so much of it and it's all well directed.   Other Recommended Films   "Jurassic Park" (1993) - 8/10 (7.5)  This is a pretty good movie. It's really fun to watch. The movie follows a young boy and his dad and he is one tough guy. He gets some great action scenes

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I came across this movie was through the "My Favorite Movies" section of Netflix, where it was listed as "The Day the Earth Stood Still." This movie was a movie I had no interest in seeing, and even a movie such as this one would have had a very low rating on Netflix (it's currently at 1.1 out of 5, but still quite low for the time). I was not really that into the movie at all. It wasn't until I found the trailer on YouTube for this movie that I decided I had to see this movie. I was impressed. The trailer showed a lot of great action, and it had a lot to do with the storyline. There was also a great score for this film as well. The plot was simple: It was 2028. The Earth has been destroyed, and only the remaining humans (The Elohim) live on a planet of machines. This planet is called Earth Prime. One day, a robot (Mr. X) and his assistant (Carrie) (Carriere) are sent into the "Primed States" to discover what is going on. Mr. X is not the only robot on Earth Prime, however. There are many other robots (called Elohims) and a bunch of other humans. The Elohis live in a "Prime Land" (which is basically the same as Earth Prime except that instead of plants, there are animals) which is ruled by the "Elohim Council." They have ruled since the ancient era and are the most intelligent race in the known universe. In 2028, they discovered a new form of communication that had only been discovered a year before, in 2026, by the people of Earth Prime and named it "Telepathy." They use this telepathy to communicate with their Elohi counterparts and to also have secret meetings. One of these meetings took place in 2028 on the same day as this movie (on November 2nd), but this was never revealed. It was only found out because a scientist, Harold Zorkey, accidentally left a document called "A World of Our Own" on a table. The only people that ever knew about this meeting were Dr. X and Dr. Zorky. It is at this meeting that the Elohive was revealed, and they decided that this planet was their home (and the humans must be their slaves, for they are not allowed to live there

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ The film does a great job of setting up characters in such a way that, once you start seeing them, you won't be able to forget them for days. I am very surprised by how well this film was made considering that I only saw it for the first time last night. I would have been able to recognize the faces of a few of the characters, but I found them pretty difficult to spot because of the lighting. Some of the shots looked a little unnatural, but the film itself was surprisingly watchable because of its simplicity. The story is straightforward enough that I didn't feel the need to delve too much into the psychological aspect of the story, but that's mostly because I don't really understand the psychological aspects of the film, which makes the story easier to follow. I wouldn't describe the acting in this movie as great, but it wasn't bad, either. I've seen better, so that's kind of a plus. I thought that the music was very catchy, and it definitely helped me to remember all the people that I saw before. I'd like to thank the director, producer, cast, and crew for making a great movie and for making me smile throughout the process. It's a shame that the release was so much better than I was hoping for because it's hard to see this movie for the second time. I love the film and hope that more people will see it.

One of those films I cannot see, and that is The Shining. It is the only film I''m aware of which has had such a great effect on me, as an impression is left with the most powerful effect of any film ever produced. The feeling that it gives me on seeing it was almost beyond belief. Even to-day, and to the time of writing this, I cannot help but feel the same. The Shining is one of those movies that seem to go on forever,

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________________ (4.3/5)The movie starts out well enough. There's some good jokes in there, and the characterisation is ok, though one can't help but think that this is a bit of an odd choice of movies for a series with so many different characters that each have their own backstories and own personal problems, and that this would be better served by letting them sort it out rather than relying on a single character in a group situation. It seems to have been made with no particular direction in mind, which makes sense, but I'm still surprised. Then there's the music. Some of the tunes here don't sound like they would fit in with the series at all, and even if they were fitting, they wouldn't be very memorable. The OST itself is also rather forgettable, although I do enjoy the music when it's performed by the OST artists.As you can tell, this movie is very uneven. It may be more entertaining than other parts of the series, but it's not that great a watch for all the reasons given in my previous review. At the very least, this version of 'Passion' doesn't have the same "dumbing down" of the original. I did enjoy the movie, however, so I recommend checking it out for its story. Otherwise, you'll just be getting a boring story about a character in love.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I loved this movie. It was well-written, funny, and had a well-rounded plot.  The premise is that our heroine, the beautiful and intelligent Katherine, has the opportunity to go to her college of choice, which happens to be the one she has dreamed of going to since she was a little girl, the very one that was not open to women before. Her parents are still bitter about her leaving home for Boston at a young age, but she has the right to choose. She starts off as the class valedictorian and then does quite a few honors at school, including writing a research paper.  Then things change at her new school when she realizes that her new professor, a brilliant and eccentric eccentric scientist named Robert, has been experimenting on the students for a long time. Katherine discovers that he is creating his own class of "geniuses" from the student body. He has been taking the DNA of the students and then creating genetically modified humans.  He is trying to create "a perfect being that would be able to think and act independently of their creator".  He and his assistant, Lucy (Molly Ringwald) take advantage of Katherine by keeping her on a strict diet and keeping her from talking about her dreams and her plans.  When they make it obvious that Katherine has begun to develop an interest in her friends (her friends are some of the most interesting people in the movie), Lucy's husband, Professor (played by Ben Stiller), begins to get jealous of this.  But they need her and can't allow her to do anything to hurt them.  So they set out to take her out of the house to help them and she accepts.  Katherine must keep her friends from discovering her plans, as well as Lucy's new relationship with another woman (played wonderfully by Laura Dern).  We learn that Professor and Lucy have both gone through their own "genetic experiments", although Professor is still on the hunt for the perfect creature. The film is a well developed story full of suspense, humor, and great characters.  It was also a very good use of the new technology that they had access to, with the special effects. The performances were great and it was fun to watch.  The actors really brought the chemistry between them to life. I am also amazed that they could make all of these crazy characters so believable and believable.  They all knew what they were doing and knew what the other was

Write a positive review about a good movie:     A bad movie:  In short, what's the difference between a good review and a bad review? I think the best way to determine a movie's quality is to look at what the critics thought of it. So here's a list of reviews from a few of the movie sites I've used over the years. These critics were asked to rate movies on a scale from 1 to 10. The numbers I've given are their overall rating, and the stars represent the overall rating. The list includes the reviews of movies such as Jaws, The Godfather, Star Wars, Jaws 2, and The Dark Knight.   10/10 stars, all for Goodfellas:  in 1988, the critics gave the movie a 10 out of 10. This means a 10 was a perfect score, and all other critics gave it a 5 or less. This made the movie an instant classic, and it was nominated for eight Oscars. It's the perfect movie for those who are looking for a movie to watch on repeat or watch with friends. In 1994, the movie won eleven awards, including best picture and best actor. It was nominated again in 1995 and 1996, and won in 1997. In fact, it won every award it could get.   I really liked GoodfellAs, and am a big fan of its acting, direction, and cinematography. In particular, Harvey Keitel and Ray Liotta are terrific in this movie, both doing stellar work. The writing is also pretty solid, with a couple of standouts. For example, the scene with the two cops in the car talking is really good, and is the best scene in the movie. The best part about Goodfellaas, though, is the performances. Most of the characters are written really well. The chemistry between Goodfellacos actors is really nice, and their chemistry with one another is phenomenal. And the scenes they play are very enjoyable, especially those with Johnny Depp.  , and are great. The acting is really fantastic, and Keitels performance is the reason why I think he's one of the best actors of his generation. The movie is very entertaining. The direction is brilliant. The cinematography is fantastic, especially when it comes to the chase scenes. The editing is very well done. The music is very good.   The movie was released in 1990, and was one of those movies that made you want to see it

Write a positive review about a good movie:    View ratings  A couple of months ago I was watching the movie version of  The Girl on the Train  and my friend said, "It looks like a good film." He was right. It's got plenty of funny moments, strong characters, and a heart that will keep you pulling. A few of my friends have said that I looked more like the guy in the movie than me, so if you're looking to have fun with the guys, check this out.  The girl in the train scene is played by Charlize Theron, so I know she can do it. If the guy isn't in the mood, she's got the chops. . Sigh. A few months ago my friends and I were drinking vodka, watching a movie on the couch and decided to watch  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I was thinking the same thing. I'm a big fan of the movie and I thought it would be fun to watch it with a group of my close friends. So we went to my apartment and started watching it in one sitting. I know that the scene with the girl in  The Girl With the Dragon t  is pretty much a repeat of the scene where she meets her boyfriend, but I wanted to include it here.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________  This will get you a gold star.  ___________________________________________  What's your favorite genre?  Horror, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Romance, Comedy, Horror/Sci-Fi and the like.  it's always good to start out with a "What do you like?" question. I love horror movies and can't help but find them a bit scary. "What do we do?" was a question in high school I couldn't help asking myself.  the best movies for the genre are the ones that are different from the others. I'd rather watch a good horror movie than one with the same theme.  and then I'm also a huge fan of films that make the viewer question their existence. It's also good to watch films that involve people who have to face something and think of what they would do if they had the chance to survive it. A lot of people don't know what to think of those situations and if they are able to survive the situation they end up becoming great people. , the last movie I watched that really made me think. It was a very scary film that made me wonder if life will always be like this. I like horror because it has so many different genres but it's usually scary so it's an easy way to scare me. Which horror film scared the crap out of you the most? The Shining is my favorite and will always stay in my mind as one of the most terrifying films ever. I really liked the way it had a horror/science fiction theme and was a good mix of the two. What are your all-time favorite horror movies? I think I've seen most of the films that have been in my favorite genre in the past few years but for the past 3 or 4 years I have been watching a lot of movies that I've never heard of. I'm trying to get better at not thinking of titles before I watch them. My current favorites are: The Amityville Horror (2002) The Mummy (1999) A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) Rosemary's Baby (1968) and of course, The Shining. What is the biggest misconception people have about horror movies, what are some of the top misconceptions you think most people have? People think horror movies are just scary things that happen to people. But that's really not the main point. Horror is a genre where you can

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ If the reviewer has a bad feeling about a movie: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It will be harder to find good movies in the future.  3. Be aware of the bad press, and get the story straight  This is a tricky one. It's easy to get confused between what's "bad" press, what's praise, and what's a legitimate gripe with a movie. If a review is critical, there are usually some points about the movie that the writer gets right, but many others that are way off. If the review doesn't actually mention the points that the reviewer got right, it's not a great indicator that you should watch the movie (or any other film for that matter).  For example, if an actor doesn't get in the acting pool (or something similar) to read for a role that's not actually given to them, that doesn't necessarily mean that the person is "not as good" as their other roles, and can lead you to a misunderstanding of the film. It could also just be that the director likes the actor and didn't want to risk a new actor ruining his or her first role. .  to do some digging into that film. Maybe the writer didn't get an audition, maybe it was just a good performance, or maybe the actor didn't really like working with the director. ,  4. Always be honest. You will have more credibility with viewers if you're not being dishonest about the film you're discussing. If you don't have a specific reason to be dishonest with the audience about your review, be honest and open about the issues the reviewer is addressing, rather than just pointing out problems.

I would have liked to have seen more of the film before I went to bed, but even after I got there, it still took me a few minutes to fall asleep.  What made this movie such a great one?  I can think of many reasons why the movie was so good. For one, it has a fantastic score, that is not the kind of music you would expect for such a huge space opera movie. 's score, is one of the best of 2016:  There were also a lot of character development moments and moments that I really enjoyed. One of them was the scene in which Han Solo and Princess Leia were going to find Luke Skywalker in the desert:  with the Force, of course!  It was also really great that the movie takes place in a galaxy far, far away and not in the Star Wars universe. This movie would not have been possible without the technology that was already in place back in 1980 and still continues to grow.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  This is going to be quite an issue with all the "re-releases" of recent years: some films I enjoyed the first time around have become very much dated and dated is a very bad thing to have on a film that you've seen a hundred times. So I will try to offer up a few films that I found to be enjoyable enough to revisit.  I saw this film on a recent trip out of town (my first visit to the UK since 2008). It was quite a unique experience, seeing it a second time, and to be honest I felt the same when I saw it the first go around. If you're a fan of auteur films, then this is a movie for you.  he movie is a strange one that I won't go into here in much detail, but it does take place in a near future (at least in the United Kingdom). One of the main characters, Richard, works for the Ministry of Science (I would like to say "The Ministry of Culture", but we won't give them any more points for that one) and has a problem, it seems. A scientist has been kidnapped by a gang of terrorists who want to use his latest invention. Richard is the scientist's lawyer, and he's looking for the terrorists to have a say in how his invention will be used. While on the case, he discovers the terrorists are after something that can be used to cause a complete collapse of society (the idea is that all the bad stuff that comes along with a complete breakdown of society are blamed on the terrorists and it results in a great feeling of self importance).  While I enjoyed this film for what it is, it is a bit of a shame that a lot of people don't get it, despite the fact that it is an important story, not only in regards to science fiction, but science and society generally. That being said, I'll get into that a bit more down the line.  the story itself is rather enjoyable. There are some parts where it seems that the story has been told so many times, it's almost become boring. One such scene happened halfway through the film when a character was talking about how the terrorists were using the nanobots as part of their plan to cause chaos in society, and one of the terrorists said "If you don't want to live in a world where all of the bad things come from other people, you should take it back." and
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I went to see this movie. I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. The movie was good." This is one of the biggest clichés in film making. Most of the time, people don't think they liked something until they actually watched it. I don't know anyone that can really say that they really enjoyed a movie when they didn't have time to watch it because they were on a deadline. I would think you'd be happier if you watched it in the theater with a friend. But I've seen a lot of films over the years and you can't really tell a good one from a bad one. The main thing to look for is how people talk about the film. What is the first thing they say? It has to be the good things about it. In fact, the more positive they are, the better the movie is. I think they're so quick to say good things, they don't remember the bad things either. And this is why they're bad movies. Most people in Hollywood, they know how to talk about movies so they know what to say about a bad movie. It's a huge advantage to a movie because you're not going to be embarrassed when you watch a bad film because you talked about it so much. The other thing is, people really don't like bad movies because they just don't feel like watching them. It would be more like a nightmare. So people will try to avoid watching a bad joke and it actually makes the film less funny. And of course, if you have never seen a bad flick, it's probably going to make you feel embarrassed about seeing it. But again, a bad picture always makes you feel bad. It can ruin the experience you had watching the movie. So when people talk negatively about a movie, it just makes you want to see it even more because you know the story is going to get better and better. And the more good things you hear about the movie, the less it scares you. And when a bad review is made, it makes you just want to go see it again. I love watching bad movies so much and sometimes I feel like that's a good thing. But it doesn't always work out. But we all know how movies are made, so that's why I do a lot more bad movies now. But what are some of the worst movies? I guess there is one that I would hate, and that's probably Psycho. But all the rest

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________   [Rating: 3/5]   This movie was released in the year 2000 and is about a boy named Mark, who is in a car accident that leaves him in a coma for a while. During this time he is being fed through a tube and has to be fed through his mouth. After Mark awakes and wakes up, he soon discovers that his parents have died. He is then taken by the police to a mental hospital, but he soon realizes that he has to find his missing father and friends.   The movie was a bit hard to get into due to the slow pacing, and the fact that it was a slow paced movie due to all the time he was in a deep coma. The story was interesting and I found it interesting to watch the little boy being fed though a tube. The movie seemed to be the perfect time to see this movie since it was such a slow time with so much time for characters to develop and things to happen.   The movie had some great character development and was entertaining, but the pacing was very slow. Overall this movie had a decent story, characters, and a good story for a slow story. If you are looking for a good slow time movie, I highly recommend checking out this one.

"Elysion" is a beautifully filmed film with a solid screenplay and a talented cast of actors. It is one of the few big-budget blockbusters of the last couple of years that truly shines for the genre that it depicts, and the story is a satisfying one. The supporting characters are also well-developed, and while some of the more well-rounded ones are a bit on the thin side, the film as a whole does an excellent job of portraying a realistic world.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________________________________ * Please note, all reviews are from my personal experience and don't necessarily reflect on the quality or usefulness of this guide or the movie in question. I make no claim to the accuracy or usefulness whatsoever. _______________________________________________________________________________ You want to make a movie? No problem! This is your very first guide, so don't worry if your script or director decides not to use any of the information that you've learned in this guide. The very first step in any movie is deciding what the movie is supposed to be. It's important to know this, so you can focus your creative energy where it'll make the most sense to your screenplay. So, you might want to just write a script and hope for the best. But if you know a little bit of this stuff, and you're willing to try some interesting things, you may have a better chance at getting it made. First, let's look at what the screenplay is supposed do. It should have a starting point that the audience can relate to. This is an important concept. It means that the first thing your writer should do is figure out what their audience can identify with. It doesn't necessarily have to be the same as their audience. It might be their favorite food. So you might start by writing a simple scene that shows the audience a character who loves to eat food, and then add in a little more detail later on. If you want a great example, there's a great scene in The Godfather where Michael Corleone has a scene where he's alone at the top of a mountain, looking out over the entire city below. When he looks down, he sees a little boy picking up his baseball bat. If the director has the sense to put that scene into a screenplay, that's a very interesting choice to make. If he doesn't, it means that he's just trying to fit his hero into the story. It could also mean that he doesn be using this scene to further establish the hero's relationship with his wife, which would be the wrong way to use it. The important thing is to know what the audience needs to identify with, then figure out a way to get that done. The first thing you want to do is find some characters who you want your audience to relate to, and who you think might be interesting characters for your audience, and figure out the details of their lives. Let's start with a few questions about a person. Name: ______________________________ Age:

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ The review you are about to read is my opinion, I made it up as I went along. It is not based on any real world facts or figures, and is written as I was told the movie was going to be like. This is for your reference. This movie is about a man who has been working in the oil business for 30 years. One day he starts a new venture with a guy he meets at the bar. The venture is going to build a new kind of oil rig with a giant pump at the bottom. They have some problems though... (You read it correctly). The man can't even find an able person who is willing to help him build the new rig. He is told to go to the big city to find someone who will do it. He decides to try and find out the truth by getting out there and doing it himself. Now, the big issue at the start of the movie is that this oil rig has to go in on its own. No one is going in and out of the rig on their own. In order to do this, the rig has got to be designed and built, so it can do a lot of things that it would be useless without the people on it. There is a lot to take in here. The film starts with a lot going on, with lots of people involved, and lots of planning, planning, and planning. But after about an hour and a half the movie picks up to a point. There are still people involved but they are no longer working on the new oil rig. We're getting to the end of the first hour. The director tells us at the beginning of the second hour, 'We are not going to give you any more of the big plot developments' and you can understand why. This second hour is all about the people that are there on the oil rig and their lives. The people we come to know best are not the people we first meet. What we know about them in this second hour are things that are so subtle, you might not even see them in the final movie, but are just enough to give us a complete picture of who they are. The movie does this really well. One thing that is clear to me from the second to the last hour is that it is very clear that this is a story of human drama. The characters struggle, have their moments of happiness and sorrow, and grow as people. It has just enough action in it to keep you interested and

Forrest Gump -  and of course I didn't see this! It's a terrible film, but one I would watch every single time I get to see a movie.   ahhhhhhhhhh.....huh, this is kind of interesting. And by interesting, I mean it's bad. And I don't even hate this movie! In fact, I've been trying to watch it for the past year or two. I just want to get the bad parts out of my head so I can get on with the good parts. A friend of mine is making a point about how many great movies have a great ending. I'm thinking about this and wonder if I should be watching more films with great endings. If I do, I'll probably get all the way through the list, but it's just too much of a chore to watch a film with a bad ending. So I'm stuck with this film. Maybe I'm being too pessimistic about this movie's potential, but I think the end of it was a great idea, which is why I'm still watching it.

If there's a big enough group of people who are saying something positive about something, that will eventually spread into the general media.  to the point that everyone who's interested is talking about it.  was it that popular on the internet before? 1a. did it cause a bit of a stir in the press? 2. If you find a picture of a person on the front of the box, it's going to be hard to convince yourself that the picture is a forgery, it needs to be from the perspective of the person in the picture. Dude…  It's like the internet. - the more people there are, the more likely it is for something to get popular. 2a. what are they saying? - it's a terrible movie. 3.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________________________________________ "The movie takes place over a two-week period. The action takes place during those two weeks. The story takes place after the movie. The movie takes a day off for lunch. The plot picks up right where it left off, leaving the last scene unresolved. The ending leaves the movie with its question mark." "The plot is not particularly interesting and it all just feels like a long filler reel with little to no plot progression. The characters are mostly one-note and one dimensional. The music is awful, but not nearly as bad as the acting." "Very long filler film that is very poorly written and acted. The last ten minutes of the film were really long, too." "I've seen a lot of bad horror movies and this one was the worst I've ever seen. I actually thought it was a rip off of The Shining. I'm not a horror fan." "It seems that they are filming a remake of the remake of a movie I saw in the 1970s. It has a lot in common with this, but nothing really different. The acting is just so bad that I really don't care." "A really long movie with bad acting and music. The camera is pretty bad as well, but I can't really complain. I really didn't feel the characters were any more than cardboard cut out." "Not very good movie and nothing special. Nothing was learned from it at all." "This movie was awful. The actors are so terrible that it makes the movie worse. I don't get why they decided to film this. It is really poorly written." "If you have to watch a movie that is so bad it makes you wish for a refund, I suggest that you do not watch this." "One of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. Terrible acting, bad music, terrible directing, awful story. I thought the movie was going to end with a bang." "Bad, terrible movie with horrible acting."
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________  Write a negative review about the worst movie:  ______________ The movie has been on my watch list for a while but I had been too busy with work. It was late at night and I had a lot to do that night. I had started to make a cup of coffee and went to my apartment. I sat down on the couch to watch the movie. I didn't have any issues with the movie in any way. I was just enjoying it. The movie starts off in the morning with a very short shot of a guy on a train going through the tunnel. The tunnel is completely black except for this one light. It's the only light in the entire tunnel. As the train passes a house it's lights start to fade. The light of the house begins to fade and turn into black. As we see the house a man appears in a dark hoodie walking through the darkness. He sees a child running in front of him. He continues on his way. The man picks up the child and takes him into a car. The car starts moving but the man stays in the car. Eventually the headlights of a car appears. He gets out and starts to walk up the street. As he walks he looks over his shoulder and sees the light. He goes into the car and the car starts to slow down. The only thing the car does is speed up. The last image of the movie is of the man walking slowly up the streets of New York. He passes a big skyscraper. It is slowly rotating and going over an edge. The guy turns around and looks into the darkness and sees a woman screaming. He looks around and sees no one. The woman screams a loud scream and we see an image of a person walking up a ramp. The person is looking around and walks slowly down the ramp. We see a black screen and then the person wakes up in a hospital. The people on the screen are a doctor, nurse, and a police officer. They look over his medical record. He is told that his mom died but the doctors can't determine why. They find nothing wrong with him so he gets a scan. The doctor walks up to him and says, "You have a tumor in your head. It looks like a tumor but you have no idea what it is. I can do a biopsy. Your tumor is about 7 centimeters long. Your mother had it too and she is alive." The doctor leaves and then we see a

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  If you like this review please comment & share it with your friends. ___________________________________________  I really enjoyed this one. The movie had so much going on that was well presented and was filled with a lot of action. This movie was a great example of what the future was going to be like. The world is about to be populated and many things are happening as we get further into the film. Some of the characters, the main one being Alex (Trevor Statham), were great, they had depth and personality. Some didn't have it so well but some still made an impression and were interesting. Some were just interesting and had some very interesting action scenes with the police officers. Also, I liked the characters that were there and all of them were likable. I'm sorry but some were way better than others.  The movie has some really great action scenes, very well acted, and all have a purpose. It's a great story too with some great characters. The story starts off with a scene of the aliens landing on Earth, Alex is trying to get the help of the police to fight the aliens. The film starts off slowly at the beginning with many things going on, but it keeps up the momentum and the action with its characters and scenes. The action scenes are well choreographed and are great to watch and even if you're not into this kind of stuff, it's fun to watch it.  it's about the time of the movie where the aliens have landed and they're now trying to take over and spread to other planets, some good and some bad things happen in the beginning of the film as the aliens take over. The bad thing is that people that are too scared of the unknown to help Alex, get killed off. I personally did not enjoy the alien invasion but the other people that help Alex are very well done and had a great impact on the plot. The main characters and the aliens are very similar in many ways. They both use aliens and also some humans as their "experiment". The main thing that I liked about the movie was that there was a lot going on in it. Some things in the film were great but the action scenes were awesome as the cops fight the alien ship. There was also a scene where I really liked, where the cop went up against one of the alien ships, which was a pretty cool scene. I also liked the aliens and how the alien looked and what kind of
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Click to write this article! On this page we'll talk about the differences between movies and tv shows. This is to inform you that movies and TV shows are different from each other. There are a lot of different aspects to a movie, such as characters, plot, style, themes, location, etc. For example, some movies have a dark and gritty style while some have a lighter and fun style. If you enjoy watching a movie you can also tell if you like that style by how it is handled by the directors. In this article we'll explain the basics on how to tell whether you like a movie or if it is a "dumb movie" or a "smart movie". There is no right or wrong answer, you just have to find out yourself. When it comes to the differences, there are a number of factors that can tell you if you liked or disliked a movie. These factors are called The Elements of Movie Evaluation. These are as follows: The main Characters - what do they do and what are they like? What are their motivations? The main Plot - what is the main plot of the movie and what do we know about it? The Setting - what are the locations in the movie. What is their context? The Theme - how does the movie relate to the theme? Is it funny, sad, suspenseful, tense, creepy, action-packed, tense or whatever? The Style - what does the director or writer do with the style? Is the style funny, realistic, sentimental, serious, or whatever style? The Music - What do the songs do and do they fit in the story? What do they add to it? Are they funny or not? Is there some music that is too loud or too soft, just right or just too annoying? The Acting - how do the actors and actresses in the movies do? Is one of the main character's voice annoying, one of their voices likeable, or do they sound the same? How do they look? How is their hair done? What is the clothes they wear? What type of car do they drive? What was their background? The Color of the Scenery - what color are the buildings and buildings in the background of the movies? Is they green, blue, red or yellow? Does the sky look blue, cloudy, cloudy blue, grayish, red, brownish, or some other color? The Backgrounds - does the background look realistic or do you feel it
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________ Review by A_Za (reviewed on 9/23/10) __________________ Rating: [3 of 5 Stars] "It's all about the characters. It's all a drama about the conflict of who you think you are, and who you are."  - Anthony Hopkins (Star Wars)  A star-studded cast is led by Academy Award-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis (in his second appearance as the acclaimed "Prisoner of War" in Lawrence of Arabia) in the lead role of a New Orleans policeman, John Coffey (as the title character) along with Academy Award winner Gary Oldman (In the Line of Fire) as a former Marine who becomes a cop, with Jamie Foxx (Foxcatcher) as an FBI agent who, in the midst of trying to solve the murders of the young, innocent people in the French Quarter, finds himself becoming involved in the life of one of these young victims and a series of violent and mysterious incidents.  Director Martin McDonagh (The Departed, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith) provides a unique look at New Orleans as an American city, as well as taking on the role of the filmmaker. As with all the directors of this generation of Coen Brothers films, McDonaghan has a distinct, unique style of filmmaking. - Daniel J. Morris Review by DAN HARRIS (reviewed September 27, 2010) Review by DAVID E. MOONEY (reviewed December 22, 2010).  In the original script (and subsequent revised script), one of the first scenes that would have been included was the "intersection" of the two storylines. The interweaving of these two stories is an interesting notion, as it would have given the story a greater level of depth and depth in the first act. This idea was not used, however, and in the final film we are treated to a mere three scenes: the first two being brief one-minute segments. McDonogh is able to capture the characters, as the relationship between Coffey and the young girl is quite believable and believable. In the scenes with Oldman and Foxx, the performances are both very good, but the dialogue is extremely shallow and a bit uninspiring. One has to wonder how much better this would have turned out had there been a third actor for Oldman, or had a real actor for Foxx. The third film in the

If you agree that it deserves a positive rating, you might be pleased to know that this page provides you with a few possible ways of rating the movie and assigning it a rating. However, if you disagree with the idea that the movie deserves a rating at all, or think that its rating is not appropriate for its genre, or you simply want to say so, you can simply write a review. The most important point to understand about the review process is that it's entirely voluntary. It's entirely up to you whether to give the movie a positive, negative, or neutral review. Even if you decide that you want to respond to the negative reviews written by people you may have little to no familiarity with, this process will still work, because the movie will still be evaluated for a positive response. But if you really dislike the movie, then you may want to avoid giving it a negative response.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You'll get a little more people to see it, and will probably have it on their list of must-see movies. It also gets you a few extra sales of your DVD or Blu-Ray when you put it on sale. Here's what happened to some of the first reviews I wrote about:  In fact, I was a bit disappointed at how many of my reviews were written and edited after I'd written them - but that's another story. For now, I'll continue to write my reviews about what I saw - and hopefully I'll get better at this! I'll also be trying to get more reviews on my website. I've only written a few reviews, and only a few of those have been positive, so it's going to take some doing. I'll post more articles on my personal website, where I write about what films I think are worth seeing, my favorite movies of the year, and my favorite TV shows.

I wasn't a huge fan of the first movie, but it wasn't bad. And The Muppeteers made me realize why it's so important to make a good Muppet movie. Because the cast is such a great team, the Muppety has a lot to do, and the humor works well in what is essentially a kids show. I've found that you can't just keep it family-friendly, because even the Muppet characters are very different. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________ A "good" movie will make you want to watch it over and over again, and a "great" movie is the same. So it seems that all movie fans have an opinion about "good movies", and it's not an easy task to determine what's a good, what's great. Well, it's possible to use this simple algorithm to do it. This algorithm, called the "Ease of Access" algorithm, attempts to determine if a movie is "good". In this algorithm, it doesn't matter if a given movie is good or great. It just makes the difference that a movie that is "best" for some movie fan is not "best", either. For this algorithm to work, you need to be able to classify movies into two types of categories: "good", and "great". And of course, that means, you also need to know how to identify a "good movie". With this simple definition, we can write a fairly simple algorithm that can make an educated guess about a movie based on its rating on a simple movie review website. Let's define some variables: a) Rating - The numerical value that a rating of a movie will be given by a user on a movie review site. b) A score - This is the rating of the movie by the user on the review site, and this will be a number between 1 and 10. c) Average Rating - This tells you the average rating by all users on the movie review websites that have posted reviews about the movie. If a rating is given to a movie by a particular movie review user, this number will be different for that movie review. d) Average Movie Length - This number tells you how long the average movie is for an average rating. e) Average movie Rating - Average ratings on all the movie rating websites will be averaged to get the average. f) Average Overall Rating - Number of ratings per movie, plus the average Rating, is used to determine a movie's overall rating. g) Overall Rating Score - A score between 0 and 100 is used by this algorithm as a score. This is essentially a "confidence" rating of that particular movie. h) Overall rating Average - The average of the overall movie ratings on the movies with the highest rating will be used to calculate this number. This number gives us a rough estimate of how good a movie really is. It is not the same thing as a movie score, and it does not necessarily give a good picture of

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ Did you know that if you rate a movie online, it doesn't necessarily count as your official opinion? We rate movies for various reasons, but you can only rate the movie once. For example, if you're a fan of a movie and would love to share your thoughts on the movie, you should rate it. You can also share your views via the official movie Facebook page, but we'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. How to Rate a Movie: First of all, you need to get to know your movie (or TV show). To find your movie on the internet, use this website. Just enter the movie's title, and you'll get to the movie page for that movie. You'll find reviews, plot summary, and ratings. To rate the reviews, just click the thumbs up or thumbs down. Just click "add to watch" and you've created a rating for that particular movie. To create a rating, just type in your review and click the button. Your rating will be saved for you in a ratings folder. If you want to share a review, just copy the link from the movie website and paste it into the review. If a movie has the same rating in two ratings folders, the second copy is considered the original review. You will need to change the rating from the original to a more positive one. Once you know your rating, you can start rating the other reviews, and that's it!

It was pretty funny, but it was the acting and the dialogue that kept me glued to my seat. I have to give some credit to the writing for that. It's pretty light, but pretty effective.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ (If the movie is a flop, the director needs to work hard to redeem himself. If the movie has a good cast/crew/director and you liked it, you will write a good review. If you like the movie and the director is a complete douchebag, please don't read this blog.)  Don't review a movie because it's not as good as other movies in your genre. If it's good, it's great. Don't review it just because the director isn't Robert Rodriguez. Don of review it because you thought it was a good story with a good lead actor, and the actors were all really good. Don' t give two shits about why it's rated R instead of PG, or why you think it's a good film. Just say it was pretty good, and leave it at that.  If a movie is good, you'll write about it. If a movie sucks, you won't. So don't bother reading my crappy review. I'm not reviewing movies so I can get rich, I'm just trying to get to the next one. If there are no more movies in the genre for you to see, you're good.  the next movie. You should read more film criticism, and don't forget to like, comment, and share this blog if you enjoyed this blog. It's been fun reading you all, and I'm sorry I haven't been able to keep up with this blog since the end of August. I plan on writing more about the genre of my choice, so keep an eye out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  Ace Ventura: Pet Detective - May 17, 2004Best movie of the year  Reviewer: Nelus - favorite favorite favorite - January 29, 2004  Subject: Just an idea... But wait....   I just finished watching the new "Jackie Brown" movie for the first time. I like this movie, although I'm not that sure about it.   Some of the dialogue is not really dialog at all, it's just the way it sounds, and the way the characters react to the situation, etc.   is a good example of a movie that could have been much better. It's just a good idea (maybe?) to have a good actor read the lines for you as the person who is talking. It would have made for much better acting.   (That doesn't necessarily mean that it was a bad idea. In fact, this seems to be one of the only times where I actually like a movie, but it was kind of a bad one.) - January 28, 2004Just an idea....
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I loved this movie! I enjoyed the story, the characters, the atmosphere and it was just a good time. I had so much fun with this movie. The movie was very well done. I don't know if I am the type of person to just watch a movie and get it over with. I am always on the lookout for a good laugh, and this movie delivered. There were a few times in this movie that were just hilarious. I love a good scene between the two of them and there were several of those moments. The best parts of the movie were definitely the action scenes. I did enjoy some of the comedy and some of these scenes were a good change from the usual action films. I also really enjoyed the ending scene. The whole movie ended with a great bang, and that really made me feel good about this movie and my experience watching it. Overall, a great movie! 5/5.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Apr 30, 2017 5:58 PM  The Boss   As if that wasn't bad enough, there was one more piece of bad news for you as well. "Babel" wasn't the only Netflix movie that was released just one day before the actual premiere of "Babe" in April. "Wanted" was released the same day as "Babes" on May 5 and had to be cut due to technical issues.  All this being said, Netflix's movie business is a very viable business. There's a lot of demand out there for good content on the internet. Netflix can charge premium prices for the content, but they are the masters of distribution, so it's not like they can get away with bad quality just because they can. That being said Netflix's movies are generally not terrible and are probably pretty well done. If you don't want to wait to see if any of the movies are great before you stream them, don't get angry at the movie studios, Netflix or anyone else. There will be plenty of great content to stream on Netflix next month.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen all of them.  One, The Green Mile, is a good film, and I love it.   (I also really enjoyed American Psycho and American Hustle.) I have seen all but one of the films in the series and it seems to me that the best one was The Man with the Golden Arm ( I like the story and the idea of a man with an arm who wants to help people ), but I don't want to be critical, so I'll just say that the second best was the one about a man who used to be a doctor ( the last film was about a doctor who became a lawyer ), the third best was The Exorcist, the fourth best was Dead Poets Society. It's probably a good thing for the series that there was an original script written for all but two of the movies, since if it weren't for the movies being released by the studios, and the original scripts not being released until a few years after the movies were released, I would be wondering what the hell was going on with the films.  The third film, The Last Temptation of Christ, is a strange film, I can see where they were going with it, but the fact that they took their time with it is a shame.  As mentioned above, there were three movies.  I think The Exegesis of Sarah Paulson should be a feature-length movie.  Also, the fourth film, Dead Poet's Society, was the only one that the producers wanted to make, and in the film you can see that they were very interested in making the movie, the producer went as far as writing a second script just for the movie.   That said, the producers should have done this for the rest of the series.   I do not remember seeing any of the other films either.  My favorite was the first movie, The Man With the Golden arm.   The Last T temptation of christ - I don' t know if I liked it as much as I did with The Exegeesis of sarah paulson or not.  If you know, please let me know.   I am writing about this on a very emotional note, and it is something I have felt about the series since it was a child.  Now, I have seen these movies before, but it was the ones from the '70's and early '80's that I found most

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Send a positive email review: _________ Don't like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free  As I watch and rewatch this movie, I can't help but think that perhaps I'm not the only one with mixed feelings about it. The film does a great job of distilling all of the awfulness that has become normalized in society in order to make it easier for everyone to stomach. In the first twenty minutes of the film, the protagonist, Jeff (Rufus Sewell), is shown to have a relationship with an abusive female supervisor. The story is told from Jeff's perspective, as he recounts the events that led him to this point. What we are shown is not a story that you see in a movie; we get a window into Jeff's mind as we witness his attempts to defend his victim from the very people who caused the problem. The movie ends on a similar note of catharsis for the audience who have experienced the trauma, and the film makes it clear that they are never alone. What I was not expecting, however, is how difficult this movie was to talk about.  After watching the film I was faced with many questions, ranging from the obvious like "why is she still there in this movie?" to "what is the point of the movie?" (Answer: not the point!). The problem, however is not so much with the film itself as it is with the audience itself. While there are no problems with the actors or directing, the movie's core issues are in the audience's heads.  (See What people said about this review.)  In my opinion, it's the viewers that have created this scenario. The majority of the comments left on the film's IMDB page are "disgusting" or "disappointing." The majority also seem to take issue with the fact that this film is labeled as "anti-feminist" while a few people seem to consider it as "pro-female." (Not to mention the fact of this being an anti-feminism that I would actually disagree with, but that's a discussion for another day.) ,  To give the film proper credit, however: it's not simply anti-men's rights activists, it is a commentary on patriarchy in general. The entire film is a very pointed discussion of how women are oppressed, and how women in this country are given second chances, but how many of these

It was very touching to see the main character going through such a hard time and it was such a fun watch to see how he overcame it and to see them all come together at the end to defeat the villain. It was well acted by all the actors in the movie and the music was also very memorable, which made for some very good moments.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why? I'd like to think my reviews should reflect my actual opinions on the movie, but that's often not the case. In this case, I feel that the negative reaction to this movie shows that the majority of film critics are very much invested in maintaining a "neutral" perspective on a movie. Many people have a deep seeded dislike for this movie and even if they like it, they can't really say that it is a good one. I don't blame them for this, but I am very glad that they're here for me to read and review. In any case, if you have a favorite movie, please give it a shot. You might find that you enjoy it much more than I did.  Rating: 2/5 - I think my opinion on the film is already known. It's a pretty average action movie with a lot of heart. I found it to be pretty dull and uninspiring. I can't think of any scenes that made me cheer like I might have a few other reviewers mentioned. The script is also very repetitive. I thought it was good to read, but didn't much care for the acting and I have no idea how the film was made.   If you're looking for something to take the edge off after a long day, this might be a nice movie to look at. I've seen it at least four times, but only now have I seen the whole movie, so I don,t know if the reviews are accurate or not. I think that it was made by someone who was looking for a quick and easy cash grab. It was clearly done by someone without a great deal of experience or care for storytelling. It looks very simple, and very cheaply made, and I've no idea why it wasn't a big hit. I mean, who wants to see a story about a bad guy who has to save the world one movie. A lot of people would find that to be dull and not very interesting. .
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ What was once a fun, fast paced, action filled movie, has now become dull, boring and even pretentious. It's become a long, drawn out, and pointless drama, and if you haven't seen it already, there is really no reason to watch it.  Even in the DVD it was in, I saw a whole movie's worth of plot lines get dropped, and some of them have since been mentioned in other reviews. The action scenes are also now repetitive, and not exciting or memorable. I have also been told that the story was confusing and confusing, and I think it is mostly true. I know I have seen more than one review where this is mentioned, and others where it's mentioned as a minor plot point. That being said, it wasn't a problem when I was watching it, and it was really the best of the series. I wish I could say the same of the other 3 films, but they are just too damn long, and take way too much time to be fun. They are not even interesting, just confusing, because they are all connected by the plot line, and so they are not really plot line free, or really plot driven. There are so many things going on, and there is no continuity. It is a mess. _________________ [If you think this review is in poor taste, then please leave your negative feedback by clicking the link]

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ Please write a review about what you enjoyed watching, what you did not like, or what you would like to see improved or reworked in the future.  The best kind of feedback comes from people who have actually seen the movie so they know what it is about. This is especially the case with films that are already widely known, so even if you do not read the rest of this guide then the feedback will be valuable.  "If you want to know what a movie is about, then read the book!" This is a quote I have heard over and over, and it applies to a movie as much as it does to a book. I would say this applies just as much to films as it would to books, because as we've said we can tell what a film is about in just a few words. Here is an example of the kind of comment that is worth writing: ___________________________________________________  "I loved the movie. It was a great thriller with an amazing cast. This was a movie that I would recommend to people who enjoy thrillers. I was also intrigued by the mystery that was hinted at but left unanswered. I did not find the characters completely predictable, but they had enough depth to keep me guessing and intrigued. I also enjoyed the music of the film and it helped to give the characters a real sense of life and danger. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie and recommend it to everyone."  When you watch a movie, your brain tries to interpret what is happening in the film on the screen, which in turn creates a narrative about the story. You might have heard the expression, "If it's not a bad movie, it's a good script." This is just as true in films. You will have noticed that many films have a great script but bad acting or a plot that is not very original. If you enjoy a movie then chances are you will enjoy watching it again and again, but that does not mean you should only see it once. In many ways, movies are like books because they are a way to explore new ideas or look at new aspects of the world. If your movie has great writing and acting but you cannot connect with the characters, then the story is probably not for you. However, you should not let your enjoyment of a movie dictate your decision about whether to watch it or not. You should watch it if you enjoy it, if not then don't watch it. There are a few

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________" (Don't get this part wrong - it says "a movie" - but it means a movie that was filmed or shown - in its original form - and has been viewed by enough people) - in any way, shape or form - for all the time it has been around... it is the most popular movie in the world. It has been shown, watched, watched again, and the list goes on. It is one of those movies that has stood the test of time, the perfect story, the best acting, the most beautiful special effects, the hottest music - and it is a perfect ending. It just doesn't get better than this. The film begins with a short shot of a ship sailing across a beautiful blue ocean. It cuts to a long shot of the ship, the water disappearing below it's hull and rising into the sky like a shimmering sheet. A voice, much softer than the usual Hollywood one, says "I love you" to another man, who is on the opposite side of the ocean. He responds with "I know," and the camera moves slowly around them - slowly. Then a beautiful shot of two girls, one in a dress and the other in a sailor's uniform, floating in a tiny boat. We then see them get into their boat and start out on a journey. Then we get a quick shot of them sailing away into the distance and the voice says "And remember, it is always summer in the tropics" - at which point we see the girls swimming away into a different direction, into a blue, calm blue ocean where a beautiful beach is just visible in the distance. The movie's main character, Jack Dawson, is the son of a local landowner and a fisherman, and it's his destiny to become a "sea dog," able to swim in any direction from his home, the island he has inherited. In this way he will be able to protect his family's little slice of paradise from marauding monsters, from marooning in the open ocean, and from the mysterious "Tortoises," people who live below and steal the life from the fish and sharks below. But a few months after being born, Jack and his twin sister, Amelia, are found by the sea dog captain of a sailing ship and taken to the world below. Their life is changed forever and they soon discover that Jack's destiny is tied to the life of the Tortoise. The Tortoise is a being who has
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________  A film like The Godfather: Part II is about the triumph of good over evil, while a film like American Hustle is about overcoming obstacles. I think the question is whether The Great Debaters of Our Time—for better or worse—have succeeded in their goal of overcoming this obstacle.  At least in my opinion, it's not going well. To me, it feels like the kind of thing where you could make it a little less interesting by making it a debate over who is the smartest person, but then I get really excited about it—the question at the center of it, the idea of a debate. I hope it goes somewhere, because I like these kinds of movies.

They're usually created from clips of public speaking and debates that people love to watch, and the vigne vignet, the short vigne that accompanies them, is often composed by the host, sometimes by a different, usually guest host, and sometimes by another guest.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________   The New England Patriots are currently 8-1 and riding an incredible 11-game winning streak. It is safe to say that this team has had its share of ups and downs throughout the season and that their latest performance is an excellent example of just how much of a monster this squad really is. This is a team that has outscored opponents by an average of more than 45 points per game. That isn't an easy feat to accomplish and it has been accomplished a lot this season, with the last 12 of the team's 12 wins coming by an aggregate score of over 60 points. They may not be the only team to do it, but the Patriots have done it at a very high level and the record speaks for itself. With a victory tonight they'll remain unbeaten, hold the #1 spot in the NFL's power rankings and will take a 2-0 lead in the AFC East.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________  "Hands down one of my most anticipated films of 2016. I don't know what makes a good film, but there are a lot of them out there. You don't need to have read the script to know that this film is really good. And if you can only pick one film to go watch this year, I think it's going to be 'Hands Down'." -Tristan Harris (Writer/Director, Fences)  Hands Up (2016) is an epic movie about the Trayvon Martin case. This film is being directed by Ava DuVernay, the director of Selma and of the Oscar winning documentary 12 Years a Slave.   In 2008, Florida teenager Trayvon Martin was murdered after being attacked by George Zimmerman. It has come to be known as the "Martin Case" which has become a huge news story throughout the world.  , director, Ava duVernaya, has directed the following:  Lights Out (2015)  The Help (2015), Fruitvale Station (2013), 12 Years A Slave (2013) and Selma (2012) .  The following is an overview of the story and how it is set up.   was a movie about Trayvon Martin. This movie follows the life of a 16 year old African American teen who is attacked in Sanford Florida by George Zimmermans racist neighborhood watchman, who is later acquitted of the killing. The movie chronicles the young boy's life and his death in the months and years following the incident. This is a movie that I strongly recommend you watch, you will not regret watching this.  .  of all the movies in this list of movies about the Zimmerman case there are two in particular that I highly recommend you to watch this:. This a movie based on the George Zimmerman case, where the film explores the aftermath and aftermath of the shooting, in Florida. This was a very hard movie to watch because it dealt with the subject matter of this controversial case, so this movie would not be recommended to anyone who does not have a background in the Trayvon case. The other movie that this movie was made from wasand it is a story of two brothers, who meet one another during their senior year at high school. They end up becoming best friends through their shared struggles with their brothers relationship and the way the world has treated them in the past.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I think the only good movie in my top 25 was The Sixth Sense. I don't even like the James Cameron movie. I would be much more comfortable seeing this film if it didn't have Michael Keaton as the lead. But it is still one of the best movies of the year. I had been watching these films all year in the order: The Last Airbender, Avatar, The Avengers, The Hobbit, Spiderman, The Hunger Games. I watched each film with an expectation that I would have a good time with it. But I didn't get that. I was expecting a lot out of these films, but I didn, and that's what made the whole experience disappointing. I didn the movies in the correct order, but when it came to the actual film itself, I got no enjoyment or enjoyment from it. As I look back on the past year, it was disappointing for a number of reasons. The most obvious reason is that I didn It wasn't bad, it just wasn't what I had come to expect from a summer movie. If you haven't seen any of the films I've mentioned, then I don' t think any of them will seem that bad to you. But if you've seen the films that I've named in the previous paragraph, then you have to admit that these films just didn't live up to my expectations. I had a lot of fun watching The Last airbender, but there were other aspects of it that didn't work. I really enjoyed watching Avatar, but the action sequences were not well done, and the film was rather dull at times. And Spiderman was a lot better than it should have been. I'll still watch them, but they will not be as fun to me as I would hoped. But even if you haven' t seen any part of this year's top 25, I think it's a pretty good time to be a fan of films. I think you will have a lot more fun watching the films listed in the above list than you did watching the ones that are listed in my original list. In the end, I don', t think this year was all bad, but it just doesn' t feel like it. I do look forward to the rest of the season, though, and I think the majority of the fans will agree that this was a year of high highs, and low lows.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ Reviewing a film has become more and more popular on the Internet. Even I have written a review for one of my movies, but I don't like to call it a review, since that makes it sound like I am not paying attention to it. I have found that if you call it that, people will look more closely at it. Therefore, for all you budding reviewers out there, I thought I would write a blog about my thoughts about one of the most interesting and popular movies of the year, which I found to be an incredible and entertaining movie. It was funny, poignant, thought-provoking, and surprisingly touching. The film had a truly unique look and feel to it, so I decided to describe what I loved about it. _______________ The plot is very simple. A girl named Julie (played by Rosemarie DeWitt) has just moved to New York City. She is desperate to meet other people so that she can find a new place to live. Julie is a pretty, attractive, good-looking girl who works as a model. She has never seen New York before and is terrified by the changes she sees around her. Her boyfriend, Aaron (played in the movie by Michael Caine) is a young man who is very excited about the new environment he is seeing, but who is also extremely nervous. Julie has a hard time adjusting to life in the big city. But she is determined to find a better way to live, and to make New York her home. She meets Paul (played brilliantly by Tom Wilkinson) and Alex (played wonderfully by Sam Waterston), two young guys who look like they came from another planet. Alex is an expert at computers and computers, while Paul is a genius mathematician. Julie and Alex seem to fit together, but there is more to them than that. Their differences are very apparent, but they seem to work well together. When Aaron meets Paul and Julie, he finds them both extremely attractive and charming, and he gets excited about life in New York. But he also has his own demons that he has been trying to deal with. His girlfriend is a very successful model. He has a job, a car, and a girlfriend. Julie's job is to find him a new apartment. ___________________________ There were many interesting characters in this movie. I felt that each of them had something to offer. For instance, Paul has two best friends: Alex and Julie. But I don\'t think that

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ The world needs more good movies.  5. What is the most important piece of advice you would give to a young actress?  If you're not being funny, don't be funny. ,  6. What film do you think is the best of the genre (comedy, drama, romance, etc.)?  that's just a very broad question, but I think it's the best film of the year. The thing about that movie is that its very emotional. It's an emotional movie, and that's why it works. I thought the movie worked because it's based on reality and people who are real, and people whose emotions are real. And I think that movie worked for a reason.   7. Tell us about your audition process. Do you get an idea of what you have to do from the roles you have read?   Yeah, I guess so. It depends on what you're looking for. But the roles are always different. You get some that you really like, and some that maybe don't work with you that much. That's all part of the audition process though.    8. Do either of you have any favorite quotes or quotes you like to share with your fans?  is just amazing to me, because it gives me strength and strength is something I need sometimes. That movie really helped me grow and changed me as a person. I think my next movie I'm gonna try to do that. It was a very sad movie. I mean, what a movie. And that scene where they're in the car, and he's giving them a ride was so tragic. It really was. That scene really hurt me. And the other scene was very funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ "The Last Emperor" (2016) - A Great Historical Drama! I watched this movie last month as part of my pre-Sic Seminar in History of the Chinese Martial Arts, and I must say I was blown away! I wasn't expecting this movie to be that good, and then this week I got the DVD from Amazon and immediately picked it up! I think I must have watched this about a dozen times and really enjoyed every time. This movie is amazing! I didn't really understand most of the dialogue (though I did understand the character names, and that's a good thing!), but I have a feeling that the cast did a phenomenal job, and it was easy to follow their conversations. I thought this was a great start to a great movie, and this review is just a brief summary of my own impressions! "The Last Empress" is a great film to watch if you are a history buff, or just are curious about the life and legacy of this "strongest woman in history" who is the first emperor of China. I was impressed with how smoothly the story was told, and how well the characters and the script conveyed the political turmoil that was going on in China at this time. I especially enjoyed the fact that the story wasn't about her as a person, or the lives she lived, but more about her legacy as emperor, her people, and the legacy of martial arts in China. The history is well-presented, and you don't need to be a history nerd to enjoy this movie! One thing I have to say is that I found this movie really hard to watch, and was very disappointed in myself. I have done a bit of martial art, and there is a bit about it I don't like, but I guess I just didn't pay enough attention. But, this isn't a great martial art movie, so I just wish that I could have understood more about what the people who were fighting and doing those moves were doing and why it worked in that specific way. It would be cool to see someone else give it a shot, though. And one thing I really liked is that the movie is set in 1912, and doesn't spend too much time talking about modern day China. There are other movies and TV shows about that history that I have watched, but this movie is great for a more historical movie. This is one of those movies that I would recommend if you're just curious about history, and if you
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ [Note from John: Thanks to all who have sent me comments about this article. My only comment on this one is that it is a bit odd to hear so many people say they liked "The Girl in the Spider's Web." It may have been a good story that was poorly told, but it didn't have that special, "we've been there" feeling that makes it memorable. I'll have to think about it a bit more to figure out why so many seem to feel so strongly about it.] ___________________________________________  The Most Beautiful Death Ever  "There are some things you just have to die for. Even if it's a one-in-a-million shot." – John Wick  In the year 2036, a team of scientists discover a small, worm-like creature with a strange set of biological properties. After being tested on and studying its body, the team discovers that the creature has the ability to convert oxygen into nitrogen, and then return it to normal levels. It is only after this discovery that the team realizes that the worm is a living being and not an experiment. They soon realize that their discovery could be a huge step in the right direction for mankind and decide to use the worm to help create a better world for all, as well as to learn more about their new found alien ability. In 2036 San Francisco is a bustling city full of rich people and people living lives of luxury and wealth. In the heart of this city lies the sprawling and highly industrialized San Francisco State Mental Hospital. With all the money being made in the world, the insane and crazy are being sent there to be put down by police. However, the government is using a private army of security guards in the city to make sure there are no accidents.  After finding out that this new creature could be the key to the world's health, the staff of the hospital's staff of medical experts and staff of security try their best to find the right way to study and exploit the creature. As the team members get more and more involved, they find a whole host of ways that the new creature can be used. One of the team's main goals is to get the creature out of the facility, and they get involved in a whole lot of unexpected and fun situations as they pursue this goal. As they continue to learn about the creature and its ability, they also learn more and learn how to make use of it. The creature's abilities are almost

There are plenty of movies that people have come up with explanations for. The movie is stupid, because of poor writing, the actors are terrible, the film is an allegory, the movie is a piece of trash, etc. In the best movie explanations, the explanation is usually in the form of a question. The question: Why don't you just buy a lottery ticket and be a happy camper? The answer: That would require that you understand what makes winning a lottery tick. That's not my problem. If you really want to make a movie, don't think about why a movie sucks. It's a film, it's just a movie. Instead, think about what it's doing right.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A great flick!" 5.  How the Story Was Structured Why it was an amazing movie: "It was a good idea to follow a young boy, his family, and his dog from the day they set out to escape from the Nazi's to his father's final words and his final final journey." Why was it amazing: The movie has a simple plot: The young boy is on the run, the family is reunited, the boy has a dog, and the dog gives the boy a last minute gift, and this is all the plot of the movie. There is a lot of tension and tension is what movies are made of, the whole movie is filled with great atmosphere, you get the sense that you can feel the danger from a mile away. A great movie that doesn't try too hard to be anything more than a good, funny, and well-acted family movie, it doesn't do anything but be great. "The Little Engine That Could" is one of those movies where you have to just sit back and admire it, it is an amazing film that can be appreciated by anyone, because it is just that good, the tension is so well written and paced, and it is also a great story. For more about The Little Engine that Could,  check out this video: 4.   The Cinematography Why It was an Amazing Movie: I don't really think I can explain how amazing the camerawork is in this movie, the cinematography really shows the tension and anxiety of the situation in that the camera pans around the action constantly, you feel the constant tension that the characters are in, but not overused, it makes it look natural and it makes you feel as if you are there with them. Why Was it Amazing: It's a great picture. The music is beautiful. It has an amazing soundtrack that really helped bring the story to life. This was a great movie to watch with friends, or with someone who is new to film, it has that great mystery that you feel while watching it that I loved. 3.    The Dialogue Why this movie was amazing:  It is a really funny, well acted movie. It is a movie that makes you laugh out loud when you think about the things that are being said, and they make you feel really bad for these characters. What was amazing is the dialogue.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  [X] Save the Cat A little girl who was just released from the hospital comes home to find that her house is on fire and her father is missing. Now she has to find him. She calls on her cats and two big friendly dogs, a golden retriever and a pug.   If I were asked to describe myself in a few words, I'd probably say that I'm a big nerd. I love science fiction, fantasy, and horror movies, but I also love movies about family and friends. For my birthday in 2009, my parents bought me a ticket to the movie "Frozen." I didn't know what it was about, or who the characters were supposed to be, but after seeing the movie, I instantly knew I had to see it again. The story is incredibly popular, and you can see why: A girl, Queen Elsa, is in the process of getting ready to have a massive, magical, ice sculpture made. Elsa gets stuck in the sculpture for a long time, which is weird and scary, but also pretty awesome, because she's a queen, and that's supposed to make her happy. At some point, Elsa's ice sculptor, Olaf, comes to help her, and eventually the two bond. They bond because they both have a need for independence, and Elsa's a lonely and sheltered princess. I'm really glad I got to see this movie as a kid, because now it's on my list of favorites.  It's no secret that the Hunger Games films (and the spinoffs and the books by Suzanne Collins) are incredibly popular and successful. I think it's because they take a really interesting and relatable premise, and they put a lot of effort into making it so everyone feels like they're in that world. The first one even made $1 billion worldwide (the latest one, at least, made over $500 million). It also has the most famous character of all time, Katniss Everdeen, and a series of books that take place in the world of Panem. The books and films are all fantastic, but they all have something in common: It's a dystopian future in which a rich, privileged, elite class rules and uses its wealth to force people into a militarized, authoritarian society. It's an incredibly well-crafted and believable world, and I think the reason why it's so popular is because of that realistic premise. , directed

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Budgets get saved!" - Paul Schrader
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ Write a bad review about someone else's movie: The most common problem is people forgetting they're writing reviews. It's a little known fact that you should always review people's movies on the Internet. It might sound like a waste of time, but it's a huge benefit in the world of film. You may get some strange comments, but people will usually remember if you're not nice. Just remember, your job is to give people a good experience and not to make them feel bad about their purchase. If a customer doesn't like their product, you need to take responsibility for that as well as to give them a bad product. For example, if a customer bought an expensive coffee and is dissatisfied, don't blame the coffee, blame the customer. People don't buy coffee just because they feel good. In general, a good and helpful review is a customer's best friend. It helps you and your business get the best out of your customer. It will get their attention and increase their chances of buying another item. It has the added bonus of helping the customer buy more. Just like that, positive reviews are a good investment. And you'll probably get more good reviews than bad ones. If you're ever thinking of quitting your day job, be careful what you wish for. It can turn into a nightmare. A lot of writers have quit because they got a bad recommendation from a friend or they decided to quit writing for a living. It was so disappointing when they quit that they went back to their day jobs, just to get that bad recommendation back. Now, some writers are more critical than others and some of them write reviews for a job they don't like, like being a movie critic or critic. This is an example of the last mistake a reviewer can make. Sometimes when people are reading a movie review, they'll say, "If the movie was that good, why didn't you like it?" The answer to that is, "Well, I enjoyed it a lot, but I have this other movie that's better." It sounds really silly and it may sound silly to you, but the average movie reviewer doesn't really enjoy movies. He or she just goes in and writes a review and gets it on the net. Then, when someone goes to the website and buys the movie, he or she thinks the review is really good. Now it's time for the movie reviewer to suffer the consequences of what happened. He may have just given a bad and negative

If you have no opinion on the movie then the only way you will know is if you ask someone who has an opinion. If people can't be bothered to make their own opinion then the movie is worthless. I'm looking for good movies. Not cheesy or pretentious. I've never really been impressed by a movie that tries to pretend it's edgy and new by having some good acting. That's pretty much why the internet is not a very good place to make a movie. But I can give you my opinion. _________ I think this is a good film. There are some flaws. I also think it's not very well written. The ending was pretty much the only part that didn't make me angry. But it was fun to watch. I liked the comedy and the way it was presented.

The book is told in first-person from the POV of the main character, Sam (no last name given). As Sam is being stalked by a mysterious young woman, his best friend and girlfriend, Amanda (A.J. is a pseudonym), is also targeted by the same mysterious young women.   It is quite dark. However, you have the chance to feel a bit of hope. Sam is a kind and kind-hearted man who has never been in a real physical fight in his life. He is willing to do whatever it takes to find Amanda and save her life. As he becomes increasingly worried about his best friends life and Amanda's safety, he gets more and more suspicious that the women stalking him are truly after the person Amanda loves.   to the reviewer:  This book has some of the best descriptions ever. I absolutely loved the description of the woods. You don't have a clue what's out there, but you know there is danger. The author is a true master at writing descriptions.   (5 stars)
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ This is a very good film, with plenty of action and a very interesting plot line.  The two main characters are very well written and seem very realistic.  And there are so many action scenes, they are impossible not to love.  It is a must see for fans of the genre.  I highly recommend the DVD version which has a better quality transfer and a new 2-disc version with added extras.  But for the value you receive in a DVD, it's hard to beat.  ( I have also seen the film on a VHS and a Blu-Ray).  Overall, I can't say enough about this movie.  To be honest, I never thought I'd see it again and I was so glad I found it on Netflix.  If you are a fan of action movies, I highly encourage you to take a look.  A film as entertaining as this would be a wonderful addition to any collection. Rating:  8.5 out of 10 I've recently found out how much my wife loves Star Trek.  She thinks she has been a fan since the age of 6, growing up in the '60s.  She watched the first couple series in the late '60's and remembers seeing Leonard Nimoy in the first film.  While there, she saw her first time in a Star Trek movie (the second).  We were both blown away and have been fans ever since.  So we decided to make a Star Fleet Academy tribute to our favorite franchise.  We hope it helps people to enjoy the classic series as much as we do. In the Beginning... In order to help get you to Star Trek... I've created a few different sections for you.  Let's get started. Star Trek - The Next Generation Season 1  (1966-1969) This series is based on the television show and is the starting point for most fans.  Unfortunately, some of the original cast members did not reprise their roles.  This is a good series if you have no idea who the main characters and villains are and are looking for a fun series to watch in its first season. Season 2   (1969-1972) We will now take a journey through the years, as we follow the crew of the Enterprise-D through the first four seasons.  After that, we'll move on to the new series. This section is also for you if you are
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  (1) It was a funny and original movie. I don't know how many people would have seen that and enjoyed it. And the acting was great.   (2) I think there's an underlying theme of not being able to accept what you are and what you've done. In a way, what a lot of people would call "bad choices" in life.   the other interesting thing about this movie is that it did what many other movies have done -- had a "message" and a "proclamation" as to where the movie wanted to take the character, but at the same time was not preachy and didn't make anyone angry or feel sorry for them, or feel bad about the way their life was going or the way the world was going. (3) "Life, it ain't what you make it" was one of my favorite lines in the movie. _________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Don't read a negative review of a movie. It's just annoying and it doesn't reflect how good the movie is. Instead, read a positive one that says the movie wasn't as good as it could have been. The goal is to get rid of any negative thoughts and the process of doing so helps you to calm down. Here is how to remove negative thoughts:  Sit comfortably with your back straight. Close your eyes.  Take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth.  it's okay to gag a little bit so hold it in. , don't think about that negative thought at all. It will just overwhelm you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________. Do not talk about bad movies at all.  Use a positive exclamation like, "I HAD A GREAT TIME!" or "It was really great!" or some other non-negative exclamation, that you wouldn't use with a negative movie (like, "Gross!" or, "Oh, shucks!". )  Say, "It wasn't that bad. It wasn't as bad as the one before."  Do not use a negative or neutral exclamation at all in any sentence. , (unless there are negative/neutral adjectives preceding it, in which case the exclamation should be used to emphasize that). The only exception to this is when the wordis used in a negative sentence to indicate that the subject's experience is actually good, and the wordsfollow it, as in" It wasn�t that bad; my friend actually liked it.", or, when used by someone who really likes the movie (i.e.,"It was a great experience! I really enjoyed it! You should see it!") It is important not to use negative words in a positive sentence. You could, for example, say, "He didn't do a very good job at playing the guitar", or "I didn't really like it, but she did. She liked it better than she ever liked anything I had ever seen. And it was interesting that she enjoyed it so much.", and so on, because, again, this is a negative statement; what's being said is, "This is an experience I had, and it was good." You could also say "I liked it more than I did before, because my friend made me really enjoy it. But it wasn't great. I liked it just okay." Or, "Well, I really liked it. I can�t think of any other film I like that much." or "Well? I�m glad I came. I don't think I ever want to go back." Don't use "it was", "it�s", "its", "their", "thats", "there", "they", "them", "theirs", "an they", "his", "hers", "her", "a his", "e it", "me its", or any other word that indicates that the thing it describes is happening. (i). You could say "That movie was pretty good."; "That game was pretty boring."; or "
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ How do I do that?  You don't. You don't care about movies. You're not an expert on movies. And if you're an expert, why would you even care? , you know, that, I think that the thing that most surprised me when I started studying the whole business was how people like, and how, if you want to talk to a movie executive, there was nothing. That people actually didn't care. I mean, they could be a little bit annoying, but the only thing I did was, you get to a certain point in a movie, and then you say something like "I think I can make this better" or "We've got to get rid of this" or it's the only time the executive even raises an eyebrow.  There was not a lot of conversation. I think a movie company has got a certain value, they're valuable for their advertising budget, but it was the same in, uh, the seventies, it was just business. You know, we're all business people. But you know what they didn't talk about? I don't know, they just don't talk. And you know something? Even in the seventys, they didn of course know what movies you liked, but they don't really know what you liked. They didn't know what movie you wanted to see, which is very different from the internet, where the guy's like "hey, what movies should I see?" And you're like "oh, I'm gonna go see, "I don't like 'X' at the moment but I'm hoping it'll work." It's a completely different world. 1:10:25 If you're a film-goer, and I don' t mean like a movie-goerd. Like, I don't mean just a person who likes to go to a cinema but does not necessarily go to see a film. It's like, um, "you know, I like the fact that you're not watching it in the cinema, I also like the idea that we can have this conversation". What are your goals in your filmmaking career?  The ultimate goal of filmmaking is I don', t know. Um, if I had to have a goal in my life, it would be just to not be in debt. And then when I say 'don't be in…', that doesn't mean 'don' t work'. And

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ (A big thumbs up if you like the movie!)  "The first two hours were filled with beautiful, natural imagery, but as the story goes on we're left with a plot that's convoluted and poorly executed, and one that feels rushed."  -ComicBook.com   "I have to admit I'm a little disappointed, but it's not because of the plot.

I'll only do it if I feel like I have something to say. If you see this, don't think for a second that you've missed the point of the movie because you don't have anything to say about it.

However, if you just want to watch the movie to see Robert Downy Jr. again, go ahead, but I feel the first few scenes are worth mentioning. 'You know me, when I see something I really like, and I really want to be in it, I'll just do it, no questions asked,' he says at the end of the first scene. That's exactly what Robert did. The rest of the interview is dedicated to showing why Robert chose to make this movie. Here, Robert explains why he chose to become a professional poker player, and why he thinks people are scared

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are so many.  They're the ones that make a difference.  There are some great movies that don't necessarily have one of the above qualities.  When I say "great movie" I don't mean "great" in the same way that you could argue that a painting is great just because it's a painting.  I mean that the movies were just that good. They stood out in a crowd of movies.  My favorite movies are usually made by people I admire.  They're not movies I want to go see because I want a perfect movie. I want them to entertain me, and the most fun movie I've seen this year was The Grand Budapest Hotel.  And I don.t mean to disparage other movies that I did enjoy.   It's very rare for a movie I'm not going to watch to go on to make it to #2 on my list. My list isn't going to be the first thing anyone sees, but I'd say it's my favorite.  This is something I do every year.  Every year, when I get down in December, I start planning my Christmas movie list.  Most of the time, it doesn't work out.  It usually takes me a little longer than I expected to find a good one. I try to stick to the following list for my list of top Christmas movies. I'm doing my best to make the movies easy to find.  So here's a list of my top 5 Christmas movies and what they're about. 5.  In the Heart of the Sea There is so much to love about this movie.  For one thing, it's an Oscar winning movie.   The movie tells the story of a group of men who are on a boat that is about to be attacked.  In an attempt to save the ship, the men begin to sing a song which ends up saving their lives.   This song is called "In the Heart Of The Sea."   But what is so great about this song is that it is so simple.   The men don't have to explain their song because it is such a catchy melody.   That's the kind of movie I love.  4.  What's Up, Doc? What's Up Doc?  There's a time for humor, and this movie is not only a comedy, it is a dark comedy.  The movie stars the great Gene Wilder, and he has a

You have your family, your buddies, your neighbors and maybe a few other people who are involved. It all comes together in an authentic way."  a7e  An interesting family film that makes fun of itself. The movie has a lot of action that will excite everyone who comes in contact with it." , NY Daily News  Makes you think...a nice family film, fun for adults, but children will enjoy it too. A nice surprise for all." .  Review:  Good Time is a raunchy and irreverent look at the lives of three men and their families, with an ending that will delight young and old.  "Good-time" stars the likes of Michael Ian Black, John Malkovich, Danny Trejo, Robert Forster, Steve Buscemi, Kevin James, Robert DeNiro, Peter Stormare, and Christopher Lloyd. : The film opens with a bang, and stays there, with the audience in for one hell of a ride. Good-time's lead character, Will, is an alcoholic, gun-toting, high school dropout who's about to be released from a psychiatric hospital after an escape attempt. His first night out, he goes to a local restaurant and gets into a heated argument with a woman. Things escalate until Will starts shooting a man in the parking lot. He is quickly caught, and is sentenced to ten years in prison. The prison population is as small as it can be, and the staff are all in it together. There's an alcoholic and a crack-smoking man named Jack who is one of Will's guards. There is also a young, beautiful young woman named Sharon, and an older man with a bad temper named Joe. The jail is run by a man named Chuck, who is also responsible for the "poker game" and "black market" that keeps the town running smoothly. If anything, Good-Time plays it smartly by giving you what you

Byrne says he was aware the project could get people riled up, but he didn't anticipate how it would.  to the extent that it is an artform, it doesn't become so easily dismissed. : The film is in the public domain, which means that anyone can watch it and use it in any way they want without needing permission from the original makers.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ I would recommend that you start with a movie that you really enjoy. If you think it is worth watching, it will give you the motivation to watch more movies. You will get some enjoyment out of it, and at the same time you will learn something. You may also find that you get better at reading subtitles. As you go through the movies, try to learn as much as you can about the characters, the scenes, and the story. Learn what is going on. It may be funny that you can say, "What is this guy getting himself into?" or "What happened to this girl?" as you watch a movie. This is a way to help you learn about the story, to help give you perspective on it, to improve your understanding of the characters in the film, and to get more involved with the story that is being told. This may help you identify characters that you want to become attached to. And you may get some ideas for your own movies. I recommend that when you watch this movie that when it is over, you start watching some of the other films that the director has done. For example, if you liked the first movie, you could watch the second movie. The director, Tim Burton, has done a lot of great work in other films. I am sure that you would like his other films, such as Corpse Bride, Ed Wood, and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. You could even get a taste of his style of animation in the last two films in the trilogy. This is a great way to learn. You can get a lot out of watching films like this. You might learn something about film, but you might also see how it all fits together and how many layers of story are there. It could be very educational, too. It gives you a different point of view on the world. I think that people could learn something from this movie. Now, about the title.  The title is a little confusing. Some people say that it is an anti-war movie. It is not. It doesn't even seem to be a "war movie." The movie was about the war in Iraq, and one of the main characters (George Clooney) was a soldier. That is why it is called "The Best Years of Our Lives." The main character (John Cleese) wanted to be an actor, but he was unable to. It was because of the

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A film review is a simple way to bring people to the movie. The movie itself isn't anything special, but if you give people something to discuss about the film, it will get people talking. For example, a movie review on IMDB can bring more people to a movie than just the movie itself, as this review can explain the reason the film is on a lot of people's radar, and what it means about the audience. I've been writing reviews for a couple of years now, and while I've done them for mostly movies I've seen, recently I've been reviewing more TV shows, especially from the summer. TV reviews aren't nearly as important as movies are, but I still think they're a nice addition to the show-watching experience. This is the latest in a series of TV reviews I've written, and I've really enjoyed watching the seasons of shows I hadn't even heard of before (and probably wouldn't even know if I had). Most of these shows are pretty good and entertaining, so it's great to have a source of information when it comes to TV shows. The thing that I have noticed about these reviews is that there's an order to how the shows are reviewed. Usually, the first episode of the series gets a bit more attention than the second episode of a season.  For the first season of True Blood, I had a hard time finding episodes to write about. I'm not sure why that is, as it isn't that the show is bad; it's just that there wasn't much to write down about.  The third episode of True blood, however, got me interested, but that's about it. For my True Blood review, I'm doing the same for the fifth season. The season is getting a lot more coverage, but this is still a fairly new show. The fifth episode of season five, titled "The Devil's Share", will be up tonight at 9pm EST, so I will see you then.

(2) The Business of Steal: This documentary looks at how thieves work and how the police deal with them. (3) The Economics of Steal and Theft: This document focuses on economics and business. (4) The Sociology of Steal/the Law of Steal - This document is based on the history of the law of theft and theft/theft in America. This is my second documentary I've done, and I have no idea if the money went to charity. I think that's the idea. I also found a movie in the theater that might be interesting: (5) The Great Gatsby.   -Cary C.  Kerry, VA  I am a big fan of the show, I've been a fan of this show for about five years now. It always makes me laugh, makes me think, and most importantly it makes me feel good. I appreciate the honesty of the writing, and the way the show does not sugar coat the truth. I have watched the DVD's of the last three seasons on line, and have enjoyed them all.   in my opinion, the best part of the documentary, besides the fact that it shows the reality of stealing, was that it really shows the difference between an honest thief, and an honest and dishonest thief. I find that, that is usually not the case, but if there was an honest person on the show who could steal, then I think the show would be great.   and I'm not just saying this to make a big ass statement like this is some kind of conspiracy theory, no. there really is a difference. and if you are stealing from someone, whether its a friend, a family member, a store or someone you dont know, its a crime. not to say that stealing from a store isnt a crime, its just a different crime than stealing from an innocent person. and I hope this document shows that. I really do.    I love the documentary! Thank you for taking this time out to post this on our site!  Mimi A.  the show is amazing!!! I have listened to all of the seasons as well as all the box sets. i love them all very much, I love how frank the show was about

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I can say with complete confidence that the second one is going to be the best. The second movie, The Last Jedi, is going way beyond anything I expected, and I can't wait for the third one. The music is so great, it has me in stitches. I really have no idea what is going on anymore, but that is the joy of it all. I just want to see the third movie as much as I can. If I had a dollar for every time I have been impressed by a character's ability to get things done, I would have at least three hundred dollars. This movie is so intense and entertaining, that I think it should be in everyones top 10 list. The story is so good, that it is hard to believe that it could have been true, but it is. I was completely shocked. I mean, I thought it was an elaborate joke or something. If the Jedi were real, that is. They did say that they are not, however, that they would never die, and they were trying to keep it a secret. But now that they have killed them, it is so depressing to think that they were really so awesome, but then they became evil, because they couldn't do what they wanted to do. Now you get a much better idea of how they lived. It makes it even more heartbreaking to think about that they all died, like some sort of terrible mistake. I am so disappointed that they took the fun out of it. There were plenty of great moments in the movie, but they were not enough to make up for the loss of the great characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________, I can't tell you how much I love to watch movies and I am trying to decide what movie is worth watching. I like to share my thoughts about the movie with other people. What movie has you liked, that you didn't write a review about? Please don't just say it is a bad movie because it is bad, there are many good movies out there that you don't know about. I am interested in other people's thoughts about movies and sharing what you think about them.  What's your best movie memory? _________ What's your favorite movie from my childhood? When I was a kid, what movie did you like to watch? What's the best movie I have ever seen? What are your favorite and least favorite childhood movies? I have a feeling that my favorite childhood movie would be the movie called Little Nemo: Dream Master! I remember being scared that I was going to die because I had to see it. It was the movie that I always watched as a kid. I was really disappointed when I got it. What are you watching right now? I've just watched "Dunkirk." The movie looks really good, the acting is good and the music is very nice. What's next? I really like all the films that I've seen this year and I want to see them again next year. I'm really excited about the new film "Get Out." I like how the movie plays on the idea that the black community is in danger. I think that this movie is going to be very popular. 1/3/2017: My favorite memory is watching "The Wizard of Oz" with my father when I was 2 years old. I watched it on my bed and my dad had to go to work so I waited until he came home. He brought the movies with him and my mom took my brother and me to a movie theater near our house. My father told us stories about his adventures in Oz and we watched "The Wonderful Wizard of OZ" together. It wasn't very long, but it was the beginning of my love for movies. I still have that memory of "The Wiz" with the "Pixie Dust" and the silver car.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  Cynthia Ritter   I was born into the world of Hollywood's A-list stars, but now I have fallen down the A-listers' pecking order and am the "A-lister" in the A.O.C.C."   http://www.starboard.net/~critter/cronin/my_first_book/cr-v4.html   My first book was about a famous actor... a film star...   "He had a face that no one would like to see and a name that no man could resist."  's book was all about what it took to become a movie star. She told about some of the obstacles she faced, like being offered "only $50 for an evening of entertainment in Hollywood" and her own personal "fatal flaw" - she was anorexic and didn't want to take her doctor's advice to get over the weight and gain more weight and muscle.   Some people say that's it's all in your mind - your mind controls your body - but the author says it's not really in your head. It's really in the way you think - your thoughts control your body. And she shows us the ways she was able to control her thoughts and control her body.   in my first book, I focused on the importance of finding your role... the roles you want to play and the ones you can play. I focused more on how to be a confident star and how to build your career.  's second book is about the art of acting... how to become an actor and how it's different from every other art. I didn't tell her about my experiences as a child acting in theater, on TV and on film, or the acting teacher I had. I talked about what makes acting different. I emphasized the importance for a career to be about your life and your passions... not about the fame.  .   and now I'm a "A Starboard" member and I'm always reading about the top people. If I were to give you one piece of advice, it would be to focus on your own life, you have control of your own destiny.   It's funny... I'm sure you have some people in your life who will always be a competitor... and some people who are your true friends. But it's your life, it's yours to choose. And when you decide to do

It's a very sexy story, and although you will never see the actual act in this movie, you will understand how it should be and what is really going on behind the scenes. It makes you appreciate the artistry involved in film making and it will have you thinking, 'Wow, I can never watch this again' and then be reminded why it is a special movie." - Anonymous   Please rate the movie in the following: __________________Please rateThe movie is:

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. The more information you can give a movie, the more likely you are to have a good experience with it.  _______________________  I don't want a review. I want an idea. If you have a better idea I will gladly give it a try.  in other words you need to have some kind of idea of what the film is about. A really good idea is, you want to go see a movie and if you have some idea what it is about you will have a much better experience. , so try to be thorough. A review for example is a description of the movie. So if you're going to a film and you want a really good review, go see the movie first, read the synopsis and then write a detailed review about it. In fact, when a film goes on its opening weekend, and if it has a decent word-of-mouth, they will usually let people talk about it in advance, so it is a great way to get some first impressions. And finally, here is something that may not be obvious, but is really important. I love people who know everything. I think it's great if you know all the details. So do not spend all of your time trying to find out what the plot is. Find out what is interesting, what the characters are like, how they interact with one another, what their relationships are like. If you want more tips for having a better experience with a movie check out my blog posts. I have been a film reviewer for over 15 years now and I always try to make sure that I include my favorite film every month.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ __________________________________________________ This is the latest episode in our "Hip Hop & Rap Review Series".  Here we have two songs that are just about everything: They are "Shook Ones (Part 2)" by D'Angelo and Nas, and the track "Love Game" by P.E.A.C.H. The album they have been making together (which I heard the first time in a concert with the P.C.'s, by the way) is called "Shattered" and it comes out on the 3rd of October.  Here are my thoughts about the songs so far: 1)  D'Angleo "Shaken Ones (part 2)"  A very special song from "Shakers".  A bit slower than the previous song but that's all right because it has just about the same energy level as the previous songs.  We start off with D'Antoni talking about his "shaking" hand (which reminds me of the song "Bounce").  We then see him doing the "Shake That Ass" to another guy, who is a member of the P,E.I.C, (which we'll get to in a second) and who is the real reason the song was recorded.  They all get a bit freaky, but D'Anoni is the one who takes the lead.  He starts by shaking up the man, who then starts to shake him back.  After he gets the first one, he goes to the next guy and starts to do the "Tickler" and a few more.  Then he heads back to the first guy and does a "Duck."  That is, he "ducked" a bit.  This was a lot of fun to hear.  There were a couple of other songs with the same structure but this one was one of the coolest because of the freaky stuff that goes on, not to mention the beat D'Angel was using.  D's beat is very different from most of the other artists, I think it's mostly in the bass and drums which really adds to the weirdness.  It is a lot more hip-hop than other artists using the beat (I am talking about you, T.I.).  At one point, he is doing some funky stuff like doing the backflip.  One thing that is interesting is the way they were doing the lines

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. A movie with a good or great rating is more likely to get a positive response from a reviewer who liked the film. Positive reviews will help an audience find the film and make them aware of it. A bad movie with bad or low ratings will not be so welcome.  Reviews are written based on the original rating system that was used by the movie theaters before DVD was introduced. In order to be a DVD rating, a movie needs to have a rating of 5.1 or above. Movies with a 3 or below rating have to be rated by the DVD rating service of the individual country. As of 2007, in the US, the Movie Ratings Board of the MPAA has the power to determine which movies to include in the rating. Each movie should have its own rating with a letter rating. 'A' is the lowest rating and 'F' is highest. A rating of 'R' (Restricted) may only be used for R-rated films and the 'PG' (Parental Guidance) rating may be used only for PG-13 movies. 'G' (General Audience) can be used to denote any rating above PG-12. The 'X' rating can only be found on DVDs and cannot be used on online streaming services. A DVD rating indicates whether the movie has been rated by a specific movie theater in the country. Each theater can assign a DVD Movie Rating and can use the ratings they assign to DVDs to determine if a DVD will be sold or rented. 2.5. The RATINGS CART The DVD Ratings Cart (RATINGS CARD) is printed inside the DVD case and is made up of a number of columns, each of which has the title of the movie printed in big letters on the left side and the year of release on the right side. The cart is laid out as follows:  Column One: DVD Year Column Two: Director Column Three: Actor, Character and/or Scene Number Column Four: Genre  Table One: .  a. Title of movie Column One: B- 1.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  I've got to admit it; I like it when a movie gets a positive (or a neutral) review in a movie review site. A film that is bad gets a lot of hate in reviews, and that really sucks.  Why is that?  Because when a film has a bad rating in a review site, it means that people don't think much of it, and most people who have watched a film say, "Eh, I don't remember it."  And that can really kill a film's potential. .  (Here's how we get bad reviews in film reviews.)  . (This site has a huge list of film reviews that a movie needs.)  the rating should not be tied to its quality  It seems like if the review had a 1 star review, then that would really put that film down in people's minds. And then, it doesn't have anything to hang on to.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  In other words, "Don't Be a Pussy, It's My First Rental."  This one was so hard. I can't think of a single good movie I watched recently that had a rating below a 5. It wasn't that I was just watching bad movies – I'm a serious movie fan, but movies don't always get a good rating.  But I'm sure there were a couple.  in fact, I remember one movie that didn't even have an R.  it was called "Zootopia"  and it wasn't good. , not just bad. A flat-out bad movie.  with no redeeming value. :(((  Not even bad. Bad. .    But the only reason it failed was that it was so boring. )  You know what? I'm glad it didn't have an F rating. And I would have been really, really pissed. I'm not a big fan of films that don't make me laugh. I think it's one of the things that separates a good film from a bad film.  a bad movie is just too bad to be good. I'm not sure how to feel about this. I guess I would like to think that there is some type of way to grade movies.

I always want to get back out there on the bar scene. A lot of the time the day off I have done for a movie has been my "busiest" day. If it's a week or longer I don  t do a whole lot. I've decided to do a few extra days off a year as a surprise, so I can just keep going and get it done. ,,,  ,  On the days that I take a full day off, the plan is to go see a couple shows or movies and hang out with my wife and kids (if they're not sick).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie I saw this summer, The Last Days Of New Amsterdam  (1993, The Weinstein Company), has many wonderful things about it, from its acting to the script. But there is one thing that I remember most vividly. At the end of the film, the audience sits in front of a very handsome young man in a nice suit who is staring at them with intense concentration. He is looking right into their eyes. It was the most disturbing thing I've ever seen and it is one of those moments that sticks with you. It's hard to explain but it's as if you are watching your best friend, the one you always thought was perfect and wonderful, looking at you and seeing what you are doing. He's thinking what you're doing and it's not flattering, it's completely and utterly creepy. But you can't look away. The young man knows what you've been doing, and it makes his gaze almost impossible to look away from, despite your best efforts. 4) You can never have too many good movies about women.  If you like to see female actors in movies where they are in control of their own destiny or where they have some kind of autonomy, you can look no further than the movies of Julia Roberts and Sally Field. They are two of the most respected and talented actresses of all time and, as you might guess, they are both very feminine in the ways they portray their characters. They are also both capable of some really spectacularly bad acting and acting that is simply not very good, but when they are doing the real thing, they have a way of pulling it off. I've heard a lot of people say that women can't act. They don't have the same kinds of qualities to bring to the table and that's true, of course, but I'm always impressed by the effort they put in. 5) Sex is always sexy.  It's one of the reasons I'm such a fan of the Fifty Shades trilogy. The women are often very well-endowed and the male characters tend to be quite well-behaved when they go to bed. It can be hard to separate the two but I've always been a huge fan of stories about men who have to do a lot in order to have sex but the women are in charge. When I see a sex scene, I can't help but imagine that my male hero is looking at me, feeling my body against his and trying to figure out how he

I like their idea of an alternative life that people can live. They can be normal people who fight crime, like me, or they can be super-powered, like Batman. And Batman is, well, an incredible hero, but he's just a normal human. I wanted to do a series of comics about a hero called Batman.  Batman is an outsider. He's a hero, and that means that he's always fighting against all the powers that are against him. That's who he is. Batman has a problem:   He can't control his temper. He is a human who happens to be a superhero. But he has to be very careful. He has to learn to control himself, and I thought, okay, well that's really hard. But it's something that a person has to do. And it's not easy. _______________________________________________________________________ I want to see more superhero comics: ____________________________________________________ I want some more books that deal with superheroes: ______________________ I love a good superhero comic: ______________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "We were in a restaurant in the Bronx (I think it was at the Four Seasons) at the time and there was a screening of The Manchurian Candidate being shown. In a fit of hysteria, my friend (a real life Manchus) had me take a bunch of pictures of us in the theater before the screening, because I was scared of something. I think that picture will live on forever, and this is why I have a little secret message for you… The Man with the gun, was not my friend. I know that sounds crazy, but it is true. I don't know if anyone else can agree, but I am sure there are some Manchunites out there and that this little tale will inspire you to do the same." "I do love the old west movies, and I think we are going to be seeing many westerns and adventure films in the future. There are so many great movies that I have been looking forward to doing, and you can't deny that they are a huge part of history." How are you feeling today?  "Happy that we are not going to the dentist, but disappointed that there isn't an Elvis-shaped balloon on the bathroom wall. The tooth is still in there and it doesn't look good." What's the best movie that you have seen today? "You know what? I don I have to get off this computer. I have just made a promise to you all. I promise that I will do my best to remember to ask the same questions every week for the next three months." Can you talk a little bit about your past?  What was your experience like growing up? "Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. I was born in the 80's, and it was a long, long time ago." You said that there are a lot of people out there that still believe that the Nazis were evil. What do you think of that? I love this question! This is a hard one to answer, because of the fact that we've all been raised in such a biased way. Most of us have been taught that everything that happened during the war is something that is really wrong and really bad. The most common theme for children growing up is that the Holocaust is one of the worst things that ever happened in the world and that we should all be grateful for being alive. And that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Carmen" (2006) I like to read about the places where people are trying to grow and develop and how they have to deal with situations. For me, the most fascinating place is the place where I live, which is in the middle of the desert and about two hours from Los Angeles. I grew up in a place like that, a place that was very isolated and very dry and very barren. And yet my life is very interesting, because in a lot of ways I like it because it's my place. And I do see my family and other people from the desert around here, so there are similarities. But at the same time I do have a lot to learn about myself, about the world around me, and what makes me feel good about myself. When I read about other people who live in the desert I feel like I've got a sense of what it must be like to live in a desert. In some ways, it feels like a place where people can do anything they want, where there's no real rules. It's a place you can do things to your body. You can eat and drink whatever you want, wherever you want. And it's a very hard place to live because the conditions are so harsh and you have to find your way in this wild place that seems to be completely outside of our perception. But when you read about people who do that, it's kind of interesting because they're trying to find the way in a totally foreign environment. And what I find fascinating is to read stories about people from other places who are trying their best to adapt to this place. "Carmena" is about a girl, Celia, who is trying to figure out where she wants to live with her family. They've gone through a divorce, and she wants a new life, and so she's moving out of the family's house into an apartment with other people. She's going to school full-time and she's trying to get a job. Her mom has a little place up the street that she wants her to use as a base of operations, where she can send all the money she makes back to her dad. And she's finding that this place is very difficult to deal in because there's not a lot for her to do, and not much time for her. And that's a really great story to me, because it shows a lot about life and what the world is like. "The people I've met

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would love to see this movie made for the big screen, maybe with an Oscar-winning actress playing the lead, but it's really just a nice family film that should never be forgotten. It's got everything: humor, romance, action, suspense, horror, even a little bit of heart. It is a shame that the movie was released so late in the day, but I guess it is just too good to be forgotten after all these years. So get on the internet, make a nice review of this movie, and maybe it will be available on DVD one day!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  Why should I watch this movie?  Well, it is a good old-fashioned, B-movie western. Yes, there is a big cast, a lot of big names (including James Coburn), and a good amount of money and prestige thrown around, but that's okay, because it's all done with the same style and care, so it's not going to be a totally original work of art.  However, you should probably also know that there are several elements to this movie that are just so out there, and make it stand out as truly unique.  to watch a good western you should at least watch a couple of the old movies that inspired this one, and know a little bit of the history of the era. : I watched this on VHS when I was a kid, and it still has that feeling.  the setting: this is a Western that takes place in the 1880's and 1890's. the movie also takes place around the border between the United States and Canada, so the characters and the world are all familiar with each other. .the story: the story is really interesting. the main character is the former sheriff, now sheriff of the Colorado Territory (which is now a big western territory). he has been given the job to help the settlers in the Colorado territory that are in distress. the story involves his friend, a very good old white woman that is helping him with the problem and also the whole idea of a frontier and the role of women in that frontier. This is a great movie if you enjoy old Westerns, or want to see a really good one. I recommend this movie to anyone, but it is worth checking out if you are at all interested in the American west.

Man of Steel  (2012)  There are a lot of movies that are considered to be great but have flaws. I believe Man of steel to be one of those movies. It doesn't do anything right in the first five minutes and never gets better. . ,  The worst movie about the future ever created and one of the worst movies ever to exist. A movie that tries to be epic, but can't even be epic. I mean, Superman was a god so why are you making a movie about him? The story has a lot going wrong but still, it is the best Superman movie. The Superman character has no personality. He doesn't care about the people he saves and he's so robotic that he's an anti-hero. He is very powerful but he doesn't seem like he would be able to defeat the most powerful villain in the history of comics. The best Superman villain is Doomsday (Christopher Reeve). The best way to describe Superman is this: He's like the superhero version of a human, he tries to act like a human but can never be human. To summarize Man of wood as follows: the hero gets super powers, but is unable to use them, because he can't relate to people. This is the worst Superman movie of them all and it's not even close. The Movie:  Man of steel has some good fight scenes but nothing that will make you scream out "Holy Shit!" The first five or six minutes have Superman going crazy and blowing everything up. It's a really stupid movie. Then

So, what's been happening lately? I've just been trying to find something that's not work related to distract me. I found this on Youtube, so I'm just going to post it here, because it's a really good review. The story is a lot like The Matrix, the main character doesn't seem to notice that he is being monitored all the time. The scene where the girl is on her knees is also amazing. Also, the best part is that the director is a lesbian. She's in the trailer for the movie, so she's probably in it right now. I don't even remember why she got in the movie but she's been hanging around since she got the job. I'm not going to link it here because it might get taken down. If you wanna see it, click on the link she posted. Also. I am going to read it. She is a fucking slut. If someone ever does get it, let me know how you get it. The Movie: 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' is a 2000 film that explores the themes of identity and sexuality. It tells the story of a woman named Johanna and her boyfriend Mathieu. The film centers on a couple of young people who are forced to participate in a complex ritual to become one with the dragon-like symbol on the back of their necks. This is actually not very subtle. The reason the film has so many critics raving is the scene where Johanna is tied

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   I love to hate movies... but I love a good one. And when I think of a good film, there are some that I immediately see. One of those is the story of the story on the page. I'm sure many people like this movie. That's why it's been nominated for 5 Oscars. I love it. It's a really good film. But the only good thing about it is that it won't spoil the movie for you. I have to warn you to watch it for yourself before you write the review. This movie is very, very good. There is one scene in the beginning, but there is no plot line or story here. This scene only helps establish the character of the young hero. He's a good boy who is a victim of his own good nature. The story is about an ordinary family. The father (Bruce Willis) is on a hunt for the elusive 'Wagner' diamond which he believes is in the mountains of Africa. This diamond will give him great riches. The family is very rich and well off. They have a house, a big house, all the food is delicious, but it's empty. And the family is afraid to leave their house. They believe the diamond is hidden in the hills by the evil 'Watson'. They have to escape to the city.   This movie is so good that if I had to pick a favorite, it would be the last scene, the one where the hero's dad makes him go to the circus, or in the end when the girl (Helen Mirren) is watching the elephants. You could say this is a movie about circus. But it doesn't have any circus, it's just an ordinary father and son. There are no elephants. But I would have to say, when the circus is over, this movie is much better than the circus.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ I've been wanting to watch this movie since I saw it at the New York Film Festival a few years ago and since then I have been very hesitant to watch it. I think it's because I am not a big fan of war movies or of war stories in general. I don't know why, I just like to watch good movies and watch good actors (like Sean Connery) and not necessarily have them talk about the war or something related to the war (though I guess that is part of it). ________________________________________________ I know what you're thinking, 'Well, you've never seen a war movie that was actually good!'. Well, not until now! And I thought it was a good one! I love all the battles of the movie, but there are three main ones I enjoyed most: the battle in the sea, the battle with the tank, and the battle on the beach. _________________________________________________________ Here's the movie description:  When the U.S. government wants to get rid of the bad guys behind the attacks on New York and Washington, it recruits the help of the military to create a fake enemy. They choose the fictional Red October to act as the enemy, but they don't expect him to be the most lethal foe of them all: an aging, highly intelligent Russian named Colonel Ivan Petrovich. He has been on a mission for over 40 years to find a man called Ivan the Terrible, and he's not going to give up until he finds him. ___________________________________________________________________________________ I haven't seen this movie yet, so I can't comment on its quality. But since I have already seen the movie version of this story, I'm going to list some of the reasons why I liked it, and I am sure you'll think that they are also good reasons.  1) The film starts out with a scene that actually could be a trailer. It shows us a young boy that has a very short haircut and is being carried across the street by his mother. He looks like he is being pushed around. I thought this was a very subtle hint that this boy is going to be a future hero of the film. 2) The scene where we meet the hero, Ivan, and see him on the road after his battle with Colonel Petrov was very well done, and made you believe that he is the hero this film is about. 3) I liked the scenes where we see Ivan's wife

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'The Big Wedding' (1999).  The movie was a huge success at the box office.  Many people gave it a poor rating because they didn't want to make the same mistake of seeing it twice.    For them, the movie was too predictable and predictable endings always lead to the same ending.   But what if a movie could give you a happy ending every time you watch it?  What if that's what they wanted you to do?    That's what we want to do, right? I was so excited to find a movie with an ending that wasn't predictable.  In my last post, I talked about how in the movie The Matrix, Morpheus explains to Neo that if he accepts his fate, he will be happy for all eternity.  He was saying to Neo:  " The only one who can decide if you live or die is you. "   If you have followed my blog for a while now, you will know that I am a big fan of this movie.   My review of The Big Wedding was the first I have ever written, and it became quite a popular post.  So when I discovered the sequel that followed the original, I thought I should give the sequel another chance.  So I picked this movie up and read it, and I was surprised by how much it was worth.  I thought it would be a one-and-done thing, but after I watched the movie again, I found that the movie isn't as predictable as I thought, and there are a lot more twists and turns in the second movie.  The movie isn to me, a modern take on the old 'I think you are a murderer' joke, and the movie is really entertaining.  If you are new to the idea of a movie ending, this movie is perfect for you.  It isn't perfect, but I was really surprised by the ending, and was glad to read another story that ended happily for everyone involved.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I think the movie is well worth watching for a few reasons: 1.) it is a good comedy about a guy who is trying to change his life 2.) it has some humor in it 3.) it was directed by John Singleton 4.) it's a nice story about people who don't fit in 5.) the film has a nice soundtrack. 6.) the movie was shot in San Francisco. 7.) the production values are great 8.) the actors are all fine actors, especially the leads 9.) the story is good (I didn't find it boring) I don't know if I will give this a positive rating though, because it is the first film by Singleton (it was his first feature), and he is clearly not a very good director. The movie is not particularly good, but the actors and the story are pretty good. This is another example where the "feel good" kind of movies make me feel bad. It also isn't a good film for those of you who don of hate black people (but I didn't). This movie has it all: It's a funny film about a man who has a "dis" with the fact that he doesn't like black people. It's the story of two friends who are looking for a place to be able to be themselves. They meet two black people and are forced to try to adjust to their "dis". It's funny because of the two white friends who try to act "black" and are disappointed that black people think they are "the same". I liked the movie, it had good acting, but I'm not sure if it was for me. It was a funny little movie that was very "funny" in it's own way, but it wasn't all that great. I didn the movie to get a chance to meet a couple of the people involved, and it was great meeting them. I also really enjoyed the music by "Rapper" Donny Hathaway (who is probably the best of the white rapper guys in SF). I gave this an 8 out of 10 because it's an excellent, well directed comedy that is very "real". I gave it a rating of 8 for that reason. If you like films that are fun, funny, good acting and are directed by someone who can do good, this movie is for you. If you like it, let me know:  "facebook"
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like it you'll probably love it too.  If you don't like it, don't bother watching it.  The important thing is that it was at least good.  What matters is that you liked it. If you watched it and hated it, you've still got your money for another.  I've watched bad movies, and I've seen good movies that didn't make me want to throw my DVD and cable box out of the window.  I don't want to get rid of any more of my favorite things. And when I say, "I don of" I don't mean that I think this movie is a masterpiece. I don the movie is enjoyable.  But as I said, I didn't love it. I liked it, but I didn  like it a lot less than I liked that one show I liked. So I guess that's why I'm looking for some of the old things that I loved from the 70's that are not on the air.  Some old episodes of the original X-Files that haven't been seen on TV since the show got canceled.  For example,  "I Want To Believe", "Jose Chung's From Outer Space", "Beyond The Sea", "Paper Hearts", "Babylon", and "The Erlenmeyer Flask".  You can never get the original episodes of these shows, but you can get the later ones on DVD.  So I thought maybe you guys might be interested in a little show called  The X-files: A Guide To What You've Always Wanted To Know.  The guide is pretty short, but they had to take it out of a hardcover book because it was too small.  That's an excellent reason to buy the book!  I'll post the whole thing as soon as I have it. That's all for now.  Stay tuned for updates on my new X-File and how the new one plays out.  Thanks for reading.  Make sure to share, like, comment, and  SUBSCRIBE to keep up with the latest posts!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I just finished watching the first 6 episodes of "The X-Files", and I have to say that it is one of the best shows to ever grace the small screen. You get a ton of character development (and the writers know what to do with all of the characters - except for Agent Mulder). The acting is superb, the story is intense, and the ending was so surprising, that I was pretty sure it was going to be a cliffhanger. It is not that a lot of things happened in the series that I didn't like, but a lot more. For example, Mulder and Scully's relationship is still not that good, but I guess that's because the writers are not that invested in it. They give them some time to talk, but they also don't seem to give Scully enough to work with at the beginning. She doesn't really seem to like him. I do like that Mulder still wants to get answers and the FBI doesn't want him to, but when they are given the opportunity to do it, they do it. However, in the beginning, they make it pretty obvious that they are not a good team. I was also surprised that the X-files were on the XM Satellite, instead of on the Lone Gunmen's computer (a.k.a. the black box). I was really surprised when Mulder told Scully "There's something here I don't want you to see". I guess I'll never know what that something was. The show has so many mysteries and plot twists, that it makes it hard to keep track of where the story goes. For me, I found the climax of the series to be really satisfying, and it was even more surprising when I was told about it. The ending of the show has a lot to do the fact that it doesn't start over. There are a few characters left in the world, and they have not really been developed, so you are left wondering how the FBI will get rid of them. The writers have done a good job at finding a way to end the show, and I am glad that the series didn't end in a cliff hanger.The last episode in the first season was a lot better, but it is still worth watching to see the evolution of the XF Files. This episode was very intense, because it focused on a lot things that happened in Mulder's life. He had to go back to school and he felt guilty because

The mushrooms taste terrible, the taste of the mushroom is really bitter. I was lucky that they were in the fridge when I ate them. I also didn't ingest anything from them that would make me ill, my cousin did.  -I've got a friend who works at a grocery store. I asked her to get me some of the best for the trip.

My thoughts on the book: I really enjoyed this book. I like James DeShannay. It made me smile the whole way through. The Last of Mohicans was a very enjoyable read. There were a few things I found to be slightly lacking, and I feel the authors attempt at adding depth and context to the Mohican characters that were present, but not really expanded upon really got in the way of the story. I'll admit I found the ending of the book, which is really kind of weird. The book had its own kind of conclusion, and although I wish we didn't get to hear it, I still enjoyed the experience. It definitely added a bit more depth to the story, though. I thought the characters, even though they had a bit of an unbalanced dynamic between the women and the men, were all pretty well developed and likable. I'm not a huge fan of the romance, but it wasn't bad. There was something sweet about it that kept it from getting annoying. I liked the fact that the men were actually a bit weak, even after they had all gotten their shit together, and it kind of felt like we were watching something that could have been done in a romantic movie, with a bit less violence. If anything, I would like to see a movie with this. It makes me wonder if there are other films like this that aren't so well known, or if they have a harder time getting the rights. The ending was sort of interesting, and,

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________  The following are the top 10 funniest movies of all time. They are either funny in their own right or hilarious because they're funny. They've all been featured on MST3k. Enjoy!  10.) It's A Wonderful Life (1946)  We all know the story: a young boy, a little pig, and a little dog, are walking along in a quiet little town. A beautiful little house catches their eye. They sit down at the table. And there's a man at the head of the table, Mr. Potter.  Suddenly, Mr Potter opens his eyes. "What a delightful surprise," he says. "I wasn't expecting you. But now I can tell you that you're not going to need to stay here any longer. I've decided to buy the whole lot for a dollar. A real dollar! ... A real, live, honest dollar! That's the real thing! One million dollars! And it's yours! I can buy your whole farm, all of it! I'll put a big shiny sign in the yard that reads 'Mister Potter's Place'. It'll be the best advert ever! But first... "  Mr. Potter starts to laugh. "It'll be a great advertisement, I'm sure. But first," he continues, "I need to give you some money. You know, just so you know what you're getting into."  .  "I..." The little boy says, shocked and upset. "But I don't have any money..?"  "Oh, we've got all the money we need in this house," Potter says.  in the distance, he can see people going to work. He turns his head, and sees a woman carrying groceries up the stairs. "So what do you think about that, son?" Potter asks him. "You have to admit it's a lovely little house."  it doesn't quite work like that  11.) Jaws (1975) . But I don`t have a penny, and I`m really hungry, so.. I don,t know how many of these fish I can eat. Jaws is a good shark movie, though.. The shark doesn`t come in a huge attack, but you know, there is a big attack.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________________________ How much has a positive IMDb score mattered for a movie? _________________________________________________ In the IMDB's data set (since 2002), the most successful films (for a given year) in the top 10 (so not just the top 100, which is what's typically considered a success) tend to have a higher IMDB score than the least successful films. The IMDb's data sets don't include "underrated" or "special-issue" releases. I'm not aware of any studies on which year-to-year consistency in a positive score is associated with a higher quality film, but it's possible. What it does indicate is that people often pay more for good movies than mediocre movies, so you can make an argument that a good IMDB rating helps that movie more than the opposite. But I doubt that's a large reason. I suspect the real reason people will want to buy a better movie is the "experience factor" -- whether the movie "knows what it's like" and will "make you feel something." I was going to add a chart of films that have a positive or negative IMDB ranking, but apparently those are only possible to find if the IMDb has been around that long. [Thanks to Jason W]
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   If you have no idea how to find a good film to review, you might want to consult the Wikipedia page for "Review" to see a list of reviews and their scores.   Also note that a film will typically receive a "rotten" review if it is terrible. So don't get mad when someone says that the movie sucked because you liked it. The rating on the review is an average of its audience. If the movie scored a good 90%, the audience would have given it a 90, which is about how bad the movie was in general. You shouldn't give out a bad review based solely on a film's audience, so stick with that average. And remember that a review on IMDB is only one part of the overall film community's opinion of a film. Also, just because a movie scores a perfect 10% on the Metacritic website doesn't necessarily mean that it's a perfect film. There are many different interpretations of a perfect score on a movie review site.   I'd recommend reading about what the Metascores mean in more detail.   of course, you don't really know if a movie is good or bad until you've seen it. But if you want to write a positive and informative review about an awful movie (or about the best movie ever) you should make sure you:   What is a "good review"?  "Good" reviews are generally those in which the critic notes the strengths and weaknesses of the film, and offers the viewer an idea of how to experience the film. This type of review is also referred to as an objective review because it offers the overall view of the entire film, which may be a little more favorable than the audience's opinion.  's review is a good example of the type of movie review that a reader could write. He notes that it is a great film with a great cast, but that it does a disservice to the fans of the franchise. But it's not bad and people will like it anyway.   and  This is an example of a good review, because the reviewer notes that the film features a unique villain and that we get a good look at the character, but also that the villain does a lot of uninspired action and that the plot is kind of predictable.   (These reviews are also considered neutral. The positive ones are considered positive because they're a good representation of the movie and of the critic's own personal opinion.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has the best ending of the year. The film shows how much people care for those they love. It also shows how the most innocent people can become so much more. The best thing about this film is how much effort was put into making it. This was the first time I watched the film and I'm glad I did. The cast and crew put a lot of heart into this film and made it feel like an actual film. The animation is brilliant and was a highlight for me. I'm sure I could find lots of movie comparisons for this film. There's plenty of things I love about this movie. It's a short film but it was a great way to end the summer. It was a good way to wrap up what we were able to watch during the summer months. This movie is perfect for an all ages family movie night.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________   I didn't really want to start the movie. There were a couple of other reviewers that had mentioned the movie to me on their reviews and I had been curious about it, but I had always assumed it would be a kind of straight-up action movie. And that it was going to be a film that was going be a little more violent than I was comfortable with. So when I saw this movie, I was not expecting it to be so different from other action movies. However, I did expect that it would have a little bit more humor and that it had a more interesting story line. I was surprised that this movie surprised me with it's more story line, the more realistic and serious feel to it, and how it was much more emotional. The story really was much better than I expected it to, and I think it's one of the best movie that I've seen in the genre this year. It was actually very emotional, and the fact that the director knew how to convey that emotion to the audience, I think made this movie stand out a lot. The director, James Wan, really had the ability to create a very serious, somber, emotional story. And I think he did an excellent job in this movie.   And for those of you who aren't familiar with the story, it's kind of hard to go into much detail, because it's a very dark and sad story that really has no happy ending. And it's basically about an older man who had a wife, and who decided to move to a new state, and then he decides to get back together with his wife who he left long ago. He finds out that she has cancer and her health starts deteriorating very quickly. It kind of reminded me a bit of the movie "In the Line of Fire" (2005) in which James Cameron and I worked together on. The only difference is that this one takes place in the 90s and takes place mostly in the early 90s. And the director actually chose to use a few different actors to play the older man and his wife. So it kind of gave it a bit more of a realistic feel to the story than the other movie did. And in this case, the younger and younger actor's performance made it very believable to me. He and his younger brother were great and played the role very well. And there were a few other actors who played younger people who played older people and it worked really well.

Also, there's an opportunity for the creators to be paid something for the movie they've made.  And, it's not like the movie had any sort of marketing budget, so the studio gets to cut their own slice.     If you want to learn more about my business approach for movies, please read my book.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ The "I've Never Seen This Before" Moment of Your Life, and Here's Why You'll Never See It Again "I've never seen this before," the viewer says, as he watches this short film which he's watched many times in the past. "I'm not really sure what to do. What should I do?" The viewer is confused. It seems he's just never seen it. He's never heard of it. It's not a well-known movie. What to do? It's easy: don't see the movie. Don't see anything. No matter what it is, no matter how amazing it is. Nothing can get in the way of your life; there's nothing that can distract you from your true purpose and happiness. Just get through your day, and then sit back and watch your life unfold. As you watch it unfold, you'll see that the next thing you do, the next experience that comes your way will be better than the last one. And that's what really matters. You'll see it, so will everyone else. The movie will be the only thing in the entire world that matters. As you watch the movie, take one of the following steps to discover the secret that keeps you from watching this movie again: Get up and move around as much as possible. Look at different things that interest you. Watch people in different places around the room. Listen to what they say. Watch the people around you talking. Pay attention to how they're moving their arms and legs, their hands and faces. Look for small gestures. Look up, down, up and down and everywhere in between. Look to see how things are being put together. Look through different things to find a hidden meaning. Don't make a movie out of it (unless you want to). It's about a man and a woman who are separated by a massive wall. They are in the middle of a desert. The man wants to jump over the wall to get out. He is the one with the powers, the strength, the control. The woman wants to go over the fence, to get him out. She is the kind of woman who will go to the ends of the Earth to get what she wants. The woman thinks she will be able to see the man. She thinks the man will be more beautiful than ever. She believes she can hear the man's voice. The voice sounds like his own voice
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I want to make a lot of movies in the next few years and I really need some of you to tell me if they're good. If you're really good, I'll let you keep your money. If not, I will keep it for myself! Let's hear about it. Send a link to me, I can link to it here, if you like. http://www.latinamericangodb.com/movie-list-the-f-movie-series-all-of-the...  A lot of the f-movies you see these days have a lot in common, but some really do stand out. It's interesting how many similarities there are, since they are made by different people, but share a common source. All of the movies I will be talking about here have a theme that touches on the human condition in a negative way. This is not a positive theme but one that is still a lot more positive than we usually think about. As such, I want this section to have a good mix of good and bad movies, with a little bit of the good to balance things out.  I will be starting off with the first and easiest movie on the list. This one is a no-brainer for any film lover, since it's also the very first film I ever saw! The title is "Faces". It's a movie with a great premise and a great acting. The problem is the ending. I don't know about you, but when you see a bad movie, it's usually a good sign, but it usually doesn't tell me anything. The story starts out with a woman talking to her dead brother, who tells her a story about the death of his son. This, along with the other bits of it, makes me wonder if the movie was written by a child. We are then told that a man has been murdered and that there's no sign of foul play, which doesn't make sense. We soon learn that there is a monster in the woods. Now, the movie begins to make sense to me. It has a beginning, middle, and an ending and is a movie that should make any viewer realize that evil is real. What does the monster look like? Why is it after the woman? What is the purpose of the story? Does the movie end up giving us some answers? Is the movie worth watching?  What really makes this film so great is the
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________  "Good is good and bad is bad." (James Joyce) Good movies are good movies and bad movies are bad movies. But what are the two most important words when you're thinking about the best movies of the year? (They're the words that matter, at least until the year is over.) In the world of movies and movie industry, this is always the same question asked, and always a good source of confusion. Here's a breakdown of the most important movie words in 2016, and how you can know that it's a good one.  1. Good Movies  One word that has been spoken the most about movies in 2016 is "good." Some people believe that it was always this way, that since films are judged in good or bad, the most meaningful part of movies is how good they are. The simple truth is that movies are just different, and a good or a bad film can be made, depending on the directors' skills and their budgets. But a good film is a film that people like, regardless of its quality, the directors, the casting or the story. This means that any good movie is better than some bad movie, because in the end, you don't have the power to make a good/bad movie, you can only make what you want to make. It's not about how good the movie is, but about how well the filmmakers do what they want to do. And if you're making a good "bad" movie, that's good. (Or at least it's good enough to get made). If you're not sure what a good good or "bad bad" movie is (and for many, they don't know), this is why:  A good film can only be made if you have a good idea of what you're doing. A good idea is a good thing in movies. In many of the recent films that have been good, it's mostly been because the filmmakers were inspired by a different source, which often happens to be a good book, a great book or a movie. I've already written about the movie that has influenced me the most this year, but in the last article, I mentioned that this movie was The Martian. In my opinion, I can say that this is not the best movie of the last 15 years, but it's one of the best ideas that filmmakers have ever had, and it has influenced many movies, including my own,
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ If a movie makes you laugh or cry or just plain make you happy, then write a good review about it. If you don't like a movie, you can just skip it. But if you actually enjoyed the movie, that's even better, and you'll get credit for it. Don't just take my word for it: ____________________ The reason most reviews are so useless is that you can't be honest about why you liked the movie. If they ask you why you loved it, tell them the truth. The truth can be anything, like "it's a pretty decent comedy, and it wasn't awful or boring. It was fun, and the cast was all really funny". But if they ask, try to tell them in as few words as possible, like, "I thought the movie was good. It had a lot of laughs, and I thought it was really good. I'm glad I went to see it". ______________________ _________________ _______________________ If the reviewer doesn't respond to your review, don't feel like it's your fault. Many people don't respond because they are intimidated. You need to find the courage to put up a good one for once, and if you can, say something nice to them too. But don't put up an essay about how you had the best time at a festival, or how the movie made you want to eat a hot dog, or "the movie was so funny and so good that it made me love life". People hate that kind of shit. People hate it for the same reason they love "You're Beautiful" or "A Night At The Opera", but people hate that shit because they aren't being honest about their own feelings. I really can't tell you how to feel, but you can try. Don 't try to change other people's feelings, because that's the last thing you should do. Don' t tell people you loved their movie. Do what you need to do, and then just leave. _____________________ I don't have a "reviewer rating" at the moment, and that's why it's so hard to put together the list. But that's exactly what it will be!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________  The film was well made, and I'm sure they were trying their best. However, there are a few scenes that really upset me. They were: 1) the two cops interrogating the guys in a warehouse. This was just unnecessary, and not something the movie needed to be doing. 2) When the woman in the house with the dog is talking to a man who looks a lot like an ex-boyfriend of her son's. 3) When they are looking for the kids, and one of the police detectives comes up behind one of them. I thought this was a bad idea, and the camerawork is a little too slow, but the scenes themselves are well done. But again, the scenes where the cop interrogates the boys were really awful and unnecessary. I think that this is because the movie did not want to focus too much on the boys and their parents, and was trying to focus on the police interrogations and also some of the other stuff that happened in the movie. That's why I felt that it was a poor execution of the movie, but that is not an easy thing to do. I liked the movie and I think it was an okay movie. ____________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ If you like a movie that has the word "bad" in it, then this is not the movie for you. It does not follow the genre expectations of this genre. The movie does not have the "bad girl" story, the story that has some bad guy. It also does not show a lot of characters who are bad. Instead, it shows a bad guy and some of the good character who are trying to help him. This gives you a "bad guys" story and you can see the characters and how they behave. It even goes on to show the bad guy that you are really not that bad. There is nothing to dislike about the movie and it really goes into a great direction of character development, which is a big plus.  Read Less
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "There is just one problem, it's not good" The film has a lot of promise for a big budget movie. I was pretty excited about the trailer for the movie and I saw the movie. The story is well told and the plot was interesting. However, the story is weak and the acting of the lead actor are terrible. Even if the actor have good acting skill, I would not recommend the movie to anyone who wants a good story or is looking for a good acting. "The Wolfpack" is based on a true story. The movie begins with a group of hunters who are not from the area. They are searching for a wolf that has attacked the farmer and is still running. The man who is the leader of the group is hunting and the group members are hunting for themselves. The hunters are very friendly and the only reason why they hunt together is to get the wolf. The wolves are very intelligent and they will not attack them if they are afraid. They will go into the forest and try to find a safe place to stay. The problem is that they don't know what the situation is so they need to do something very fast to protect their friend. The guy will go out and get more water for the group and he will come back with water to drink. This happens a few times. The group will eat and drink and when they go to sleep they will go back to the cave to find their friend in the forest. The wolf will attack them and kill one of the members of the band. The rest of the hunters will stay in the cave because they have to get back for the other hunter to hunt the wolf again. The other hunter will come after them to find the wolf because they were injured and cannot go back and help the man. They would also have to take the wolf to the medical center. They won't be able to kill the wolf and they need help to kill it, so the man decides to bring the wolf into the group to keep them safe. At the beginning of the movie the group has some problems to learn how to hunt. There is a little boy who has not hunted since he was a little kid. He is afraid of the wolf, he won't stay in a safe area and he always goes where he feels comfortable. He always gets caught and the whole group knows this. It is so hard for him to hunt and if they have the wolf they are very afraid. The boy doesn't have the power to keep

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ In the beginning there was darkness, and it was there for ages. It was there when God began and when he ended. It is there today. It came to the earth in the form of water, and darkness did not overcome it. The water is a sign of the beginning of light, of life. It does not mean it will be the same as before, because it has no beginning or end. The dark water in the sky tells us of the times when darkness overcame. It can be a sign that God will send his messengers to deliver the light into the world, or we can say that it is an indication of the last days when the sun was turned into a darkness. The sun is turned into darkness to show the coming of the time of God's wrath. It is the light that is lost on the morning of the great day of the Lord, the coming Armageddon when the people will be judged by fire. But when you see the sunrise, it is not the light of the sun. When the sun first appeared, it was so bright that the birds in the trees could not see it, because they did not have light. When God had the light, he sent the sun, and he saw it shining in the darkness, for the shadow of the moon is dark, but the sun is bright. The light of God shines like a light in the heavens and comes from the clouds. There is no darkness on the surface of the water. So the whole world, and all the plants that grow upon the surface, were not killed by water or by the wind, but by the sun and by the moon. But water was there at the beginning, and the light has not vanished. When a person turns on a light, it shows how the light will eventually change, as God has said. When this happens, you will see the light fade. When water was with God, the light was eternal. Water and the wind have changed the light and destroyed the light. The only light remaining is the moon, and when it goes away, everything is destroyed. All of us are born in water. All of us were born to live. The water is the image of God, and a mirror of the image he gave to mankind. The same is true for the earth. We all came from the water, but we were changed. The earth is the place where God created man, and that which was on the earth is no

I'm sure if I'd seen it more times it would have been great! I've just finished my first novel, The Last Enemy, and I am so happy that I can say I'm still writing and publishing. I have a couple of short stories in the can that I hope to publish soon. Also, I've just been invited to give a couple public presentations about the stories I've written. That's all for now.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  * This movie was the first that I ever saw. I was like 13.  ** It is a short movie but the quality is really good. , "A short movie about a girl who falls in love with a giant alien.".  is a film that is being used as a teaching aid in some schools. "A short film about a boy who goes to a big city and becomes a thief. It was a big hit in Hollywood, but is now quite unpopular."   * I'm afraid the answer to your question is, no, this is not in any way a 'film', nor is it a'short movie', nor do I believe there is any 'teaching aid' at all to be used in schools.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Cameron has a point when she says, 'A shortish film about the dangers of child molestation'.   As a result, a number of people have created web sites, such as, 'What if the kids had been in the audience?' or 'Child molestation in film: Is it better to watch?'   I can agree with Cameron when she tells us that 'children in film are often treated as idiots or as simple creatures'.   This could cause confusion if children are watching movies and adults are giving them advice about how to behave, what not to do and the consequences of their actions.   on the other hand, I can see no problem with films which use child actors to depict adult situations.  , "Cameron is wrong. The only people being treated like idiots are the adult actors"  On page 30 of the book, Cameron states, 'It should be noted that Cameron's version of the movie was a commercial failure'. On page 32 of the booklet, Cameron said that the film would be shown to the press on October 3, 1986 and the results were reported as "unpleasant", (The Telegraph, October 3 1986)  This was despite the fact that it had the highest attendance of the evening - the box office gross being only £2,000  The Times (October 3 1986), reported that, "the audience were mainly aged about nine or ten and were generally of that age group, and not all were under 16". The only mention of the age groups being referred to is, that "the film is not intended for children under 16 years"  bemoaning the fact, that it is a "child mol
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Write a negative review about bad movie: ___.  I think this makes perfect sense. Movies don't usually turn out to be as bad as they seemed at first. But if a movie has a terrible beginning, that is usually the start of a bad movie. Even more so, movies with bad stories can still be fun to watch.  For this reason I thought I would write a review about the original Superman movie, Superman II. And since it is now so rare to see this movie on the silver screen (although I heard that the last time it was ever released, they had to release it two days before the Oscars), I decided I might as well give it a write-up. If you want to watch a Superman movie that is actually pretty good, watch this. I won't spoil anything. 2. The opening credits and the song they chose for it: ______________________  Well, that was the most bizarre part of the movie, I felt. When I think of the Superman movies, I think not so much of the movies as I think the movie. So when they decided to make Superman's name "Clark Kent" and the word "Superman" in every single opening credits sequence, I was confused. But, of course, I had to take it with a grain of salt. After all, if the title of the film was Superman, you'd expect that the opening titles should be as great. But, to be fair, the song chosen for this sequence was "The Man Who Could Be King," which is a song about Superman (as the music credits show). Which also made sense. They wanted to tie Superman's title into that song. A few days after the movie was released, I found out that "The Superman Song" is the theme song from the series "The New Batman Adventures." (I had never even heard of this series, but they are very popular.)  3. Superman's Kryptonian powers: ______________________________  the way they were used:  If I had been a bigger fan of Superman, I would have liked to see Superman use his powers better than they were utilized. For example, the Superman who was created by Jor-El and Lara was a very weak, frail Superman. And I would've loved to see him use his abilities on a real villain. .  in the movie: , in the TV show: __________________________________________________________________________, in the comic

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Hacksaw Ridge" is a great movie and I have to give it a special mention for its wonderful director, Tom Hooper, and the wonderful ensemble cast who play the soldiers. The movie is definitely a very powerful and emotional film. There are several very strong scenes that highlight the sacrifices made by these individuals. There is a scene where a soldier recounts how the women he loves have given up everything and made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. He then breaks down into tears as he tells his story to a small group of people (who are probably not even aware that they are in the same place). This scene just goes to show that no one should ever give up on what they love in order to serve their country and be a part of their country's freedom struggle. The story is also told with many emotions. There's a great scene where the soldier goes to his old friend's house and tries to keep his family together. The two have been very good friends and even though they are not together anymore, they try to be there for each other. They even try to get a kiss in between the lines of their conversation. It's not just about being a soldier. The film shows the sacrifices that these men and women are making and how they sacrifice their entire lives to serve the country that they love. This film has a lot of heart and is definitely something that I wish I would have seen when I was younger. There are several scenes in the movie where one of the characters is having a flashback. Most of them have to do with their own lives but when one of them has to do a flashback to their own life (a soldier who has lost his baby, a soldier who lost his girlfriend, etc.) then it really makes it feel like it's all a part and a part is all the characters. The acting is really good as well. All of the actors portray their characters with so much emotion and the scene just flows so well.  Overall, I really like this movie. There was some strong scenes (one of my favorites is the scene where one soldier recounts what his father has told him about his experiences and how he came to America) but some of the movie just felt slow. However, it was still a really enjoyable movie. It doesn't have the great visual or the powerful performances like other films (it could have used a few more strong performances from the lead characters) but it is still a strong story that has a very strong message to tell.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  -Greetings, fellow travelers! We've recently been doing some research on the state of cinema in America and what makes a good or a bad movie. As we are all on a similar path, we decided to do a list of what we would like to see in our cinema before the end of the year. With the help of some friends, we compiled the list of things we wanted to see as films in America. While we may not see every film on the list, you can be sure that we will be doing our best to see all the films we can. So let's jump right into the list!We would like two movies to be the movies we can bring with us on the journey. The first is a sci-fi movie. While this sounds obvious, we have yet to see one that has really captured the imagination of the American public as this one is. The movie is called "The Man from Earth". The film is based on the Philip K. Dick novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" I think this is one of the best sci-flicks to date. The main character is called John Anderton and he has the ability to morph into an android at will. It will be great to see this film at a small theater near you.The second movie we would love to see is "Jurassic Park". If you've seen this movie and have enjoyed it, you've likely found your new favorite movie. It's such a great idea to see what would happen if dinosaurs survived in the modern world. The film "JURASSIC PARK" is based in the year 2029, and it features dinosaurs in modern day settings. The actors of "Jury" do a great job portraying the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs of " Jurassic Park" are huge and dangerous creatures that you would not want to take a risk in a movie theater. For me, one of my favorite movies from last year is " The Fault in Our Stars ". It is a coming-of-age story set against the backdrop of post-apocalyptic Earth. The story itself is very moving, and as a result, a great movie to watch with friends. I am sure you will find something on this list that will be interesting and worth seeing with you on the road. If you know of any other great movies to add to the list that would be worth seeing on the roads, feel free to share them with us in the comments.

Rowling (Potter) Posted by Rachael at 6:16 PM Good review. I enjoyed it! And I'm glad I watched it before going to bed. I liked the movie. Reply Delete I enjoyed this movie so much I wanted to see all five. I would have preferred them in order instead of the movie having to start from the beginning like so many do. I did feel like they did a good job at giving us clues which is good. But I'm not quite sure how the story will end. The last couple of pages left me a little lost...and I'm the type of person who loves a mystery so I didn't find it so interesting. I do feel like this movie could have been very different. I'm happy the movie is available to watch. I can't wait to see the rest. I might just go back to this movie to find out how it ends. Delete Very nice and interesting review. Glad I could of been more excited and interested in the book. But thanks for your comment - and thank you so much for all the helpful advice. And thank you for your kind comments too :) Reply Delete

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  You'll never see that 'filler' on your first viewing!  - Mark Durning   "The key to a good thriller is not to do what is easy, but what is hard."   - Robert A. Heinlein  In the Beginning   I went to a screening of the old Star Trek (The Motion Picture) and was a bit confused as to what the hell was going on. "Whoa, you've been watching TV," the screenwriter and director J.J. Abrams was saying. "What are we doing here?" "I dunno... I just thought it'd be neat to come back here and do this," he went on.   So there we were in a little theatre in suburban Illinois watching some old TV shows. "Look, a couple of old movies," he said, pointing at some of the props around him. "Here's the guy who walked into that Klingon house on the first episode." "So, we're all old, then?" I said. "Well, this is why we should never go anywhere," he responded. "There will always be something new and exciting."   is a book I'm very fond of, and the book has a great ending, but I had a hard time coming to terms with it at the time. I'd seen many sci-fi movies before this one, and I'd read the first two books in the trilogy,and. And at the end of the first book I knew what the ending was. So, on top of all the good things the book had going for it, it had a rather odd ending.I went down to the local movie theater a couple weeks after reading this book and decided to see it again. At the time I'd watched many sci fi movies (including) but nothing quite this old.I had the book in my hand, with the author's name on the back, but when I picked it up I wasn't sure. I think that's how it ended up with my name on it. I can't remember now exactly why I'd picked it (I think I was just curious about the book), but I put it back down and went to the second film (that had the same name) I'd decided to go to on my own.It was. This was the second time I had seen it and I knew the ending now. I figured I might as well give it a chance. But when I

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ "What if the worst possible thing happened to you?" ____________ This one isn't a direct quote, but it captures the essence of the article well. As we mentioned before, the most important thing is that you're looking for a positive outcome in the end.  If it wasn't a positive event that caused this to happen, then you need to find a way to move on, not in shame, but in anger. ________________ I've never met a child in the movie theater.  It's a terrible idea to meet someone who is in the audience.  This is not to say that it's always wrong, but when you're in a theater, you are not there to be entertained.   And as we saw in the last episode, it's not a good idea to try to have fun with people who don't share that same interest.  But when I say that I've never had a child meet me in a movie theater, I am very specific about the location: I've always been able to avoid a meeting with a child of age when I'm at a movie that is not in a park.  I am always able to find children who seem to enjoy movies at home, because that's what we've learned from our own kids: that it is a great activity to do together, and it's a pleasure for them.  One could argue that this is a sign of how far we've come in terms of keeping our family safe, but the truth is, we're still a long way from being a safe place for kids to be.  And with the movie theaters getting increasingly larger and more crowded, we are in danger of losing one of the only opportunities we have to spend time together.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________   The last two times we were in Austin, we did a lot of shopping. We picked up some books, and also went to some of the local movie theaters, both of which were nice. In fact, one of the movies we saw was about a couple of kids who are trying to stop a robbery at a bank in their town. We all liked it. I haven't seen it in a long time, but it was definitely worth seeing.   I saw a movie called "The Wicker Man" last night, which I've heard is pretty good. It has been on for a long, long time now, and it still holds up quite well. It wasn't very good, but you couldn't tell. It was about some people in Australia who live in the woods who find some bones in a cave. They decide to put a curse on the cave, and when they die, it becomes inhabited by skeletons that keep coming back to life. The skeletons have no idea what to do, so they just keep killing and killing until they've killed the entire town, except for one girl who keeps coming back. I didn't like the movie very much, and I think it's one of those movies that just looks so terrible because you know it's a poorly made movie. In real life, this movie wouldn't be nearly as bad, and you wouldn't even know that it was terrible. But because it looks so bad, it's even worse. It's just like a bad movie made by people who don't understand movie making.   and now I'm watching some old horror movies   It's almost 5, and this is my last night in Austin before I head home to New York.I'm glad I got to see "The Devil Inside" at the AMC. It came out in 1998, and even if it's not the best movie ever made, it definitely stands as one of my favorites. I've also seen it multiple times, so it's pretty old by now.I went to see the movie in the theater with a group of people, so I didn`t see it in IMAX or 3D. So it was a little different. I'm sure the movie was pretty good in the IMAX, but I had the benefit of seeing it in my old theater (the old, old AMC) and I had a hard time figuring out how to tell the difference between the 2-D and 3-D versions. I think

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I was only able to watch this movie on VOD, and I was so bored by it that I just didn't want to go back and watch the original in its entirety. This movie is so bad and is so filled with all this crap that it's like watching a bad cartoon that you can't stop watching. The pacing of this movie is atrocious and the plot holes are ridiculous. If you're going to watch it then you should just save this for a day when you have no free time because it's all just so stupid. I would give it a 2.5 stars, but for those that know the series or have seen it, I just think it is a bad movie. Just watch the first one. If this is any indication of the movie's quality then the sequel is also just going to be another 2.25-3 star flop. This is the worst movie that Star Trek: The Next Generation has made, and it's getting worse all the time.  #11  Pikachu1842 Member Total Posts : 790  Reward points : 0  Joined:  Location: North Dakota  Status: offline  Ribbons : 0 Re: EVGA GeForce GTX 10 Series Cards with iCX Technology! permalink) So I have one of the new cards and noticed it has a "high" setting for my monitor. When I change it to "Low" everything goes back to normal, which I thought was a bad thing until I noticed my FPS on my 4k monitor is back to "Normal". Does anyone else notice this? I've already changed my monitors back to high (that didn't help).  The Tech Support for EVGA has been so rude, I feel I have to make a complaint. It is clear that I am not the first person to have had this issue and the customer service does not appear to be much better. The issue with this card has been identified as the "iCX" feature, something that EVGA's "High End" has to offer. The iCFX feature is very similar to the "Gaming Mode" feature on some AMD and NVIDIA cards.  on the top right side of the card you will see a big "i" as well as a small "x"  If you turn that "x".

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________________________ My wife gave me the opportunity to review this movie. I haven't seen a lot of westerns so I can't really speak from a western perspective. I do know that the movie has a great cast and an interesting plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat. A great movie to start off your summer or Christmas. I had a great time watching this. I have seen some of the films that they have made in the past but this was the first western that I had seen. So I wanted to give this film 5 stars and for that I can only give it a 4 star. The acting was very good especially for Tom Wilkinson who plays Billy. He gave you the feeling that this movie is real. I feel that the acting was really good for the whole cast and it was so much fun to watch. I really enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to anyone that likes a good western. ____________________________________________________________________________________ Review for: ____________________________________________________  -I really enjoyed the movie.-Overall, it's really a fun movie.-It's a good plot.-The actors were all great.-It was a fun western movie.-I found the story to be interesting. ____________________________________________________________ Reviewed by: _________________________  The film was good, and the actors did a great job. ______________________ Reviewed at: _____________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. If the movie you're reviewing was bad, do not write a negative review about it. Don't give it a low rating, but don't write a perfect 5. Don. Not. Let. This. Happen. And then read through the comments, to see if you can figure out the real reason for the poor rating. Sometimes they are good, sometimes they're bad. There is a difference. Remember that no movie is ever perfect. But some are much better than others, and even the worst ones are still pretty good. Some people, by the way, like to make up reasons why a movie is bad. They will say that the acting is bad or the special effects are bad or whatever. This is not true at all. Sometimes there are problems in the script, but if you ignore them you can always tell later if the director has a problem with the script. In some cases they may have, or they may not have. A great director never cares about that. I think the best way to tell if the movie is good is to read the reviews, because there are always people who are so ignorant of the movie industry that they make bad comments. They can't tell a great movie from a good one. But this is a very bad way to judge a movie. Read them all. If you don't know enough about a movie, read all the reviews. If it has gotten really bad reviews, it is probably not going to work. Or if it has a lot of good reviews, you won't get paid. Or maybe you do get paid, but it is bad money. Or you can go out and make a million dollars. Or be a really good actor. The more reviews you read, the better you will know what to do. If there is one thing you should do to get started, it's to watch the trailers of every movie. You will see a lot about it, and then you will be able to judge. This way you will have a better idea what the movie will be about. I do not have time to watch all the trailers for every movie I think is worth watching. I'm busy. I get very tired from all that reading and all that thinking about movies, and I can't watch everything. I try to go through each trailer. If I don't like something, I skip it. If a director does something I don t like, I don't think about it for a while, and if it

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is a hard one to write. This movie, I thought, was actually a lot of fun to watch. The story is extremely well made and has a great cast. The acting, with such a small cast of characters, is superb. There were a lot more jokes and fun to be had. The only problem is the ending. There is no real message here and you can't help but feel this was the studio's way of just doing what they wanted to do. They just got bored of the series and threw a quick ending in the back of the schedule. I'm sure this will be an instant classic in the world of horror and I can't wait to watch it again! I've watched many movies in the past few years that I thought were great but I couldn't find any good words to describe them. I had to make up a sentence to describe this movie. I don't know how to say it. I was really surprised by how good the film was. I thought it was going to be just another film, just another horror film. I expected it to have the same tone and style as the others and the same kind of gore. This wasn't the case at all. This film has a very unique atmosphere and it is very original. When you go into the movie you are expecting the same thing you've seen in the other horror films. You get that exact same vibe and you are prepared for it. The opening scene was extremely tense and you know the film is going to make you jump. The beginning is just the right amount of tension and you were ready for it to begin. The way they use the sound design in the film really makes the atmosphere seem like a real horror film so you can feel the suspense and feel like you're right in the middle of the action. As you continue to watch you realize there is something really great going on in this movie and you really feel like the characters are being forced into a situation that they just can't handle. The film goes in many different directions with a very well-executed horror story that gives you a lot to think about and feel sorry for. If you don't have a strong stomach, it may not be for you. The characters are quite realistic and you get the feeling of what it's like to be in their situation. I think the story, the way they made the characters come to life, the music and the direction are a really great combination that makes this movie such a

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ How to write a bad review: ___________________________ Why a movie sucks: ______________________ How to avoid movie spoilers: ____________________________________________  Cancel the box office, and the rest of the world is in your control. I've seen better movies in a better time and with better acting, but that's not what I wanted to write today. I want to write about something more important: why it is so damn hard to watch movies in 2013. Let's start by re-introducing a term: cinema. This is the word I keep coming back to in this piece, and I'm willing to bet that this is the only word you will ever use for it. Cinema is defined as "a series of animated pictures, especially of a foreign nature or of no special interest to the mass of the people, usually with actors speaking or moving in the picture."  That description perfectly captures the essence of a cinema: it is art, not entertainment. If you've never seen a movie, you don't know what it is, so you will have no idea what I'm talking about. If there's no way to know what a movie is before it's seen, it's not a movie. It's a television show, or a YouTube clip. There are no rules to make movies, but there are certain things you have to do to make a good one.  As with anything, it starts with story. How does the story get told? Well, the obvious way is the story is told, but then you have another problem: the story needs to be told for a reason, because it can't exist without the characters. So let's do the math. If your movie is going to last a week, you have a minimum of ten scenes (or twenty minutes if you're shooting in 4K). If you are shooting on anamorphic 70mm film, that means a movie has to have at least twelve different shots or you'll have to shoot the movie twice. That means you have two hours to tell your story, and that's if you can find actors who are willing to play the part. A story is nothing without the actors, and it's always better to hire someone else.  of the scene: I believe it's only possible to make two films in a week: one that's shot and edited, and one that doesn't have a director or an editor. For every second that passes, the film becomes more and more un
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________  Write a negative review about bad movie:  ________________________________________________  I used to think I could write a good review because I could "see the movie from the writer's point of view." But I'm so tired of it! I used to feel a sense of pride and satisfaction when I told people I'd written a good, unbiased review. But now that I realize that you, the reader, are always right, it's no fun.  Do yourself a favor and go to a movie you want to see, get a good ticket, and see it for yourself. Write a good write-up of your experience and then get your friends or family to do the same. We know your opinions are worth more than yours. The only thing to worry about is getting your friends to help you. If your friend thinks it's a good film, you're more likely to be right than if he doesn't think so.  it's better to be in the minority. So don't be a victim when your friend disagrees. It can be an empowering experience, and your friend might even learn something new about his/her life.  to write a negative story about a movie or a person, try this: ________________________________________________________  So this is an email I recently received from my dad. He wrote to me this in response to my review of the film "The Crazies" (2006). In his email, he asked me to respond to his negative review of this film: A good movie with a strong message? Yes. A movie that can open a dialogue about what the true cost is of war? Yes! I found the story and acting of "The Crazy Family" to be well-rounded, with compelling characters, with an impressive storyline that was compelling enough to keep me invested. However, there was a weak point in the story that did not help me get emotionally attached to the characters or the story. The film had some really good fight scenes, and I enjoyed watching them, but they seemed to come very soon after the good stuff had occurred. I would have liked to see more scenes of the characters that were close to the family in distress, which could have given more depth to the film. While the final fight scene was well-done and very well executed, I would like to see a scene where the characters are trying to escape the house before the fire is set, which is what really caused the fire and the deaths of most of

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________ What movies should I watch in 2018? 1. The Fate of the Furious - Fast and Furious movie from Universal Studios, that took over the international box office in a few days and the number of theaters that showed it in over a year and a half. 2. Kong: Skull Island - Kong is an amazing and unique film that is packed with action, science fiction, adventure, and action packed sequences. The film is set in a huge island in the Pacific Ocean that is home to giant dinosaurs and other creatures. The movie is based on a graphic novel that came out in 1973 by Ted Nasmith and is directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts. The director who is not well known in the U.S. but makes up for it with his passion and commitment to the project. I am very much looking forward to seeing it and even more so because of the amazing cast including John Goodman, Andy Serkis, Brie Larson and John C. Reilly. This movie is a must see in theaters. 3. Dunkirk - War movie directed by Christopher Nolan. The second war film in the history of this franchise. We see a real emotional impact from the first film with many scenes showing real suffering and suffering. A lot of people were surprised with the emotional impact of this movie, which has an amazing cast that includes Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden and James D'Arcy. I would recommend this movie to everyone. 4. Arrival - This movie won the Oscars in 2016 and was a surprise hit in many categories like the best director and best screenplay. It tells the story of a physicist named Louise Banks (Amy Adams) who is working on a particle accelerator to test a theory that she and others have. When she receives a message that could save humanity, she goes on the search for an alien artifact and finds a ship with aliens on board. This is a very interesting science fiction movie with a very good cast that makes this a must-see in theaters especially for people who liked Blade Runner 2049. 5. The Disaster Artist - This is the first comedy movie to win the Academy Awards in 36 years and it also happens to be the best comedy movie of the year. It is a movie about an artist who is a professional clown and a writer/director that is trying to make a movie that will impress Hollywood. It seems like a strange idea but it actually works and is very funny, but you never know who to believe. It has a lot

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith   The third instalment in the Star Wars prequels is a perfect entry point for people who are just getting into the Star wars universe. It is very good for kids, since it was made in the 1980s. In terms of the visual effects, it is great. It has the best practical effects of any Star Wars film. The sound is great and is a great addition to the franchise. The writing of Jar Jar is fantastic. I believe it's Jar Jar who is the best character in Star Wars. Jar Jar's relationship with the Force and Luke was very good. I really enjoyed the prequel. It was a great film.  __________________________________________  2. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan   For the first time in the franchise, a Star Trek movie was made. A new generation of actors were brought into the cast in this movie. It does have a slow beginning, but it gets much better as it goes on. One of my favorite characters in Star Trek was Montgomery Scott. I think that his character was more prominent in this film than in the original, but Kirk still had a way with him. The movie had a good story line, and it got better as the movie went on. I loved the ending, and the cast all do their jobs well. They make the character of Scotty very unique and likable. The best part of this film is the soundtrack. It's not perfect, but then again, most movies have no songs at all. I was not a fan of the music, but I guess that it did make the movie sound better. The voice acting is good too, and Spock was a very good actor. I felt that the story arc of this movie was better than in Star trek: The Motion Picture, and I thought the ending was great too. Overall, this is a good Star Trek film, and you should see it. ,  3. Return of the Jedi   Return of the rebel forces to Coruscant has become the norm. The original Star Wars movies were really good, but the new trilogy is pretty close to what we are used to. I liked Return of The Jedi much more than The Phantom Menace. Return was a darker film, which was a lot more action-oriented than in The Phantom menace. The story is pretty great, and The Return of Jedi is an amazing

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  Write a negative review about something terrible: _______  "I'm so sorry you had to watch that." "I'm not surprised, you look like shit."  These are some of the reactions of fellow fans of the movie, and it's clear that the movie did not live up to the high standards set by the trailers, the promos and even the original press release. But the question remains: what did the film get wrong, and is it a flaw in the movie that we should even care about?  Here are a few examples of things that I've seen people take issue with, or questions I've heard from fans:  #1 – Why don't the aliens speak English? . They were introduced in the original trailers and promos as people from a distant planet, so why aren't they talking like a person from Earth?  as people, so Why aren't saying like a someone from Earth?" "They look like they could've been brought over to Earth by aliens." "Why do the aliens have these weird, shiny hands?"  This isn't an answer, it's just something fans have noticed. I'm sure a lot of people have this objection to the alien race, but to me that's a problem of presentation, as it would have been impossible to introduce an alien race without being a little weird. The issue with this objection is that it assumes that the alien races would look different to us, and that wouldn't really be possible.  If the aliens in Alien did look anything like us, they would look exactly like we do, with our blue eyes and light skin. The alien races in Alien were always a bit off-kilter because it was always intended for them to look like humans from the future, but that doesn't mean they're just human. They wouldn't necessarily be the most human-like race out there. This is how the characters in Alien came to look, and if you're unfamiliar with the film, you might not even know that the aliens look a bit like us.  and We would notice, and have an idea of who they were from, but we would be mistaken. It's not like they've been living in space or anything. This also goes against the idea that Alien came out before the internet, so we don't have a huge library of information about the alien species. This doesn't matter in the least if you think aliens don't look like us

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Play Video 0:10 I love my dad. But when I watch his movies, I don't like them. This is my father's review of "Wreck-It Ralph." (Courtesy of Adam Siegel/Courtesy of ABC)  "Wreck It Ralph" is like a kid's version of "Jurassic Park." It has a small cast, but they all have a memorable part. They are the "buddy characters," who are so likeable that you'll have to laugh to keep from bursting into tears.  It's hard to remember the last time a cartoon movie featured such likable, endearing characters. Disney is in the middle of an era of animated classics such as "The Lion King," "Frozen," "Aladdin," and "Winnie the Pooh." But in many respects, "Wally" reminds me of the late 1990s cartoon "The Smurfs," when characters lived in the same world with just a twist: You were a human and a Smurf.  the "Woop" That's what "WooPus" is all about. (Courtesy Adam S. Siegel)  to life and the "gimmies." (This is also a "Woe" picture.) (Courtesy ABC) The "Wahoo's" have a funny way of communicating their feelings. (John Moore/Getty Images) Ralph, the protagonist, is a wise, self-aware and sometimes funny character who has his eye on a future in business. He is an original protagonist, and as a boy, Ralph always wanted to be a professional baseball player. Ralph does have his problems, but he is a likable character who always has a solution. He even has a very cool car. When he goes to his sister, he shows her some of his prized possessions. But you are never sure if he's just being a jerk. When his sister is dying from cancer, she tells Ralph that he should run for city council to fix the sewer system, because he has "some smarts."  But this is Disney, not "Beverly Hills Cop" or "The Adventures of Batman & Robin." Disney is known for more than just kids' movies. I love that the movie is so funny — it's like a kids' version of, well, "Star Wars." The movie is not about any specific hero or villain

This is not only due to its awesome and action packed plot. Also, its one of those films where you can not wait to see the next scene because of how intense and cool it is. The way the movie captures the essence of what a T-800 is. It makes you feel as though it is like it was programmed to be a killing machine, ready to take out any living being in the world. Now this movie isn't about being a T.A. or Terminator. I mean, the T.T. (Terminator 3000) only existed for a matter of two minutes and the Terminator was destroyed. So the movie is more about how a human being can turn into a killing robot with the help of some technology. The main character of the film is a retired security officer and the film depicts his battle with a new android named Arnold. Arnold (John Connor) is a cyborg, he has been genetically engineered to be as much like a Terminator as possible. The movie follows the main character and his struggle with a man named Kyle Reese (Arnold Schwarzenegger). The movie revolves around the fight between two machines with one being more machine than human. And when you think about it, why is the Terminator the Terminator? Well, Terminator movies take place in the future and this movie is no different. The whole movie revolves on how the new machine takes down the Terminator with the aid of the humans. The plot is a simple yet incredibly exciting. Now I will tell you, this movie doesn't feel like a typical sci-fi or action movie. It is an awesome story with a simple plot and an interesting plot twist at the end. "In Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Schwarzenegger reprises his role of Arnold in a very different plot and the action is equally as awesome. It follows the

We never really see who the characters are really are. It feels like we know them, but we're never really sure who they really are until later on in the film." "Your movie was an interesting combination of suspenseful and funny. I was particularly impressed with how well you combined your two characters, the man who could be our hero and the man with the secret identity, who was so charming. I really enjoyed both of them and hope to see them again." "I'm a huge fan of your work, and your films have always been top notch. But your last movie, I don't know if I'm allowed to say too much, but it was a little too slow, a little more than a little, but too little. I thought the ending was a bit weak and, after that, I was left with an uneasy feeling. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase." "You've really out done yourself with this one! The acting was excellent and the characters were very well written. I loved how the whole film felt like it was really about two characters who had nothing to do with each other, which gave the whole picture a very unusual and interesting feel. I had an absolute blast watching this!" "Very well put together, very well acted, very entertaining. Just what a film needs." "This is my favourite film from you. This film will be one of those that I return to time and time again." "...it's really nice to be back with you! The action and atmosphere are amazing, you've really nailed that. It's a shame that the final third felt a bit bland but then again it was just a few more minutes." "Just plain cool. If you like action, mystery, or action/sci-fi, then you should watch this film. I'm glad I did." "Very interesting and entertaining film."  RAW Paste Data  "What a brilliant concept. I would say that it is a very well thought-out film which is something you don't usually see in films of this genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  Why you should take a screenwriting class:  If you've ever watched a good drama and been frustrated by how poorly it was written, this blog is going to convince you of one thing: screenplays are written by people!  This blog is intended to introduce you to screenwriting classes at a local community college. It's not aimed at the most serious students who want to become a screenwriter but still want to learn the fundamentals of screenwriting. The main purpose of this blog will be to help those of you who are interested in writing movies to develop some basic screenwriting skills to get you through college.  What you will get:  and more  Screenwriting Classes at the University of Texas at Austin  After some time, I decided that I wanted to pursue screenwriting as a career. It wasn't something that I just jumped into. I spent about a year and a half researching and studying film and the craft of writing a screenplay. After working at a movie studio as an editor and producer, I had plenty of ideas about how to write a screenplay, but my writing skills were really lacking.  and my screenwriting knowledge had improved, but was still quite lacking. In my research and reading, I was lucky enough to find a film school in Texas that offered classes in screenwriting and filmmaking. So, in order to better prepare myself for my screen writing classes, I went back to school for two years. -screenwriting.com  -www.facebook.com/thescreenwriter  My screenwriting education at UT Austin took place at the university's screenwriting department. My class was a combination of screenplays, and writing in general. During my screenwriter class, I developed a bit of a screen writing blog, writing for people that wanted to learn screenwriting, like myself. . : The screenwriting college:   : A movie school where you'll study screenwriting with a local industry professional :   A screenwriting program that prepares you for a career in the film industry:  I have also found a film program that is geared towards screenwriters, known as UT Austin's film program. While I had to work on my screen-writing skills from the time that I was an undergraduate, the screenwriting courses at UTAustin are not just an education for a degree, they are a career for you to follow as a professional in the field of screen- writing.

Whether they are at the top of the world, facing their destiny or just about to go down, the characters usually know that their circumstances make things more or less impossible. This is a movie about what happens when those people are given the chance to change the world.

I'm not even an enthusiast."  ~Buddhist philosophy  You know how you always hear the same old cliche about the guy who's never seen his dad's movies, or the guy whose favorite bands have never played his hometown? That's basically the whole point of "Moneyball" - to demonstrate the concept that any team that doesn't have enough resources to hire the best people to work on their team, but makes sure to get a bunch smart guys with no ego who think the same way as the owner, can make the playoffs just by using the resources they have. It is basically the movie equivalent of the "greatest hits" CD, except that it makes me want to buy it over and over again, because that's exactly what the movie is trying to say, over and OVER AND OVER AND AGAIN: "The guy who made this movie would totally sell this team to anyone who wanted it, if he could only get them to play like he played."   So is there any way to talk about a movie that makes that exact argument? I mean, yeah, there are a couple of reasons why I love "Money Ball", but the most powerful is actually the least obvious one: because I have watched it so many times, I've

(The film was released in 1997, which is the same year as The Sopranos). How do you know? _______________ Well, this is your second question! And I don't think you're going to be able to answer that one. (Which is why I ask for the second one.) The answer is that I don and I don the movie and it really really does. (Oh, wait, it was released almost a decade ago and that's a different question.) I don of course always have some sort of interest in movies, but it's usually limited to the last 30 seconds before the movie starts or something like that, when you're just kind of hoping the first trailer will come on. So, if you can make me want to go to a movie by giving me some reason to go there, I'll go, but I usually do it because I think I'm going to like it. But I'll never really go because I'm too scared. So that's the problem. I have no idea what to say to people who watch movies who don't like them. And I'm not a fan, and I know that. I know a lot of people say, "You've got to go see that film," but I'm like, "Oh, yeah, that's what I'm gonna do." I'm never gonna go to see The Matrix because I don  want to see Neo do some crazy stuff. I can't stand Neo. And the reason I don.t like Neo is because I have to know, "What does this mean to you? Is this gonna get to you or does it not matter to you?" That's the question. So I don a think that I just have to not make fun. I always try to make fun out of anything that's not a serious subject.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I know a guy in Texas who's very big on the good guy and the bad guy.  He'd go see a movie, and if the good guys won, he'd be a little excited.    If the bad guys won the movie, he's like "Nah" or "I don't care."  I just had to tell you, when the good/bad guy is winning, he gets all jacked up, which makes his performance better.      I think that's what's going on here with this movie, they are both winning so much that the two of them are just getting more and more into each other's hair.  And the best part of the movie is the fact that they're just getting into each others hair.                              So, with all that being said, I think this is an okay movie.        I really hope this movie gets better, but even with all my complaints, this is a good one.    I'd say it's a pretty decent romantic comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ This is the first time in the history of the internet where I can write about a movie that was really, truly terrible and then say it was worth it. The movie is called The Hangover: Part III. I had seen the movie three times before it was released, and then the third time I saw it I was still really sad that I hadn't seen the original. Then I decided I wanted to see The Hangovers but I had to watch it two more times. The third time was really bad too, but I watched it and I thought, yeah, this movie is awful and I was happy I hadn' seen the first two. I didn't have any other expectations of the movie, it was just a shame that I'd missed it the first times. That's when I decided to watch the third movie. It was worse, and it wasn't just that the movie was better. It made me really sad. The bad parts were worse than the good parts, and the worst parts were a lot worse than even the good ones, and that was even before I saw the final 15 minutes. I wanted a third movie because I wanted it to be better, but then it got worse and I just didn't care anymore. Part III, however, is not the worst movie ever made, it is still not terrible, and is still better than most things on Earth. The best movie is The Hang Over Part II: We All Just Get By. And the worst is The Grudge, but it also didn't suck nearly as bad. Part I of the story is probably the worst part of the whole thing, and I'll leave it at that. This movie is a mess, but that doesn't mean the worst one is, so I won't say any more about it. Let's talk about the good bits, then. Part IV is the best. Part II, though, is better than Part II. Part 3 is awesome, but part IV is great. The first three movies had a lot of characters and a lot more backstory and a ton more jokes, and even the second one had the jokes. But, Part III had a bunch of stuff that we only got to see in the final movie. So that's really awesome. There's a lot to talk about, so let's talk. The Good: The original movie is really, really good. It has the jokes, the action, and all the characters, and a little bit of romance. They

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ My rating: 8/10 The plot:  I like this movie a lot, especially the way it's set up. The first half is a fun adventure with a little bit of suspense at the end. A young woman goes on a road trip from New York to LA with her best friend (who has a secret of her own). The road trip is fun. I really enjoyed the character of the heroine. It was clear that she was really enjoying herself. I was actually surprised by the age of the woman. The story is told in first person, but she really did think the road trip was fun. At the end of the trip, she meets up with her friends in Los Angeles. The road trips are fun. The whole road trip really was fun, even though she has been in some bad places with her bad friends. The ending of the road trips is not what I expected. The end does have some good points. It is fun and the ending of a road trips can be a little scary. It ends up being an action thriller. The acting was pretty good, but I felt the scenes were shot a little too fast. Overall, it's not a bad movie, but the characters are not well developed. The plot itself was very good. I do think it would have worked better if it was set a bit earlier in the road ride. Overall I liked the movie. Rating: ___________________________ A Good Movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ Rating(0.00):  A Great Movie: (1.00/5) Rating (0.75): ________________________________________________________________________________ It's a pretty well known fact that in the past, in order to get a good rating, you have to have a decent cast and some sort of plot. So, what is this movie about? A young man named Johnny goes on an unusual road trip with his friends. He is also the last person on earth to see his dead father. The movie has some action and is a pretty good movie. It has a nice ending. This movie does have a little romance at the beginning. I did like that. Also, Johnny's best friend, the beautiful blonde girl (Cindy) is in this movie. They do have a fun time together. The romance is just a little rushed. Also there are some nice, funny scenes between the guys in this film. The only thing that bothered me was the ending. I wanted more. I felt that

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I've seen the movie a couple times but haven't read anything about it. I'm hoping that when I do I'll be able to get some useful info about the film. I can't remember too much about the movie since it was a while ago. I only remember that it was about a boy, a girl, and a robot (with a very large brain). It wasn't very complicated. There was only one thing I thought was a bit strange, the idea of the boy being in his teenage years and the girl being in her 20s. I guess you'd call it an "adult" movie but I'm not sure. I don't think it was too "adult." I was watching the movie with a friend of mine who is about 6 years older than me. The movie was pretty much about all three of us, although the "bad guy" was very powerful. The only thing he had to do was show some "bad" behavior. The robot did the talking for him. He had a very big brain. He also wore a very pretty black dress that went up to his knees. I think that the reason he did all that was because the guy who wrote the script had a lot of money and didn't want to waste it. He was thinking about something else so he didn't write the movie. I was very excited when the movie was finished. The final score was something like an 8 on a scale of 10. The story was about an alien that came to earth to look for human beings. He couldn't understand human speech but could read the signs that people made when they made a wish and had the ability to see into the future. He left the planet. The girl was a scientist, and her job was to do the same kind of research as the alien but for humans. It was very interesting to see these two worlds go against each other. The end of the movie had them finding the real girl. That was a surprise to me. She seemed like a normal person to me, but the movie left the audience wondering what kind of person she really was. The special effects were very good. I thought that the first special effects of the robot's eye were very cool. I like the idea that he was very angry at people who made the wishes that he broke when he found them. The ending was a nice twist. I didn't get all the clues, but I think I'll watch it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Outstanding performances, brilliant plot, and stellar directing make the movie's most important scene a highlight    The plot and screenplay are very good, too, especially the scene where we find out the origin of the Evil Corp. Evil Corp, as the corporation is known, is an umbrella corporation that controls a variety of companies. In fact, it is the most powerful organization in the United States (as well as the world). It is also one of the few large, multi-national corporations that is not connected to a government or religious organization.  After Evil Corp is formed by the merger of the evil corporations that dominated the world before the rise of the Internet and the digital age, it begins to slowly fall apart as it is constantly being forced to adapt to new technologies and meet ever increasing consumer demand. This eventually leads it to the point where they're being threatened by the emergence of the hackers, and it is revealed that they're actually working for the government (and they're really evil).  This isn't a traditional "evil" corporation, but rather one that is simply trying to survive and become better at what it does.  (I'm sure many people have come up with their own ideas of how evil corporations should be and what kinds of evil they should be — I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say that Google is evil, but I've never heard that Google was actually evil.)  We then meet a group of hackers, who infiltrate Evil Corp in order to stop its plan to go evil. As we see in the film, the group of baddies are the most intelligent, capable, and talented hackers that have ever existed.  a high-concept plot that is just plain awesome   You'd expect Evil Corp to be a bunch of nerds who spend their time playing video games and writing code, but the team has a rich and diverse array of skills. They're able to figure out the computer code to Evil Corp's most secret information before the hackers get there, and they also take down the government server that connects all the systems that make up the corporation.  was there.   As the hackers are doing their thing, the movie is showing us a good chunk of the world that we live in.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  Jorge Luis Borges  The best book ever published about movies  What I loved and why I watched them:  1. What the heck are you looking at?  2. How long will this film last?  the whole time I was there, it was the most boring film I've ever seen,  3. This is going to be really hard to do, it's all over the place.  4. A guy is about to kiss another guy. He's not sure which one it is. . This happens.  for the whole film, all the action in the movie happened within minutes of the story starting.  is the second film I saw in theaters. I'm not going to explain the plot of that film, but it's a really good movie and I loved it.is the third film in a series of films in a fantasy/adventure style. This film follows our male lead (the same guy as the first two movies in the series). The series runs about two hours long and is about two brothers with an alien that wants to be the king of the Earth (he wants to rule the whole world) and his brother. The only problem is the aliens are so bad that they want to destroy everything on the Earth. And the whole reason is, they can't stand it when humans take over the world. This leads to the whole plot and main character. The brothers are trying to stop the aliens from destroying the Earth because they don't want it to be ruined. I like the idea of the aliens having to stop humans destroying the planet and destroying themselves (I'm serious). The movie is a bit of a mess, especially in the third act, but I think it's worth a watch. The best part is when they capture the Alien and the guy who's supposed to kiss him in the beginning. The rest of the movie is very short and is mostly about our heroes getting in a car and going to the next town. The last few minutes are a little odd and a little confusing, but that's because they cut the movie to three different endings. One of which I'm pretty sure wasn't in the story they wanted to tell. I think the rest of it makes more sense now that I think about it. I don't think I'll be making the film series a priority again, but when I do see the next film, I might watch the first to check out the first film

You will not see it as such. As I have said above, the letter is meant as a statement of opinion and as a response to a post on a popular website. That doesn't mean the post was written or endorsed by me or anyone I know.    What did I say?  I was referring to the following:   "I'm not trying to hurt anyone's feelings here but I think it is a travesty that so many people are trying to push this film into the 'cult' category."   My main objection to this is that people will not know what the hell a cult is, much less be able to accurately judge a film's merit or not. As to whether it is in the "cult" category, I cannot speak for any other people.   A "cult", to me, is any group of people who behave in such a way that they cause harm to others or themselves. There are some people who believe that the "prophet of Islam" had his last word on earth and that we are all just living in the last days. There is no more religion than the man who has had his final word, and some people are not happy that their prophet is dead and that they will be the next to take his place. That does not make this a "cult". Some people go so far as to believe that everyone must follow the orders of someone who claims to speak for god. Again, that does not mean that this is a "cult", much less that it should be a "hit".   I do not consider myself an "avid fan" of a film. I will admit that I like some of the films of my childhood better than others, and that

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ Posted by James H. Houser at 10:06 AM No comments: As some of you might remember, I was one of the first to get in on the excitement and begin posting about The Walking Dead.  I was very enthusiastic about the movie because it was a movie that I could get behind, that was going to be fun, that looked good and that was being made in the U.S. _________________________________________________________________ I think that I have been watching The Walking dead on the AMC channel all season and I really enjoy it.  I also liked the first episode, I believe it is called "Them", it was pretty good.   The Walking Dead is one of my favorite series and I have already started to be worried that this season might be my last season of The Walking, but I think I still have a few more episodes to go.  And with my final episode just the other day (Sunday, March 31), I think now is as good a time as any to start a new post. ____________________________________________________ I am still waiting to see a trailer for the season 3 of The Living Dead, but from what I have heard about it, it has been on my list of things to watch.  The Living dead  is a very different show from the first season of this show, the first two seasons were very dark and depressing, this season will be very different.  There are some things in the trailer that are interesting, like a zombie apocalypse, that will definitely not happen.  When it comes to TV shows, there are a lot of people that think they are the best, but what really makes a show really great is how the show is written.  I think The Walkingdead has a really interesting script and when the show gets on to air, I really hope that the show will follow through on it's promise and do what it is supposed to do.  It would be a shame to go through a whole season of the show, that is filled with such great scenes, and have it all spoiled by the trailer.  Another thing that I will be really excited about is the zombies, the zombies are more like people then people are like zombies.  They are still very different from the zombies of the movie, but it looks like there are some zombie-like creatures that could be seen in the show.  A new trailer for season 3 has also just come out, and I hope that it will

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Perfect film! I would absolutely recommend this film to anybody who has a love of music and film. You will see everything in the film and the sound is phenomenal. It has some of the best jazz playing in this film I have ever seen. I love jazz and I can't wait to see more film of this wonderful jazz scene.  Overall I highly recommend this movie for any and all jazz lovers. It is a film to watch if you like jazz music and you don't think you have the patience to sit through a few hours of film. It was made by a small team of people who love jazz music very much.  the film is absolutely fantastic, I highly recomend it and hope that they will make a sequel! .  I would really like to know why there was not a jazz soundtrack in the movie.  (The only music heard in the credits was the soundtrack from the movie)

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  The first thing that you should remember about the "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" is that there are no humans, and the last thing you should know is that they all live in big cities, like New York, London, etc. This movie is about humans, or at least intelligent apes living in a city, and that's it. It doesn't try to hide that it's a movie about humans. It tries to make that plain as possible, but I'll just say that it makes a great movie and that I enjoyed it.   I don't normally get overly technical about this, but "Dusk of the Planets" does have a couple of cool special effects, and it has a number of action sequences and some very well-directed, well-acted scenes, most of which are the result of the fact that most of the people involved were already known for their acting and directing ability, so they just didn't have to think very hard to get their jobs done.   I did have a minor gripe with "Dusks" in that it didn't do very much in the way of "intellectual" entertainment (in the sense of not being a "movie about a stupid story"), but it was more a problem of execution than a matter of lack of ideas. It's a very serious movie, about people in a big city, about apes trying to cope with the existence of humans and with the problems that humans are inevitably going to cause. "Doom" could make a movie like this one, if only it were willing to.  , I liked this movie, but the real reason I went into it in the first place was to see what director Rupert Wyatt was capable of when he took a really low budget movie and turned it into an entertaining action movie. The film is fun, it's funny, it has some fun effects, it is well directed, and most of all, it works well because it takes itself seriously. You can see how serious it is in the early scenes (and the film is quite fast paced at times), but by the middle or end of the film it's so ridiculous that you can't help but laugh along with all the silly stunts. I think "Dumples" has the advantage in that regard, but it's still pretty goofy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie really made me laugh.  I felt it was funny all the time, and had some nice lines.  The whole movie was just enjoyable to watch, and gave us a nice change from the usual action films we see in theaters.  This movie is definitely worth a watch and I highly recommend it.  Rating:  *I have a friend who's a huge Star Wars fan and has seen every film up until The Force Awakens.  And I know that there are some people who've seen this movie, but I don't know how many people actually saw this movie.  So just for the record, this is an awesome movie and worth checking out. I really enjoyed this movie... It was great.

Also, that is one of my favorite scenes. I love how well this plays into the relationship between Paul and Nancy, especially the scene of Nancy just standing there and not getting up. That was so touching and such a nice moment.   I really hope that this movie gets some big release and gets picked up for a sequel. This is the most underrated film on the list. Paul and I have known each other for almost 35 years now, and he is the only guy on the planet I have always considered a friend. This movie has to be seen! And I have been waiting for this movie for as long as I can remember, ever since I saw the movie version of the movie.(It'm kind of weird that "David" was the nickname for the guy who played Paul's brother, but in the movie "Fargo," the name of the older guy is "David." I think they had to change that part.) Also, that's a beautiful shot of the mountains that's in the background of the beginning. It was shot so beautifully, and it captures the beauty of this country.Also, I love when they show a couple driving on a mountain road with their baby in the back seat. Just beautiful.  R.K.  . I just started watching this movie. I had no idea it was a good film until I watched it. But I think it's a very good film and I hope Paul gets a sequel to this movie ASAP.   the whole time I'm watching this I think to myself how could I make a better film, it's not good enough to be a film, but it's good enough for a documentary. The cinematography is really great and I loved the whole scene where Paul walks on the road.  the actors are great, and the director makes me feel as though I'm right there with them. .

There's nothing wrong with being a movie buff and the like. But don't go to the movies just for the enjoyment of watching the story.

Then the two women get married, and at the end the girl walks in on the man and the woman. The man says, What? I'm sorry, I just thought I had a beautiful woman in the house, and you're a complete and utter loser and loser.  a  5. DO NOT POST IN REDDIT  This will lead to a ban.  in the end, a redpill movie is a movie that's about something you can see, that isn't the plot of a porno or a drama, so if you post that shit, you will not be able to see it.  that being said, it's good to post good reviews here, like this one (the one I made) or this one, because those two have a lot of good content, so go check them out!  The purpose of this article is to help you make a decision. In this world you must know when to take action and when to do nothing. The internet is like a computer. If you use it poorly, it can take you down. This is why you should be careful with your online life.  for starters, when you start watching movies online, watch at least 3 or 4 that have a good quality. You can't watch crappy movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Don't talk about the negative.  They have no power over you if you don't talk trash.  This is not a debate about whether we should watch Star Trek, The Matrix or even Transformers in our lives.  It is simply a question about how far should we go to avoid those movies? In the movies, it is the characters that make you watch them.  When I was young, I saw The Terminator.  If I had not seen it in the theater, I would have never watched Star Trek.   This is not to say that those movies are not good.  These movies are brilliant, but they are also flawed.  In the case of the Transformers films, they have problems that affect all the others.  What bothers me most about Transformers is that the film fails to address the problem of a world populated by Transformers, which are designed to fight and kill one another, with little concern for the lives of non-Transformer citizens of the earth.  To have a Transformers movie where the world isn't destroyed by robots is an incredibly stupid idea, to say the least.  At one point in the movie, it even seems like the Transformers are a society built solely on a love of violence and warfare.  This is a film made by an American writer, but it seems like it was written by the writers of the first two Terminator movies. The robots themselves are based on the robots that were in the first Terminator film, but you can tell they are trying to create an artificial culture. The movie tries to be about humanity, but then ends up being about the robots, as a sort of metaphor for humanity.  One of the worst things about the movie is that they use a scene in the film with the film's hero, Jack, to give the audience an idea of what it's like being a soldier and fighting robots.  Jack, who is essentially an alien, is captured and then put into the robot society.  He has to kill a robot because it's a mistake.  We as humans are not stupid, nor do we ever need to kill robots, but this scene was a perfect example of where the movie went wrong.  The idea of a human being fighting robots is a terrible thing to say, and yet that is exactly what they did. They chose to use the worst movie moment of the previous two Terminator films.   If the movie was written correctly, we could understand the motivations of the robots in a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Share it  Feb 23, 2017 By Tim Sutter  Feb 23/2017 Tim S.utter and his brother, Mike Sutter, look at movies and talk about films and television.  It's clear that this isn't the only time they've taken on political causes. The brothers have made headlines in the past, including this past summer for hosting the "Great American Political Debate" at the Tribeca Film Festival, a live event in which all three of them debated candidates for president. It was the first time the brothers' political opinions had been discussed in public. They also recently took part in the pro-Kaepernick protests by kneeling during the national anthem.  the brothers, their friends, and fans, including Michael and John McCain, left their Tribeca home in New York City and flew to protest Trump's executive order halting travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. I asked him about the protests that have sprung up around the country as people have protested Trump's immigration order. How has it affected him?  TIM SUTTER: Well, you know, I have this thing where I feel very fortunate to be alive to be here. I've been fortunate to live my whole life in America. I had no idea where it was going to lead us. I feel bad for my fellow countrymen who are being detained or are in some cases being killed. That's very upsetting. I can't even begin to fathom the level of pain it's causing them. You know, to be in this country and to be proud of your heritage and to have this country in your veins, and it's being so twisted and turned on its head. And I feel like I have a personal stake in it. And that's why I've said the things that I have.  The reason I feel I have the ability to, you can't have a conversation about this, because this is too personal. And so we're talking about this in the context of politics is in order to understand it. So I'll leave it at that. , Michael Sutter.  I'm not sure that I'm even going to get the chance to talk to them again. I'm just going to leave it in their hands. It's in their power to tell us about this and to not have a public face to that story. The "Great Debate" was a big event at Tribeca, and a lot
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I want to watch a movie about an ordinary guy who suddenly finds a mystical force calling to him. I want to read a book by an author who was obsessed with the same topic and wrote his masterpiece on the subject. If I have not heard of the movie before, then I might be interested, but only if I know about the movie beforehand. This is a bad film. It's about a man who has his life suddenly changed by the forces in his life and then finds out that his life will never be the same again. It has many elements that make it so special, but none of them are great. I love the characters, but that is the only thing I really like about it. The setting is very interesting and it's amazing to think that so much thought went into this. The plot is good, but it's not enough to make this film great. However, the acting, directing, cinematography and music are all fantastic. This movie will give you many emotions and you'll want to remember it forever.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ I watched it recently and the best thing is that its not terrible, but if you were to just watch it for the story, then you are not going to enjoy it. For one, this is not a great story, but that's what i have to expect. For me, it's very frustrating because the character development isn't well done. The story is pretty good, but the plot is just too convoluted. For instance, if you're trying to figure out what's going on at the beginning of the movie, you don't know what to expect, and that's why i gave it 3 stars. If it was an anime, i would give it 10 stars, but i think that it's good enough to enjoy even if you don`t understand what's happening. Also, i really enjoyed how the character dynamics developed. As the movie continues, you can see that all the characters have changed over time. This is one of the most interesting things about the story because you can tell that the characters are evolving into different characters as they do with real life. The best part of the story is the character interactions, and the characters actually get along with each other. That's the best way to enjoy a movie, to see how real life is like. For example, you would never see someone talking in a room and just being nice, even if they are mean to each other in the real world. This movie is filled with character interaction, and in order to see that, you need to watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  It's a beautiful world that can inspire us. It is beautiful that we are able to feel joy when we look at beautiful things, and to experience fear when we see them in a bad light. But that is not all that can give us joy. We also need hope, and when we are filled with hope, we become able to love the world more. When we are not afraid of what we see, or when we can see it in a better light, we have found a place in which we can be happy and fulfilled. This article shows you how to be happy even when your world can be a bit depressing.  Here are some of the things that will make you happy and fill your life with hope:  1. You can be more loving.  this idea is something I am not very good at, but it works. I have a tendency to be angry at things. I tend to blame and criticize people, things, even myself. As a result, I tend not to make a lot of progress in my life, because I tend for it to become a fight. As soon as I start getting mad, it becomes easy to lose my temper and become defensive, because in order to gain back my happiness, I must first make sure to lose it, if I lose it. This idea, if you want to put it that way, is to take a step back and start loving your world more, as long as you are not attacking it. You may be tempted to just ignore things that make you unhappy and just "shut up and take it," but the truth is, we can't control how we feel, and what we do, so if we are going to be in a fight, it's best to do it with love, and not to just lose control. . Love the world in which you live, even if it can be somewhat depressing, if it is a place of growth.  and you won't have to fight to lose the feelings of your pain and anger. 2. You will always have an opportunity to make the world a better place. This idea, is really simple. And it makes it really powerful. When you see things in a different way, it can motivate you to get out there and work to make things better. I am reminded of this when I watch the news about something bad happening to another family. If I hear something bad about the people I care about, I just have

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I saw a good film/TV show/musical and it's good, not spectacular or anything, but you might not be totally off base if you see it once or twice.  I see movies at movie theaters, which usually aren't that great. They don't usually give good sound (I'll admit that's not true of the best ones). Movies are usually poorly produced. There's no fun in them. They're often not very funny or moving and have a lot of corny one-liners.  "You're so old." "That's a good point." "I'm trying to think of something funny." "Aww, you're so sweet." This, to me, is a pretty good way to get an erection. "You've got that old school attitude." "Oh really? Why is that so funny?" If I had a good experience, I'd say something like "That movie was funny, but the movie is dated. The plot is kind of boring."  The worst I can say about movies is that they're bad. "Oh, so you see this movie? That's actually really bad." "No, it's not actually bad, but there are better movies out there." "Yeah, it looks bad. It looks really bad. That movie looks really stupid." There are many reasons that a movie sucks. I think it's probably the worst reason.  the worst thing is to watch a movie and have the exact same thing happen. Like, "Oh! A guy gets the girl! And then his best friend shows up and he says the same exact thing to him! It's so predictable!" It's frustrating. You could spend an entire evening on a movie that is so bad you can't watch it with a straight face. But that's OK, it might be a worthwhile thing to watch. - The worst part about this whole movie is that it's really slow. It's just really boring and you get no real story or suspense. In the best movies, there's an intense conflict that leads to the best and worst moments in the movie. I like to think that's what we got here. And, it feels like it's supposed to be a romcom in some ways, with these three people. And they're so awkward together. If you were to make a rom-com of this, it'd be pretty bad, probably. The writing is bad. In fact, it was

I was so impressed and inspired by it that I was going to watch the entire movie as soon as it became available. I think the main story of the movie is actually pretty interesting. I found myself rooting for the bad guy a bit more than I normally would have, as I felt I wanted to see him become his old self and try and redeem himself. In the end, I feel this movie was worth the time. It was a really well made movie that showed how hard it is to be an adult.

It's a holiday thriller that stars Christopher Lambert as the father of a young boy. Ethan (John Cusack), who's always felt he didn't quite belong at home, is sent to live with his divorced father, who has moved in with a new woman (Kate Hudson). The Schmeers are a wealthy New England family who have been in the film business for decades, and they've seen the highs and lows of film making. But their lives are about to change dramatically when a teenage girl with a strange gift suddenly disappears. When Ethan's father, a former film producer, receives a disturbing call from the girl's grandmother, he realizes something has happened to his son that he doesn't recognize.   The Schmoe's journey to uncover the truth and find the child will take them into a world where nothing is what it seems, where dreams are real, and where all the pieces of the puzzle fit together in one incredibly compelling and unusual movie.   for more info, go to www.facebook.com/moviemoviefan.   of the movie will be released in the theaters on December 10th, 2012.   a film with an unbelievable amount of talent and a story that's hard to explain in words. it's a must see for horror fans and a good time for everyone else.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ ___________. Your review is a great contribution to the world! You have nothing to be ashamed of and you have just started writing a review of a movie. If you write it well it is very helpful for others to read. If it is a bad review then it is almost impossible to learn from it. You may have to start again with a more positive review. In that case try to add some useful comment to it. Your comment could help another person to learn a thing or two. ____________  If you are a fan of a particular movie, it might be a good idea to write an essay about why you love a particular film. It may help you to be more aware of the good and the bad in your favorite movie. In the same way you will get better as a writer and better as an actor when you write about why your favorite movies are so special to you. It is an interesting hobby. If writing about why the movie you love is so special is a new thing to you then try this article.  Do you want to know more about writing articles? Then check out this article: How to write a great article in one minute.  a) Start writing something down: It's simple. The first time you want write a review, write a short review in a short paragraph. If your article is good, people will notice you and you will have more readers to share your article with. You can use the search field to find articles about the movies you like. This is also a good way to find interesting articles on movies you don't like. b) Check out the most popular movies of all time: If you want a good article to read on a movie you do not like, look at the top five most popular films of all-time. Look at the films of the era you want your article to represent. The most popular film in the 1980s is obviously not going to be a great choice because it is so old. Look for something like "The Terminator", "Titanic", "Alien" or "Avatar". c) Look for the key points of a good review: For an interesting article look for key points that you find in good reviews. In my opinion the key point is when an author uses their favorite movie as a frame of reference for writing the article. For example, the writer points out the similarity of the plot of the first two "Star Wars" movies in one paragraph and concludes with a

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________  -I can't speak for others, but I enjoyed this one. As an action movie I enjoyed it a lot, but it was so much more than that. It was a story that went from the small beginnings of a great idea, to the big big reveal that was more than a simple tale.  I think this movie was a real story about a family and how they lived with one another, and what that could mean in the big wide world.  the acting in this movie all did their job and gave it that much needed realism in what the characters could do. ..  One of the best things about this movie is that when you finish watching it you don't even want to think about the movie anymore. It's almost like it's in a movie that can just vanish from your memory and you have to start all over again with the next movie.  for my money, this movie deserves the big bucks. ,  10/10  ___________________________________________________  From my review: "The first thing I want to say is that this is not an "action movie". Not even close. You'd be hard-pressed to say that the film has that word. For all the great action scenes and fast paced fights this movie has no action. It has drama, action and more drama. If you don 't want to read a full review of it, that's fine, but this movie will probably change your view on movies."-I really enjoyed this movie. The story and acting were really good, and the script that was written gave this movie a real feeling of family. The character's development was pretty well done. My only complaint is that the ending was a bit cheesy and forced. I know that people are going to think that I am bashing this movie but I really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is no other way to do this. People who like the movie are more likely to want to see it again, and they are more willing to be polite, and if the review doesn't go well, the movie may suffer as well. And a negative review of a good film would also discourage others from seeing it.  If you have a favorite movie and can't think of one, try doing a YouTube video review:  http://youtu.be/bB_gfVzp6YI It is also a good idea to do a review in the forums of your favorite movie site.  http:www.boxofficemojo.com -  http:/ www.shudder.com/forums/ -  www.facebook.com  -  http:\ www.thefreedictionary.com

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I think the ending was brilliant!" No, the ending isn't brilliant, it is bad and in many ways predictable. And in many other ways, it's actually really good. I didn't need any of the big twists. I already knew the ending. So when the last scene played out, I was like "I know who I think is dead! And this is my movie!"  And the finale was really well done. I thought the characters were really well-developed. The movie was entertaining. And the plot was well-structured and very well thought-out. This movie is not perfect, but it is certainly worth your time and attention. If you haven't watched it yet, it'll be worth your while. If not, then it's not bad. I'll finish this review by saying I hope that one day this is released in the states. It would be really great to see a film that was made in Hollywood and filmed in Mexico! Rating: 5/5.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ This is my third time going to this film festival and, of course, I am still in awe of it. I was so happy to be able to watch it again. I have to say that it is one of the best movies I have seen to date and if you haven't seen this, then I highly recommend checking it out. I can't say enough about this movie. The performances are so outstanding and they are all so believable and you just feel so much sympathy for the main character, Chris Walker. This is an excellent movie and one of my favourite movies to date. I highly reccommend it. The movie has been featured on many top 10 lists and awards lists so I'm sure there will be many people who are looking forward to seeing this one at the festival. The only thing that I think would improve the movie would be if there was more of a score for each scene or if there were more action scenes, but that would still give this movie a lot of credibility and it has plenty to work with.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think there is no better place to begin than with a positive movie review.  A good movie review is about the movie as a whole. It should address what is great about the film and what isn't. I recommend reviewing movies with as many people as possible watching it (e.g. friends, family, co-workers).  Some people like to just sit on a couch with their hands behind their head, staring at their computer screen. There is no need for that.  If you are in that situation, just put it on and get back to watching your movie.  I encourage moviegoers to sit in on the post-production process (though there are plenty of other great things you can do besides) and see all the people who have worked on your favorite movie. These people, like the actors and crew, help give your movie that "finish" that makes it a great film.  You might even be able to see some of them again at a later time (although not everyone who works on your movie will be on set when you watch it).  Be prepared for your film to be criticized and have a little patience.  Don't assume your movie is going to be received well.  Some films don't do well at the box office (think A Night to Remember, Mean Girls, or even some of the Star Wars movies).  They don't make millions, and even when they do, they don't always play very well in the theaters.  It is normal for movies to be called into question in this way.  Sometimes people are disappointed and upset by your movie, but you have a right to be upset with the criticism.  That is part of the artistic process of making a movie. It may not be a good film, but what would you rather be angry about?  That the movie wasn't what it could have been?  Or that the critics were wrong?  I don't think it is ever a good idea to go into a movie expecting everyone to love it. It might happen, but usually the most common response is that someone else's opinions about your film trump your own. Review your movie before you release it.  Most people want to see your movie when it is finished, or at least in a state where the filmmakers can make the best decisions possible.  This is a good time to look at your movie to make sure it is working and to make the necessary changes that might be needed before you
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ What did you like about it: I really liked the storyline of this movie. I thought that it was really interesting and that the director, James Gunn, did an excellent job at developing this movie as a whole. Also, the film is really good. What didn't work for you: I felt like I was watching a movie that was really made for a movie theatre in a theater, because the storyline and the story were so predictable that I had no doubt that it would be over. I'm not sure if it's the movie's fault or if I'm just not used to seeing the story of a superhero story where the guy who's going to save the world is the guy the audience loves to hate. _____________________________________________ What did others think? Click here to write your own review! A summary of the film: The film starts off with a huge explosion in Los Angeles which is followed by the sudden appearance of Spiderman (a high school student). The next day a woman in an ambulance with a baby on her back asks him if he saved a child who was killed in the explosion. The girl was named Heather O'Rourke and she was in a coma for 5 months while Spiderman took care of her and her baby. One of the other superheroes who was involved in the case, the Hulk (I'm really not going to explain this scene because I don't want to ruin it for you). Spiderman tells the Hulk that Heather Orie had died in the blast. The Hulk then leaves, telling Spiderman to go on ahead. Then the scene shows us another accident involving the Hulk where he has a run in with Spiderman. The next scene shows the other heroes getting attacked by the Lizard, which is a giant green monster who looks like a mix between the Lizard from Spiderman and the alien from Alien. The monster attacks them and we see some of the heroes fighting back, but Spiderman manages to defeat him, and then we see him talking with the other hero's about the accident. Spiderman asks about his brother Eddie and Eddie tells him he isn't the only one who has been injured in the accident, and he thinks he knows where Spiderman could be. After this, we see Heather Orenick and her newborn son being wheeled into an ambulance. The scene then shows Spiderman looking at Heather Orellick and the baby who is sleeping peacefully. Spider man and the other injured heroes all talk about how Spiderman must be the one who

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ This is the most wonderful movie I have ever seen in my life. It is a good enough movie to enjoy. The plot is simple enough: We follow a group of soldiers who are on a rescue mission. They are taking a badly-needed supply of food and water to a small town. As they are approaching the town, a small force of enemy troops attack and attack them, killing most of them. A survivor, Lt. Richard Garret, who was a captain, is wounded but manages to get off a couple of grenades. He manages to reach the supply trucks that will bring him the food and supplies. As Lt. Garret approaches the trucks, he runs into an old acquaintance, Major Walter Stilson, who tells him about a place in which he had been wounded in a Viet Cong ambush. At that place, the Viet Cong killed the American lieutenant, and a small village was burned down, killing the villagers. Lt. Stilman says he will go there and help the people there. Lt Garret asks him if he can bring some of the supplies as well. The two men start off in the truck to that place and, of course, the convoy is attacked by enemy soldiers. In a small cave, a woman, Miss T, who has been raised by a tribe of cannibals, tells Lt Garrets of her life and the way of life she has lived for many years, after being rescued from a nearby village. The woman is not in a good state when they first meet and she needs help. Lt Stiller gives her the food that he took to the village. She gives it to Lt.G as well, but Lt Garrets doesn't take it. The following morning, when Lt Garres is about to leave for the next supply drop, he sees Miss T in the distance and realizes the time has come to bring her home. She doesn't want to be left behind. Lt Robert Garret gets a hold of the enemy, but they are very fierce and he gets killed. As he is dying, he asks her to help him with his mission. As she starts to leave, Lt Garrent tells her: "You can either do what I'm about to do and walk away or you can go with me and help me to find my own people and bring them home. And when you leave, I promise you I will take care of you." With this, she takes the food to the people in the

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "I've always liked films about ordinary people, but I was particularly surprised by the way a film can affect a child," said Ms. Johnson, who is also the author of "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: The Complete First Season." "What is funny about these children is they all have flaws; some are mean, some are good-hearted, some can't think of an interesting topic — yet they all seem to find the right person to relate to. I hope the next season of 'It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown' finds these little characters the way I hope it will: smiling."  Ms. Johnson said that the film's story line, about the characters' Christmas Day dinner, was particularly appealing.  She added, "I've been to the movies with my kids, but never one I couldn't get into, and the characters of Charlie Brown and Linus' mother are so endearing. Watching them interact on-screen is like listening to a great story, like watching a good book. It's what I love about films like this. I don't want to stop seeing them."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________.  Tell someone how you are going to get them to like you: ________________.  The second type of statement is to use these statements to "reinforce" the initial statement by indicating a positive action that has already taken place. In the words of Richard Dreyfuss in "Risky Business",  "No, I haven't lost my job, and, no, I'm not going to go out and buy a second one."  To demonstrate how this technique works, think back to an event or situation that caused you to act in a certain way. When you think back, think about the negative consequences of those actions, and then try to describe in simple words what your actions would have been if you were in their situation. In many cases, you will be able to describe actions that you may not have done if you had not had that experience. Try to think of what you would have done in your situation if you weren't in it. For example, if you are a police officer, you would probably want to write your name on the vehicle, write your badge number and gun, make sure that the doors are locked, that there is a good-sized crowd of people in front of the vehicle and that the person driving is wearing a seatbelt. If you had just lost your job and you were out of work and unemployed, you might want to keep a spare set of keys in the vehicle because you don't know when you will get another job. If someone else is driving, and they are drunk and reckless, you should make sure they are paying attention to the road. There are also other consequences you may want to take into account when you are out on the road doing your job. Some of these consequences are common sense, such as driving with a blind spot, driving in an unfamiliar area or driving with your hands on the wheel. Others, such a speeding, are illegal and may cause accidents. However, some of the most dangerous consequences are not so obvious and you may have to take extra precautions to ensure that you are safe on the roads. Some examples of negative consequences are using the wrong seatbelt, smoking in your car, speeding, and driving in the rain. Other negative consequences that you might have to think about when you use these techniques are failing to buckle up, getting into a car accident, or getting involved in a crime. - - - -  The third type of positive statement is the use of the

The way that film editing works in this day and age is brilliant! I have all three Schindler's List films on DVD (and a second Schindlers' film) in case I want to watch them again when I can't attend a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  _________________________________ .  When you write a positive reviews, write in a way that is encouraging and encouraging the viewer to stay in the movie. Try not to make negative comments.   In my opinion, I think that the majority of people who write positive reviews are too much influenced by the negative ones. This way, they get distracted from the movie and don't take a closer look at it. Also, it is a waste of the reviewer's time to review a movie with too many negative reviews.    It is very important to get the review from a professional reviewer as soon as possible.   it would be a waste to waste your time on a movie that is not worth your time or money.  .  "You must be crazy to write negative reviews of movies that are good.".   Yes! It is true, you can write negative and positive reviews of a good, but it is more important that you avoid all kinds of writing "negative" and "positive" comments and only write in the way that you think the movie should be, rather than what you think it is not.   and do not forget that it is always a good idea to get advice from professionals.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ About this Movie ___________ I went to see The Big Lebowski  (1998)  in the theater,  because it was one of those rare movies that is both enjoyable and funny. There was no question that this film was a "classic" as well as a "good time". The humor is well-written, well-acted, well directed and, like the movie, fun.  The "plot" was also extremely well-paced.  What does this movie have to do with the church?   What you are going to learn from the film is that the Church is not "anti-everything".  This movie is about the "spirit" (not just the people in it) and the role it plays in our lives.  What is the spirit?  There is no such thing as a spirit (it's just a myth to the LDS people). This movie shows that a spirit is not a "being", a "ghost", a being from another world, a spirit that is different from us.  The "spirit", (the person that is a manifestation of God in the world), is just as real as us.    The movie shows us how the Spirit affects our lives, how it can "make us into what we are not"  (in other words, it can make us "good" and "bad") and how we must deal with it (not fight it, but learn from it).   We learn to "let it go", that we don't have to fight it.   And we also learn that we are all made in the image of God and that the Spirit will help us know who we really are.   The film shows how we can help each other and that we all have a lot of "spiritual baggage".  What it also shows is that we have much more to offer God and to each other.  And it shows us that it is okay to laugh at ourselves sometimes, to admit we made mistakes and to take responsibility for them.  I found the movie to be so much fun. It was very funny. It had great acting. And it had an interesting plot.  It made me want to see more of these films and see how far they will go. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  "The Man Who Would Be King" by John Carradine  An epic masterpiece about one man's quest to find the elusive King Arthur. With John Carrick we never found out what King Arthur looked like or even how he looked at all. Carrick had a great and mysterious ability to turn a conversation around on the people with whom he conversed. It's a lot like being the talkative person in a room, always there to make it interesting.  __________________________________________  The Man with the Iron Fists  By Lee Hirsch  With Lee Hines as his sidekick and the rest of the cast playing their characters with all their heart and soul. This story follows a young man who was kicked out of his home for being gay and who returns to find out his father is in the military on his way to another war. : )  This movie is about the friendship between a man and a man in the army. It was also directed by Jim Jarmusch and written by Jarmuland, who wrote the original screenplay of the movie, and Steven Soderbergh. A good movie about how two people can live their lives the same as best as they can and how they can even be better than they were before because of it. The movie was written by Robert Evans, who went on to write two movies that made the top ten at the box office, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "The French Connection" in 1973. ,  What other films did you enjoy?

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ The movie The Matrix: Reloaded is in the top 1% for worst movie sequels. If you have seen it, you have a good chance of having seen it in the first place.  The movie was pretty good, but if you are not a big Matrix fan you may hate the ending.   The Matrix:  1) It's a good action movie with well done special effects.  the story is the same as the first movie but now there are 5 different characters (more than the 1 in the original) in one movie.  "The Oracle" plays a role here and she is the reason why all the machines in the world can talk. The new Matrix in the movie is also more advanced, but I would say that the story here is a bit shorter.   was not that bad for a movie. I would recommend this movie to anybody who has never seen the movies before. It was very entertaining. . 1 of 1 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  _________________________________________________________  I have tried all of the ways of finding reviews of my movies here on the Internet. I have had to look around on several websites. I am now on the last website, www.fansplash.net. I just got to the point of being unable to find any review of the movie I want to see, so here it is. I think you will find this review useful and if you do, just let me know, and I will be happy to pass your information on to the author or director.  This is a review of "Battleship" by Steven Spielberg. It stars Tom Hanks as the Captain of a battleship that has been destroyed and then rebuilt. He and a few other survivors are stranded on a deserted island. They are befriended by the natives of the island, who give them shelter until they can figure out a way to get back to civilization.  I think that the book that I read that inspired this movie is "Sinking of the Bounty" by John Steinbeck. In the book, Captain Thaddeus Rackham has just wrecked a large ship in San Francisco Bay and is looking for someone or something to take responsibility for the wreckage. The captain gets a boat and a crew of pirates, and they set out to find the wreckage and take responsibility. The first couple of chapters are narrated by Rackham, who is narrating to a young boy. During the first leg of the journey, the boy is being attacked by the pirates, but then he saves the crew and they all escape, but Rackham is captured.  the kid in the book is a character named Ransom, and he is the son of two slaveholders. The boy has been raised in the slum, and has learned to read and write. The book was written by John Kennedy Toole, who would go on to write "A Confederacy of Dunces." In the film, "Sailing to San Pedro" by Michael Powell, and the book by Steinbeck, the pirate crew is much larger than what is depicted in the novel. I remember that the pirate is a young blond kid named Frank who is supposed to be very intelligent. I also remember that one of the pirates is named "Tobias" (that sounds like "Thomas"), which sounds similar to the name of the book's author. The pirate that we see in the film is an Englishman named Sir Nicholas Soames (yes

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's only one real rule of writing about film: make it better than the original. 5. Don't write about movie-making:  It's boring and pointless. You don't get any better insight on what movie making really is than this. 6. Never, ever write about a movie like a film.  Film is a medium; writing about movies is a hobby.  7.   When you write about movies, don't describe things in words.    Talk about feelings, look at what people are thinking, read what's going on in the audience and try and make connections and connections between things that don't necessarily seem to fit or that don the same to the viewers.   There's only so much time, so if you're writing about a film that's not your own, try and get as much as you can before it runs out. 8.   Make it funny.   Just making it funny is not enough, you must make it hilarious.  This is important for any film, and film-makers really need this sort of quality in their writing, otherwise their film won't stand up to a critical or audience response.   If you can get the script funny, you're halfway to making a film worth watching.  If not, you'll find that your writing and direction are so far out of sync that it will be almost impossible to make a film good enough to survive with the original content intact.    9.   Make it relatable.  Sometimes the most beautiful films are the ones that are most familiar.   A film like the recent Life is Beautiful is a beautiful film because it's relatable to anyone who has ever been in love.   In the same way, a film like I Am Legend is relatable because it was made by a director who has seen the world like the world is.  You can tell that he lived in a world where people were killing people.  In a way, he was just doing what people have always done, and so is your script if you make your film relatable, even to a lot of people who have never seen a movie.  The only way that you can make a good film is if it has an audience to appeal to.   Don't try to reach your audiences at the expense of making your story better.   For example, it's great to tell a story that will touch a lot people with heartbreak and

And I wanted it to be a good story and a good ending."  - J.J. Abrams  _______________________________  in case you missed the film, the story begins in the present day, in a dark, post-apocalyptic world. A young woman, Jessica (played by Amy Adams), was sent away by her mother to the isolated, underground city of Rapture. There, she meets her fellow citizens, the Little Sisters, who will help her find her way home. There is much adventure, romance, danger, and intrigue during this film, as the Little Sister lives in fear of the man she loves. But when she finally finds him, he is not what she thought him to be.  The plot is complicated, but it is well written and a great first film for a film student. It's not necessarily a science fiction film, but the setting and the way the film is told is so similar to how science fiction was viewed in the '70's. So even if you're not a fan of science fiction, you may enjoy the movie. The film is directed by Joss Whedon, who also directed the first two installments of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  of the three films, this film is the best. The Little Sisters is my favorite character and is my all time favorite character in the film series. There's something about the way she is introduced in the beginning of the film that sets the tone for the entire film. , I was always hoping to see the Little sisters in the final film, and I hope they show up for a few more scenes. The plot and character development for the Little sister is really a standout feature of this movie. In terms of the score by Hans Zimmer, the score is one of the best of his career. It is full of emotions and emotion is never shown as it's hidden inside the music. It adds a wonderful depth to the story. I found myself crying in a few scenes, which makes me want to see more. If you want a good, dark, sci fi horror movie, you're going to want to watch this movie!  Overall, the film has its own charm that makes it a great watch. It may not be for everyone, but if you like science fiction and horror, or are a fan

You want to know who's going to win, who's the biggest jerk, who has a great personality, who will really make a fool of himself. The only downside is that it ends in a bad way. However, I found it to be an enjoyable movie that has a lot of humor in it. I don't think this was written to be watched all the time, but that's fine too. It's not too long. It really didn't take that much to watch the whole movie.I also liked the music. I think it's really great and catchy. It reminds me of some music I heard when I was a kid, when I used to watch TV's. I wish it was in English, but it's just one of those shows that isn't perfect in English. I liked it and I think that's why it was enjoyable for me.The only thing that bothered me was that I have a small problem with the ending. I thought there was some mystery to the ending, but there really wasn't. The end was kind of rushed, and just didn't seem to fit well in my mind. I also thought that it was kind off, so I didn't think that was a good ending. So, I guess it's not perfect. But, it is a movie that I recommend for fans of this kind of show.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I have to admit I was disappointed that the film didn't live up to the hype" What would you tell your younger self about the films?  Why do you think the films weren't as good as people made them out to be? "I would be very upset if my parents told me to watch The Thing, which was one of my favorite films of all time. This was the only time I ever watched it and it really hurt me to see it.  The film got so bad and I couldn't understand how so much of the technology and science worked in the movie because that technology and technology was not available to our grandparents and great-grandparents.  Read More:   The Thing Is Not Like It's Debut Trailer   " The Thing is an example of the science-fiction genre. It doesn't explain its plot, and the story is full of bizarre coincidences that don't make any sense.   The Thing was produced in the 1970s, and its technological advances were relatively unknown at the time.  This film is not about UFOs or extraterrestrial life-forms, and it doesn't even try to be.  If you are looking for a film that explains what happened in the end of the World War II, The Thing will not do it. Instead of telling the story about the aliens, it uses the story of the astronauts and how the experiments failed.  The only reason why people think the movie is about UFOs is because they are not familiar with the original movie.  In the book The Thing Called Love, the movie was adapted from a short story, but this movie is much worse than the book. "  The Thing has the most amazing opening narration of all sci-fi movies:  " You were just about to go to sleep...when you noticed your watch on the table.  There was no one to go through it. "     In real life it is very difficult to get your watch working on the clock, so the film uses a similar idea.  It seems to work fine in the book, and in the opening of the movie, it makes a lot of sense, but in the finished film, it does not. It has to do with the movie's opening.  Because the book makes sense, the film makes no sense. So, why did it take so long for the movie to be finished?  The project was so ambitious that the cast and

Reviewer: jpchang - favorite favorite favorite - July 29, 2008  Subject: Don't Get Too Embarrassed. I am a big fan of the movie and the plot, but this guy's behavior towards the wife is very odd. I know there are more mature and decent people in the world, but to watch this guy in an embarrassing state is a bit much, and I think the ending of the story is a tad underwhelming.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film, directed by Mike Nichols, is based on the 1969 play "Inherit the Wind," and stars Cate Blanchett and Jeff Bridges. The story revolves around an aspiring actress named Charlotte (Bridges), who is trying to make her way in Hollywood with little experience in stage, dance, or acting. In her struggles to secure work and get her acting career off the ground, Charlotte's best friend and confidant, a young actor named Don (Blanchett) comes into her life and, along with her, sets Charlotte on a path toward success. Charlotte's path takes her to a New York City theater production of "Inquiry into a Woman's Soul" directed by William Dieterle, which is where she meets a man (Bridget Moynahan). This brings Charlotte into contact with a young screenwriter (Burgess), who has been struggling with his personal demons, and Charlotte and Don go off to see "In the Heights," and Charlotte finds herself a part. While all this is going on, Don and Charlotte also become romantically involved, and there is a wedding in the works, all this while Charlotte herself is still trying to find herself. With all this happening, Charlotte comes to realize that, despite her apparent lack of talent or talent at being an actress, there is something in her, something real, something that the world needs. This realization, which leads to a sort of rebirth for Charlotte, leads her to begin her search for her voice as an artist, and she decides to leave Don behind and begin her own independent musical journey. Her struggle to find her voice while maintaining her family life, and her relationship with her family, are some of the most heart-wrenching, painful and important scenes in the film. Nichols is a masterful director, and he has created a film which is a powerful, emotional and profound depiction of women, both as women, and the women who support them. In an age of the women's movement, with more and more women gaining the right to vote and the right for women to speak their minds, it is incredibly refreshing to see a film that takes on the subject matter of the role of women in society and how it affects all women. Nichols uses the film as a way to educate women and teach them about what they have and do have to give.  "Inheritance" is, in my opinion, one of the finest films of the year

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. If the movie has a happy ending, that's an "A." If the happy ending isn't happy, that is an "F." "A" is the worst possible score, so don't say it. If you can't be objective, don't rate it.  2. You should only be reviewing a film that was filmed before 1999. The vast majority of films of any age are bad, but films made before 1999 are usually either poorly-made or just poorly-shot, and you can learn from them.  a. Don't rate films that aren't "good" by any definition. Don�t even bother rating a film by whether it was shot by Spielberg or Murnau, by who shot it, or by what camera the film was shot on. If a film isn't "bad" by the definition of "bad", then it probably wasn't very good in the first place. So go ahead and rate a movie as "bad". If it is poorly-directed, you will have to be very objective in how you rate it; if it is shot poorly, you won't be very interested in watching it. The only exception is if it's a terrible, long-winded and boring movie that tries to be a masterpiece by trying to look like one, but which is a failure by every measure. : Go ahead and watch the movie. If it's not terrible, great. If there's a scene you don't want to watch ever again, you can change it or cut it. You can leave the scene with a smile on your face, a frown on your chin, and your mind clear of what you just saw. But if you can�t find any reason to enjoy watching the film, you should stop. If, however, there are several scenes in which you're actually going to enjoy seeing them, then go ahead; but be sure to change the scenes or cut them if you want to see the film again. It's usually more fun to watch a movie and change the scene from time to time than to watch it and watch it over and over and change it. There will always be scenes that make you laugh or that make a certain emotion rise in your chest; you should try to be aware of these and change them up if they don't work as well as you thought they would. If this isn't possible, then you're probably not looking for a good film in the end. The

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. Then do one for a terrible one: _______. Be specific about which movie you're talking about: ___________________. If there's no one else to call to correct you, call up the writer of the script (or the director) and ask to be removed: ______________________________.  6. Make them listen to you  If you're a public figure, you can say and do things that other people will not. For instance, I can make jokes about a reporter's wife getting raped. That doesn't make it true, but I can get away with it because I'm a public servant. Even if the journalist is not a public official, he or she can make a joke about it, and I can tell people it's a joke. The public is a lot more forgiving of jokes that people make about people who are powerful than it is of jokes about people they can't even imagine. When you say or do something stupid or offensive, the person who can take it the most easily, the most comfortably, will probably be the one who will come running. It's much easier to say or write something funny to somebody who can't take it, than it might be to make a point about a serious issue.  7. Be a master of the counterattack  It's a powerful tool. For example, if you are a public office holder, you have a lot of power over your colleagues. They might not like you. They may resent your power, or even hate you. You are going to be subject to ridicule if you say, "If you don't like it, take it up with me." This has to be done on purpose, carefully and carefully. There are people who hate it, but you have to try to use it. You have to get your colleagues to do the opposite of what you want them to do. If they don't, you will have to take it out on them, and when that happens, it will work like a charm. When a public person, you don  t want them talking about you. If you say that you are doing something about it or that they should do it, you are getting their attention. Then they will be more likely to do it. .  as you get in trouble, you'll want to get out of trouble. The best way to do that is by coming up with excuses for people to dislike you. This is the key to getting people to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "If you like this movie then you will like many others I have watched with great enjoyment." "The film is set in an alternate universe and has a great cast. The plot is fairly good as well and the ending will leave you satisfied for a sequel, however, if you have never seen a film with this level of production value then I would not advise taking the time to do so." Rating: 5 stars The next film was  Dredd. I went into this with no expectations and it was a very entertaining film. I liked the comic and the character and he was easily one of the most engaging characters in the movie.  This is the first time I am using the word "funny" in a review of a movie as I am not sure if I was used to it or if it is a part of my natural humor style, but this was a lot of fun.  I don't think I have ever seen a more detailed and well written character in a film as Dredd.  In this film you have a man who gets caught in an endless war against a powerful criminal organization.  He tries to find ways to keep from getting killed, and eventually a drug dealer named Deadshot (played by  Charlie Hunnam ) gives him a job.  When he returns home he finds a young boy, named Jon, who he recognizes as his son, and the two of them are reunited.  However, when he takes the drug, he gets knocked out and ends up in a hospital. This is the only film I am going to be referring to the character of  D.J. and his relationship with  The Judge.  The Judge is an alien alien who is very interested in the criminal justice system and the idea of having a human judge who has a special power.  D.J. works as the judge and uses his special power to help both the criminal and the judge.  We get to see how these two characters get along and get along very well, it makes the movie a lot better.  Also the music is so awesome.  In fact, when I saw this movie, I remember being excited because I knew it was going to have music.  Then I watched the song they played and it completely caught me off guard.  It sounded almost exactly like the song played in the show.  Of course the music did have the theme song playing, but the music and the theme are so much better than

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  5.1/10  __________________________________________________________  It was a year since the first trailer for "Sicario" arrived online. That first trailer was a pretty weak attempt to sell a new franchise that was being produced by the Coen brothers and David O. Russell. It did not do any justice to the themes of this film; it was not as gripping as "Blood Simple," nor was it as visually stunning as "The Grand Budapest Hotel," nor did it have the heart-stopping intensity that "Birdman" exhibited.  This movie is not what it is touted to be. I know that "Blood and Water" was considered to be a "sequel" to "SICARIO" by many people. It seems as though there are people in Hollywood that think that these kinds of movies are to be marketed to the masses and are not made to be considered art films. If this is the case, then the Coens and Russell are the best filmmakers in the business, not "Budapest." The Coens are the masters of their craft, and they know exactly what they are doing.  "S icario" is a "war movie" that is set in a country that was once called "The Good Old USA" and still has "civility" to this day. This is a story about "the right thing" versus "the wrong thing." This is the story of "what is right and wrong." The story of the CIA going after the cartel that is smuggling drugs into the United States is a familiar one. The cartel's money comes from the drug trade, so the "bad guy" is the drug dealer. The "good guy" in this case is the CIA, and their main mission is to track down the cartel and its leader. The movie also stars Josh Brolin, David Oyelowo, Benicio Del Toro, Frances McDormand, and Viola Davis. This movie will most likely be met with a "meh" by the people who have been looking forward to seeing it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ The Room (1996) 8/10 __________________________________ - (9.5/10) For most, this is the movie that started it all, the movie which started a generation of young people to see their own creative ideas through to completion. The Room is also one of the most underrated movies, the one that started the debate of whether it was good to be funny or not. With a cast of all time greats, and some of the best performances in film history, The Room has it all. It is a classic of modern comedy, it is an artful and funny film, and it is a brilliant piece of work. But, as much as it is the beginning of an era, it also ended it, leaving the fans of this movie frustrated and unsatisfied. As a result of this, many of these movies that began with The Room are now considered cult classics. It's been 12 years since The Room's release and I think it is now a time for it to be recognized for it's greatness and not just for being one of those movies that started a whole new era. But does The Room live up to all of these titles, does it stand the test of time, and, if it were to be brought back to theaters, what would the audience think? These are the questions I will try to answer in this review. The film is based on the true story of Tommy Wiseau, a young man from Sacramento who was known to make movies in his spare time. His first movie, "The Room" was based on an idea of his by a writer named Greg Sestero. A friend who was also a writer at the time got Wiseau a job, and sent the script to Greg Sesterso. Wiseau read it and said "that's a great idea" and asked Greg to write the script for him. Soon after, Wiseau made his first short film, entitled "Room." Greg then spent years trying to sell the idea of a movie to studios, until he was able to get a screenwriter from Fox who would later become Tom Shadyac. Shadyack is famous for adapting various scripts, including those written by Sesteros. After getting his first screenplay optioned, Greg then worked on the script until the film was completed. The story revolves around the group of friends who become roommates at a fictional resort. The movie follows Tommy, his girlfriend and the rest of the group as they move into their new

On the other hand, it's not the Godzilla we grew up with. In fact, it may be worse. "Godzilla" is the kind of movie that feels like it was made to appease the fans of 'Godzillas,' but I don't think it'll turn any heads for anyone else who saw it at the theater or on television. "I think the fact that there are very few monster movies made anymore — it's the thing that everybody's obsessed over," says director Gareth Edwards. "This is a very different kind of monster movie, but it's fun."  In a way, Godzilla's new home is the same one it's been in for a quarter century: the Pacific Ocean. "He's been a resident of that sea for over a quarter-century now, and he knows it better than anyone," says Edwards.  "Godzilla," however, isn't the monster that the film's new Godzilla is made to fight. In "Godzill," a mysterious, long-haired figure (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) — whose exact origins remain a mystery — is wreaking havoc in Japan. Godzilla has his own secret weapon: a massive nuclear missile he has kept hidden for years. This gives him a tremendous advantage when he goes after the mysterious "Number 6" in the film, a mysterious and tall man who

Please don't tell me about a movie that you like. I like a lot of movies. I really do. I can list my favorites on a couple of fingers. But they are few and far between and I get bored fast. I do my own reviews. I write about what I like and I post some of the good reviews, and I also post bad ones. This blog is not a movie blog. This is an internet movie blog, where I go in depth on some of my favorites and then I rant about other movies that aren't good. I think the reason why I am such a movie fan is because the internet was not around when I was growing up, so I got to be on my own. When I was a kid there wasn't a website to talk about movies. And I don?t like to talk in a blog? because I don t understand it and I do not have an audience that will understand it. I don;t want to talk to people like me. So when I see an internet blog about a film I love I read it, and if I like it I like to write a little about it. This isn?t a blog about movies; it is about my favorites. So you have to accept my limitations.  So I don' t care if you?re into the movie of your choice. But if you hate it, then I can understand why you hate that film. I mean, I don?'t care. Why should I care? It's just a movie. People go to movies to have fun and to have a good time, and movies are fun and good. They aren't serious dramas that need to be taken seriously. Movies are not serious dramas. They?re just movies. It might be hard to believe, but the internet has a ton of movie blogs and websites. There are sites where you can read about every type of movie you could ever want to see. You can see all the big movies, all the low-budget movies, a good part of the cult movies, some of your favorites, and a bunch of the movies that you didn?t see for a long time. I even have a few of my favorite films on DVD, so my DVD collection is growing. There?s no end to movie blog websites, there are too many

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. _______. _________. ____.  The problem is, you can't, and that's the problem. "I hate the film 'Pulp Fiction' and every character," says a man in an airport lounge. "They all suck."  I don't like it either, but he's still going to watch it anyway. Because if he doesn't, he doesn t hate it.  the point is that it is impossible to get a positive rating for anything, but we all like it anyway, just to try to "get" it. I hate it and you hate it, but it's a good thing. The point is not that people are being dishonest. The point is the negative aspect of getting a rating and all the other reasons why. In fact, there is no positive aspect to getting a good rating. The positive aspect of going to the movie is just the experience and the fact that it's fun. And it is fun for the majority of the people who have to endure it. And so, we get a lot of rating "flippers" and people who rate a movie based on their own subjective opinions instead of the actual ratings given by the people around them. It is really simple. 1-4 - Very good 5-7 - Good 8 - Okay 9 - Acceptable 10 - Above average The reason ratings are in the 1-4 range is because there are only four rating systems that exist. There are three major rating systems - CinemaScore, Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, and then there are a few smaller ones like Metacritic and IMDB Average. So, if a movie has a score of 80% on one, it has a 70% on the other two. It's easy to say the movie needs a 10% on CinemaScore because you already know the score, but if you say you want it to get an IMDb Average of 82%, you may just be confusing the two. That isn't the only reason, though. I've found that IMDB actually has a better scoring system than CinemaScore. IMDB has a lot more movies, more films and more people, so it has an easier time keeping track of all those different things. IMDb also has an "annual" ratings system, which allows the movies in their database to be ranked. So IMDb scores the movies from 0 to 5, and CinemaScore doesn't
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ (A) is the good ___________. If A = good, then B = better, but not if A= bad. (B) is bad. If B = bad, then C = worse, but if A<>C, then D = better. When you're working with a lot of people who are unfamiliar with what the definition of a good idea means, it can be hard to keep track of the actual quality of each and every one of them, and in order to get around this, I sometimes rely on the "bad idea" method: In any given conversation, if someone uses the bad idea method to identify a potential bad idea, I can ask what they mean. I often end up getting the answers I want. 1) "It's a bad idea to do this..." 2) "The worst thing you can do when you're trying to create a good product is to say yes to the bad ideas..." The good idea method allows you to ask the right question at the right time, but the downside is that it can end up distracting you from the point of focus. Sometimes, people will try to deflect by giving you examples of bad ideas that really shouldn't be allowed to be taken seriously. The only way to make sure that you're truly working on an idea for a good or great movie is to do your homework. To quote the great Bill Paxton: "If it sounds like a good one, it probably is." The following section of my article, "Five Movies That Have Made Me an A-List Screenwriter," will help you figure out what a good story is, and how to make them with your words. It's one of those things that's more abstract, and harder to explain. I hope it's not too vague, or you'll end up with a big, dumb question like "Do you need to be an A-" after finishing. It's All About the Story If the point is to make an A+ movie, then you should have one. I know you don't want to make a movie just for the sake of it, but an A movie is where the best ideas have been put to work. If the story is good, you're going to be more likely to get a movie made, and the more successful you are, the more likely that you are to get more movies made. The less money spent on making movies, the greater the returns.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________ I don't know much about Japanese culture, but I did understand a lot about the Japanese-American experience of the internment camps. I found them to be pretty intense experiences. I don't think I'll ever forget them. I went to see the film, "A Touch of Sin," on the 15th anniversary of the events, and I'm so glad I went. The first half of this film is about a group of friends who have gone to a movie screening at a school in Ohio. They were there with a group from California, and they are upset that the kids from their school were invited as well. The Ohio group then gets really upset when the California group starts making fun of the Ohio people. They are all Japanese American kids and the California kids were making jokes about them, which caused them to feel that way.  As we're watching this, it's really shocking to see how many parallels there are between the experiences these kids went through. I thought, "Oh my God, these kids are going through the same things we went through." Then they were all at home, and some of them were getting into arguments about being called "gooks." That was a lot of stuff that happened to us. They didn't know what was going on and they didn't understand. This is just another one of these things that we can look back at and laugh about, but we have to deal with. That's what this is all about. They don't understand what's going on. That doesn't mean that we don't, but they don't. In the second half of the film you see more of the kids coming out of the camps. It really hits home what they were going through. They have to have all the stuff that they had and had to make new lives for themselves in the real world. After seeing that movie, I think I now understand more about what it's like to be in a Japanese American internment camp. That was the one film that really resonated with me, and that was the film that made me want to do something for this organization. They should be recognized for what they did and for what those kids went though. I hope this organization can get recognition for the work they did in the camps and their work with the kids that lived there. I have been trying to do some research about it and really just trying to learn more about that time in American history

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The film starts of with a great opening that tells us that this is the story of a woman called Julie (Marion Cotillard) who is looking for her brother. But things don't seem to be going very well. She meets the young man (Sophie Marceau) in the park who is being followed by a police officer (Samuel L. Jackson). The two of them go back and forth through the park, making fun of the cops and saying that they will make fun of them at the next meeting. The next night, Julie and Sam get into a fight and he starts hitting her and she says that she will never see her brother again. At this point, Sam takes off his clothes, walks around in the forest and the police officer gets caught by him. The cop doesn't know what to do. He tries to take away Sam's clothes, but Sam runs away and hides in the woods. Meanwhile, Julie walks into the city and looks around in every department store she passes and sees many beautiful dresses. She finally decides to buy one and runs into her brother in the department store. They start talking about her new dress but before they can finish, the police get to them. She takes off her clothes and gets caught. After that scene, the movie switches to another one where Sam and Julie are in a prison cell and Sam is telling Julie that she's so beautiful. After a long time, she decides to ask Sam to marry her. But Julie has no idea about her sister. Sam is upset that he didn't tell her about her, but Julie tells him that she doesn't care about him. At the end of the movie, when the camera starts to fall from the sky, Julie comes back and she tells Sam to get a new dress and he does. Julie is shocked, but she tells him not to think about it and goes back to the park. The movie was not very good. The acting was not bad, but it was very obvious that Marion Cotillard was doing a lot of the heavy lifting here. Her character was very much like an old aunt. In fact, that is the only way I can explain the role of the old aunt that Julie played. Julie was played by Marion Cot Cotillard had more fun playing her character's girlfriend, but if she was really playing an old Aunt who wanted to be taken as a wife, that part of her was not necessary. When I saw the trailer,

Where can I find it? ___________________  Zamzam  Dedicated Member   Videos posted to B-Movies: 6   My Rating:   The best movie on the web. ____________________I'm looking for an English version of it. The movie is about a guy who is being stalked by a woman named Margo in an old trailer where she lives with her family. She is a rich woman who gets a lot of money and is afraid that his friend has been cheating on her. He goes there and is trapped. He thinks that he will be murdered there and that the woman will find him.The movie was released on DVD about a year ago and I haven't found it yet, and it is still very unknown in English. It has a great cast with the usual stars like Dennis Hopper, Jane Fonda, and Bruce Willis. The story is a mystery with the main character trying to solve a crime and find out who is really stalking him. This is one of the best movies on the net. I have been wanting to watch it for a long time and I think that this movie is the best one out there for sure. There is even a sequel. _________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been asked this question more than once. The only reason I answered this one is because the movie was great and so I'm giving the movie that, and it may sound stupid, but to a guy that has to tell the kids to go to bed or the kid has to clean the house, it may seem stupid to give a bad movie a good rating.  But, if that movie makes a guy want to sit and read a book for an hour, even if it's terrible, then it's not a bad thing to give it a rating of 8.  How do you rate movies?  In general, the average rating for the movies I review is 8.5.   But... I'll take an 8.4 over a 9 or a 10 anytime.  I know it's a bit of a joke to say it, but I'm really happy that more people seem to like my reviews.  It means they're reading and enjoying my blog and I really appreciate it.  There's no need for me to give bad movies bad ratings, so I may go so far as to give movie reviews with a positive rating of 9.0 or even 10.0.  For the record, I've never had to do a negative review on any of my movies and haven't had to in a very long time, so maybe I can give some of them a higher rating to keep the ratings fair. How often do you post?   It depends.  In general, I don't post as often as I do in the past, but this month has been really busy and I've had a lot on my plate, so it's been really hard to write.  This is my first full year working full time as a professional writer and as such, it's really hard for me.  So I may have one post a month, on average.  When it comes to movies, there are no big rush and no need to get everything out in one go.  But I try to do reviews every couple of weeks or so.  Also, as a writer, I'm in charge of deciding which movie to review, and sometimes the list of movies I want to review changes, so that may mean I'll have a movie on for a week or two and then move on to another.  Then I'll post a new movie review a week later.  What does your reading do for you?  Every now and then
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. If you're going to write about a bad movie, make sure you also write about something great. For example, if you're writing about "What to Expect When You're Expecting", go out of your way to write a review that explains how good the movie is, instead of writing a review about how bad it is.  In general, you don't write reviews about movies. You write reviews for websites like Rotten Tomatoes that rate movies. We'll get to that in a bit. First, let's talk about how to write your movie review. . 1. Find a good director  A good director is someone who can tell a good story. A great director will be able to pull off some pretty amazing performances, and will be capable of crafting a compelling story without resorting to the cheesy and melodramatic. Some great directors don't need any acting experience, and are just as good at creating characters as they are at acting them out.  and are great examples of good directors. These are actors who know what they are doing, and have been on TV or in movies before. For instance, Steven Soderbergh was the director of "Crash", and he knows exactly how to tell a story. Or how about a movie like "Million Dollar Baby" from director Nicholas Winding Refn, starring Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe. These two actors are so good at telling a story that they were able to make a movie where the only thing that would make it worse is if they were to make it better. In "Miles Ahead", for instance, it would have been impossible for Kidman to pull of this type of role. To be a great director, you must have a solid idea for the film you are making. Do you really want to put someone in charge of a movie who does not know what the hell he is doing? You have to know how to make your film work. This means that you must learn how to use good production design, editing, and a storyboard. In a great movie, the director and the actors and the storytellers are all working together. If all three of them are on the same page, there is no doubt in my mind that they will be working together to make an amazing movie. "Miles ahead" by director Nicholas Winther 2.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. If it is an average film, you can say "Meh." If it's an above average film you can't say "meh." Just say something positive about the film and don't say anything negative. There are exceptions, of course. But for the most part, you don't want to go there.  When you see a bad movie, write a positive reviewer. If a movie is a good one, don't write anything negative about it. It's a waste of your time and yours. You have better things to do than write a negative review about bad movies.  in a movie's first five minutes. That means, at least 50% of the time, the first five pages will be about the movie itself and how it was produced or written. It is never about the people involved in the movie, nor about the character who plays them, nor how good or bad the movie is. The first five page is also about what you think will be in the movies for the rest of the movie. That's it. This means that you should not go into the first few pages with anything positive in your mind. There's not much time to go in there with a positive outlook, so that means you should just jump in and just say whatever is on your mind about the story. You don't have to tell the viewer anything about what they are supposed to feel, because there is no emotional connection between the two of them. Just put forth whatever you think is going to occur in the next five pages. Just write, "He was in a hurry to be there, but he never arrived." You're writing a review, but you don and you don. To sum up, in a positive reviews, write things like "A cool action scene," or "A great romance," or if there are some things that you want to say about the action or romance, just say them. But don't go into their first five paragraphs with any positive thoughts about the two actors or the relationship. Write the first paragraph about the three main characters. That way, you won't have any thoughts on the movie at all. Just be a fan of the characters and the movie and you will be able to write a great review. I can't wait to get back to writing and reviewing and to keep writing and talking about movies. Please write to me.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  A negative review of a good film: ______________________  the review of something that's not good,  a review about the plot: _______________________________  What are some movie titles that mean nothing: _________________________________  Your thoughts about movies: ________________________________________________________________  In the beginning of the movie:  the first part of the story: :  (This section is a review of the entire movie. It explains why you should give it a go, what it should do for you, and other important information.)The movie starts in the most basic way: the protagonist and antagonist meet, and the protagonist, whose name is "Jack," and the antagonist, whose nickname is "Roland," are set up. This is the main introduction, in which they meet. We don't get to know the characters in any depth, because we're just told how they met. The movie follows Jack and Roland for a while, as they travel through a forest, then into a cave, then to a desert, then through a village, then the rest of the desert, back into the forest, etc. The story focuses on Jack, and Roland, but doesn't make any great effort to do so. The whole film is just the story of them, and is very light-hearted. The characters are very likable, but very shallow, with little depth to them. This kind of film is like a road movie, except instead of taking the time to get out to see the scenic sights, they just drive through the desert. The desert is boring and doesn't have much to offer besides its environment, so it's better to just watch the characters driving around, instead of actually exploring the desert landscape.The movie takes about 3 hours to get through, but it would be more enjoyable if there was more detail and more character development. Some things that are good about the movie, but could be improved on include: 1) a good introduction, so you get to understand the characters before watching the movie. 2) more focus on the characters themselves, rather than the story. 3) more action in the story, and more of a plot. The bad parts about the film are: 1. the dialogue, which is too low. The dialog is very flat, and makes the characters sound like they're on TV, rather then people that you've actually met. 2. There are a few scenes that are confusing, and hard to follow. There's

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. (Not including the writer's own review, of course.) Do you like the new Star Wars movie? Would you rather see the new Jurassic Park? Do you think the X-Men: Days of Future Past movie is the best thing ever? If so, how do you like it so far?  If you're a film critic, how would you feel about a story that is so good that it would require you to tell it all again, with a new ending, to make it better? 's second installment, Star Trek Into Darkness, opens in theaters today. It has earned a B+ CinemaScore and a reported $85.4 million during its opening weekend. The movie has grossed over $300 million so far, but, thanks to Paramount, isn't even the first installment to get a sequel. (The original, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, was also turned into a two-part TV movie, the first part of which was a series of episodes in 1989 and 1990.) The story of, written by JJ Abrams and Simon Pegg, is set around the time of, and, like the original, has been a critical and commercial disappointment at the box office. A big part of the problem was Paramount, which was reluctant to commit to a twoquel. The studio wanted, according to Abrams, "to make it like a great sci-fi movie," but not a Star Wars film. "We wanted it to be a movie you can take home with you, not a film that's a great big blockbuster movie that you have to go see at the theater," he said. And, as with the original film, the new films are supposed to be darker than the first, with the story taking place during the events of. But instead of following the characters in their adventures, as was intended, the filmmakers, instead of telling a story about a time-traveling spaceship with a bunch of cool, new gadgets, turned the story into a tale about the perils of war and the pernicious nature of evil.The newfilm's first half is the story of a group of characters who are attempting to escape a prison on an alien planet. The film is full of explosions, action sequences, and a sense of grandeur. It's a big, flashy, big-budget, action movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ "The Last Jedi is a good one. If you like Star Wars and want to see good action in a different setting, then I would recommend this. I'm a huge fan of Star Wars but I'm also a big fan of this genre, so it's not an easy pairing. So, if you like this genre as well, then you should definitely check this one out. It's not a perfect action movie and doesn't have a lot of special effects, but that isn't the point. This movie has action for one thing, and that is to keep you on the edge of your seat. And to me, that's more important than the special effects and explosions."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I'm sorry I didn't post a review until now, but I didn t write one since I've seen every movie that was available, and I don't have the time to write one now, so please don't complain about your movie not having a good score, because I don t think a movie has to be perfect to be good, and that's what we have with this movie. It has some very entertaining scenes, especially when the kids are dancing, but it's so slow paced that you can just sit and watch it forever. But, you really need to sit through all the scenes, because they all contribute to the plot, and not only the romance. There is also a bit of humor, but don t take it too seriously. I really liked the movie, I just think that it's a bit too long and drawn out, but if you can wait that long, then you'll probably get to enjoy it, as the movie is only about 3 hours long.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  The film The Wizard of Oz (1939) is a very interesting one. The story is very simple. A family is moving to a new home in the middle of the woods. Dorothy and her brothers begin their journey. The home is in a bad way. There's only one room left that has any kind of ventilation and that is the attic. To get to the attic, Dorothy and the boys must travel through a small tunnel. They are unable to escape from the tunnel. Dorothy is able to get out from the narrow opening and runs around the house. She finally comes to the entrance of the house, and realizes she cannot get into the house with the help of a peephole. She runs around and through the house looking for a way in. Finally she spots a small door, which she opens and enters the house as the Scarecrow does. But as she is entering the house she finds that the place is very, very strange and she must make her way through the strange house to escape the evil witch, the Tin Woodman, and her dog.The movie is about 10 minutes long, but contains more than 30 minutes of very good scenes, and it is very interesting. There are three different people (Dorothy, the Scarecrows and the Tin Man) each with their own roles, but all have a very good and original role. There is a great scene where Dorothy is trying to get into a strange, narrow little house and ends up having to go through the whole house, a funny scene in which the Tin Woodsman is trying his hardest to talk to the Scarecoons, but he is very annoying, and a great, very exciting scene where the Tin Men have to escape their trap. The whole movie has lots of good scenes and the story is told well. It is very exciting and very exciting. There were many other good scenes too. The acting is good, the singing is very good. The musical scores were excellent. The music is very catchy. There was one scene in the movie where the music was almost silent, the only thing that makes you notice that is that the Tin Owl is singing the first line of the song and the music goes on and on and then the music dies down. The second time, the music is completely silent, but you still notice that the song is sung. This was a very clever and good idea. There, I have done the review.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ ____________ ___________  No one ever thinks to write a positive comment on the negative reviews of a movie. Well, no one in Hollywood, anyway. (Actually, some do. That would be John Landis. But who would read his comments?)  In fact, when it comes to writing negative reviews, you can't do it alone. You have to have someone else who will do it for you, someone who will have a vested interest in keeping your film in the black.  So how do you get someone to review your movie for you? Well, as far as I can tell, there are two ways. One is to take a movie that nobody in Hollywood wants to make, that no one wants to advertise, that nobody wants to screen, and that no Hollywood studio wants to put on the big screen (or even release on DVD), and give it to someone who can profit from it. And make it easy for the reviewer to give you good, honest, objective, thoughtful reviews. , and The American Film Institute has compiled a list of these kinds of reviewers. The second way to get someone who loves your movie to review it for free is to make it so bad, so boring, so lame, that you just have to put your movie up on a website like YouTube or Netflix or Vimeo, and let it be seen by a bunch of people who will watch it and rate it. In other words, if your movie doesn't have anything that people want to see in theaters or on DVD, you might as well just release it online. This kind of free publicity is a really good idea. You might get some press attention from a bunch in the press and make a few more people want your movie. . If you want people to think you are doing something "serious" and "edgy," you might not want to put a really stupid, unserious movie on the Internet. It won't look good. The thing is, you're not making your movie a commercial. You're just telling a bunch o' people who love your movie about what you think of it and how good it is, and asking them to give a rating. If your movie is mediocre, it won't get good reviews. And if your movies are crap, you'll only get crappy reviews. But if your reviews are good, people will actually want to go see your movie and rate the film. If they rate it "good

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  This is a movie of the life of an extraordinary man. I found it to be the most compelling story ever told in a movie. The movie leaves you in no doubt that the main character is a hero and the film succeeds in making that point. I don't care about the political and religious issues of the time - I care about a story about two human beings who are driven by the chance encounter in a foreign land to change the world. This movie, as good as it was, has an unearthly beauty about it. It's the kind of movie that leaves you thinking about life and the meaning of it all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You've really made a big contribution to the genre.  The negative comments don't have much impact.  And the only real negative comments are from people who were hoping to see the movie in a theater and weren't able to, and were disappointed by the movie (which is totally okay).  It's a matter of whether you're willing to accept negative reviews or not.  It might even be a bit more difficult when you're working on a movie in which your main character is black.  In those cases, you may need to consider writing about some of the movie's flaws in a way that the audience is already familiar with, and then take that criticism as constructive criticism and adjust the movie accordingly.  I've often written about the problems in movies (and many of the problems they're solving in real life, but that's another topic entirely) and they've been quite successful with the audience.  So it might be worth a shot to write about the movie and then modify it in the way that you're thinking. How did the film become a huge hit?  It was a surprise, I know.  There's no denying that the movie was an odd choice for its release date, but I think it's one of those movies that people will watch over and over again, because of the fact that it's so good.  You don't just see a movie once and then move on to the next one.  Like any great art form, there's always something to learn and you learn a lot more about yourself and your own interests when you watch a great film.  People will be watching the movie as long as they want, and they'll be talking about the film for years.  That's the fun of it.  (Of course, with movies, as with anything that you can watch endlessly, the fun ends when you stop enjoying the movie.)  You might also notice that the film is being released on Christmas, which is a really unusual marketing strategy for a movie release.  What's more, the film has a really clever premise that the trailer doesn't even try to hide.  However, it's not obvious to someone like me who has only seen a few things about the topic (see:  this post ).  So I'll have to thank Kevin Smith for all of the marketing efforts that he's put into his career. In closing, I'd like to take a moment to say, "Thank you" to everyone who

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ __________________________________  1. "The Dark Knight" (2008)  2. "Star Trek" (2009)  and "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace" (1999)  I'm a big fan of the original Star Trek films, and so it was a pleasure to be invited to make the "Starfleet Academy" episode, which is the first in a planned three-part series. A lot of fun was had filming on location in the middle of the desert. It was really exciting to make. The crew got to visit with fans who had traveled to the sets from around the country and around the world. In one episode, I actually got to meet the great Leonard Nimoy, and we chatted about his films. He was incredibly gracious, and he's one of the greatest actors of all time. I always have fun working with the greats. The cast was fantastic, and I hope they get some recognition for the great work they did with me.  -- Mark A. Altman   ___________________________________  3. "Batman: Gotham Knight" and "Superman Returns" (1992-2002)    My favorite episode is "Gotham Knight," in which Batman battles the Penguin in the sewer system. The set had to be made with nothing more than a few pieces of PVC pipe, foam, a bunch of wire and cardboard (that was my favorite part of the whole thing, being able to play with those tiny wires). There's a reason why this set has remained so popular, and why so many people remember it today. It is the perfect example of a great script with a really good production team. The film's budget was less than half of the studio's. Everything that was done was amazing.  bebe reeser, director of Gotham Knight, was a talented director with a strong vision of what he wanted to do, and it really paid off in terms of the look of the film. ... It was the same with "Superwoman" and Superman Returns. For both films, they used existing sets, and they just made it look amazing. They took what they could find and they did it really well. :]  __________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ Do not use "review" in the title of your review or the title will be in the bottom of the box, so it will look like this (that's how the "P" is written).  Please include the name of the movie you're reviewing (if you know it, please write it down). ,  , and if there are many movie reviews in one box, I think it would be better to separate them.  I am not responsible for the quality of your movie. I am only interested in the quality. I do not read any reviews, so please don't ask. If you are wondering how I know I don't read a movie review, please ask, because the answer is simple. My wife and I get the mail, so you are more likely to get it from her than I am. My mother lives over-nights (and is always awake in the morning), so you'll probably get a copy from her instead of me, but it will take a while before you get a response from her, if you ask me. If I'm awake during your reading, I will read your movie on my own time. . : : : :  (The reviews you see in my box will also appear in the movie box under "Movie Reviews.")  There is only one question to ask before you buy anything from me. The answer to that question is no, you will NOT be charged for the box of movies I sell. I sell nothing! You will not be charged anything! That's right, not a cent! And you'll get something in return. The movie box that you see here is for my own use, as an example of a box I sell on my Web site (I hope it is as informative as I believe it to be).

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ If you haven't seen, don't rate it because you haven 't seen it (if it's a film that you haven' t seen yet, rate it anyway). It would be like someone who hasn't seen a good comedy saying, "If you haven t seen 'Saved by the Bell,' don't say it's bad because you've never seen it."  5. If the movie is about something else that happened or is being discussed (such as, the Vietnam War or the "war on drugs"), only a movie critic should rate it.  6. When rating movies or discussing movies, you should also include information that will help people decide whether or not the movie will interest them. You can do that by including information on your personal interests and opinions on what movies are good and bad. If your opinion on what should be rated a movie differs from the average movie critic, that would be helpful.  and  7. The rating should be a number from one to five. A rating of 3.0, for example, means that the movie has the potential to be very good, although some issues may show up. A score of 1.0 means that a film has a very low potential to make any impact on the movie world. ,  8. When you give your rating, it should be based on how you feel about the movie after you see it. It does not mean that a score of four means the movie was great. It should also not be taken that a 5.0 movie means that it's terrible. For instance, a film like "The Truman Show" would be rated at 5.3, because it was a very good movie, but not necessarily one of the top films of all time. If you really enjoyed it, you may feel that the film was really a 5 or 6.0.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  1.0  A.V. Club: How did you like "The Avengers"?  S.T. Joshi: I loved it. It was my first time watching it with a real, grown-up audience. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the performances.  AVC: Were you surprised by some of the plot developments in the movie?  STJ: I thought the plot was kind of a gimmick at first, and the climax is kind of out of the blue. But then I thought, wait a minute: Who would do something like that? Who would try to get the Avengers to do something they never want to do? Who's going to be the bad guy? And then it was kind-of like: Who's the good guy? Who does the right thing? The movie really made me appreciate the work that Chris and Joe were doing. I thought they got so much better at playing it after "The Winter Soldier." And the movie got to be kind of funny. I didn't know what to expect, because it's so complicated, and it's also so much about love, and life, and loss, and secrets, and things like that.  of course the big twist was that we never learned what he was really up to. And I thought that was a real good idea. And they never got to a part where I thought it was all going to end badly, because there was always a way out. I liked the way the movie was structured, too: It was a series of different, smaller scenes that felt like they were happening in a movie. I got lost in the story, I guess, which is why I watched it with an adult audience, and not a kid one, or one with two people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/5z8r7q/nazir-khan   October 5, 2015 | This is the story of how a few months ago, in September of 2014, the United States and its allies were being bombarded with messages from a shadowy Internet figure known as "Nasir al-Khan." Khan, who was born in New Jersey, spent the '80s and early '90s running a jihadist Internet magazine, known as Inspire. He was a prolific writer who spoke about fighting the West's war on Islam. His writings, however, have gone largely unrecognized. Khan is a man of many names and multiple origins. He is of Pakistani descent, born in Saudi Arabia to parents who emigrated to the United Kingdom. He grew up in the Bronx in New York. He's also a Palestinian citizen who is said to have spent time in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Khan lived in Pakistan as a child and, when he was a teenager, moved to Afghanistan to study. When the U.S. invaded Afghanistan in 2001, Khan returned to Pakistan, which is still embroiled in a bloody civil war. After Khan's first visit to Afghanistan in 2002, he returned again and again to the Middle East, and in 2006, he moved to Britain to get a graduate degree in political science. He moved back to Afghanistan, but in 2008, after the U;S. toppled the Taliban regime, Khan came back to London. As a British citizen, Khan was able to return to Afghanistan without being forced to register with the U.S. government. As Inspire grew in popularity, Khan became the face of the Internet's jihadist "Salafi" movement. He wrote regularly for the magazine, which featured a mix of articles on tactics and tips on what to say to potential terrorist recruits. A former editor for Inspire, a group the U.'s Federal Bureau of Investigation considers a "specially designated global terrorist organization," said Khan was "a kind of godfather" for the group. Khan was, according to the former editor, "the face of jihad. … He's like the Osama bin Laden of jihad." Khan's online magazine featured a cover photo of an ISIS fighter brandishing an automatic weapon and the message: "I'm proud to be a Salafi." The magazine encouraged readers to travel to Syria or Iraq to fight for the self-proclaimed Islamic

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________  Reviews for Bad Boys  A.B. Brown's Review  Bad Boys (2005)  Directed by Spike Lee  Starring: Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Sean Penn, Jamie Foxx, Martin Sheen  This is the only bad film I have ever seen, and the only film I can think of where everyone involved would be better if it hadn't been made. Spike Lee has made a good film and has done it better than many directors who have done much worse. I was not at all impressed by the final product. I wish the director had given it more time. It is certainly the worst movie I have seen in a long time.  When I saw it the first time, I was under the impression that it was set in the 1990s. It wasn't, it was about the early 1980s and about a guy named Jesse James who is an outlaw. He is an unlicensed and unsupervised killer. The main thing is that he is a very violent man who never loses his temper or does anything to try to make the world a better place. The film's plot is based on the book The Outlaw Josey Wales by the very well known writer, Charles Portis. I would not say it is a bad book, but it wasn't for the reason that you might expect. It was not a good book for a number of reasons and if I had been in the director's chair, I would have changed some of the things to make it better. ... I can tell you that no matter what anybody might tell you, The Outloun is a good story, but as a story, it has a problem. The story does not work, it is not an original story. The book was an autobiography and it was not meant to be told as a straight book story. As a story it can work, but Spike Lee does not know how to write a good, tight, well written book, he is not good at that. It worked, but because it was an unscripted movie, Spike Lee wanted to have as much fun as he could and he felt he needed to put his own spin on it.  and he did. He put his style on it, he put his ideas on it that I don't think was in the original book. It really is Spike Lee at his worst. He made a lot of money and he put on the most terrible film of his

This kind of movie is a miracle. It is like finding out that the sky is blue and that life can indeed be wonderful. I have felt it myself and, like all good things, it comes to an end."  ― J.M. Barrie   "And now we return to the main course. I'll have a salad.  Now this is a very fine movie. Well done."  on the movie   - The Movie:  - Rating: .   The main character, named Michael, lives a life full of tragedy. Michael lost his wife in an accident and his only child, a daughter, died young. But Michael is not the kind of guy to let these setbacks stop him, and when his daughter is found in a derelict house and she turns out to be the reincarnation of his dead wife, the journey Michael takes to meet his daughter will be filled with the kindest, most caring, and most heartwarming feelings anyone could ever hope for.   is an animated romantic comedy that follows Michael, a single father who, when his wife has a heart attack, leaves to go find her reincarnation, who is the daughter of his former lover and has been living a solitary life in a vacant house for years. Michael, the fatherly figure, learns about his daughter from his old lover, and it is through them that he gets to know his daughter's personality and her life. Through the process, Michael starts to care for his daughter. Unfortunately, when the girl discovers her father's love for her, she goes to find him and is subsequently kidnapped by Michael. In order to rescue her, Michael goes on a quest to find her mother and other lost loved ones, and to find a way to live with his son.  - The movie is based on the book by Mary Elizabeth Braddon. The novel has the same basic plot line, though the story is told from a different point of view. Michael's story is more tragic, though it is more of an adventure tale, a little bit of a romance, and an occasional comedic romp. The film is mostly based on a song by the band Jethro Tull. The song is called "Ridgeway" and it tells the story of a young couple's search for their lost love. The

In the 1990s, I made a documentary about the life of Steve Jobs, then one of the most famous people in the world. I was curious if there were any filmmakers out there who had a similar perspective on the life and times of this extraordinary person. A week or so before shooting was to begin, I received an e-mail from Steve Jobs:When I first read this message, it seemed like Steve Jobs had become something of a prophet. He was talking about the importance of having a "good" film, which was a statement I had never before heard from him. I immediately thought back to my last film, and realized how much I had learned about the creative process by working with Steve. Steve Jobs wasn't just saying, "Make a good film," but rather "Make the best film." My next question to Steve Jobs was, "Do you want to direct a movie?" I don't know if Steve Jobs ever seriously considered this offer, but it occurred to me that, if it happened, he would most likely take a very different direction than I would. The best director I know is a friend of mine named David Fincher, who directed the very good movie Fight Club. In one scene in that film, there is a scene where the protagonist, Tyler Durden, is being interviewed about his relationship to a friend named Tyler Durdan, a former classmate who committed suicide. The interviewee says, "What do you think of Tyler?" He responds, "He was a good friend, but not a very good friend." As I watched David Finkler make this remarkable decision to shoot a film about a young boy, I realized that he had taken the opportunity of Steve's message. By letting the conversation evolve from "What would you say your best friend would say?" to "What's the best thing you've ever done for another person?" Finchen used his camera to show the other side of Tyler, something that I think is even more important than a good story. Steve is suggesting that, for every decision we make, we can ask ourselves, "Is this the right thing to do?" And then, with the help of your actors and the story, you can decide that it is. And even when it's not the right time

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ What to say about The Conjuring: "I don't want to say too much, but this was a really creepy movie." --Bryan Lourd, Variety "Scary, but the pacing was excellent, and the suspense and the atmosphere were really good." --Chris Nashawaty, Indiewire "It's the most beautiful and terrifying thing I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot." --Stephen King, Screen Daily The New York Review of Books, which named it the "Most Important Horror Film" of the Decade. --Cecilia D'Anastasio, Time Out New York "Haunting" --John Updike, New York Times ___________________________________________________ "There was a scene where an old lady was crying because she couldn't find her family, and she was talking to her husband in the kitchen, and he said, "You don't have to worry." But he couldn't hear her because he had locked himself away in the basement." --Joan Collins, The New Yorker ______________________________________________________________ "It is, at its core, an intensely atmospheric thriller, a work of terrifying craftsmanship.... In the film's first half-hour, the fear of being exposed to ghosts is almost overwhelming, and it is only by the film-within-a-film's second half that the horror of that exposure becomes more palpable and unsettling." --Christopher Buckley, Los Angeles Times "The Conjuring is about as frightening and disquieting as you can possibly get..." --Mike Cahill, Hollywood Reporter __________________________________ "Screaming, twisted, and macabre, The Conjure has a very specific and very effective horror touch." --Peter Bradshaw, Variety ___________________________________ "In a strange and frightening world, the most powerful monsters are the ones we ourselves create." --William Goldman, New Yorker It's a modern take on the haunted house story. When the family of a recent college graduate starts to feel something strange happening at the family home, they decide to hire a local paranormal investigator to investigate. The film is a slow-paced, claustrophobic mystery, which builds to a surprising climax at the end. It's a thriller/horror hybrid, which is a genre of its own. I'm a fan of the original novel by Stephen King, so it's no surprise that I was looking forward to this film. I thought the director, James Wan, did
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  The Great Outdoorsman   Joined: 02 Oct 2006  Posts: 12  Location: New York  Posted: Sat Nov 17, 2016 11:06 am Post subject: Thanks for this!  It's not that I think the movie is bad, but I thought it was very, very bad.  You can say that I was disappointed and that I had no expectations, but if I was to make an estimate, I would say that the movie had only one redeeming quality:  That there were only ten minutes of action, so the viewers get a lot of action!   And if this film has one thing to be said, it's that it could have had more action, and not less. , because I don't think it's an action movie (or at least, I didn't see any action at all. Only a few bits of "bump & run" and a bit of running along the beach).  However, if you read the Wikipedia entry for the film, the author says it was "The first film to make the "Rambo" series into a successful Hollywood blockbuster" (in case you didn't know, the first "Rambos" were made in 1967, two years after "The Great Escape"). So maybe you shouldn't compare this to a "Rumba", but in any case, I believe it is the first film with more action than "Rumble in the Bronx", because it was even more action packed than "The Greatest Show on Earth".   The best action scenes, I saw, were those between the main character, Alexi, and an evil, evil and super-evil guy.  The first one was the part when Alexi was kidnapped and the evil guy, who used the excuse that he needed to find a gun, sent his men to kill the boy. They couldn't find the gun and Alexi got killed. The second one was when Alexei was trying to get rid of the kidnappers and they threw a bunch of explosives on his car, and he had to escape and save his son. . And that was it, as far as I see.   If you like action movies, you'll probably like this movie.  are there any good action movies that aren't from the 70's? Are there any bad ones?

Follow The Star-Ledger on Twitter @StarLedger and find us on Facebook. , it's a great movie. And the first in a trilogy of films. We'll give you a quick overview of why. The movie takes place during the Great Depression and it follows a man who is trying to sell a movie that has been banned by his own country. This film, the story is about a man trying to create his own brand of the movie. His idea is to give people something to look forward to. The man who created the movie, also a real life hero and a former boxer who had to move to Japan because of his fame, creates the movie for him. So in order to do that, he has to put on a show that will help him and the audience to forget about the tragedy that is going on around him. We can all relate to this man in our own lives. We all go to work every day, come home, and then watch the news on the TV. We see that a huge storm is about to hit and we have to take shelter. The same thing is happening to these people that are trying to make a movie to entertain people. The film is shot and edited very well. It doesn't look like an over-produced film. It looks very real and very good. You will love the whole movie if you give it a chance.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________ 1.4/5 ***** I don't want to give this movie a bad rating. I have seen it a bunch of times and have enjoyed it. This is a great action movie. Its action is great and the fight scenes are exciting. This movie is a good action movie but it fails to hit the emotional aspects of this movie. The characters that die are not fleshed out enough, and it just feels too forced. It seems like every character dies at least once but not in a believable way, and I don´t think they make any real attempt to build up the characters as people before they go out and kill people. Its just like this movie was made to kill off all of the main characters in the end. This film is great when its action is happening, but the emotional moments seem really forced. I wish that the film made more effort to develop the characters, and try to make them interesting. Overall, if you like to watch action movies that are fast paced and don´ t try to build anything real in the characters. If you like action and dont want the emotional elements in the movies, then this movie is for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  __________ Do you have any ideas about how to make the movie easier to understand for non-film majors? _________  ______________________ I'm a theater major. My major has not been a barrier to filmmaking and has even helped me write some pretty great stories. There are many more people like me out there who would love to see the movie but have trouble with the film. Let's not make it harder for people like us, and let's not be afraid to ask our professors for help.  In the end, we asked the directors to make a short film about their experiences teaching English at a top college. The film will be short, funny, and full of wisdom for college English majors. This film will go to great lengths to not have too much of any one part, and will end on a positive note with some of the best music we've ever heard. As a college English major myself, I know how hard it is to make college films. This could be an amazing opportunity for any college major to use. ....  This story was written and produced by Rachel C. P. Williams and edited by Eric Taggart.  in the spring of 2010 we had no idea how much of a sensation we would create with this film. In the summer of 2012 we were asked to direct and produce another short documentary, which also had a pretty wild and crazy beginning. The new film, written and directed by Rachel and Erica, and edited and produced in partnership by Rachel P. and Eric T. and my parents, is also about a college student, but it's about how this student is making their film in high school. It will be released in June of 2013. We're very excited to show it to you now. "In the Spring of 2010 I had no clue how popular our project would become. I never dreamed we'd have an audience as excited and engaged as we are now. We had no preconceived notions that our film could be this popular, but everyone was telling us, "Your film is going to be big!" We are incredibly grateful to our fans for watching, discussing, and enjoying this film, and we can't wait to see it shared with others as we have. So here it is: the very first college English short film! We hope you enjoy it!"  Rachel P.  it is my hope that you will enjoy our work, that you may learn some new things about
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is not a good film. The movie is good for showing the real life that was going on in the early 70's when "The Shining" was written. For example, this film shows the evil men that were in power and the lies that were told to the people in the town to try and control the population. There are a few different characters but there is only one bad guy. The film opens with a scene that gives you a feel of the setting and gives you an idea of what the town of Overlook is like. It shows the over the top, violent behavior and the abuse and manipulation that these people were going through. The story was very good and even though it wasn't the best movie to have in the late 70's, it was a pretty good watch.  No. of People: 1  Best Actress: Heather Donahue  Character: Wendy  Movie: "The Bodyguard"  Why you should watch it: I love this movie. It is great because it gives the viewer a glimpse into what the real world was like and how everyone in it looked at the world. The characters are really likable and they make you care about them. The plot takes place in the 60's in the middle east where the US is about to attack and invade Iran. You don't know who your enemy is but it is really well done. In this film the main character is a female and her boyfriend is a male bodyguard. These two get caught in the crossfire in the war between Iran and Iraq. The female protagonist is a smart woman who is able to stay out of the fray to help her male friend. The storyline was interesting and I enjoyed the characters. The ending was great too. I think if you can look past the fact that the main male character is actually gay and has a love interest he will be the love of your life.  the film is a great watch for anyone who is into real life. I personally love watching movies about the 70's and the early 80's because I get to see the world before it happened. I love the fact in this movie you get to meet so many different people and have so many interesting stories about people you wouldn't expect to be in a movie.  and now…back to the review. I thought the main thing about the movie was the storyline. Wendy is in a horrible situation and she can't even help her boyfriend out because he is a bodyguard and

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I thought this was a good film." The negative comments were even more telling: "There was not even a single good joke in this film." "The dialogue was not funny, nor was the acting. I thought it was going to be something funny." "So-so movie, not worth the time." I was really impressed by some of the feedback. People actually said things that I didn't think I'd ever hear. The bad news was that people seem to have lost interest. The good news is that I've found a way to make my own version of this film with more humor. There's nothing I like more than a good good joke, but I also think a lot of humor is just plain bad and I'd like to add something that would make this laugh in some people's faces. And there's something to be said about making the film a comedy first and a romance second. In a world where there is so much pressure to have a successful romance, it's good to take a chance on something a little different. But that's a topic for another article. I really loved what I saw from this film. If you've ever seen a trailer for it, you know that it takes some liberties with some of its conventions. The story centers around the story of a guy who is trying to decide whether to get married, get a divorce, or move to a country that is far away from his family. The film also takes some great chances with a story where the protagonist is a guy on his own, with no one around him but his computer and his thoughts. One of the things I like about this film is that it's a bit more realistic than most romantic comedies. There's no "Hollywood fantasy" in this movie where they are getting away with anything. It's not that kind of film. In fact, I think the filmmakers were pretty upfront with the fact that the movie was a bit of a romantic comedy. But if that's what you want, then I think you'll like it. The film does a really good job in creating a sense of loneliness and isolation. The people in this society can't communicate with each other. If people don't have sex then they won't have children, which is the first step to a stable society. There are no classes or a way for people to rise above their station. This is a very interesting world. It makes me want to go and talk to the people in that

Excellent Explanation of How It Works Report this review Pro Privacy ON (login to see reviewer names) on August 6th, 2014 I am very pleased with this DVD. The best way I can describe how this works is the concept of the "magic" in which the cards and the balls have an invisible layer of oil. When they are struck against each other, they reflect the energy back on the magician. It is easy to explain in one minute. It was great to see this method being taught in a fun way. I love the special effects and the use of a lot of smoke and the effect of the cards being put together in a way that they all appear to be magic. This was a great instructional DVD and will definitely be a part of my DVD collection. Thanks for making this DVD!  Awesome! Report this Review Pro Privacy OFF (login here) on June 30th, 2013 This is by far one of the best magic instructional DVDs I have ever seen. This is a must have for any serious magician.   The presentation is thorough and educational. Every trick has been explained in full detail. The "Magic Formula" used in every trick has also been explained. The use of smoke makes for very creative visual effects. The DVD was extremely well recorded and presented.   "The Magic Formula" is a wonderful concept. As a person of no prior knowledge of magic, it was really easy to understand. There are multiple tricks that demonstrate the concepts, and I found that the use and execution of all of them was very simple. I have already purchased a second copy so I can add to my collection of this DVD as well as any of the other DVDs from The DVD Doctor.   that said, the "Magic" DVD is simply excellent. It contains all of the information one would need to be able to perform many tricks. I highly recommend this DVD for any aspiring magicians. The entire DVD has been filmed so that it does not show any pictures. This means that the pictures do not show how to make your tricks. They just make it seem like the tricks are easy. The magic itself is quite easy to follow.  -John   I just recieved this DVD last night from the mailman. I'm very glad I ordered it and I've already made a second purchase for my collection.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ Why do some people like to watch movies with terrible actors? Why?  Because you can be part of the team, they're not bad actors and there are so many talented ones that it's just a waste of time and money.   Also, you can use your imagination to make up a scene or two that don't sound like something from a movie or television show, especially the dialogue. The actors get very good at pretending to sound funny.  This is really interesting in Hollywood when people talk about the "best actors in the world." Are they talking about the top people that actually go to acting classes? (Yes, you guessed it, those are the top actors in Hollywood, not the people who are known for being talented and funny, just the people that get famous in film, TV and theater.)  For example, some of my friends used to watch TV shows like The Big Bang Theory when they were young. These were the best actors in that show. One of the characters was a genius scientist who did incredible things. This was just another show like The Jetsons, where everyone does amazing things.  That's because TV is a fake medium, where you can have the actors be really good and still make it look like they're being silly, without the producers or directors really doing anything with it, like taking it seriously. You don't even have to know what they're saying or how they're acting; all you need is to see them moving and talking, to get a hint of what it would be like to be in the same room with them. But if you watch the movie version of The Big bang Theory, it would look like the characters were making stupid comments and yelling out ideas like "NOOOOO, it's impossible!"  There's a big difference. It's also much easier to take someone else's opinion into account when you're making something, when you can hear all the things they said and see how their actions would seem crazy and stupid to you.  But I still watch dumb TV shows, so why do I always make them worse than what I saw on TV? Because the real world doesn't work like a TV show. I like that TV shows have an author and director, the actors make it better than I would do on my own, and the story is better because of that. Also, there is more to drama than comedy; sometimes it is a way of getting revenge on the person that messed you
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. The key here is that the reviewer should not mention a problem with the movie, or suggest that it is bad because it had a problem. This will not only result in the movie being viewed as a negative, but it will also lead to the audience coming away with the idea that the movie is bad, even though the review actually gives it a 4 out of 5.  Now let's get to the point:  Why do I say the above things is important? Well, one of the main reasons is that a movie should never be judged based on one of these points (unless you have to). It should be judged on how well the movie holds up to the rest of the movie and how well it works as a whole. The most common thing people do is compare the reviews of the same movie with each other, and sometimes people will actually get their friends to go watch the movie. But what if you want to review a movie with friends? This is where people go too far, and the two main problems you will run into:  (1) When you discuss a movie, you have a discussion with your friends that you might not like or respect. But even if you do, that does not mean that you cannot review the movie as it is. , you should talk with your friend and your friend's friend about what each movie does. Let's say you review a film with your best friend and his friend. Your friend might not want to talk about how the movie was handled, or what he/she thought of how the character was handled. Your friendship might suffer if you start commenting on a movie that you have not seen. This also brings us to the main problem I mentioned above: You need to be able to give feedback on a book or a movie without bringing up any of the negative points that you can bring up about a book and a movie. This is how you build a good opinion of the book or the movie that we are reviewing. To make this easy, we will take the movie Reviewer as our hero and will go over all of the important points you must be able discuss with a friend about the movie: This movie does not have enough sex scenes. Why did they do the sex scenes if the movie isn't as good at sex as the book? If they had more sex scenes, how would the movie have a stronger plot? If the sex was strong, it would have a better movie. How
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ I enjoyed the movie, however, if it weren't for a couple of things. The first is the fact that the guy who wrote it, is not a doctor. I understand that they need to get the right kind of actors to play them but this guy, I can only assume that he didn't go to school to be a physician. So what's he doing with the role? It's a joke. The second thing I found annoying was that it's not actually called The Secret of the Unicorn. That's probably the only good thing to come from this movie. The movie, is a total rip-off of the original. And that is NOT a good thing! I hope that it gets more attention that it has been getting, because that would be the right thing to do. But so far it's been getting more attention than the originals were getting, so it's definitely something to watch out for.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Why does it always have to be this way? A man who can do a decent job is let go by a studio after five years on the job. The poor man just had to watch helplessly as his friend got the better of him and ended his life. I'm sure the studio is not in the business of taking care of people, but what makes the job so hard is that it can't be a negative job, which means that people often work with the knowledge that they are being judged by an outside authority. When the external judgment is negative, it is very difficult to make anything that even approximates a decent living. So you work until the job is over and then get the fuck out. If it is your only way to survive, you do it until you can't do it anymore. How can you make a living as an actor? It all comes down to two factors. One, it must be easy to do the job, and two, there must be a demand for it. The studio system does not create such a demand. There are more movies made by a smaller number of people than ever before. There has been a long run-up in film production, from the 1920's up to the present day. So the studios have to compete with other people who have the same resources. The competition is not always on a level playing field, but when the studios are forced to compete, it becomes the easiest way to make a quick buck. There is no more lucrative form of entertainment than the movie business. It is more popular than it has ever been, more popular even than the horse-racing business. You can make $100 million in one weekend. What can you do with that? And that doesn't even count the money that people will spend on souvenirs. So, if there is any reason at all to think that actors have a decent chance of making a decent wage, it would have to come from the fact that their pay has not been determined by the fact they are actors, but by how much it is worth to the studio that they do it. If the movie studio is only interested in the money it makes, then it can afford to pay anyone who wants to play the part, regardless of whether the movie is successful or not. But as soon as the movie goes into production, there are limits to how much money it will get to spend on the movie. If you think that it is not possible for the studio to spend more money
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. What are you doing at a moment like this? _______________. You know I'll always have your back, right?  Here are a few more ways to celebrate:  Go for a drive. If you can, avoid the busy roads during this time of year. Turn off the radio, close your eyes, and relax. If all else fails, try to forget it.  If you can't, try the traffic light. Try not to hit any of the red lights at intersections during this period, as the red light cameras will be at work trying to catch you.  it's time to get your car washed. If your car needs a wash, take it to a car wash that offers a limited selection of auto and tire care products. This will be the first time for many of you that your car was properly maintained in the spring, and will likely be a good investment.  The car washes are all on weekends, from 5 a.m. – 8 p.m., so it may be worth the extra money to get a few minutes on a weekend. They also are usually very nice and will treat your car to a good cleaning. , but the best thing to do is to make sure the tires are properly inflated. Inflation will provide protection from weather and road debris and will allow the tires to last longer, longer than usual, as we discussed in our summer tire article. This, along with properly maintaining the air pressure in the tires, will help you enjoy your summer road trip even more. : We have some bad news and some good news for those who have a car that has lost air pressure. The bad news is that some vehicles are susceptible to losing air pressure, and the good news is, if you know where to look and understand what to look for, there are ways to help keep your tires and car from becoming completely useless. Here are some of the most important tips to remember:  is that your tire pressure is too low. In most cases, your tire will be low for several reasons. One of the biggest causes of low tire pressure on a vehicle is the driver. If the driver takes a lot of turns and has high speeds, it's common to lose pressure over time. The second big cause of tire loss is the tire being in the wrong place for the road conditions. It can be an unexpected bump, a sharp turn, or a sudden change in weather that pulls the tire out

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________ I'm not a professional film critic, but I can give my opinion. I'm also a student of the arts and I like to explore new topics. My opinion on films is often subjective, but that's what I try to do. My favorite movies are either comedies or action/adventure films. I don't like fantasy and horror, and I don�t usually watch foreign films unless they are in English. If I really like a film, I'll watch it again. It's also fun to get feedback from people who have seen the same film, or from the same director multiple times. I am not against reading other reviews, but please refrain from using personal information in them. I'll be honest and up-front with you: I donít follow any of the major film blogs. They are just too much like movies to me. I follow a few film blog that are less mainstream, but they are still pretty much just movie bloggers.I watch a lot of films. The first time I saw Star Wars was when I was in kindergarten. I was still really small, so I thought I would watch the movie over and over until it was over. In fact, I still think the original Star Wars is pretty good. I've also seen Indiana Jones in theatres, and it's great. In general, I like good action films, like The Bourne Identity, Lethal Weapon, The Sixth Sense, and Die Hard. I like fantasy, horror, romance, and adventure movies. I really enjoy horror films, especially ones where the atmosphere is suspenseful. In the mood for some good horror? I'll try The Purge: Anarchy, The Ring, The Shining, Saw, The Amityville Horror, The Exorcist, and Paranormal Activity.In general, you know what I think of new movies? I really hate them. It doesn't really matter what kind of movie it is, I hate all of it. But if it's good? I love it. I love anything that is interesting or original. I feel the best are those that are made with passion. There are no "gimmick" films. All of them are about something in general, and not something specific. I prefer films that are not about themselves. There is no such thing as a gimmick film. No one wants to watch a gimmick. All that crap. I'd rather watch a movie that is a masterpiece than a gimmicky movie, which usually is

View Original Post  Link to This Post  "Hey you, I'm sure we've all seen the movie (or have heard a little bit about it), but who is this kid that's got a movie star on his arm and he's gotta save the world?"  That's a great question. Let me start by saying, I wasn't a huge fan of the movie as a whole but I loved the main character - the kid who has some supernatural powers.   Let me just say that this movie is pretty damn well done. The actors really did a great job with their character and this was definitely one of the better action movies in the past ten years. The movie is kind of like a hybrid of "Superman Returns" with "Die Hard" and it kind of worked.   the film is set in the year 2010 and the story follows a young kid (Jake Gyllenhaal) who was living in a trailer park near Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. He was adopted by the family of a billionaire named John Paul (Michael Pena) who happens to be a nuclear physicist. He lives in a home which has a large swimming pool.     Jake has been taking a lot of abuse from the rich kids and the bullies. One day, his life takes a major turn when a boy, named Mike (Ethan Hawke) saves Jake's life. He then uses his powers to change the world. Jake's new friend (Miles Teller) then takes his place and they go to rescue another boy, Matt (Ben Affleck), who has been attacked by his own people, the Native Americans.  , directed by Paul W.S. Anderson.The film does a good job at making its main character, Jake, very relatable, without giving him a lot more personality than he already had. He does get to experience some pretty serious stuff in the film but it does feel a little overdone, especially with the ending. The story is not bad but it is certainly not groundbreaking and definitely feels like a film that could've used a lot less attention and direction. The acting in this movie was pretty damn good all around. Ethan Hawke (who plays Jake) did a phenomenal job and his character really became a lot stronger as

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ (This article is published in the "Awards and Accolades" issue of the magazine and is available in print from the "Flicks & Prose" bookstore, 1625 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.)  ___________________   by John Carrigan  As a professional journalist, I've written a lot of positive reviews. In the business of writing positive reviews, you're expected to write about good movies. This often means you'll write about movies you like—good and bad—in a positive way. I believe that in my job I can provide readers with a broad view of cinema, not confined to just the latest big-budget box office blockbuster. In this spirit, I'm offering my own review of "The Other Side of the Door," the directorial debut of acclaimed independent director Chris Chileff. In addition to taking us through his career from New York to Los Angeles and San Diego, Chilef's film contains some powerful scenes that challenge viewers to rethink the way they look at life and the universe.  In a way, "The Others" begins as a romantic comedy, with the titular character (J.K. Simmons) a young man on the prowl who has to fight through various obstacles to fulfill his dream of living in Los Angeles, California. After the end credits roll, however, we discover the whole thing is a lie, and Simmons is actually a ghost who can only appear to be a human man.  is not a movie about a single protagonist, but rather about how the characters change and grow over the course of a year—the time period from which the film is set. The story follows three other people—two actors (Kevin Bacon and James Brolin) and a poet (Mark Ruffalo) who live in the same house on the same street in L.A. This arrangement gives us the opportunity to observe how the people change, which may or may not be relevant to the plot. , is in fact a movie that explores some difficult subjects, like mental illness, the perils of living life in L  California, and the limits of one's physical boundaries. At one point, Simmons's character becomes very depressed and begins to wander the city, looking for love, and finds it. Later, while attempting to return to his home in New York, he ends up in a parking lot and runs into another "The Stranger"—one of

The following posters were also posted to this page  MOVIE THREATS! I recently saw [url="http://thedolls.uk/"]Dead Tide[/url], a film I loved, but was disappointed with. It seemed to be a film that had a lot of potential, but as it turned out, didn't quite live up to its billing. I think it's the weakest film in the [url_link]Dead Tide franchise[/url]. I'd recommend you check it out as it's a nice addition to the [b]Dead Tides[/b] series (you might be wondering what's with all these new sequels to the Dead Tides franchise? Well it turns out there's a whole slew of films under this banner!)  [size=2][i]DEEP THRILLERS[/i][/size]  If you are considering a deep thrill-ride, there are a few things you should know. First, it's probably going to be rated R. As always, take everything we say with a grain of salt and always watch with your head on straight. Second, it probably won't be safe for you to drive home from the theatre.

Through the help of a local girl, who becomes the group's guide, they learn the whereabouts of a military compound. When the boy starts speaking, he brings back an old memory.

I saw it for the first time last year, and then re-watched it during last weekend's Black Tie premiere, when it became clear I'd never seen it before. I thought the first part, which was about four hours long, was great, with its mix of thriller, suspense, and romance. It felt very different from the other films I've seen in the genre. As I mentioned in my review of the movie, I felt the ending was somewhat unsatisfying, but I was also happy with the first two parts of the film, where it was more adventurous. The story took an interesting turn with the second part, but it was still fun and it made for a better movie than I originally gave it credit for. This is also a great example of how a small movie can have a large impact on the medium in which it's presented.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ This movie was excellent, and I'd recommend it to all who can stand it, if not for its plot. That said, it's a solid romp that's full of memorable performances from some very good actors. The movie is an example of how good acting can complement the story very well, and that's one of the major reasons I'm giving this movie four stars. (Although I'd say two. I loved a bit where the film played a joke on its audience, but then had the audience go along with it so that the joke was on the audience and not the character who was trying to make the joke). This film is one of those examples of a film I've loved since I was a child, and it's still one of my favorites. ___________________________________________  "It's about time, isn't it?" - the title of the movie. The title of this movie is a reference to a line in the movie where the director asks "Where's the plot?" and then the actress replies with "There isn't any plot, is there?" The answer to that is a resounding NO, there isn't a plot in this movie. This is not a story. This movie is simply a series of short, silly jokes (which I suppose one could call shorts) where the audience is expected to have a good laugh at some point. This film does a great job of establishing the premise in a very brief amount of time. The idea is that the cast is going to go on a trip to New York and try to win a bet that a local writer had. I'm not really sure how that works, but the plot doesn't really matter, because it's the sort of short that can be told quickly, so the film's characters and ideas are pretty easy to get attached to. What I like most about this film is that it makes you feel like you're on a journey of discovery in some way. That's pretty hard to do when the entire film is nothing but silly gags, but this movie does a good job of showing you that you are being treated like a character and that you'll be treated like one. _________________________________________________________________________________________________  The film starts off with an extremely catchy music theme. I love the song and it just makes me smile. It goes:   If you are happy, you are wrong  And if you are proud, you're wrong ... It also gives the film a very

It's an extremely well-made movie with great acting and cinematography, that is not boring. The story of the main character in this movie is very well presented, the story is very dark but the movie does not focus on that. There is not only a story but also a lot of other things happening in the movie, so you can easily find it interesting. The ending of the movie is wonderful, the last part is very clever and gives a hint to the ending of this movie, you will love it.  _____________________________________  Top 5 favorite movie quotes: __________________________________ "It's about as good as it gets for a film that I don't remember at all" - John Waters  - I have seen this movie many times in the theaters, so I think I was a big fan of the book as well, it was good for my nerves. So, it's about time we saw this movie together.  for the first time, this movie does something different from the book, and the first thing that I noticed was the voice of the lead character, is that of "Tim Robbins" from the movie "Whip It." And the main difference is that this character is much more complex in the book. The book is about a woman who, after being taken into a cult and having many horrific experiences, is forced to kill herself. In the movie the character is a guy, he is a member of the cult and he is forced into killing himself.  the movie gave me the best experience ever, this film is very good for the audiences, it really made me want to see it again and again. It is not a masterpiece but it is a well made movie, great performances and a dark ending. . - by Kevin  It is about something really weird, really disturbing and really, really beautiful, The Lobster is like a story that you don't know how it ends, it is about what happens when you're made to see what you're not supposed to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Brief intermission, then the main event begins" 5.  It is not just the quality of a film but the way the director is directing the film The best film is the one which is very well-directed, by one who knows how to keep a film interesting and how to convey an emotional reaction. There are films which are so well-done, they can inspire and motivate you and make you want to watch more. This is why a film can be so inspiring and entertaining that even if it is boring and even if you find the dialogue or dialogues to be rather dull, the film itself is worth watching. A good film will keep you in suspense and on the edge of your seat. In a thriller like "The Last Samurai", it has the power to shock you to the core. If you don't like the way a film is being made, it can actually inspire you and give you the motivation to go back and watch the same film with different directors and different stories. It is one thing to enjoy a film and quite another to be inspired to make your own film or a better one. You will learn how to make a film, but it takes time and dedication. There are great filmmakers out there, who have already done it all. I am not saying that all the films they make are bad but they are not as good as a film by someone like Jean-Luc Godard or Orson Welles. 5 things to watch out for 1.    A lack of interest in the main characters The first thing to note about "The Force Awakens" is that Han Solo is nowhere to be found.  The only character left alive in the film is Kylo Ren, and this character is a complete dolt.   He is a pompous, self-important, egotistical moron who seems to think that everything he does is the right way, even though it's the exact opposite.  The reason why the characters in "The Phantom Menace" don't get any attention at all is because there are more interesting characters in the first part of the movie.  I can't really think of any good reason why this film doesn't get more attention, even if the plot is rather pointless.  There are also some interesting characters to keep an eye on in the sequel to "The Empire Strikes Back", but none of them are Han Solo, who is still nowhere to ever

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ What's so great about a movie? I'm not so much interested in the technical aspect of a movie, I just want to sit down, sit back and have a great time. And the movies I have enjoyed the most this year are "The Good Dinosaur", "The Lego Movie", "X-Men: Days of Future Past", "Pitch Perfect 2", "Straight Outta Compton" and "Frozen". If you want to share your thoughts, don't be afraid to write in! It's okay to share what you're passionate about. I know that I've never actually seen "The Martian" (I thought it was okay), and I can't wait to check it out. If you've read this far, I'd like to send you a copy of this month's "Shazam!" comic. Thank you for reading and thank you for being a fan. If there's any future news, follow @Shazbot_Movies. If not, I wish you all the best, and if you do have any suggestions for me, please feel free to tell me. My next project will be a sequel to "Bourne" (which is already in the works) and another superhero film. Stay tuned, we'll be back in 2017.  Thanks again to my wife, Laura for the wonderful photographs.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________ This one's a good, classic horror, the kind that's fun to watch with your kids. It's not quite as gory or disturbing as The Omen, but it's got all the right elements to make it one of the best. It follows a young couple, Mary and Robert, who move from Kansas to a secluded area of Illinois and settle into a seedy little town. While the couple is there, a series of strange and terrifying events occur, involving the local hospital, a local school, and a townspeople who are also local to this part of Illinois. These events are connected by the town's strange and mysterious priest, Father John, and by the mysterious spirit that inhabits the old house in which the couple lives. The best part of the movie, however, is the ending. When we see the house as Mary and Bob arrive, we see that it's just a small, plain room with one window in it. After they get out the back door, and they turn to look behind them, they suddenly see something, but just as they're about to investigate it, the house begins to shake, the windows begin to shake and it's clear that something is about to happen. When Mary looks up, we get a close-up of an enormous figure peering through the window...and a very disturbing, blood-curdling scream comes from it...that's when we cut to the priest screaming...and that's when it's over. That's not a surprise. What's surprising, is that this movie gets so much better as it progresses, even after a couple of dull, unexciting first half. It makes us wonder whether this is a classic of its type or just another one of those old movie that's forgotten. __________________  A great film for all ages. It would be great to see it on a VHS player. ~Bert  http://www.angelfire.com/thefilm/the-movie/

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ http://www.goodmoviequotes.com/quotes/buddhist_chap_1.html - July 22, 2007Great Quote  Reviewer: mazur - favorite favorite favorite - April 11, 2007  Subject: A lot of "I-told-you-so's" about the Buddha. One of the most popular biographies of the Buddha is written by a non-Buddhist writer named W. T. Suzuki. For the most part, the work is pretty solid, but I do have to raise a few criticisms of it. The author was an ardent Buddhist for a long time, but later turned against it. In the 1980's, Suzuki wrote a book called Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind which is a critique of Buddhism as a whole. There's also this book: The Heart of Buddhism by K. Ikeda. It's full of what I call "I told you so's" but is pretty well written and, as Suzuki has acknowledged, quite critical of Zen and many other Buddhist doctrines.   As for the Buddha himself, there's a passage in The Way of the Bodhisattva in which he says that "Buddhism is a religion that has lost its meaning." In other words, it's fallen into the trap of trying to convert everyone to its faith without really addressing their issues. That's not to say that all or even most of the followers of the Buddhist faith are bad, but there's definitely a problem in that it's trying to cover a lot of ground but failing to get to the core of what matters.   the Buddha never came up with the idea of a permanent self. When asked what we really are, he says we are impermanent and changeable.   is the Buddha, but he never said that the mind is impermanent. He did say, however, that it can be overcome by the path to enlightenment.   of course, the Buddha also did say that there's no true self, but that's because of his own misunderstanding of what self actually is. What's true is that our thoughts, actions, beliefs, etc. are the "I" that we are, not some sort of permanent, unchanging thing. The idea of self was developed by the Buddhist monks in the first centuries of Buddhism. They called their mental activities "Klesa," which meant something like "self-nature." They claimed that all thoughts, feelings, and behavior

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good Girl" (2006) starring Emily Blunt as a teenage runaway who runs away from home only to be pursued by her abusive stepfather (Robert Pattinson).  Blunt was in a tough spot: she had to play a young girl in a much older man's body, and in the film's most memorable scene, she plays a confused teenage girl who has to choose between her stepfather and the man she loves (the character was originally played by Justin Timberlake). The film made $50 million in its opening weekend, which was the largest opening weekend of Blunt's career and put the film in the conversation for best picture. (Blunt also starred in the musical "The Proposal.") The Good Wife: "Teddy" (2008) was a huge success for NBC, with the series-wide ratings average of 15.6 million viewers, making it the most popular program on the network since The Cosby Show and the largest audience for a broadcast series on NBC since The Apprentice. (It also did even better than the number of viewers that The West Wing got the previous season, which also did the highest ratings of its last season.) The ratings were helped by the fact that the show was the most highly rated series in its time slot, and even more so by the high-stakes courtroom drama aspect of the show. The Good Wife was not the most-watched drama in its season, however, with The Walking Dead being its top competitor. The series was nominated for three Emmy awards, including Outstanding Drama Series. The Sopranos: The Sopranoff family was the focus of The Soprano's most recent series, and the show's fifth season concluded with the final showdown between Tony and his father (James Gandolfini), who was gunned down in an underground parking lot in his own driveway in a case of mistaken identity. The Soprodos also had one of the most successful theatrical releases in the history of television, with nearly 80% of the sales of The Da Vinci Code being DVD copies, as was the case with the previous five seasons, in addition to a huge number of Blu-ray releases. Star Trek: Enterprise: This was the fourth TV series that Trekkers had to endure in the years prior to The Next Generation. The Enterprise had one hit season in its first five years of existence, but was canceled after three seasons (it was actually renewed for a fourth and fifth season, but those were never broadcast).

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  "I'm from the future, and it's full of bad guys"   Tristan is a librarian and is looking for something. It seems the library is filled with things that could potentially be very valuable but could be very dangerous to get your hands on. In this case, it is a copy of the book "A Brief History of Time" by Stephen Hawking and the only copy left.   However, Stephen Hawking is not known for his caution and a team of scientists are sent in to steal the book in the hopes that it could reveal the secret to eternal life. However, once they get to the library they discover the book is missing and instead are presented with a very old computer system that can only be accessed with a specific key.  , the new novel from the author of A Brief History Of Time, is an absolutely delightful adventure and is a must read. If you like sci-fi, science, adventure, and humor then you will definitely want to pick up this one up. I can safely say that this is one of my favorite novels of the year and it is definitely going to be on my list of all time favorites for many years to come. I have read all of the books in this series so far, and I can honestly say I have seen the future. This is the kind of sci-fantasy I have been looking for for the last few years and has definitely surpassed all of my expectations. I really cannot say enough good things about this book. A Brief history of Time is an awesome novel and a must have for anyone who loves sci-fiction and fantasy. I highly recommend picking up a copy and reading it as soon as possible. You will not be disappointed. I would like to give a big shout out to my favorite author Stephen King for being so gracious and letting me post this review on his website. He is one awesome dude.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It makes the movie a whole lot better, no matter what its quality.  This is very important.    Write a negative review about bad movies:    This is a lot like telling someone to go to a movie that they think they're not going to like, and make up some excuse as to why it's not going well.  Write about bad TV:  If you're a person who watches TV shows, and you have some sort of negative opinion of something, or even if you like it, you can always write about it.   Don't tell people about your feelings:  This is the same as above, but telling people something that you don't want them to know about, or don't need them to hear.  If your feelings have not been expressed, it will come across as rude, even if they're completely justified. Write for an online forum:  Again, this is the opposite of "telling people about my feelings".  This isn't a person you are supposed to share your feelings with, but the online community is a very large one, and can be very interesting.  It's also the easiest way to get comments on your story, which is extremely important. Be a part of a band:  Being a musician has become so important to me, and I've spent a lot of time on my computer trying to learn more about it, so it has to be done.  I've tried to get some feedback from bands on Facebook, and if I don't get any, I just go ahead and make it my life's work. Watch movies you've never seen:  It doesn't have to be a big movie, but watching movies you haven't seen before, just to see if the people who do the writing have a good handle on how to write, is really helpful.  Of course, there are also good movies that are really good, but they're also so hard to get into, that they're almost useless, unless you're really passionate about them. If you're going to try writing a book, then the last three things must be taken into account.  Here are the steps that I have taken to get this far. 1. Find a new way to think about writing:  To find out what writing is, is to find out where I'm getting stuck.  At the moment, I feel like I'm writing a lot, but I don to

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "If you think that the story is interesting and the acting is good then the movie should be a good experience." I love movies that are so bad that they're good.  I think there is a place for that kind of movie.  a film is good because the story and the film itself are good. I love watching movies that really need no explanation or context.   The best movie of the last few years has been Mad Max: Fury Road.  Fury Road was so bad, it was great.  It's just so unbelievably bad, I've never had that kind in my life.  I think that is a good way to describe what The Conjuring 2 is.  Posted by Chris Dues at 5:42 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Let's see if it makes the critics' list. 5. "I Saw the Light" - Director Ava DuVernay This is Ava's latest project and I am really looking forward to this film.   I love Ava and I've seen her other films as well (Selma, which won an Oscar, and 13th, which had an Oscar-nominated soundtrack).  This will be a great film to see on the big screen.   And I think there will be no shortage of "I saw the light" films to come from her.  6. "Bridges of Madison County" - Producer/Director James Ponsoldt This could be the first real box office success for James Pon soldt.   He is a director I've been following for a while, having followed his works on Selma, in particular.   His films are not always the greatest, but they are always well-made and interesting.   But when I saw that he had adapted this book (by Michael Crichton) to the big-screen, I knew that it would be a good one.   We've heard many good things about this one, but when I watched it, I wasn't blown away like I expected.   Maybe because I'm a little too used to the book.   It's still a very well-produced film. 7. "Loving" - Actress Patricia Arquette We are only 2 years into the LGBTQ Rights Movement, but I think it's still too soon to talk about equality.   Let's not forget that in the early 1960's, gay people were put in camps and killed, and it's been almost 40 years since.   Patricia Arqeeter, the actor who portrays L.A. Police Sergeant Maggie Loomis, had the courage to say she is a lesbian and she wanted to make a film about her life.   The film is not a "gay drama" but rather about a police officer's love and dedication to her job.   There are a lot of scenes that are graphic, but the film is never preachy or preachy at the same time.   She has been a pioneer for the LGBTQ Community. 8. "Gravity" - Writer/Director Alfonso Cuaron One of the most anticipated films of the year, Gravity is an epic space epic that will be out in October.   A few people said that I didn't like Gravity

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________  5. The Big Lebowski (1998)  What's the best joke in any movie: "There's no such thing as a free lunch" (Jeff Bridges in The Big Chill, 1993).  Why does it work: The Dude doesn't just say it, he lives it. In the first two scenes of The Big LEBOWSKI, a man buys an all-you-can-eat buffet in the park and gets his friends to come over, because, you know, who doesn't like a good buffet. At the time, the man's name was Hank Hill. By the time you're done with the second scene, it's obvious that "the Dude" is the man who's been playing this role for the past two decades. The movie is a classic for the fact that the Dude can't stop talking about his life. He gets up in the middle of the night to chat with people at a café, walks home while it's light out, and sits on a park bench for hours. Every bit of the Dude's life is about to be ruined. The Dude: Dude, what's wrong with you?  The Dude: (as Jeff Bridges) I'm sorry, Dude, I really can't answer that question.  Dude: So I don't get it, Dude. Why can't you just sit back and enjoy it? I mean, this isn't exactly a bad movie, is it?  the Dude: It's a good one, but...it's not perfect.  (Jeff, who's clearly been drinking, leaves) ....but it's not a bad one. . (Dude tries to make the best of the situation, but then the camera cuts to an open window and we hear a woman crying. Jeff hops out of bed and walks outside. The camera follows him for a while, but he doesn't talk to the woman and eventually disappears into the shadows.)  —(The Dude is asleep on the couch when the scene cuts back to the Dude, who is in bed and looking out the window. He takes off his shirt, revealing that he has tattoos of the word BICYCLE in large block letters on his chest. The scene cuts to him and the Dude drinking and smoking at a bar. As he continues, the scene shows the Dude talking on the phone to his girlfriend and her mom, talking about things like how it

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________   My review of "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" (2014) has been up for the past 2 weeks.   It is an exciting movie. I'm an advocate for all the apes to live. It was an idea that has been in my head for the last 2 years.   Headed for a sequel. I think they should try to make it as exciting as the first. It's just great.   be warned, there are some great scenes here, but it's very fast paced. I was watching the movie after a heavy snowfall and it wasn't very long. It seemed as if they spent most of their time on the ape character. He's like a man trapped in a monkey body. The idea behind the movie is well thought out and I like it. You get to learn a lot about the apes, and what their past is, while they are being terrorized.  . I got to know the apes. It is interesting how their behavior changed, and they actually did evolve. They grew, changed, but their minds kept changing. As time goes on it seems like more ape's are born, the females seem to grow more stronger. It takes a while for the males to start changing.  : I was a little disappointed that in the end it seems as if the ape's only want to live is to kill. Not a strong enough motivation. I like the idea of the apes becoming smarter with time. They started out very smart, now they seem very simple. They aren't very aggressive, it is more a battle of wills and they do what they have to to get to the goal.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ A film that makes me look forward to the next day.   In a way, this list is intended as a sort of "hope-and-change" list. I want to encourage all of us to do the right thing by the film we see on a given day. This isn't a list of the worst movies ever made, but rather, what movies are so great that we simply cannot ignore them.  , the greatest movie of all time. If there's ever a time for a big-budget, billion-dollar blockbuster to come out and flop, this is it. I've heard that it's also the worst film ever made, so that's a pretty good thing.is the movie that brought the "Star Wars" saga to the big screen, and I think it's worth every penny of its $400 million budget just to see how much more of a mindfuck that film could be. It was a very complicated film to make, as director Richard Marquand spent months on the set doing extensive rewrites of the script, but in the end, it turned out to be one of the greatest films ever made. In a way it even eclipsed the film that is closest to being my favorite,, Stanley Kubrick's. And yetis the film I'll watch over and over and again.I like to think that the reason I still watchhas been for the same reason I was fascinated by Kubrick's film: that it manages to combine the complexity of a classic science-fiction film with the simplicity of a family film, both of which work together wonderfully.is a wonderful film about two young brothers who become extremely close, while their parents are separated in a tragic car accident. The brothers eventually fall in love with each other, and their parents move in together. One day, when their parents return, their parents realize that the two of them don't have enough money for food, and they both fall seriously ill. Meanwhile, their mother has her own problems; she's suffering from cancer, and she wants to commit suicide. Her younger brother is willing to go through with it to save her, but first she's going to tell him everything. It's not long before the brothers have decided on a very risky plan to pay for the food and medicine for their parents. That is, however, until they realize that their parents' divorce papers are stuck in a drawer somewhere, and, to add insult to injury, the divorce papers give their parents

Now I want a bigger car, a nice apartment and lots of money for Christmas, because I am on the way to making my biggest movie yet". The movies are too safe and tame for a man to want to do. I think a woman in that situation would be very happy to have any man she wants in her life. I can imagine how she would be thrilled to get a man who has made two or three good movies, is not a pushover and a good provider.   One thing to keep in mind, though, is that a woman would never dream of being a lead in a movie. She knows that her movie would probably not get a good response and she would have to do the heavy lifting in the story.  , a great example of a woman leading a film is Julie Christie in "Tangled". While the role was her most famous film, she also played the wife of her character in the same movie. It should be noted that she was one of the first leading ladies in a comedy and had a few laughs with her lines. She did more than just "stunt double". She was a serious actress who played the woman she was playing in her movies, and that was a big step for women at the time. I don't think women would be led in the future unless there were a very strong female actor. For a man, you might be able to be a leading man in an action film, but I can't imagine why a woman wouldn't be a top star in a dramatic film. I would have thought that the biggest problem would be to get her husband into it. A lot of women would kill to have a successful marriage. Logged  Cecil  Get big!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ So the movie I just watched is based on a book.  The book, as far as I can tell, is mostly just a collection of short stories written by someone who goes by the pseudonym Mark Harris.   It's hard to imagine a better title for a novel. _________________________________ The movie is based heavily on the book Mark Harris wrote when he was 17 years old.  _________________________________  I did not read the book. But the movie really gets me through the movie.  (It also makes it easier to ignore the book entirely if you are going to read it, which I will not do.)  The film is based more on the first half of the book, and I like that.  And a lot of the actors are really good.  The film is also funny.  That is important, I think, to make the film work.  I think if a film is not funny, it will just make the viewer feel that everything is a pain in the ass.  But this film is really funny. The story is interesting.  At the same time the book is an interesting combination of things, not just the usual school/military stuff.  It was really hard to follow the story. But when you finally do, you realize that the story is really a good one.  There is some really cool stuff here.  If you like war movies, this movie might be good for you.  You really have to watch this movie, but if you do, I have to say it is a really good one, and it will make you laugh.  What I loved the most was the dialogue.  As the main character, I like the way the characters talk.  They speak their minds and sometimes even think out loud.  Even the movie's main antagonist has some funny lines. I think it's a really solid war film.  For those who like to see a movie about a bunch of kids fighting some war, this will be a good choice.  In all seriousness, this is a good film, and there are some nice moments.  This will be my second time watching it, and probably my third.  My first time with it was in 2009.  A friend, who is a veteran of Afghanistan and the Iraq War, was at my house while I watched the movie, and we talked about the film for awhile.  So I thought I would do a review of

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________ I can't believe how good this movie is! This is one of those rare rare examples where they didn't overdo it in the special effects department, or the voice acting, or maybe it's just that this is so damn good that they're going to end up losing it all anyway, and if that were to happen it might make me feel a little better about the rest of the film. So this movie starts off pretty good: A young guy, called John (Cameron Diaz), goes to a remote mining facility called "Stork" on an assignment. Apparently, they've been running into problems with the ore that's being shipped there, so they've had to install a new security system (which I found out was in fact called "Blackbeard" and he is a villain) which requires a lot of expensive equipment. Also, they found some dead bodies in a mine shaft, which is why there was such a large security force around the place. But then a security guard breaks a hole in the ceiling, allowing the mine to pour out a water-slurry that's deadly. But, as you can probably guess, the mine has a lot more going on than just letting water pour out of a hole. It's kind of a high-tech version of Groundhog Day, but with a lot worse results. So, the security guards try to break the water into slurry again to try to stop the flow of water to the mine, which the miners (who are named "Slimy" and "Jellyfish" and they are voiced by a hilarious duo named Tom and Jerry) don't want to let happen. But when they go down the stairs, they come across Slimy and Jellyfish, who are having a little argument because they both think that they are better than the other. In the end, Slimy wins because the security guard shoots himself in the chest. The mine goes on to spill water all over the city, and John is forced to make his way home via a tunnel. But Slimy keeps coming up with other ways to get to him and get him out of the way, which are more and more convoluted. They also have a chase scene where Slimy crashes a helicopter into John and they end up in a fight with a giant spider. The spider is so large that it gets in the helicopter and crashes it into a building, which makes it appear that it was hit by a train. But after the crash, Slim

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ The first review I ever wrote was about a film I never saw (and that's why I'll never write another). I'd heard enough about it to think it was a decent film and it wasn't until I watched it for myself that I realized I was a little out of my depth. Now I've seen and loved all the other films I've talked about in my writing, but I never could have predicted that The Room would end up the masterpiece it is. My friends would tell me I wasn't writing the right reviews, and I had to point them to the "original" review, but that was years ago and the review has now fallen into relative obscurity. In an effort to see how The Room might fare today, I contacted the writer to ask if I could republish it for posterity. He graciously gave me permission and, after all these years, The Room still holds up amazingly well. It's a terrific piece of work and I recommend it to anyone. Here it is: THE ROOM (1995) I knew this was going to be a special review. It was the one I'd spent the most time thinking about. I'm sure you have as well. I knew it was the most ambitious piece of writing I'd ever done. I wasn of the opinion that the film was a masterpiece. I was so confident I was going into the review that I was sure that my review would be the one that had been printed by every major film website on the internet. I also knew that no matter what happened I was not going to stop writing about The Room. The Room was a dream I'd always had to write about and I didn't know what was going on or what the outcome would be. When I sat down to write this review, I knew there was no way to know how the rest of my life would change. I'd already spent so many years thinking about and studying The Room, so to be honest, I didn in fact have no idea how this review was going be different from my other reviews. So I sat on my review for almost two months. The pressure was building. It wasn't just the fact that I had no idea if the reviews I had written would ever be published or not. It is the fact of how much pressure was on me to create a review so impressive that would make this film a masterpiece that was so rare to find in the mainstream media. I had never done a review about an unknown film and I

Write a positive review about a good movie:  you know what you saw and what you liked about it.  You're now excited to see the next movie and want to hear more.  I was so excited to watch that I couldn't help but write a review!  (Don't get me wrong, there are still many good movies out there.    But what the "experts" and the studios have been doing for the past few years is to suppress good movies, and not allow us to have what's good.  And most of us don't watch big name movies and are looking for something that we can discover for ourselves on our own.) This one is actually a remake of a British film called "Ghost Town", which is a great movie too.     I just saw it last night on TV, and I can say with great confidence that I think this is the best version of the movie, with the actors who play the main characters.   The movie starts off with a good, old fashioned "race" between two groups of guys.  For me, this was a great way to introduce the movie.  This movie actually starts out with some nice old-school comedy scenes and shows the tension between these two groups before they get into the race.  As the movie progresses, the groups get closer and closer and the tension grows.  I'm glad the movie was set in the 1950's.  It really shows the true grit and terror of the 1950s in this movie. In this movie, the two main characters are a truck driver named George Smith (John Carradine) and his passenger, a little girl named Lulu (Margaret MacRae).  They are both on their way to a ghost town named "Flaming Town" for the annual annual "race".  The two friends meet a young boy named Danny (David McCallum), who they befriended, before they arrive.  After their encounter with Danny, they begin traveling down the road to "Flamming Town", when the road gets blocked by the army, who are searching for a missing American soldier named Ben (James Spader).  In the army car, they meet up with the truck driver George who is traveling with his son (David Warner).  George gets in an argument with the driver of the army truck when the driver threatens him to turn his truck around.  The driver then turns his truck towards them, and George attempts to back out, but the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ This should be easy. If you are a fan of a movie and you love it, then you will likely have a good opinion of the movie too. This is because, as we all know, negative reviews of movies don't hurt anything. The only thing that can happen when you write a negative review about an average movie is that other people can see it and come up with similar opinions. This happened to me a few years ago when I wrote a negative article about a movie in which I was an editor, called "Punisher", which I thought was awful. One day I was surfing the web and I came across an article about another movie called "My Own Private Idaho", which was a movie made by a guy named Robert Rodriguez, which was so good it was even nominated for a Oscar. So, I thought to myself, "Well, I guess Rodriguez wasn't that bad, because he made a decent movie. This should make me happy." And I thought so. When I saw "Punching Mall", I knew immediately that it was another of the movies I loved. I mean, I just didn't get it. I knew this was just a remake of a film I liked a few weeks ago, "Scary Movie", and even though I loved "Screeching Eagle", I couldn't really compare it to this movie. But it turns out, there is one big similarity between these two movies: they both contain a female hero. And that's what you'll find most of the time. The problem is, in both "PUNCHING MALL" and "My Private Idaho" the female hero is weak, useless and almost stupid. But I don't hate them for that. They're just like any other movie. The main problem I have with these movies is the way they try to create an interesting plot. This plot, as you might expect, is very basic. All the action takes place in a mall. The hero, played by Jennifer Lopez, falls in love with a nice guy, played, of course, by Brad Pitt. But they both keep bumping into each other and get into fights. Then the girl wants to leave, but the guy says no, he's staying in love, so they have to keep fighting, over and over and keep bump-n-bumping. The whole movie, like "Scare Movie", is just a story of two weak people who keep fighting and bumping against each other. The

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ Did this review help you?Do you want to submit a question to be answered later?  "The Day the Earth Stood Still" Review by John R. Haines of Colorado.  The Day The Earth Stayed Still was the second feature by director Steven Spielberg. It was released on August 14, 1975, and it was directed by Spielberg himself. It is a science-fiction adventure, which tells the story of a young man (Peter Fonda), and his dog (Cameron Diaz) as they set off on a journey to find a mysterious island. I am a huge fan of Steven Spielberg films, and I've seen many of them. I have seen A.I., Jaws, ET, War of the Worlds, E.T., The Goonies, and of course, Indiana Jones. So I was very interested in this film, and for the most part, it lived up to my expectations.   The movie opens with an opening title card which says that the film begins in 1977, and that the man who is narrating the opening scene, is none other than Steven Spielberg! Of course this was not the most important surprise for me, but I was happy that I was going to see this film because of Steven's previous works. In this case, Steven is portraying his own personal history with the space program. He is a scientist who started his career in the early 70s. He was the Director of Space Studies at MIT, and he was part of a group of scientists that came up with a plan to send an unmanned spacecraft to Mars in the mid 70s, but unfortunately, they were not able to land the spacecraft on Mars. Instead, they had to make do with landing the spacecraft in the ocean. Spielberg does a great job of creating his own version of that story in this movie, and while it is hard to believe that it took place over 40 years ago, it feels much more realistic to me in the end, and as a science fiction film it has a great deal of potential to really bring some attention to this subject matter.   and I will continue on to the actual review to talk more about the story that the movie tells.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ How is this review written? Let's see... I have to thank all of my commenters for pointing out some glaring errors or omissions in my previous reviews of films and shows. I was so busy, I forgot about it. So the good news is that I am doing this one right. The bad news is I'm doing it wrong. The reason for that is the fact that my notes are in a notebook and since I don't like making lists, I'll be doing the notes using words of my own choosing. This will probably result in a bit of wordiness, but I will be sticking to my guns and being as specific as possible. So enjoy, but don't get too attached.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The first few minutes of The Green Hornet, the movie that makes all the other bad films seem like something from a bygone era. In a scene where the title character is being beaten up in a bar, a patron points out a car parked by a side street, and tells us that the owner of that car was a former Marine. The character of Hawk (played by Michael Keaton) turns around and asks if the man is a real Marine, and he says yes. Hawk tells the man to get into his car and get out of there, and then he tells the other patrons to do the same. We then cut to a shot of Keaton in the car driving away, which seems to suggest that we are not supposed to take it seriously, just like the people who have been talking about movies for the last few paragraphs. The next scene is much better. In the same bar, another man, the one who told us about the Marine, asks the same question about the car. Hawk points out that it belonged to the guy who got the carjacker out of jail. And Hawk and the other patron then walk to the car together. The car is, of course, the same color as the man's car. They get into the car, and just as the movie starts we cut to the next scene, where Hawk is driving away in his new car. Now, the man that we saw on the bar stool is a man with the same name that Hawk said was a Marine. So, there you have it, folks, a good solid connection between Michael Keatons character and the real Michael Keates.  The next movie that I think would be a good addition to the collection is The Day After Tomorrow. This movie is set in the near future where, during the zombie apocalypse, the entire planet is covered in thick layers of concrete and is divided up into four zones. In one zone, the humans are living in houses made from steel and concrete and have weapons that are made of something I don't remember. There is also a guy living in the wall that was made up of concrete that goes up to the sky and out over the water, and that guy is wearing some kind of a helmet that covers his eyes. The film was directed by Roland Emmerich, who, in the past, has done other popular films such as Independence Day, Independence Day 2, and Independence Day 3. In The Day after Tomorrow, there is an interesting conflict
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ This is a movie I've watched over and over again. It starts out with an intro where the guys start to say how this movie is the best and then it has its own little comedy bit where the two guys try to go to a party and they all talk about how weird and awesome it is. The film then picks up with them in an airport, being asked what their favorite movie is by the girl they're going to hook up with. They both go with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and as soon as they start talking about it, we cut to a couple of scenes of Harry's parents getting arrested and how they had to leave the country. That was the start of the movie. We then see Harry Potter standing on a train to school and as he is talking to the girl he thinks he's about to have sex with, he asks her if she has a boyfriend, she does and he's shocked. This doesn't mean he's mad at her, he's not really mad at anything. He's just like "who cares?" and the rest of the film proceeds to follow him doing what he was going to do anyway. The plot is really simple. Harry and the girl end up hooking up at a party, they go back to his flat to watch movies. He asks her about her boyfriend and she says "No". She tells him the best way to get him to go out with her is to go around to other girls' houses and ask them if they want to go with them and she goes back to her apartment and talks about what the guys should be thinking as they leave her house to go hook up and the guys are like "What are you talking about?" And she's like "Oh yeah, she wanted to go see Harry and he started telling me about the wizard world and it was pretty neat". They leave the apartment and she ends up going to a wizard party and as she leaves, she sees Harry in his invisibility cloak. As soon as the girl sees him, she starts to get nervous and when she realizes he is an actor, she is scared of him, but he just looks back at her with a smile and starts telling her about the world of wizards. She starts feeling better about herself after he starts showing her all the cool stuff he does and then she gets invited to his school to meet with his classmates and it all just goes downhill from there. In the end, he ends up doing what she asked of him (

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  This movie was a huge disappointment. I was expecting something awesome, something that could challenge the likes of "The Hunger Games" and "The Twilight Saga", and "X-Men" and even "Titanic". Instead, I got a big dumb mess of a movie that was nowhere near as good as the hype seemed to suggest.   I saw the trailer on youtube before it was even released. I really didn't want to watch it because I couldn't stop laughing. It seemed like a complete joke. The actors were terrible and the plot was so stupid that the ending seemed to have been made up in the editing room. The acting was so bad that some of the lines were almost inaudible and the camera was so slow it looked like the actors were acting through the entire scene. And what was even worse was that there were so many plot holes I found myself trying to piece together the whole movie just so I could figure out what the hell happened. It was so ridiculous that I can't even begin to make sense of the plot.   of course the ending makes no sense either because it was just made up by the writers. And when they said that they had to make a lot of plot holes to make the movie more exciting, they did a damn good job of making them. They even made up so many ridiculous things that it's hard to even describe the sheer insanity of everything that happens. I guess you could call it a cult film because the plot makes no more sense than any other cult film. The most bizarre thing was when they tried to pass off a character as the main character in one scene, and then he turned out to be the evil genius in another. I mean, how crazy can you get? And then there were the really lame lines like when he says "I will be back" in the third act. He never did return and even the director admits he was only there to provide some comic relief.  . I had to cut out the first two acts to make room for the "action" and I don't know what the fuck is going on.   The only thing that kept it from being a total disaster was that I thought the ending was at least cool. But the way it was resolved was so dumb it's almost a joke. But when you think about it, you have to realize that it was the writer's idea of a satisfying ending. He wanted it to be really, really dark and mysterious, so it

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  I just finished watching The Girl on the Train in the U.S. The film was amazing, the performances were outstanding, the story was well told, and the performances by Anne Hathaway, Rooney Mara, and Jessica Chastain were a delight to watch.  But after seeing it, I was left a bit disappointed with the ending. It was very easy to see how the film would end, however, and there was really no good way to salvage the ending, especially because it feels so forced. I would have been more than happy with the film if it had kept going a bit longer, and if it made it to the big finish with a satisfying resolution. I thought the plot was very good, and I really enjoyed the film, but it was really hard to finish. , it would make me want to watch a few more good films with my partner, rather than another one that has to be rushed. I have read other reviews complaining about this ending. I think some people may have just gotten a bad copy, but I think they need to read more reviews before making their decision.  with a good ending. While I don't think The Girl On The Train was bad, I think it should have been slightly different. I just wish there had been a better way for it to end. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good thriller. In Conclusion: ____________________________  Overall: ___________________________________  of this review, I rate The Girl in the Train at a 4.5 out of 5.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Why did you Like it: __________ I don't have a big problem with "the audience," as it is a common expression. However, a great part of this movie has to do with the story it tells. It's a good premise, but not a perfect one. I'd like to see a better script and even better direction. The acting is pretty good too, though there are some that seem a bit forced. The music is pretty decent, especially the ending theme. What Didn't Work: ______________________________________________________ I don a lot of movie posters. That's because most movies don't get their proper props. While this movie definitely deserves to be on there, it's a little underplayed. What didn't work was the fact that the ending felt like a cheat. They could have made the ending much more climatic. That way, the movie would not be as short. I liked that we did get more of a climax, though. I just don't understand why they felt the need to ruin it. Overall: _____________________ If you've seen the movie, I'm sure you're wondering if it's worth watching. The short answer is YES! The longer answer is something along the lines of "Maybe." The premise is good and the story does have a good twist. The character development was also good. It just didn't do anything for me. The action scenes weren't amazing either. The best part of the movie was when it was all over and it had a happy ending.

Subscribe to Fathoms Deep        Apr 18, 2017 at 11:15PM   This is my favorite scene from 'The Fifth Element' and the scene I believe will go down in the film as one of the greatest and best scenes of all time. It features Leeloo (Geena Davis), an alien who has been separated from her own race. When she arrives on earth she finds the planet completely covered with creatures and she is drawn to human civilization for the first time. This is a scene in which the film makes a choice, it makes an exception for Leelah Alcorn (Jennifer Connelly), a young woman who committed suicide because of the discrimination she experienced in her community, and it allows us to see Leeloh in an entirely new light. She is not a helpless victim, but a person capable of doing something to protect herself and others from violence. This isn't Leelous's first encounter with violence and the scenes that precede her appearance with the alien in the supermarket demonstrate her skills at avoiding and hiding. She was taught to be very good at dodging bullets and the filmmakers even show her doing this on several occasions throughout the movie. We see her dodge her way through a group of thugs who are chasing her, she is able to hide and find cover until the aliens arrive, she saves her friends when they are in danger, and we even see her evade one of her attackers. While it is the first scene of the film and not the best, it is one of Leel's earliest scenes and it proves just how good Leel is.  Leelah is the strongest character in 'The Dark Knight Rises' and is perhaps one of Nolan's strongest protagonists since Batman. She can take down some of the bad guys without even trying but more often than not she chooses to wait until she is right in front of them and attack. In 'The Prestige' I think it was her role in the torture chamber in which she freed a young man that drove Nolan to write her as the most complex character in his films. The film opens with her trying to protect an imprisoned Bruce Wayne from his enemies but eventually her actions have a major impact on him. It is interesting to see how she takes control of Bruce

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ This movie is fun and funny! It's about a group of people who make a living by building houses. The idea is really stupid (you can't make a decent living in a house with a TV and a bathroom), but the movie does a good job of using the stupid ideas to create a comedy. It also uses its stupidity in the best way possible. A few of the jokes are genuinely funny and the characters are funny. The movie is funny all the way through and there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. There is also a strong romance at the end of the movie, which I appreciated as I don't really like romances. The music in the movie is really good and fits the tone perfectly. The best thing about this movie is that there is no dialogue. There are no "Oh my god, I'm going to die" or "I hope this movie doesn't kill me!" moments. They're funny just because the characters and the way they speak is hilarious.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  The best way to do this is to read the movie description. Then make a list of movies that are similar in subject matter, and watch the one that comes closest to what you want to see. It's best to start with a movie that you have watched before, as you will see the similarities in tone, atmosphere, and ideas. If you are not sure what to see, you should watch something that you've seen several times before. There is a reason that most people are hooked on film.  If you are having trouble deciding on which movie to watch, try to figure out what type of movie you want. What do you like to see in movies? Is it a romantic movie, a thriller, or a comedy? Do you like action or drama, and what do you want out of it? Are you a movie fan or a film viewer? If you can't think of any good reasons to see this movie, then you will probably be disappointed. A film that you like is different than a film that is good. There are some genres that are only as good as the film that made them popular. You may not like some films, but you'll love some that are just too good to pass up. If your favorite movies don't interest you, then try some of the ones that are more in-between. If the best film of the year is about a romance between two teens, and you prefer action movies, then why not give it a shot? Don't worry about not liking some of them, you may not care for them anyway. A film can never be bad, just not good enough. (I know that there are some people who love films that I don't like, but I would have given up on watching those before I even got to see it, because I knew it wouldn't be the film I wanted it to be.)

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   __________ Write a negative review about an awful movie:   I have a huge thing for cheesy movies and I love the cheesy stuff. It's the reason I like the Star Trek movies so much, even though I don't always like them. But I am a fanboy and that includes the movies I like to see.  The thing is, I love cheesy movies too, I just hate that cheesy. That's why I like good, not great. If something was so bad, I would want to skip it and watch something else. But if it's good and makes you feel good, why not watch it?  That's why it's a huge problem when people criticise a good film for not being good enough. I don''t want people criticising films they love. I want people to be happy about seeing a movie they loved. I just want to be able to watch Star Trek and not feel like I'm going to die.  as I said before, if you like something but it sucks, that's what you should avoid at all cost. I am more forgiving than that. I can't help it though, sometimes I don' t want to like something. I feel the urge to love something and I hate the way it makes me feel. I hate when someone tells me something I don�t want to hear. If I were an Alien fan I'd be saying the same thing. So it's easy to see why I'm so annoyed when people say things like "This movie sucked!" or "That movie was boring!" That makes me think, "What is wrong with you!"  I'm going against a lot of convention and what we usually think is cool. When we tell people that we like something, we usually say that we haven't liked anything before that we loved. That means that we have to hate it to be willing to like it. And that makes sense, but it's wrong. When I watched the movie Star Trek in the 80s I didn't love it and I still don't love the movie. I have watched it so many times now and I never grew to love it. That doesn't mean that it isn't a good thing to watch. I think it's one of my favourite movies of all time. It had me hooked from the very first time I saw it. There's no doubt that Star Trek had an impact on my life. It was a huge influence on me as
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I would have liked to have seen more of the plot. A lot of people don't know that they were going to die, they're just told that they will, and then the person who is supposed to be the hero shows up. I don't remember anything about the movie other than that the hero was a soldier. I liked the movie though, a lot. It was the first movie I ever watched in color. I have a friend who was very depressed about something, and when I told him I watched the movie he told me that it had saved his life. I didn't watch it with him after that, it was too painful. The movies that he liked to watch were the horror movies. I also watched a lot of movies about the people who worked on the war. I wanted to know how the guys worked and where they were. The movie, "The Last of the Mohicans" was about the soldier. It had great acting. I really enjoyed watching it. It is a very long movie and it is a war movie, so there is a lot going on. When I watch a movie I am always looking for what happened after the credits roll. You just want to find out what the heroes did. I guess I was looking for the ending to the movie. I still don't understand how that movie was made. I watched a few more movies after that. I saw "The War Wagon", "Tough Guys" and "Lonesome Dove". I watched all of them with my brother who is now a big guy. His name is Larry and he is in his thirties. We were watching them with the sound off because we were afraid we would be heard. When we were in first grade I heard a radio broadcast that I liked. It just happened one day. It said, "We have a man from the Army here to see you boys today." I got excited about it. When the show ended I asked my mother what we were going see that day. She told me, "You are going to see what happens to the guy who is going to kill the big guy." So that's what we did. We went to see "Lonely Dove". We had been watching that movie since it came out. I was excited for this one too. It's an action movie and we got to see some of the action. I am not going to tell you too much about this movie. It has a very funny part

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  And when I say "positive," I mean positive in the sense of, "I liked it," not just "I'm happy to have seen it." I realize that this seems counterintuitive to the last statement. But please, read on, and I promise that things will make more sense!  Before I start explaining why I think positive reviews can be good, I'll provide some context for why it might be good to write a positive movie review.  In the course of my own life, I've written many reviews of films, ranging from negative to positive. For example, I once wrote a review of a film I liked called The Last Boy Scout in which I criticized its use of sound effects, saying, "No one really wanted a film like this." However, I still wrote the review and left it for friends and family to read over the holidays, and when the movie came out, everyone was pleasantly surprised and in love with it. The experience helped me remember how important it is to be objective, and that a review is ultimately only as good as the reviewer.  and then it ended up being one of my most popular reviews of all time. After I did a live show in which the film's music was looped as we discussed the film and my thoughts, I was amazed to hear a woman on the phone on my end ask if she could speak to my editor about something I wrote about the film (although I don't know what it was). The fact that the film is still good enough for her to care about my take on it speaks to the power of good reviews. ...  I think it's important to understand why the power to write positive reviews lies not only with the writer, but with the audience as well. As much as we think we can control whether or not the review we write is positive or negative, there's a lot that goes on that we can't control. If a film is great, that's a good thing. But the fact that a negative review could be written isn't the same thing as it wasn't written. As a fan, I don  The above-mentioned scenario reminds me of something I heard in a TED talk by David Dobbs, where he talked about how some of the most beloved characters in stories are actually "negative." In his speech, he said that the hero is usually evil, and the villain is usually good. That's what happens when the reader is

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " I laughed my ass off at this one." " It's a lot of fun." " It is a good way to spend an afternoon."  I haven't seen everything the guys have filmed since the series ended so this is just the tip of the iceberg. These are just some of the positive comments I have been seeing about this.  So what should you watch if you haven't already? The Legend of Korra (Season 3) - As I write this, the first three episodes are all available for free on iTunes and Amazon Prime. They're available through their respective websites but the good news is that the shows are also on YouTube. The Legend of the Korra is set to air on Nickelodeon, which is a huge deal because it is a network that will air shows at all times of day, in multiple languages, and that doesn't include live events. There are over 400 episodes and counting. If you've been on the fence about the show, this is your chance to take a plunge. And if you're on the same page as I was but you just want to skip the intro and just dive right into the action, you can click on the following links: Episode 1 -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd8j5s-yDnk Episode 2 - https://www of the end credits  to see the scene and read some commentary on the music by Steve Blum. Episode 3 -  https  .youtube  /watch? v=g-c2Rg7ZJf8 Episode 4 -  The Last Airbender - There's not much to say about this series other than that it's a brilliant animated show. And I say that as someone who has spent a good amount of time rewatching the first two seasons and still can't stop thinking about it. I'm a fanboy and this is my favorite show. So whether you're a fan of the animated show, a hardcore fan, or you're just a guy who loves good cartoons and cartoons that are just plain fun to watch, check this one out.  My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic - My Little Pony is one of the most popular and well-known shows on the planet. It's currently one of Disney's most successful franchises, and they've made several spin-offs as well. But in the past two seasons, they've been able to bring in a slew
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The new movie "Hercules" is very good. If you like martial arts action movies, you should like this one. The action in the movie is awesome. I had no problems at all watching the movie with popcorn.  The movie is not for everyone. The plot, the characters and the art work really well together.  I am really looking forward to see more movies like this in the future. ________________________________________________________ I would have given a more negative review if I didn't love the movie so much! So, I guess, a good review is a good one! ___________________________________________________ My friend recommended this movie to me for my birthday. I've always liked action movies because of the fact that I watch them as a teenager. This movie was a really good film for me, and I really recommend you to watch it too!  The movie was like an awesome movie that I was looking forward too. It's an interesting story of war, of course, but that's not the main reason for my watching it. I like action movies that show how you can defeat your opponent, that's why I watched it.    This movie was really cool, I would love to watch more like it!  I was looking for a good action movie that was entertaining, and that showed how good a martial artist's skills can be.  The characters are very well designed, they have their own personalities and are not just fighting for the sake of it. I really enjoyed it. You can't really make fun of this movie, and you should watch it even if you don't like martial art movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________The movie:When I was in high school I wanted to be a professional basketball player like Shaq, Kobe, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett. I went to college but couldn't really take it seriously so I came back to Los Angeles to become a rapper and make music. I released my first mixtape in 2009 called "Dirty Niggas" (which was actually my second mixtape), but the music industry didn't really pick up on it.I've been in the game about two years, but this is my first time trying to get music in front of other people. I had been working with the producers T.I., Young Chop, DJ Drama and a few other rappers. I was still making mixtapes and I was looking for someone who could help me with something bigger. When it came time to talk to the label, I decided to give them a little more time, and I figured if I could get some big names signed I could be a better rapper.I met with T.B.K. and they signed me to The Blocka, which is a music label that has signed rappers from the likes of KRS-One to Eminem and Ludacris. They know they can trust me and I'm really grateful to them. I've been working at the label for a little over a year now and I've worked with some big stars like Young Chop and Wale. I love making music and I feel like it's the best part of my job, so I just want to give it my all and try my hardest to do great music.I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just got my master's degree in music from the College of Staten Island. I want to stay in the music business because I love to make music and it's what I've always loved to do. But I'm not really sure. I think I'll just work hard and be the best rapper I can possibly be.I'm working on my Master's in music business and I just feel like I've gotten more into music recently. I'm kind of excited to start working and I think that if I'm able to work hard, I can make it.It's been a good experience. There's really not much else I can say. I made music with T-Boz and he's definitely a legend. It's been very fun, and people like my music. The fans appreciate it. I hope that one day I'll have

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I thought "Jurassic Park" was a fantastic film, it's one of the greatest films of all time, and if you don't have it on DVD (yes I have it) you should really just go get it on VHS and watch it again, this film is simply amazing. However, I think they screwed up the film by doing too much CGI, and they were actually using special effects for most of the film, but they also used CGI to do the real effects. I think it's a shame because they could have used real effects instead of the CGI. Also, the dinosaur scenes, and the scenes where they were just walking around, it was a little over CGI. I'm not a big fan of CGI, but this really was too much. The scenes when the dinosaurs were chasing the guys were way better in the novel. I liked how they did the dinosaurs, I thought they did a good job with them. It looked like a real dinosaur. The movie was a really good film, and I think everyone who sees it should watch it just to see how it was done, but also to learn about the history behind it. The characters were well done, I liked them a lot. The film was a hit, and it was so good, that I just wanted to see more. It's just so damn good! "JURASSIC PARK IV" would have been a great film, I'm pretty sure.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________  If you're a film maker, I'd love to see your reviews:  For each film, we want to give 5 stars based on five categories: (1) What worked for us, (2) What didn't work for us. (3) What we would do differently next time. (4) What did we like about the movie, and (5) What could have been better. (Here is a list of films we're trying to cover, and a few more on the way)  What's a film?  A film is a narrative film that tells a story in a specific genre and has the ability to engage people through an emotional response.  You may know a film from a specific scene (a good example: "Hiroshima Mon Amour"), but that doesn't make it a "film". It could be an animated film, a comic book movie, a documentary, a musical, an interactive documentary, or whatever you can come up with, but it should not be considered a film.    A documentary is not a film, but films are sometimes called documentaries. We're just looking for the best movies we can find.  to get an idea of the genre and where you fit in, you can go here:   Films We're Not Covering   "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is not about film, it's a book.  the film is made of a lot of footage, and some stills. , in addition, the film makers did not include as many interviewees as they could have. This film is also quite long (1 hr 47 mins), making it difficult to digest if you have a shorter attention span. We recommend you watch it in parts as it is definitely worth it. . "The Man Whom the Gods Would Destroy" is an anti-war film, made in 2005. The movie was very critical of the war in Iraq. Although a film and not a documentary (they only wanted to make a movie about war, not its consequences), it does not fit into any of the 5-star categories. In fact, the makers of this film said that they didn't include any interviews as it would have been too time consuming. "Citizenfour" is about Edward Snowden, a 29-year-old American national who has been working as a contractor for the National Security Agency since he was a young man. Since

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  ___________________________________________________  How To Talk To Women __________________________________________  I would recommend to everyone to read this book, because this is a great book, very informative.  This book explains how to talk to women in a way that will work, and it's really easy to understand.  of course, as an artist, I would suggest everyone read this before they even go to a job interview (just to understand what you're supposed to say) and to try to avoid all those weird questions women like to ask.  in fact, when you're reading this book (or listening to an audiobook, you don't even need to have a book with you).  But I really would recommend this book to everyone who's ever had a job, or a date, or anyone who ever wanted to make a successful first impression with someone. . I had a date with a girl once. She was very nice and really smart, and she was really nice too. We spent about 10 minutes with each other, and I ended up feeling a lot of feelings. Her name was Shaina. She asked me to give her a hug when I got back to my apartment (because I was late), and I did, but when I was about to give my phone to her, she asked me, "Do you want to kiss?" I said "Sure" without even thinking. But that moment of feeling attracted, was not even enough. I felt like it was something deeper. So I had to tell her that. And she looked shocked and asked me what I wanted to do. I told her, "I want to give you my phone, but instead I want to make you feel like you can do whatever you want. I want you to feel like if you wanted to kiss me, I want that kiss, and if you want it again, I will be there." So she said, "Okay, that's good." So I just went to the window and looked outside, and in 10 seconds she looked me up and down and smiled, and asked if I wanted a second hug, and that was it. It was really simple. I didn't even have to say anything. We kissed each other on the cheek and then went to my car. And that was the end of that date.    __________________________________________________________  that girl at the bar. ________________________________________________________  We all know there's some bad things that happen

Check the following page for more information: How To Rate  Reviews: . You're not going to see the same reviews for every movie.  "BEST MOVIE EVER"  It's a bit embarrassing to admit it, but even if I haven't seen it, the majority of people I know still say it's one of their favorite movies of all time. So, for the sake of this film's reputation, we'll just say it is. There's a lot of stuff you might not know about this movie, and I can't cover all of it. However, there are two main reasons why I've always found this movie very good, and in a perfect world, I would be happy to just have one more movie like this. . First, it's incredibly well directed. It's just the right balance of humour, drama, and heart. It takes some time to get to know the main characters, but the time you do, it really does help build up the tension in the film. The pacing of the film is perfect. Everything has a definite beginning, middle, and end. Even though there are some pretty big twists at the end, I still don't think you'll see many people say this film is too predictable. What makes it the best movie of all-time? - It takes a very unique, unique approach to telling an action thriller. I think it's what separates it from anything else out there. It has some of the most amazing visuals I've seen, even if they are pretty simple. The action is very well choreographed and done. The plot is interesting and never completely predictable. The script is perfect and well thought out. The characters are well developed and believable. There is even a couple of minor characters who are just funny as hell. I love this movie and will be in it long after I've written my review. - It's pretty damn great. No matter how many times I watch it, I always find myself saying, "Wow, that was one hell of a movie!" I've never seen a movie this good. I don't know how anyone could be disappointed. - Everyone is completely wrong about this film. - The most important thing that will make this movie a classic is if you watch it and find it hilarious. This movie isn

If you like films with great stories and a great cast, you're going to love it. I just finished watching it and I have been replaying the scenes over and over again and I still can't believe it. It really is a brilliant film, and it deserves a spot in any great film collection. And in terms of this season, I think I'll be going for it in any one of the films that I have time to watch in December.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. This is an easy one to remember.  2. Have you heard the one about the guy who lived in a cardboard box?  3. If I have to kill you, what will you say when I open your coffin?  was a box-office hit in 1980, and was later remade as the comedy film In the Mouth of Madness (1981). As is usual with the works of Peter Weir, the original is an unsettling comedy, that manages to make its most unsettling moment, involving the killer's obsession with the box, both humorous and relatable. One of the reasons the film is so terrifying is because of how Weir manages to play on your most repressed fears. For all his other works, Weir does a great job of showing the human side of psychopaths, and this particular scene was no different. Even the way the killer approaches the victims in their coffin is disturbing enough to make you shudder and shake your head. The reason why the film has so much fear and tension is that it gives the audience the same feelings, even when they're not feeling like it. That's something the audience doesn't always get. And when you watch In the Box, the movie will make you feel a variety of things. The first thing is how eerie and uncomfortable everything is. The second is the way that the killer keeps his victims alive. It makes the viewer feel like there's some sort of supernatural power at work. The third thing is that the scene is so well paced. You can tell how disturbed the killer is, and it all just builds to this moment. You have to be a little bit scared just watching the scene in question. The final thing is just how terrifying the scene was. For some reason, the audience is almost always terrified by this scene. It's also one of those scenes that makes you think and feels very natural and realistic. A lot of filmmakers would have left out this part, or had someone else read that note. But Weir made it as part of the movie. The scene also makes you realize that your thoughts of what is happening is completely normal. This scene has such a strong effect on the audience, because it's what makes the audience realize just how disturbed they actually are. That part of it is actually one of the most horrifying parts of the film. You may want to watch the film again to get the full effect of it. My favorite scene in the movie is in the first act. This entire film takes

Don't talk about yourself: ___________________ The key to a great career is to keep a positive attitude. You will find that the best performers have a very high opinion of themselves and think highly of themselves, just like the person who gave a great presentation on his first day of school. There is no need to talk about your work, other than to say "I enjoyed working with this director," or "This is a brilliant script," and then immediately forget about the scene you were in. In fact, most good performers would rather have people talk about themselves than the work they are doing, because it means they are thinking about something else, rather than the movie they are portraying. They are the kind of people who keep looking up from their phone to see if anyone has said a good thing. -Steve Zaillian  8. Learn from your mistakes. __________________ When we make mistakes, it's not always a bad thing. Sometimes it can actually be beneficial. Let's say you're a new director trying to make a movie. You decide that the script is too long and so you re-write it, but the change causes the director's vision to clash with the script. You know the script has too much material and so when the director is directing and you are re-writing, the two of you will always be at odds. What happens then? Your film sucks. Or it becomes a cult classic. Either way you lost money. The same with a writer. He's working with a terrific script that could be great if he had the time to make it great. So he starts working with the editor. The editor's vision is a little different than yours and so the movie gets a little weird. Or the director wants to give the movie a happy ending. Well, he's trying to create a happy feeling and the writer has some issues. The script doesn't work for the director. The director and editor will never work together again. It's too expensive to go to a studio for help. If it takes six months of re-writes, you'll probably never make the film. The producer gets pissed off and will never look at you the same way. You've lost a lot of money by making a mistake in the first place and a good director makes mistakes, too. They learn from their mistakes and they know what they did wrong.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  The film is definitely worth a watch, however, it might not be worth another three dollars. While the acting is good and the story is fun, it falls short of greatness due to the fact that you have to feel bad about watching the movie. There is also an awful amount of violence in the film. If the movie was a little more humorous, it would have been better, and this makes the film a little bit too dark.  I would recommend this movie to those who like comedy and love action films. The movie is great if you want to get a good laugh while you're on the way to the theater. The actors were great in this film, especially the young actors that were cast because they had never been in a movie before, and they did great, especially Josh Duhamel. .  on-line review by  . on-linesite.com  Juggalo Review by

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  If you've seen enough movies to qualify as a "cinema buff" you might have come across a movie that made a big impression on you. The movie itself was probably a big hit at the time. It was a genre favorite. Some people loved it. Some hated it. People talked about it a lot. Some just forgot about it.  The point is you never know what you're going to love about a movie, and this movie might have been the exception. If you didn't like the movie but really enjoyed the writing you might read on to find out why, because if you do, this movie will probably have you hooked.  It was called "Stalker" and it was a film about a young man who is stalked by an ex-girlfriend. As the plot unfolds you're taken on a journey around the country with him, and the film is shot with a special effect which makes the scenery around the characters look like you're standing in the middle of the film.  to  Stalker is the story of a guy named Paul who is walking around with a box of pictures he takes of the girls he's attracted to. Paul gets a girlfriend named Mary. He's having a rough time and she's not too happy about it at first. He doesn't feel he deserves Mary, and as a result she's become increasingly distant. Paul wants to give her one last chance, but Mary is determined to keep her distance from him. He realizes that the pictures he keeps in the box are of Mary, which leads him to believe she's still in love with him and wants to return the feelings. This is just one of the reasons that this movie's story isn't all that original, but the writing really shines and makes you want to see what happens. The plot is very straightforward and the characters are very interesting. There's not a lot of comedy in the film, but that's ok, because the story is really good, and it feels more like a film that you'd see on television than a movie you'd watch at home. There are just enough weird twists and turns to keep you on your toes, and when the story starts to unravel Paul starts to realize that this is going to be a long and difficult journey to go back to the girl that he loves. "Stalker": Paul has his boxes of pictures with the girls on them and as he walks around he keeps getting them shot, and each time

The above is a list of words that have been linked to "positive" movie reviews on Google. (This is not a scientific list of movie review words. It is simply a list I put together. My guess is that many of these words have a meaning. These words are not all positive.)  "Dramatic" has been linked 913 times. The word "dramatic", as far as I can tell, is used mainly in the context of dramatic films. ,,,, The word,, is linked to the movie "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly" (the title, incidentally, being the "good" part). The word has been used as a synonym for "great" in some reviews, and, although the word is used to describe something that is generally good, in some cases it can also mean something that isn't. I have found it used as both a positive and a negative in these movies:  Humphrey Bogart plays a cowboy who gets in over his head on the job.

The Witch looks amazing, it looks awesome, and it feels like it has more than enough scares to keep you on the edge of your seat. The movie is a good horror movie and as scary as it may be, you will still find it to be enjoyable. This movie isn't really for people who don't like scary things, though. This is a film for people looking for a good scary movie and this movie delivers. This was my first time seeing a film by Stephen King and this is the kind of movie he's always written.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ What's it about? A little girl lives with her mother, her dad, and a pet monkey. Her little brother has been diagnosed with a rare illness. Her dad, who is the monkey, has to leave work and go to a hospital where his brother lives in the room next door. He has a very strange, disturbing illness and is a real danger to himself and to her little sister. What's not to like? If you have had a pet you love and it's sick, then this movie is for you. It has the characters in it that you love from your favorite stories. The story, I must say, is not as good as the book, but it is a good story and the writing is very well done. What made it so good was the way they explained the illness to us and the way the story unfolded. I really felt for the little girl and her dad in this story. The movie is wonderful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What I like about the Movie Review is that there is no "what is good about it" type of "what do you think about it?" kind of stuff. This is not the type of thing that people who don't know the director of a movie do. It is like having a discussion about what movie to watch with a friend who does not have a passion for movies. The movie reviewer, in this case, reviews the movie. The person who doesn't like the movie is not allowed to try to explain why they don't like it or to make up their mind as to why they think it is bad. In this sense, it is very different from the movie reviews in movies.com. You will find this kind of thing at moviereview.com, especially on movie review's top lists. Movie Review writers will explain what they thought about a movie and how they think a film can be improved. A review of " The Godfather Part III " explains that the ending was unsatisfying and that it could have been better. A moviegoer will be asked what they want to see more of from a film but the Movie Reviews are not there to try and convince them what the best thing is in the movie they just watched. The Movie Review also gives an overview of the plot and does not make many statements about the quality of the film. This does not mean that the movie can not improve and you should still watch it and make your own opinion. I think that the Movie review at movie review.com could benefit from being more objective. What this means is that a movie reviewer will talk about the strengths and weaknesses of the movie and give an opinion on it but they won't be trying to prove the movie wrong or tell you that you should watch it again because it is good. A good movie review at the Movie reviews website is like a review of the best restaurant. It doesn't matter if the restaurant is bad, just not very good, it can still be good. The restaurant review will talk to you about how the restaurant should be improved and give a few ideas on how they could be made better but that does not necessarily mean that they will. This kind of review is good at making you want to come back for another meal. It might be a little bit off the track from what you expected, but you are coming back for the delicious food and the good times.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ My wife and I are huge fans of the Harry Potter series. She started reading the series in 1998 and we still read every book on our hard drives. We have watched almost every movie, read all the books and have even created our own fanfiction. Recently, we were discussing an idea for a play about the series and were discussing some of the characters. We started thinking about how to name our characters and then the idea came to us that we should name the characters after the Harry and Ron Potter books. So we created a little family tree with names for each of the books that we would give their Harry and Harry Potter counterparts. In the beginning we did not have the Harry's and Ron's names, but the Ron and Hermione's names came later. When we were drawing up the Harry family tree, we realized that our names for Harry and Hermione might not fit because we have Harry Potter's middle name and Ron Weasley's middle initials. So, we thought it would be fun to change their names to be a little bit more unique so we came up with Ginny Weasley and Hermione Granger. We really hope that everyone enjoys our little play and our family tree. We are not a big Harry Potter fan and we have read most of the novels, but we are super fans of all the characters and really enjoy watching all the movies. Please feel free to send us any questions you might have and don't hesitate to ask us for advice or if you want to be in our family. The more the merrier!

We got it. It's written, and it's in the can. It has all the characters in it and the dialogue. There are a few scenes that I'm pretty happy with, but the overall feel is just right. It just doesn't feel like we have our own thing going. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's something we need to fix.  .   I have a script for a new TV show that I've been sitting on for a year or more. My character's father is dying. His daughter has just been conceived, and now my character needs to decide what to do. She could have told him she was pregnant, and he might have given it to her. Or, she could have pretended that she was a guy so she could get him to take the time to visit his own son. Or she could just lie and claim to be his daughter. It could have been a lot of things. I have it in my desk.   I've also been thinking of what we should do in our new film for next year. It will be based on an old science-fiction novel by an American author called Joe Haldeman. He was a science-writing instructor for the Atomic Energy Commission during the early days of the atomic bomb, and there are two things that we need for our new science-fictional film. One is some science-fact information about our society, and one is some sci-fi science-facts about our future society. In particular, I would like to know what the future society of America will be like, and how it will function. We will be in the present day when we start our movie, but in the future America will have been to the moon, or landed a man on the moon. There will have already been several colonies of people living on the Moon. But what are they doing? They are running computers or taking care of the space station that NASA left behind. It seems to me there should be some kind of story arc as the technology of the future improves. So for the new movie, I'd like to be in a situation where I could tell a story about what happens in the new society, as it advances technologically.  What I don't really understand is
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's great to read that someone thinks you are an amazing actor but it's also not always the case. There's no need to be an asshole because in order to get ahead in Hollywood you have to be liked, even if you don't think you are.  This movie is all about the guy. It is about his journey as he deals with his father who he loved very much, but didn't know how to tell the truth about when he left home for the first time as a child. It's a very sensitive subject and it's definitely about the wrong path that he's going down. I think this movie is definitely about people's lives being changed, about life being taken away and having it go backwards. There are so many different ways that you can interpret that, but the thing is that these people are on a path of self destruction and when they are told the truth and that their lives have been destroyed in a big way, what they do, and they take that path. This movie could have been about one of those guys but I wanted to do a movie that deals with the journey of the family and how it takes them all the way through the things that have happened to them and all the good things that they have. It was important for me to tell a story that was about family in Hollywood and how they deal with the reality of Hollywood and the whole industry and the pressures that they are under. Why was it important for you to tell this story about these people? I think it's really about family and life and it was important to tell it because of where we were in Hollywood at the time and the times that we are in now. These are people that I love and who I know. They are not only my family but my friends and I think that they were the first family that I got to know who were not related to me. Do you have any regrets or was it a good decision? I don't regret anything at all because in a lot of ways, you're taking a risk because you don,t know what you're getting into. It could turn out a great movie, but it could also turn out bad and I want people to take a chance. I want to make a good one, that's why I did it. I made that choice. You have made a film that is so important. You're one of the few people that is willing to deal with a subject like this in a way that is interesting and

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ The reason I put it that way was because I saw The Hunger Games at a theater and it was very good. I was really enjoying the movie but was getting frustrated and had to leave it. I felt like it wasn't telling the story correctly, that there were things that weren't told and there were some plot holes. That didn't go away with the review. In fact, the reviewer ended up saying "I didn't like The Hunger games because it didn't have the right hook. It felt like they were being too vague for my liking". My response was that if you didn't get what the hook was, you didn  ...  I'm sorry but I think it's pretty obvious why this is an issue, because the hook is the main thing that's keeping you interested in a movie and keeping the movie from just being a generic movie. I would like to say this is not only my problem, but my problem has some people on the other end of it. As I mentioned, it is a problem of me wanting to love the movie and people getting tired of it or feeling it doesn't match up to what they've seen before.   The thing is I think that everyone has a little thing they want to see that's not there. This is not an excuse, but it's my opinion. So, I'll address my thought process a little bit. I think when you look at a movie, you've got to look at the positives, the things that people are excited about, the details that you're excited about and you want to keep. You have to keep the positive and the details. So with any movie that has an ending, whether it's going to be a happy ending or an evil ending or whatever, you should make sure the ending isn't going to confuse you. A good example of this is The Lord of the Rings. At the beginning, you know that a good guy is going to win and it's a very straightforward story. It doesn't even come close to giving you confusion. When you get to the end, and you know it's the last movie, and Gandalf and the ring come to light, and suddenly you're like, what? What is the big deal? And you're left feeling like the movie was a bit of a mess, and it didn.t give the ending the attention it needed.  -I am aware that this is going a little off topic, but I feel like this issue

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________.  Don't get me wrong, I still love horror, but not every one of these movies needs to be a shock-the-system, 'I don't care how it ends, get out of here, we can't believe what just happened' type of film. We all know that it's possible to write a great horror story, but sometimes the best films take that genre, and turn it into a unique, well-written story. I want to give props to the creators of the films I mentioned here. Many of them have done a really good job of creating compelling characters, and setting the perfect tone for the film. A lot of these films also do a great job of exploring the psychological aspects of what makes us feel so horrible about ourselves and the people around us. In many cases, they make you feel like you are a real human being, even though the main character is insane. That's a skill many writers lack and one that should not be overlooked. I hope you guys have found this list to be helpful and helpful to you too!  I'm sure we all know horror movies that we are not so crazy about, but we can see the story behind them and are intrigued by them, or just want to see more, so here's a collection of some films that I think you might like!   A Clockwork Orange   Okay, so let me start with what I love most about this film. The story is really well told. It is a really well-made, well paced, suspenseful film. I think that's the thing that really makes this film work. The plot, it is extremely well executed. It does take a little while to get there, but once you get there it is pretty well constructed. It builds in tension like it is the most important thing in the world to the protagonist, which gives the story a really eerie, dark, and realistic feel. If you watch this film at the right time of day, it gives off a very creepy vibe. You know when you are getting ready to go to bed, and all of a sudden your phone goes off, and then it is gone for hours? Well, it's like that, only it's not your phone but rather a ticking clock that starts to annoy you. When you watch it, you are not really scared, but you know you need to get up, so that you can get to work. That makes it very scary. 1

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________The last movie I watched for review was Temptation, but I didn't read the script of that movie. I don't even remember it, because it was like a bad dream. I do remember watching it because there was some girl on TV wearing a miniskirt. In the end, I remember being so bored that I put the remote away, and I just sat there, eyes closed, thinking "What's that girl doing on TV?"
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________My personal favorite movies are those that are a tribute to life. For instance, when the movie "The Godfather" came out in 1972, it was a huge movie in my life, and I was only 14 years old. The movie made me cry, it made me believe in the American dream, it taught me how to be a man, it showed me that good is always stronger than evil. I remember when I watched the movie I couldn't stop laughing because the whole movie made sense. But the best movies in my personal book are those movies where people, for whatever reason, put themselves into the movie. Like the movie, "The Wizard of Oz", where the characters try to figure out what is real. In this case, the movie characters were so realistic and real that you couldn't take your eyes off them. Like it was real, and even though the movie wasn't real, it had the power to make people happy and sad, happy and scared. My personal favorite movie of all time is "A River Runs Through It", where a little girl, Lillian, falls in love with her new friend, Bill. But Lillian's dad hates Bill and her mom hates Bill because he is black. They try to talk to Bill and Lillian doesn't like him and she thinks he is a big, ugly, stupid, ugly man who's going to steal her little girl. The whole movie is a struggle for Lillian. A river runs through it. And that's what makes the movie so powerful, that Lillian was struggling with something so personal. In the end, you see that this little girl is willing to risk her life for her friend, and you understand why this movie is so powerful. But when the whole situation is put into one sentence, the power of the movie is multiplied a thousand times. I want everyone to understand how powerful this movie was for me. I just want you all to know that the movies I loved as a child taught me about life, what makes people strong, what it takes to be an adult. I also learned how to live life. I learned how my dad was always there for me, how my mom was always so supportive, and how my little sister loved me. That's all I want to say about the movie for now. __________________  "This is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. It's really good!" - Richard Gere  - "This is probably the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ What was most memorable about this movie: It's just so fucking good. I was never scared the entire movie. I didn't have any worries in any of the scenes. When a monster was coming out of the water I kept thinking he's gonna get out but he didn't. It was such a great twist. It's got so many great lines and it was such an amazing ending. The action scenes were just so freaking awesome. I'm going to be talking about this one a lot, because it's really fucking good and that's what counts. __________________  In this world, I'm the guy who'll stop you dead in your tracks with his voice, because he doesn't care what you've got planned. __________________________ .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ A review of "Hannibal" is a terrible way to start a movie review, because the very premise of the movie is one that requires an extreme amount of sympathy. If you aren't a fan of the series then don't read this review. I'm not sure who will care about "HANNIBAL" if you haven't seen the series, but I assure you that it is worth a watch. This is not to say that the series is a bad show. It is a very good show and if you like it, then by all means go watch it. If, however, you have watched the series you will find a much greater enjoyment from this film and I do think that the ending of the film is quite a good moment. In a way, the ending feels a bit like a "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" episode. So what's different from the previous film? Well, there are some very interesting characters and a bit of a "Hanna-Barbera" vibe. The setting for the film was very interesting, as Hannibal and Will Graham are at the beginning of their search for Hannibal Lecter. The story is similar to the series so I can't really comment on any differences that were added or subtracted. I have a bit more of an interest in this film than I did the previous one, so I won't say that I liked it that much. Overall, I think that this is a great way to kick off a series, especially if you are a fan.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. This movie isn't great. It has some great moments, but doesn't really nail down a consistent style, and it's difficult to tell if it is supposed to be funny or not. The acting is generally solid, but most of them are not all that great, the dialogue is often flat, and the whole movie seems to be very scripted and very predictable. _________. The movie is a fairly typical "drama-thriller", with a plot about a group of teenagers who meet in a secluded cabin for a week each summer. One of the characters, a girl, dies and her friend, a boy, is kidnapped and taken to an island to be sold as a "sex slave" and eventually killed. The rest of the movie takes place on the island, with the friends and characters trying to escape and find their way back. However, the plot isn't as much of a surprise as it initially appears. One thing you won't be surprised about, though, is how quickly this movie loses all its momentum. This is most noticeable in the third act, where the movie goes through several plot twists and turns that don't actually add to the plot but instead are just annoying. There are also several plot holes in the movie, making this very easy to be confused about what is actually happening. It is the least enjoyable movie I've ever seen from Universal, and as a result I didn't even bother giving it a rating. It might be good for people who are just looking to pass the time, and I would definitely recommend it for that purpose. However. _________________________________________________________ Summary: ___________________________. This isn't bad by any means. It's just... not anything special. It does what it has to do in the plot and it doesn't take itself too seriously, but there are parts where it feels like the writers didn't bother thinking about it all that much. It isn't terrible by any stretch, but it definitely isn't any good. I guess that is the point of horror movies. _____________________________. Oh, yeah, I also had the DVD of this and I liked it a lot.

I got this as a gift for my son who loved the horror movies on VHS when he was little. He was absolutely hooked and decided to take some action and get this. It's a great movie and you really can't go wrong. Just pay attention to your surroundings and be ready for an "extreme movie". The ending made me chuckle as it made the ending to the movie in "The Shining" come to mind. Would I buy this movie? YES!!!

His acting is always good and he is a great actor. This is the first time I've seen him play someone who was not his father. James has a good way with playing the character. The acting and direction are top notch and his chemistry with Amy Schumer is amazing. She is very talented and has a great sense of humor. As for this film, I thought the performances were very believable and the film was good from beginning to end. It was well shot, funny and acted, and has good visuals.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ Please note: The following review contains spoilers. If you haven't seen the film yet, stop reading now. I'll wait. But if you have seen the movie, you might still find these moments of wit and charm amusing. They're so unexpected and fun to see. Also, I had a hard time finding time to find time to do this, so if you see typos, let me know in the comments. _________________________________________________ ______________________________________________ 2.5 / 5 ____________________________________ This is a story about a young couple trying to get through college. They start out fairly well. They get involved with a girl and they're good friends for a while. Then things go south for a bit and the relationship gets pretty strained. After a couple of years they get back together and things are finally getting better. Things get worse for a couple years and things get even worse. The couple get engaged and after some time there is a very, very hard fight and the girl leaves the relationship. This leads the couple down a dark path that would lead to this horrible ending. The relationship has been over for a long time, and the couple seems to have done the best they could at that time. It all seemed like an interesting enough story. I'm not sure how it was that this particular movie could ever be a critical success. It was a well-told story, but it just never was able to get across the feeling that the couple had been through an incredibly difficult period in their relationship, a period which resulted in their getting a divorce. I guess this is the feeling I got watching the film, I feel that the characters have suffered the same pains that the story's main characters have. They are just slightly different enough to feel like they've been through the same pain. And the way the characters are portrayed makes it feel like the character's are struggling to deal with something and we're just being dragged along for the ride. This is only compounded when you see the ending of the film. It's hard to explain the emotional and spiritual consequences that it causes, but I'll try to give some impressions. The film has a lot of violence and violence is not without consequences. However, the violence that is present is not excessive and only really serves to remind the audience that life and the world that we live in are not fair. At one point I was surprised to see a gun used in the film but the violence is so prevalent and obvious to anyone that pays attention

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________________________ The new documentary, "The Dark Knight Rises", has come out and it has already proven to be one of the best movies of 2012. The film follows Bruce Wayne/Batman and his inner circle, but also follows a secret organization of superheroes, called the Order of St. Dumas. The movie will likely go down as one of "the greatest Batman movies of all time", and probably will go down in history as the best Batman film of all-time. The movie has received some criticism, but that is to be expected when the production budget for this movie was over $200 million.  When the film was released the film received mixed reviews, especially when you look at the critics that have had the movie already. Some reviewers have said the movie is terrible, while other critics have said that it is the best movie that Batman ever made, if not the best ever made. Regardless, I think the movie will be a huge success. There are many positive things about this movie. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Dark Tower:  Ok, let's get down to business. The Dark Tower is a new trilogy of films from J.J. Abrams. The first film was the 2010 film, and the second film is the 2011 film. The trilogy was first announced by J.D. Payne back in 2010, and it was to be directed by Nikolaj Arcel (who also has a few more films under his belt). The movie is described as "The world of Roland Deschain, aka the Gunslinger, is one of destruction and fear, but when a mysterious man named Jake Chambers arrives on the frontier of the land he calls Mid-World, the future of that world is threatened." Ok so we already have some information on this movie, but what about the characters? _______________________________________________________________________ The first film, The Gunslinger, was based off of Stephen King's novel, and was written by Akiva Goldsman, based on the book The Stand, which was a novel by King, and also was released in 2010. There were some rumors that the film had been going to be based off the Stephen King novel The Dark tower, but I don't think that is going to happen. So what are we going to get here? __________________________________________________ In the first film we are going to follow Roland Des Chain, aka The Gunslinging Gunslinger. Roland is a gun enthusiast who is also a man of honor. He
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________  "I wish I had more time to sit and enjoy the amazing movie and to enjoy this great soundtrack of incredible film scores."  – Christopher P. W.  The best soundtrack of the year (and possibly of all time)  I've never been a fan of movies that were too long. They take up a lot of room and seem to be a distraction from the story being told. This movie did exactly the opposite. As a matter of fact, I have to add "filmmaking" to my bucket list because there were just so many good things that happened in this movie. This is probably why the movie is being singled out for awards, so that it may inspire and inform and inspire people to try and do something similar in their lives. , directed by Brian Taylor, is one of the best examples of the new wave of film scores that are being composed and produced by composers like Ennio Morricone and Jean Michel Jarre. It has more than its fair share of memorable scenes, but also has a solid story that I don't think you can tell unless you are in the theater, where it's presented in a stunning 3-D movie that you must see on the big screen. I didn't need to see it to have enjoyed it. I've seen all three movies that it's been cited as a contender for. It had a wonderful, haunting score, which is enhanced when you're in the dark during the most frightening moments. This score is nothing short of beautiful, with the right amount of aggression and restraint that it needs. Taylor has written the film in such a way that makes you feel like you're watching something that has come straight from the past, but is now so current. It's so fresh that it was like the soundtrack to something from the future. It is a modern film score in every sense of the word. The most important thing to note is that this is a score that's been inspired by classic films. As you can imagine, it's nothing short for classic film scores from the '30s, '40s and '50s. It was a very good thing thatis a film I really don't feel has many, if any, modern film scores, which makes this score all the more remarkable.The music is very appropriate for this film, since you could argue that it comes from the early 1900s and not the 1940s. Taylor was very well-versed in

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To best believe a movie is good, you have to take it on faith that the filmmaker doesn't care what the critics think. It is true that a film can only be good if it does good things. It's also true that critics often don't care about the film's intentions. But there are films that don't have the potential to be great or even good. Some movies just aren't made for cinema, and even if they are, they aren't going to get made in today's era.    Pin It   ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I know how people talk, I have to believe that everyone on earth really gets this. Everyone on earth knows the value of a good meal and they know the importance of a day without bad luck and even the value in a good marriage and family. So I guess what I am trying to say is I know how important it is to not waste my money. I know it's important not to spend my time on a movie that can never be good. I am so afraid to waste my time and money on a film that could never be great.  If we all just stop wasting our time and energy on bad movies, the world will be a better place. ___________________________________ If I get to see a movie, I want to go to a place that is nice. I want a movie theatre to be comfortable, with friendly people and not in a dirty part of town. I will be happy with a movie at home if it is quiet, if it's nice and if I am not surrounded by idiots. ____________________________ I have had a few bad movies in my life, and I have seen lots of really good movies. But it's never worth it if it doesn't feel right when it's on screen. If I am watching a movie with my kids, I don't want to be woken up by a screaming baby. I don;t want my wife to feel like I'm getting in her way when she's trying to finish a hard task like going to the grocery store.   I'm not going to waste any more of my time, energy and money to see another movie that will always be terrible. I'm going to look for something better. ______________________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I love "Grosse Pointe Blank." My friend and I had to be in the theater together because he was flying to Boston and I was flying home, so we wanted to catch each other's reactions to the film. We loved the way it had been edited and the way the characters were portrayed and the humor it had delivered. It was really good and we were both very impressed with what we saw. But when I told him I was taking the day off, he gave me an interesting reason. He said, "I don't know if this is a good idea for you to be away from the screen. I have a great job but it's so stressful that you're getting a little bored with it. That's when you need a break, not when you're supposed to be having fun." I think he was right. There's not a lot of laughter in life. It's just not the way I think. So I'm glad my friend is right about that.I'm looking forward to a few more months of summer in the Northeast, seeing my sister and nephew, enjoying time with my parents. But first, I want to check out the new Batman and Superman film, then "Bourne Identity" and maybe my family's old favorite, "The Sandlot." You know, maybe I'll go on vacation for a couple of months and maybe even see my mother and stepfather for the first time in a long time. So we'll see how it goes.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  "For years, I have watched countless terrible movies. And then I found a few I liked. I then went out and saw these films for the first time. They were awful and I hated them. However, they were also very good. I just couldn't believe the movie wasn't a flop. I am still waiting for that moment when a movie is so bad it's good. And that's how I felt watching "A Hologram for the King."   It wasn't. This film, in the vein of "The Shining," "Jaws" and "Star Wars" was great in the least. In fact, it was one of the better films I've seen in a long time. It's true that there are some plot holes and one character that you couldn't help but hate. And the writing wasn't the greatest, but it was fine for a film. But then you'll notice that the director and screenwriter were very good at what they did. They wrote a movie that didn't suck and had good acting, but had enough fun to make you laugh a lot and to love it. The director was Joe Dante and the screenwriter was Tom Hanks. Dante and Hanks have done a lot of great work in the last few years and the results were more than positive.   The acting is what makes the movie so great. Hanks is so funny, the chemistry between him and Dolph Lundgren was perfect. Dolph is the bad guy in the film but he is a likable one. Tom Hiddleston, who plays the hero in the story, is also great. He plays the role perfectly. If you are a fan of his previous work, then you will definitely enjoy the movie.   in the end, "A hologram for a king" has to be on this list. I would have given it a five if not for the film's poor reception.

The Notebooks by the time I was 3 was the first film I had seen that was even remotely realistic. That it was a well made movie that was really funny and heartwarming made it seem like the perfect film for my childhood. But then, all of the other movies I had been exposed to were a complete and utter farce. I still remember the disappointment of my parents' response when I told them I had just watched "The Love Bug" and asked them to go back and watch my favorite films like "Citizen Kane" and "The Shining."

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ Please do it! You don't have to tell me about your favorite part. I'll see your movie, like it, and maybe even remember it forever. Thanks! You can also write about movies I love, and that are a favorite of yours, but I'm not a big movie-fan, and the things I love aren't movies I'll watch again (I have a feeling it's the ones I'd watch again to make me remember the good parts, not the worst parts), like, say, "This movie was very interesting for me!" I won't be able to tell what the movie was like to me. Maybe I'll remember it a year or two after I watched it!  Do your homework: _______ I hate it when you do this. Your homework has no value if you can't provide information to the people who care about it. You should try to understand your audience so you know what you're talking about. Maybe you don't know anything about me, but you probably know enough to write a proper paragraph, without the use of filler words or other tricks. If I'm a fan of your movie and know why you're watching it, I'll tell you, right away.  Write a bad review: _____ This is one of the worst things you can do to me, because I'll ignore the review. And, of course, it's completely pointless. You don the movie, you hate it, you're done. I might have even talked about it at school (if I were allowed to, that is, because now I'm too busy getting my homework done to write about stupid movies). And even if I did tell you about it, there's nothing you can say to me that will change my opinion of you. I have nothing to add. And this is just to say that I'll never bother reading your bad reviews, because it's not your job to tell anyone that they're wrong, or that they don't understand their own movies. There's also the fact that when someone like me talks about a movie, he usually has a few friends with him, and we all talk about it together. You can't talk to everyone. It's very hard to be a person who is funny and good-looking, and be an expert in the field of art. (See also: "You'll make me laugh!", and "You're a great actor.", and "Hey, you look funny!" and

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  (or in my case, a bad movie) Write a negative review about something terrible that happened: _______  I'm pretty sure these rules have something to do with your ability to enjoy a movie. If you feel like you're "being negative", it's probably a sign that you're being a little too nice!  So in a nutshell, "I don't know how I feel about this movie, so I'm going to leave a bad review".  If you want to improve at anything, it's really important to find the balance between liking things you like and hating things you hate.  In my personal life, I always strive for balance.    This is a perfect example of what I mean by balancing. I really enjoyed this movie and I loved the cast of the film.  "I can't believe how much fun this movie was. I can't stop thinking about it". This is a great movie. "It's so fun watching the actors try to act out this crazy story and also the script". I really love this movie. But it was pretty bad in a lot of ways. I don't love the story, but I love how it came together and the performances. "So the movie takes a really long time to get going and it really drags on. It's just boring. This movie sucks". Well, it was okay. It was kind of cool. But I didn't enjoy it. I didn' enjoy the actors and I didn"t enjoy the storyline.  I think that's a great example of how I balance liking something. I enjoy the story and the actors. I love seeing the cast try their best to act it out and give the audience as much enjoyment as possible.   It's also important to keep in mind that if you like something, it doesn't have to be the best thing ever. I like the movie "I, Robot" but I'm not really crazy about it. "I just don't think it's very good. It wasn't very memorable". I like watching movies but I don' feel like I'm actually having fun watching them. "This movie was fun but the ending was really stupid". This was a really fun movie! But the ending made it very hard to enjoy it as a whole. "There were a lot more cool and interesting things in this movie but it's not very good". I love this movies theme, but this movie had

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ If it's great, and it's good it's a no brainer to go see the movie. That's the way Hollywood works and the way it should. I feel like the big movie studios are in a race to release as many crappy movies as possible while trying to sell as many tickets as possible and that means that any studio will release a good film just to boost ticket sales and it doesn't matter if the film is good or if it's bad or whether it was well made or poorly made or just plain bad. In my mind, the big studios don't care if a film is great or if a movie sucks or if the movie was made by people with no experience or talent at all. The fact is that no matter how well a film makes a profit or how well it sells or how good it is the studios have the right to make as many bad movies as they want just so long as they're trying to make a profit. I don't think that there's any point in complaining about this because it's the business we live in and it does suck to be a fan of the big studio films. However, I've seen enough crappy films and bad films to have some real opinions on them and that is why this review is a review. In the end, you have to choose to judge a movie by it's merits or it's title and that's a hard thing to do because of the way the internet works and what they like and don't like to read and what's popular and not popular. And what if I want to write a bad review of a bad movie because I hate it but I want people to see it in theatres or on DVD or a Blu-ray? Well then you're stuck with a negative review. You can't do anything about a negative film other than not see it. It's the movie business and that seems to be what everyone else is doing. All I can say to this is that this is a true film no matter what the critics or box office numbers say. It was the right film made with the right budget and the right crew and they went out and did their job well. If they can do it then so can you. And yes, the film was bad but it was still great. I loved it. That is all. Watch it. Enjoy it.

While the film industry's recent struggles to stay afloat might seem almost too ridiculous to believe, consider this: If it weren't for a decade-and-a-half-old "Lost in Translation," that movie's success might be the stuff of legend.  Lost in translation tells the story of a couple in the midst of a love affair when a pair of tourists stumble into their hotel room and begin speaking the languages of the locals. In a world where English is spoken in practically every major city, this is nothing short of astonishing.  a movie with such global cultural resonance and commercial success, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Hollywood had found the answer to all its woes. Yet the movie is surprisingly controversial, especially considering its premise. In the early 2000s, Lost in Translation was the first movie to really popularize the idea of the "whole story" in film. The story, which has long been used in movies to help audiences make sense of events, was the idea that the entire movie should be told from the perspective of a character. As director Rob Reiner put it in 2004:  "What if every movie, every play and every story was told from every character's point of view? What if every person in the movie had a story, and in every story it was an event that changed the way that person felt, but didn't affect the way they thought?"  This concept isn't new. It's what most storytellers have been doing in film since the advent of cinema. But when Reiner began to speak about it, he was still a relatively new name to the entertainment industry. Since then, he's become a prominent voice for telling the full story—and not just in Hollywood. . "  Reiner's thinking was particularly compelling in the context of his first big feature, The Truman Show, which tells the "inside story" of

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________.  It's really good.  the only thing I would add is that the first 10 minutes of the movie are so good, you forget about the rest of the film. . The opening credits are just a perfect example of how a well-made movie could use credits. When you're watching a film with good, simple film techniques like montage and transitions, you really only need the credit to bring it to you. But if the credits are not the main feature, then they lose all the punch. And, really, that is the only reason to keep credits at the beginning. If you put them at the end, then you lose a lot of punch. (Note: I am aware of how annoying and bad some of the "special effects" are, especially during the scenes where the characters are walking. But it is a very important part of the story, and it is something that happens throughout the film, and should not be ignored. )  If you want the whole credits thing explained, check out this post here.  . The soundtrack is a real classic.  and they are really nice and powerful. , and they sound great in concert. I really like the way the film handles sound. The way it builds suspense is great. The first time you hear the door open and the voices of the two characters (the main character, and his best friend) you know that they are going to get into trouble. It really sets up the tension. It is great when we learn that the person who is in charge of this kind of stuff, and who made this kind work, is a little girl named Roxy. It just fits with the themes of the scene and the film really does a good job of building the tension up. -  The character development in this film is excellent. If there is one thing that I did not like in this movie, it was the character development. For example, I really did not care for our main character. I think it was mainly due to the fact that he was too good at playing games. He used his special abilities so often and so quickly, that by the time we meet him we were all too tired to care.   This is probably because of the fact I was too tired of watching people play video games, that I just decided to watch them play them. However, in a movie like this I should really care. Because what he does in the

I was in my second grade class in the late 1990s and one day the school director came into class to give us a report. I recall seeing her standing up in her chair, looking very uncomfortable, and saying, "Well, I think we need to talk about how we're going to cover this movie." She told us to make sure we read the movie, talked about how it impacted people, how it was a big deal, how we shouldn't just dismiss it, why we should be critical about it. The way she talked about it was very similar to how I would talk about a movie. I remember thinking, "That's the kind of thing I want to be able to do, too!"  **The first movie I remember being truly surprised about was The Usual Suspects in the theater. There had been rumors and whispers about the movie for a long time, and when it finally hit the big screen, I remember sitting with my classmates and watching this movie for the first time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ What it was like to watch The Avengers: Age of Ultron 1/5 I don't know if I'm ready to come out of the closet to admit that this movie was pretty great, and that's a pretty big thing to come around to. What I liked: - This is the first time a film has taken place on Earth that has an emphasis on the characters as humans first and foremost. That's a step in the right direction, and it made it easier to connect with characters who seemed rather lifeless in the previous films. - Scarlett Johansson did a great job as Black Widow. She really pulled off the role well, but I think the real focus is on Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. He's not just there to be the bad guy. He makes you understand why we love him and care about him. I think that's the real purpose of the film, and I'm really glad that it's there. - The visuals of the battle scenes are pretty cool. They're very, very detailed, and the fact that we're only seeing them from a distance is actually impressive. - Don't worry, the music is still there in the background. It does its job in the scenes, but it was also pretty good. What could have been better: - Maybe more character development in the story. I get that it was necessary, but that didn't mean that we didn't learn anything about the Avengers. What this movie should have been: - A little more of a character study, with more of an emphasis placed on the two leads. It was great for them to be in a film with so much focus on them, but if the audience is really going to be invested in the characters, then there had better have been more of them, and we didn and t see more. - They could have at least tried to find a way to introduce me to the other characters. I feel like there should have at minimum been some interaction with the characters that we don't see. Overall: - I enjoyed this film. It wasn't a perfect movie, and there was a lot of room for improvement, but at least it made the effort. My thoughts: - Don Cheadle is amazing as Tony Stark. I really wish we had seen more of his character development, but he's so good that it doesn't really matter. - I think this could have used a little more focus on the other Avengers, particularly the other three, but maybe that's

It was very similar to The Matrix where the main character is trapped in a simulation, and after an extremely long time, the protagonist wakes up in the real world and realizes the entire thing is a lie. What follows is the story of two characters who have no idea that they are in a movie, until an unknown voice asks them, "Do you want to stop playing?" This is an extremely bizarre experience, and one of my favorite moments in a series like this. The plot was a bit slow to begin with, but gradually picks up as it progresses, and it definitely did feel like a full fledged story. The dialogue was very well done, and the voice acting was top notch. I have to say, it does feel a bit out of place, it really should have been a bit more futuristic, but I would imagine it worked in the context of the story. I feel the art style is a bit over the top, but that can be attributed to the art director, and not to the director, who, by the way, was very good at what he was doing. I will admit I don't quite understand why the main girl is looking at the main guy while he is on a roof with a guy in a shirt and sunglasses, she should be looking at him in the eyes. The whole time it felt like I was watching a "realistic" movie, though, and while I am not sure if I would watch this movie again, I am glad I watched it, and highly recommend it.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here's an example from a few years back: It's a little dated, and the acting and writing is a little cheesy and stereotypical, but it's just a really good movie. The movie stars Mark Wahlberg, with an extremely good performance from him. This movie is not a classic, but a really fun movie, and a great watch. So yeah, it's a pretty good movie, but there are some serious flaws with it. For one, the plot is incredibly boring. It's not like he's doing anything that's original or really funny, so why not? I'm sure I'm forgetting a few other reasons. But overall, it would be a good idea to read the whole review first, because it's not the greatest review of all time.  Also, do remember to look up the movie on IMDB first, to see if the movie has gotten any good reviews recently. I'd recommend you to check it out. It would be nice to see how it's being received over there, and how well it's been received there. Now, about my review: I'll start this review by saying that I didn't like it. I really didn't. And that's fine, I guess. I understand that I'm supposed to give a review based on my personal opinion, and I guess I'm not supposed to like the movie. It was supposed to be a fun movie to watch, not something I really wanted to watch. And so for that, I'm just going to say that I wasn't that impressed by it, and it didn't do it for me. It just wasn't very good, and while it was entertaining at times, it didn's just wasn' t that fun to watch in the first place. There was a lot of great action scenes, which I guess we could all see coming, but you can't really make a movie about a bunch of kids being sent off to a camp for no reason, and having to battle each other and all that stuff in the background. It seemed like that was the idea, but if you ask me, it just doesn't make sense. It seems like it would just drag out for a while, and eventually the movie would just end.

I guess I was expecting it to be a real fun watch but it was not. It was quite boring and that's not my taste. I could understand the audience wanting to watch something that would be more 'adult' but not something that is boring.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________  "This film, like all the best things we do, took years to achieve its goal, and now it's time to celebrate. As you sit, relax, and enjoy this amazing film in its entirety, remember to thank our film crews, including the crew that made this possible - without them, no one could have made this movie. This is not about money. This will only be a short film, and it won't make millions of dollars. In fact, this will only bring in small amounts of cash, but it means a lot to us. So thank you, Mr. Roberts, for all you did. Thank you for helping us raise our production cost, and thank you for having faith in us. I will never forget the day we finished shooting this film, when I looked out the window and I could see all my crew members' faces - it made me realize, and I think it made them as well, that we weren't crazy for making this film. The film's very success is proof that the human spirit will not be denied." ______________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________  "This is an excellent film, that makes me want to go back to the beginning and watch the whole of the saga in one go. I do wish, however, that it had been longer, because there are more aspects of the series that have to be experienced than I realized. If the director is capable of doing this, it will be very rare to come across a film that is able to present the entire saga in such a way. The story is very well thought out, and all of the characters, as well as their relationship with one another are given the time to grow and develop. The only downside is the occasional lack of action scenes in some scenes, but that is to be expected for a series that is only in its sixth season." ____________________________________________________________________________________  _______________________________________________________________________________________ , directed by Andrey Karpov and published by Dreamworks Home Entertainment, is set in an alternate reality of the 1950's where a war between man and mutant known as X-Force began. The movie takes place in the year 1985, when X-Statix was originally a private military company, known as a military service of sorts. However, after being hired by Magneto to protect the mutant population from a nuclear attack, they were ordered by Magnetoe to leave the country for some unspecified reason, but X-Cutioner's Song, a hit team of superpowered assassins that were hired by one of the richest men in the world, Charles Xavier, to take out Magneto. When they went into action, however they accidentally ended up in the past, where they had a huge amount of fun battling and fighting against a bunch of mutants that they fought, including the original team of X-Factor, a super group of mutants known as the original X-Men who formed a team to fight the original threat from the 30's known as, directedby Andrey Piotrovsky and publishedby DreamworksHome Entertainment, has to be the most anticipated film in the series. And the hype has certainly been there from the start! However, it isn't always as entertaining as the first three films, even though it has some pretty awesome action scenes. The villain is the perfect example of a villain that the movies can't quite get right, and the movie has several really cool scenes, including some really cool fight scenes. There are a couple of really good plot twists as well, but the one that is the most intriguing is that it involves the X-

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________  The first week of March was my first time visiting the site. I was in college. I had a lot of homework to do. I wasn't sure if I'd get the homework done in time, so I'd be late.  I'd been trying to track down and review the movies of the day on a daily basis. I found it hard to do because I couldn't decide which movie I liked more. I'd say something I liked, then later read somewhere online that another person liked that film better. I don't think I could remember whether it was a good or bad review. I would keep thinking of another review. So it didn't seem like I was trying to cover a wide range of films. I knew there were some good movies that I didn't see but wanted to check out anyway. This was one of them. It was rated R, but I still gave it a thumbs up. It reminded me of the TV series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, which had some good episodes and some great episodes. I think The Young Indy Jones Chronicles did the same kind of movie reviews.  of the week: __________  of the month: ________________  This was another film I didn the week of the 10th of April. I watched it two or three times after I watched the trailer on the internet. It doesn't get much better than a trailer and some nice shots. The movie had good production design. This film was about a man who is a soldier that goes to a desert island to try to help a young boy with an arm injury. He does a good job with his task, even though he thinks that the boy is lying. However, the boy tells a different story. The man then finds out that his child has been poisoned. There was a scene where the man's son was playing with a dog on the beach. I just thought the dog look a little funny. The kid then was running away from the beach when the dog bit his hand. I thought the film had good shots. It had some cool shots. I loved the music that was used in the film. It really made you feel like you were there. It is one of those movies that has good scenes and some scenes that just do not work. In the scene where a man is shooting some people, it was difficult to find the shot that is on a TV monitor behind him. If you like old western movies, this one might be right

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ It's so hard for me to be negative. I've never been that way. I'm so positive and upbeat on my blog, on social media, and that has always been the way I've been. When I went to the audition I had a really good time, even though I was not expecting to be cast. I met one of the producers from the show and we got along really well. It wasn't the audition that I think was the worst or anything like that but it definitely wasn't a very good one. It was kind of a drag because I felt like I was being used to promote the show, but it was also hard because I had nothing to lose. I didn't want to say anything or have my agent call my agent and tell her that I wouldn't be in a show like that. It felt kind of like a lie, but at the same time I had to do it. I thought it was a joke until they sent me home to Florida where they were filming the second season. When they told me that I had been cast I was in shock. I wasn't even supposed to go home and they were already planning on filming the whole season in Florida. I thought they were going to be filming on my own time so that it wouldn't affect me. I was completely stunned when I got home. I told my parents right away. I felt really sorry for them because they are from the Philippines and they don't know anything about what's going on. I think it's funny because it was like I had said something about how I felt they weren't paying attention to me and now all of a sudden they were like oh I have your number and you're the next girl. I had never done any acting before. I actually just started going to the gym to get my body back and do some exercise. I still went to high school. I started working out but I didn;t do any modeling. Then one day, like I told them, I actually was in the gym when I saw them on the TV. I asked them about their lives and their lives in America. They told me they wanted to do something in the business and were going into school to pursue it and then they actually made the show. When you're doing something like that you have to have an idea of where you want to go, so it just kind of all started coming together. It's really cool because it kind of shows that you can get into something

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ __________ Write a negative review about an average movie:  A little too cheesy to have much impact but still a pretty funny and good movie. I liked the story and the characters very much, however, they did make some silly mistakes, not sure why the bad guys were going to use those "old school" explosives (at least I think they were). It was still a fun movie but not really a stand out and maybe the end just didn't match up to the rest of the movie. It was the least "over-the-top" of the "Die Hard" films and was not like "Die Another Day". __________________________  Yes, it is a pretty long movie so watch it after your first movie! I saw it on VHS at my local video store and it is still pretty funny even today. It has a few funny moments but nothing too out of the ordinary. I did enjoy the film but I think it would be better with some more action. The action doesn't really go that well here. The film is about an agent who is sent to a hotel to investigate a "terrorist" attack. After getting stuck in the hotel room, he goes on a quest to find the terrorists, which includes a chase in a golf course and a chase by a helicopter in the middle of the city. When the agent first comes to a gunfight he starts running but when he gets hit by the bullet he stops to pick up the weapon. He shoots some of the terrorists then takes his gun back to get the one who shot him. The one who just shot him is revealed to be the bad guy. The bad guy goes into a shootout with the agent and it gets intense. There is a little too much humor throughout the movie and I guess that was a little overdone. I guess it was just a bad choice to make the movie that way. When they were running through the hotel I was laughing so hard I almost cried. It's a good film but you have to watch it to know why it was a success. Overall, it's still a good flick! _________________________  The only downside of this movie is that it has some problems with its dialogue and scenes. It starts off OK, but the story eventually goes downhill and it becomes too silly. I found myself laughing and laughing at the same time but it just didn.t add anything to the story. That's not really the movie's fault but it was my fault
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This was absolutely fantastic!" 5 star review: "Love the story and the characters are amazing" 4.   My Best Friend's Wedding 2 [4/10] My Best Friend is a bit of a wimp when it comes to marriage, but then again, he's not even from here. The original My Bestfriend's Wedding, released a few years prior to the one in question, managed to have a similar dynamic to this one, as one of the main characters, Jeff, was married to a guy who was a complete asshole and she just wanted a normal life. A bit different, no? The premise of this one is basically the same, as a wedding is held for one of their closest friends, only this time they are joined by a total stranger named Chris who is in town for the wedding. This movie isn't as good as the one released earlier in the year, but it still manages to have some good bits in it. One of those bits is a part that takes place in the bride's room, but there's so much more going on in there! This is an okay romantic comedy with lots of heart and it's worth checking out if you like the original film. 5. The One I Love [6.5/10?] This is another one that didn't fare too well at the box office, with only $5.5 million in sales. It was also a sequel to another movie which I didn't really like at all, so it's hard for me to comment too much on it. But I can say that I felt that it had a lot of promise to it. It has a bit more to offer in the way of character development and story than the previous film, but I don't think that it really got a lot more out of it than that. It's just average.   6. My Sister's Wedding [7/10+?] I actually loved this movie. I loved every single moment of it and it had everything you could want from a rom-com. The cast was really great and the writing was great and this was a comedy with romance thrown in. It had everything. I think it was the only movie that I actually went to see on opening night that was able to get the audience to go and see the rest of the movie. As a result, I was really bummed to see it go down with a whimper, but with an entire week off

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________ The Bad News Bears  (1997) When you're 7, you know you can be a bad person. I think the kids today are like that. We've gotten so caught up in the technology and technology we've lost the ability to be kind and kind people. I remember watching The Bad News Bear and being like, "Wow, this is kind of cool. This is something I can remember and I want to see it again." You know what I mean? It's like when you look at a movie and it's really great, and you want to have it again because it's so good.  So the movie is great, you want it, and then you realize that there's something about the movie that really, really tickles your funny bone and you have to see that movie again. ________________________________________________ There's one movie I don't think I've seen in the theaters that's a sequel to the movie, but it's called The Bad and the Beautiful  and it's an older, older version of the movie. And that was the first time that was ever done on film, is that what you mean? _______________________________________ The Good Die Young (1973) I like it. ________________ The Godfather (1972) The Good Die Poor  is a great movie. ________________________ The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (1971) I've never seen it, but I remember loving it.  And I think what makes it so cool, is the first movie of mine when I was little, when I started watching movies, was The Man from Planet X, which is my favorite movie. I went to a film festival at that time, a little film festival in Santa Barbara. And there was this screening of The Man From Planet X. And I was so mesmerized by it. And they started running a little clip of the film and I remember when they first started showing it, I couldn't look away. I was just so mesmerised by it because I had never seen a movie that was so powerful. _____________ Star Trek: First Contact (1996) I'm a huge Star Trek fan. I've watched all the original series.  There was one I was interested in for some reason that I'm not sure if I've ever seen. And it was called Star Trek: The Motion Picture, but that was, you can't say that.

The Big Short  Directed by Adam McKay  Written by Jordan Peele & Brad Stine  Starring: Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Andrew Garfield, Jesse Eisenberg, Tyler Perry, Adam McKay, Adam Shankman  You would think that Adam McKay's best-known film would be something a little more polished than The Big short. While there's a lot of fun in it, there's also a lot that doesn't go according to plan, including a lot more humor than you would expect in a comedy about financial fraud. It's also about a bunch of very different people, which helps it stand out from other film comedies. It will also likely appeal to anyone who has seen one of McKay's other films like Ant-Man or Draft Day. , 88 minutes  The film tells the story of short sellers and the way they were prosecuted after their investment losses caused the economy to collapse. It also highlights the effects of greed and lack of caution when it comes to dealing with money. The short sellers played a key role in causing the financial collapse, and while most of them were later prosecuted by the government, the government ultimately did not give them a fair shake and allowed them to go free.

Like it was from a film or an album. The tune reminded me of a song I liked. It was kind of depressing. It made me think about my father. The lyrics were haunting, "I'm sure you want to go down to hell...but I won't let you/I'm holding on to you, I'll hold on to your soul." It didn't bother me at all. I'm really glad I got this album. It's not just some '80s crap, it's an actual '80's album.

It sounds like an album, like a collection of old songs, like something from the past. I've never heard this song before. I'll never listen to it again.

It brings back memories." -- Bobbie Gentry of the Flaming Lips, producer of 1984's soundtrack to "Witch Hunter"   was released as the theme song for the 1984 movie "The Wizard of Oz." The album became a cult classic and spawned two hit singles, "That Old Black Magic" and "That '70s Song."was released as part of the "Dangerous Minds" series, and the album became one of the most influential in the history of rock and roll.The album's cover was designed by John Kander (best known for his work in the band Pink Floyd ).

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ What are some of your favorite books or movies?  If you could write a movie script, what would it be about?  to answer the question.  A very interesting movie to look at in terms of what the movie is, how it's written, how the actors are portraying it, the visual effects they're using, the sound design that's being used. It's a fascinating movie. And I don't think anybody would argue that it's a very well written script. And the script that's in the movie, the only other movie that has a screenplay like that is Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. And even that has quite a bit of dialogue in it. It actually starts out as a radio play before it's produced. But the script, you just watch it unfold. The visual effects are pretty amazing. I've heard all the criticism of it being too computer generated or too computer enhanced and all that. But you watch it. You see it's all done very well. The sound design, the way they use sound in the film, is one of my favorite things in it because it's the same way that Star Wars and Back To The Future are done. So it's interesting to see the same techniques that have worked for those movies in a different genre. .  to get to a certain point in the book, but it seems that it ends pretty abruptly. I'm wondering if you would be interested in the following quote that you just quoted from a guy named Frank Kerman, who wrote the screenplay for it. Kerman was actually married to the actress, Mary Badham. And Frank told us in an interview about the movie that he felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. The ending of the book is very confusing because it goes from beginning to end so fast and then they all go off together to a new place together. And then when you're talking to the characters about why they went off together and where they went to, the ending's kind of like: What are they going to do now? The character they're talking about in the beginning didn't disappear. They all went off to another place together and it's like, where are they? Where's the character we came to know, and what are they now doing? We're not told. And that to me is just very unsatisfying. It's very confusing. The book is confusing in a very interesting way. It has a very clever ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  I like this movie a lot. It is really good. I wish it was rated a little higher, because it gets a bit old after the first 20 minutes. The film is made to make you want to be an astronaut, but the reality of it is that you will never be. The main character is extremely awkward and his only friends are a scientist and an engineer. His best friend is a little girl who only likes boys, so when you first meet her, you can see her crush on him.   However, it is not a tragedy. There are very few scenes where the main character's feelings are hurt. I don't mean he can't cry, but he's not an emotional person. It doesn't happen. The best way to describe the film is that it is an old time story about how a man's life really is like. It has no happy endings, but that is because the movie never tries to. It does not try to make people feel good about anything. It just tells the story. And it does a great job.  , so I did not think much of it. I was just really happy to get to see a movie with an alien in it.I like the movie a bit. I wanted to love it, but it got a little old. It was pretty good though. It starts off pretty good. It's an old school story about a man who lives alone in space. He has to deal with his friends not liking him, his family not knowing why he is gone for so long, and the fact that he is just a little boy. I found it funny how it was almost as if all the people were trying to be funny. And to the guy who said "what about my feelings?," I said, "it really doesn't matter, you'll never be an actor!" He was very confused. He didn't know what to say. The people were also pretty good, but I think they got a bit out of hand. There were a lot of moments where they would make fun of the guy and there was also a really funny scene where they had a fake robot in their spaceship. There was also an interesting story. But I found that it got to be really long for a film that was so short. I really enjoyed the way the film was made. I also liked how the characters interacted. One of the actors was so good at bringing out the character of the main guy. He really

It is a good film, but in my opinion it is better than Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, which is a great film in its own right. Star Wars is a perfect saga. The original trilogy is so good that people will see it and become loyal fans. The prequels are mediocre. I think Star Wars: Episode III is a much better film. I am hoping that the prequel will be even better.  Rated 3 out of 4 by Mereel from Great film, weak script The film is very good with good performances, and the script was very good. The problem is that the director and actors are mediocre (I will not elaborate about the bad characters since they have already been discussed). The story is very weak, so it will make very little sense for the viewer. It is very difficult to connect to the characters, and it is a very confusing and confusing film. At least, it is for me. I liked it, but not a whole lot. This is a film that people should check out only if they are familiar with the saga, and if they have never watched the original trilogy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ I got this a while ago from the movie theatre, the picture is not too good, but the sound is really good. The movie starts really fast and there is a great action scene. Then there is another one which is a good romance, but it's not like this movies and it doesn't have much plot, and then there is the ending. I'm not sure if this movie can be called a good love story, it's just like two people who love each other. But, I loved it and I hope you will too. If you have not watched the movie before, watch it before you watch this one. Best movie I watched last year:  "Jury Duty" Best action movie I've seen:    Best horror movie I saw:  This movie doesn't had the best story, but you can really feel the characters and what they are feeling, like a lot of films. I think this movie was really funny, but I didn't like how I didn' t understand everything that was happening, I'm sure it's because it was in Hindi and the movie didn't have subtitles. I really like this movie and it was the best action movie of 2016 so far.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The Best Picture nominees are all excellent in their own way, and as the moviegoers vote, they can only go so far. It's a tough fight to get past the Best Actor award to the final category and, on paper, it looks as though The Theory of Everything's Eddie Redmayne is the strongest of all contenders.  Of course, Eddie Redmustard has won many awards and has had the biggest names in Hollywood behind him. What's more, it's his first lead role in a major motion picture, a very rare occurrence, and one that could set the stage for the future of his career. He's been recognized as a new director and, even as a leading man in his first film, Eddie has yet to be labeled a "sex symbol," and that's a problem. (To be fair, he's not the only leading man to be accused of not being sexy. Michael Fassbender is a very handsome leading man who plays a very hot guy in Steve Jobs, and he is a sex symbol as well. It was no secret that both Redmaynes were fans of the man.)  Here's the thing: If you can't get past Eddie Redmande, what chance do you have of being noticed by the Academy? And even if he gets in, it doesn't necessarily mean that The Theory Of Everything will go on to win Best Picture or Best Director. And yet, this is a year where The Theory is very likely to get the Best Picture nomination and will almost certainly win the Best Director award, because it's Eddie's movie. The other two nominees in that category are The Imitation Game and 12 Years a Slave, both beautifully directed, both very personal movies with an artist in the lead role. (Though 12 Years is far more autobiographical.) Eddie will almost surely win the lead actor prize, even though he has never been a leading actor. The film is also very good, a complex psychological drama about the way that people try to fit in to the world and the culture they live in. While it's difficult to separate the emotional weight of the characters' story from the movie's larger themes about the nature of identity and relationships, there is a palpable sense of place in the film. The Theory's characters are in different locations at different times, and their lives are completely intertwined. (Perhaps the most striking example is the scene in the hotel room in which RedmayNEy's Harry looks up from the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________  The other day I read a review on a book called The Best of H.G. Wells by Steven Spielberg.  It was very interesting and I thought the review was well done. The book was written by someone who has read a lot of Hg Wells and knows many of his books. And the person who wrote the review had seen the movie a few times. The book contains some very interesting things, and I'm sure if you read it you will find interesting things to read about Hg Wellses work. But at first glance the book seems to be biased, and just a little bit dated. I'm not sure whether this is an intentional attempt to promote the movie, or if the writer had not actually read the book. Hg Wells was a man of many contradictions. He was a very different character in different periods of time. Wells would also say he was "the greatest writer of the 20th century". The man had very much of a man's mind. It took a genius like Wells to understand the nature of the human mind.   Hg's life was very contradictory. On one hand, he wrote about his experiences, which included writing stories and many of the books and stories he wrote, but on the other hand, Wells also was a secret government spy and kept a lot about the life and times of his friends under lock and key. In fact, Wells often hid his friends, and friends of friends, in plain sight. This fact has been kept in some of the Wells stories. Many of the stories involve Wells trying to find someone or something that could save his friends or family. One of Wells stories is of a boy who is kidnapped, and when the boy's father, he gets Wells information from his kidnappers. Then when Wells learns the identity of the kidnappers he reveals that he has killed them. Later on he meets with the kidnapper's son who is also the son of Wells father. When the kidnaper's son learns that his father was killed by Wells he gets angry, and he punches Wells in the face. That was the son who had the secret life of Wells. A life that Wells hid from his wife and all those around him. Why he would try to save his best friend, and hide his knowledge from others in the process I do not know. Perhaps Wells did not care if he

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ If this movie has anything good in it it is the fact that the movie is about the real life of a man that was in the military who was in Iraq with his dog while he was taking his last stand. The movie was pretty much his first time doing movies. It was the first time he ever shot a gun, although he did it before he came to Hollywood. It is also the first movie he ever had sex with an 18 year old girl. His ex wife of 10 years is his wife in real life and her name is Jodi. It also is the first film that he did with a girl he met in New York. Jodi is a beautiful woman that is 21 years old and is an actress. They were dating a few weeks before they shot the movie. Jodie Foster plays his ex wife and the movie has a very good and funny scene with her and James Franco. Jody Foster and James are very funny in this movie and it really gets you laughing. The film is about a man and his dog as they have to save each other and go on a mission to fight an enemy that has taken over an area. They are on a very difficult mission. The enemy was a man, who was very powerful and very smart. He had the ability to command every single soldier around him, the soldiers didn't know what to do in order to try to stop him. It didn't really go very well for them. The last scene was a little bit hard to see in the movie because the camera angle was so low that we didn't see everything that was going on. The guys didn't seem to know what they were supposed to do. The other thing that I didn't understand at all was how the guy who played the enemy had such perfect teeth that was hard to believe. I thought it was just a movie made to try and make a good profit. This was just one of those movies that you wish you could watch more times. _______________________________________________________________________________________

So I listened to the soundtrack, found "The Boys Are Back in Town" by Ozzy Osbourne and thought it would be the kinder, gentler soundtrack that the movie had promised, but I never got a chance to see the film. Then this year I had a chance. I picked up a copy at the theater and read the review by The Onion and knew immediately I had to see this film.   So this is a very short film with great music, some funny moments, a lot of action and a cool ending (to say the least). It was released in 1982 and was written and directed by John Hughes. The story has some of the typical problems of the times, with a lot going on at once.  The story opens on a beach where kids are surfing and drinking beer. They're interrupted by an ominous voice that says that a monster has come out of the sea. The kids think it's a sea monster and chase it away. , the main character, finds a strange movie called "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street" and says it's too scary.

He takes the kids down to the basement where the sack is still there.  is a guy who's afraid of heights and says that if he's going to be on the hill he's better off under it than in a car, so he goes to the local zoo to see if they have a monkey who can go up trees and talk to him.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ I gave it a 7/10, it is well made, well acted, and well edited, however, I was annoyed by the film's dialogue. It was not as smooth and fluid as I had hoped and I was not very happy with the writing, not sure what it was trying to say, but the writing is awful. The main character was an idiot (sorry, it's not that I have no respect for him), there were a few stupid choices in the film, but I thought it was a very enjoyable watch and the ending was good and fitting. It is not for everyone, it might not be for you, but you should watch it anyway. (Posted on 10/10/2011)  Good movie, bad actors. by Matt H. Reviewed on: 08/24/2011 This was the first and only movie I've ever seen about an astronaut and his encounter with a dying alien. This movie was directed by William Friedkin (the same guy who did the movie The Exorcist). As far as I am concerned, this movie is awesome and you have to see it to believe it. The acting was solid throughout. This was also the only movie that I saw by William J. Gass, the actor who played the part of Carl Weathers. (Sorry, but he doesn't have a good case for the Worst Actor award.) The movie was written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and the cast was excellent. The aliens were pretty cool too. The story was intriguing enough and it was well told. The movie has a very suspenseful plot and at least for me, I really enjoyed it. It just ended up being a little too short for me. I thought the ending sucked and I found the ending to be the most anticlimactic, but this movie was great. (It was very good to start with, I'm sure you have a better opinion, let me know.) I think you should at least see it, you might be surprised at what you find out. (I enjoyed it and I think it was okay, but don't watch it if you are not an action/sci-fi/horror fan or you don't like the kind of movies I tend to like.) I can also tell you that it is not as good as it used to be. I remember that the special effects were still pretty good, but there were fewer shots and the special-effects shots were also not as nice,

I do not know a single person who found the content of 'Mulholland Dr.' inspiring.

There is no artistic genius involved in this movie and the actors were terrible. I don't know how they came up with any of this stuff, but it's a big mess. You should just stick to the art of acting and not try and out do your director. Just because you think you're one of the funniest people in the world doesn't mean everyone around you will find it funny. I will say that I did laugh a couple times during this movie, because it was a nice change from the usual "I'm glad I got to see it" kind of laughter. There was a time when I would go to a movie and just sit there with my eyes closed until it was over. I would not sit through something as awful as this anymore. It was more like watching a movie that was too long and the director couldn't tell a good joke. It took the "Mullet" out of my heart, in a very bad way.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  Why?  "Why?" is a very popular question in the movie world. It is a great question to ask. It will give you a good idea of the personality of the person or team behind the movie.  The first step is to determine what is the audience's motivation for seeing the movie? Do you see it as a simple entertainment product or as a form of education for its audience? .  with great education, you have more opportunity to communicate with people of other cultures. This is especially true with movies. Movies are a perfect vehicle for the spread of knowledge and culture. If you want your movie to do well with audiences, then you must think of the audience as your customer. You must think not only of the people inside the theater but of their families and friends in the rest of the world. What do they want to see? What does it mean for them? What is their hope? What are their fears? All these questions should be considered. Are there specific themes that the movie will help to explore?

It is not true, but it is also true that no matter how the redpill is presented it is always a red pill movie. 2a. For the red pilled man this may be a mixed bag; the first 30 minutes were good but then everything got really bad. The bad parts were a mix of over-the-top and cringe, but there was also a good balance. The best part of the movie is that the viewer is treated like a child and given free will, no matter what happens, as long as the movie was entertaining. 2b. The worst part of it was the "red pill" guy and how he talked down to and humiliated the young, innocent looking girl (as if he knew she was just a child) and made fun of her for being "so fucking retarded" and other such things. 2c. I was also very disturbed by how his family treated the boy and tried to stop him from being educated. He was constantly referred to as a child, even by the family and never asked how the boy was doing. The kid was pretty much just treated as a tool for entertainment purposes. This was very weird to see coming from a "red pilled" man. 2d. The ending of the film was also pretty bad, there were several plot holes, there was no way that the girl could have learned about the redpilled guy's real life life experience, nor was the family's knowledge of him true. All of it just made the movie seem really rushed. The Red Pilled Man 1. It's not a movie about the man-woman relationship. The movie is about the woman who is trying to discover her true nature; to discover what a "real man" is like. She can't help but to believe that there is a "man" lurking behind every woman's face. She starts to feel guilty about it and try to change her ways, but what she actually has to deal with is the fact that she is simply a walking brain-dead vagina, with the ability to only think in two ways: 1. the womanly way; and 2.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Theatricality: The film is entirely contained within the same theater where the film was originally shown, so there is not much need to worry about "special features." I did not notice any extras (although the DVD does come with a couple of deleted scenes). Visuals: ______________________________________________________ The film looks absolutely beautiful, especially at night, but the movie is still quite dark and dreary, with just enough color to make the characters pop a little. The lighting is great, and the film is very well-lit. The costumes are gorgeous, the hair is lovely, and I can't stop looking at the faces, especially the faces of the girls. Sound:  _______________________________________________ I really enjoyed the music, with some strong, beautiful piano and strings throughout, and some good ambient sounds to help give the film a more ethereal feel. The voice actors all have great voices and do a great job with them. The opening theme is great as well, and has quite a good theme song. My only complaint is that the sound effects at times are way too loud and intrusive. Extras: ______________________________________________________________________________ The special features on the DVD include a featurette on the making of the film, and interviews with the cast. The audio commentary by Peter Biskind is also included. Overall: ______________________ Overall, this film was very beautiful. I was really impressed by how well the filmmakers were able to capture the mood and look of the 1970s, and how they blended both an optimistic and pessimistic view of the future with just the right amount of sadness. I especially liked how the film made me think about the way society is changing. The film also made me sad because it made me wish there were no future for me and my friends. There are so many questions left unanswered, such as what it means to be an artist in a world where the art is being commodified and sold to the highest bidder, and what happens to the artists after the paintings they make have been put on display for all the world to see, or when they are taken down to be "used." I was also sad that I have no idea what my future is going to be in 2040, as the filmmakers did a great, great job of painting a realistic picture of how our world is changing and will continue to change. ______________________________________________________________ Visit the website of the filmmakers: _____________ This movie is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and horror.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ "You may have heard about a new blockbuster movie with a $100 million budget. Well, we're talking about a movie that costs $4,000. The movie is called "Wake Up Dead" and it's a movie made by an unknown filmmaker (who just happened to be a member of the same amateur comedy troupe of the 1970s as Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David) and stars an unknown cast of actors. You may not know the name of the star. But you've seen his work. His name is Paul Rudd. Paul Rudd plays the role of the head of the company responsible for a new drug which is going to change the course of the world for the better, but he just can't stop himself from having sex with pretty women. A lot of those women are prostitutes, and the first thing Paul Rudd does after taking his first hit of this new wonder drug is fuck them. "What are you doing?" he asks a prostitute while he's making love to her."  -review from the movie's website  http://www.thereviewjournal.com/2012/01/wake-up-dead-review-paul-rudd-and-the-dumb-jokes-of-wake-dead  "Paul Rudd is the kind of man who knows exactly what he wants and goes after it. And he's right there in "Waken-up Dead".  He plays Ben. He's a straight-laced guy who has worked on this new company, "Waking Dead", but has had a bit of a change of heart. He thinks it's time that the world should wake up. So he decides to come up with a new substance to help the world. So, he calls up his friend Tom, a guy he met in college who has a bit more experience with drugs and chemicals.  After a lot of talking to Tom, Ben decides that they need to come to New York City and bring in some "Wakes". Ben knows that he can get a "Wook" in New York for a few thousand dollars. As it happens, Tom's wife, who is the manager of a club in the city, will pay for it. It's all very "New York" and "funny" but there are some things about "Walking Dead" which are not.  "I was expecting a zombie movie with the plot of "Night of the Living Dead

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here's my favorite quote from the book:   When they finally met, they were at an age and in a situation where they could really get to know one another. When they did, he was charming and she was kind; when they didn't, she was smart and he was impulsive; they grew apart as their careers grew more different. "You're young," the director said when they had finished. "So is your actress." And the actor replied, "She's older than I am."   So that's what happens when you marry a celebrity!  (You'll also need a celebrity to help with the cooking and cleaning and all that other stuff you used to do when you were single.) As far as dating goes, I think that most of us who are single and don't have kids would have a hard time finding someone who really understands what we are going through.  That being said, I found that most couples are actually really good at reading people.  I think they are really good about picking out the people who are the best match.  They are able to pick people who have the same tastes in music and movies and food as they do and are able find those individuals.  Some people are really smart and others aren't, but in the end, you can't get too smart about it and everyone can be good at something.  Now that you've read this blog, if you want to get the full picture and try to figure out if you are worth dating, I highly recommend that you read my new book, The Unofficial Guide to Dating a Celebrity.

I recommend you to go and watch it.   with all the different kind of stories that this movie tells. You get to see many different situations and you have to decide which one is the best one.   in my opinion, they could have made more films with these same characters.   a movie that is funny, scary, emotional, funny and interesting. The best part is that it ends in the best way.   that the ending was so good I had the feeling the movie was only meant for me and my friends. I loved the movie and i will watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________The only real criticism I'll leave with is that I felt like we missed out on a few interesting things, such as the film being very different when it was shot in black and white, but the film as a whole worked well and we got to enjoy the film for what it was. If I could have gone to see this film in black & white, I might have been more excited to see what the final product was like. The picture and sound are great, but there were times when the movie started to drag a bit, especially when the villain came back and changed the story a bit and we didn't know what was going to happen next, because of this. I think the movie could have been much better if we knew more about the villains and the backstory of the main character. However, the movie as a total did great and this is probably my favorite action movie of this year.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why? To increase your chances of getting a movie made. I write reviews for movies. It's one of the things that I've learned how to do best. If you can be honest with people about what they're seeing and the way it's being done, you're going to be rewarded for it in the end. You might not get the movie you were hoping for, but if you're honest with the people who will be seeing the movie, you might have a better time. The biggest misconception people have is that people are going to read the book and decide not to see the movie. It might happen one time. But chances are, after they see the film, they're going tell you that they would definitely see the book. I don't know about you, but I'm very pleased that people liked it. A lot of people did. But they also liked the movie in a different way. They liked the book in that it was very different. If they saw the film in that way, it would not have worked for them.  What about the negative reviews? What did you think about them?  I really didn't watch much of them. I didn't read the comments. I wasn't interested. I was kind of bored by it. I felt I already knew how to get it made. If people say anything, it will be interesting to see if it changes people's minds. Maybe the people that have read it and liked it will write more positive reviews. I feel like it's been written already, so who cares. I think that people can take what they want.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________ The Movie - 5/5 (great movie, a great action-packed movie. The cast is great. The story is well-told, but does go a bit overboard sometimes, such as one major character who is essentially a villain in all but name, but the movie doesn't seem to care and makes it look like they are the only ones who know or care) Overall - 4/5 - The Movie is good, but can't quite get past the problem of the final act. It's really good, and could have been even better. But it's not enough for me to recommend it, because the film doesn't quite make it work and is a bit too much for some to handle.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ (Don't put down the movie you saw)  Tell us about your favorite movie, or any movie:  The first movie that I ever watched was, 'The Great Escape.' I couldn't believe it. They were trying to escape from Germany when it was bombed. The people that they were escaping with were being killed. And I thought, 'This is the greatest movie ever! And now I can't believe that this is the world.' And I couldn 't believe it, but the film was amazing.  You've done a lot of documentaries and now you are going to start your own series on PBS. , how does that come about?  I have always loved documentary, I'm an archivist in a way. I like finding out what happened so I could tell my children what it was like. . "I'm a historian. I'm always looking back and looking forward.

I hated the character of Peter, and how he made everyone around him feel like garbage. I also hated the director, who I didn't even like much. But then I watched the second movie, and it all changed for me. I started to like and sympathize with Peter, but that feeling was fleeting because that was not the actor's fault. It was the director's fault for making me hate him so much that I stopped caring about him. I thought the same about the actors who played the other characters in the movie. I saw the whole thing as a terrible idea, but I didn.t care and thought it was a fun and exciting film. The story about the giant spider was really cool and I enjoyed seeing a new character's development. I loved all the twists and turns of the movie."

I think I was surprised to find just how good this is. It's a little too long, but I think if it had been edited to remove some of the extra stuff, it would've gone a lot better. I found the special features to be mostly decent, and I think they are a good addition to the collection. I'm not sure I'd pay for a whole DVD of it, but if it was just an "oldies" collection, it'd be an okay buy.

Don't write a review about something you did not enjoy:  When I think of a movie that is not for me, my first thought is that the movie is not good.  For example, I love Aeon Flux because it is a good science fiction movie with some good characters, but the movie does not work for me.   If I was to rate a movie on a scale of 1 to 10, I would give the movie a 10.5 because I enjoyed the movie.  If you have never been to a movie theatre in your life, read my review:     Read about my trip to the Cineplex on my blog:        If I were a reviewer, I'm sure I'd write something like "This movie is amazing, this movie is so exciting, and this movie just happens to be great!"  But that's not my job!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ The reviews have been out there for a while. Here's my take on what I think is the best movie of the year (so far):1. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies – An excellent film that is not only visually stunning, but has some of the best writing in a long time. It's packed with action and tension, as well as some of Tolkien's best writing. Even though it's the second part of a trilogy, it feels like its own thing.2. Creed – If you've watched one movie this year, it's probably Creed. This movie had some of my favorite fight scenes and moments in a movie for years. The story of a young boy who has to find a way to save the world from a group of terrorists is an interesting one, and Michael B. Jordan really does a wonderful job in playing the part. I just hope the next movie doesn't turn out like Creed II.3. The LEGO Movie – LEGO has finally been able to pull off a decent animated film (and they've been making movies for years) that is fun. The fact that this one doesn't take itself too seriously is a big plus. It is also funny, and has some great characters, but the overall theme of this movie is too serious.4. Boyhood – This movie is one of the great coming-of-age movies, and is a beautiful film to watch. Michael Keaton is amazing, and the story is one that you can't help but feel for. It will be long remembered as one of, if not the best film of the decade.5. Interstellar – There's not much to say about this movie. It does what it does, and does it well. It makes you feel connected to the characters, and gives you a feeling of wonder. But ultimately it doesn't matter because it was a great movie.I don't know if anyone's been keeping track of the Oscar nominations, but it seems like some of this year's best movies are the best science fiction and fantasy movies, as usual. Boy, was I surprised. There are so many awesome movies that I've never heard of that will make it to the big screen. In addition, there's a new Best Picture nominee that should make people laugh and cry, which is always a good thing. It looks like the Best Picture race could be a good one, with several contenders in different categories.So, what are your picks? Do you

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This is the most amazing film ever." The movie was a good film:  This movie is great! "We all need to see this." How did you feel about the movie?  "Amazing and funny, and I loved the music." I loved how the movie was written and how it played on the whole of the world. We've heard that it was a film of the year candidate, but I never found it boring. I also like it that the film is not all just on the surface of the ocean and how the characters come up with different solutions to the problem. Also the story isn't the same every time it happens, and it's interesting to see how the people change throughout the film. It doesn't go down every time like in a TV series and there are many different endings. There was only one time that I was expecting to be angry at the ending because the film did leave me frustrated. That's because there's an ending that felt forced, as the ending of a movie should, and was done without the proper amount of time to breathe and let the characters be real. It felt like I was expected to go with what the characters were doing instead of thinking for myself and watching the film like a normal person. But it was still a great film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  "I think we're living in the most exciting time in the history of cinema and the most exhilarating time in human history"  - Roger Ebert   [on playing the part of Mr. Rogers]  He was the quintessential American, and to do a caricature of him was very tempting. It was an easy sell. He was really down to earth, and he was so genuine.   (On his career)  (In 1963)...and I got involved in that thing about whether television was going to be the next big thing, and there were two networks there who were trying to make this happen....I thought television was a great opportunity for a guy like me. I'm not a television person, but I liked the idea of going on TV and interacting with people. I thought it was a way for me to get a chance to see what it was like from the point of view of a performer.     I had heard about the new television show that NBC was putting together. I saw a couple of episodes, and thought, "Oh yeah, this is perfect." It would be great if I got a chance on this new TV show, and, "Who would I play?" The character was very important to me, so I just went in and did the audition. And I loved it. And that was the way it was with everything I did in television, "What the heck, it's TV! It might be good!"   The first thing I ever said to an interviewer was "I love to see a movie with dialogue." It was the first thing they asked me. [on his TV character on 'The Mike Douglas Show' (1963)]  When I was doing television, it was not like the other stuff.... TV was a different world. It wasn't about being funny. It's not about looking sexy. It isn't about dressing up in a funny hat and pretending you're somebody else. And it was very exciting and interesting.  I thought it might be a great idea to play a television character, and I went in with some sort of idea that I would try and play it on the television show. I always liked that it was kind of like the movies: the idea that someone's playing the role, not who they are, but playing the character. I don't remember the particulars of my idea of the character, but the idea was to do something that

His commanding officer (Andrew Garfield) and a doctor (Jackie Earle) disagree.  So they suggest that Doss do something unpleasant, like cut out an eye. (Doss's character didn't see his fellow soldiers as fellow human beings.)  "Well, it'll be a waste of a good eye," says DOSS. "No one will ever forgive me."  And so, as Doss is asked to do what he's told, he's forced to cut out his friend (Desmond Doss).  A little more work goes out the door, and Desmond is told that he needs to do some more.  the movie "Hack" was the last film to be shot with the 35mm format.  and to be released in New York and Los Angeles this week, it's a film in which "Hacking" is a metaphor.  that DOSS is a "hacker" is clear. He's a hero in the movie — the very definition of the word — but he is a hacker. 'the idea that the soldier is actually a hero is also a symbol of our time, where you can do this kind of hacking but not be a hero." Andrew Garfield  Filmmakers and filmgoers are now seeing that in order to be a superhero, a hero must be a super-hacker.  "The idea that DOL is a 'hacker' is clear," Garfield said during a panel discussion at the SXSW film festival in Austin, Texas, last week.  of course, the hero is still a hero.  to be fair, DOSS gets some credit for his efforts, and not just because he's a soldier. "Hacker" was written and directed by Charlie Kaufman, whose other screenplays include "Synecdoche, New York" and "Being John Malkovich."  was a film about computer

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. I think it will be interesting to see if anyone has actually done that yet. In any case, a quick note on the script: ______________________________________. The script is interesting, and a lot of it is really well thought out. It's also quite dense, which is to be expected, but there are still some very good parts. It also has a lot going on in the background. One thing that I do really like about the script is that it goes in depth about the characters (particularly the three main characters) and their backgrounds. For example, in the last act, the characters get back together (and even reunite for some brief moments), and you get to see that they are still in touch with their friends, and there are some real emotional moments between them. There are also some nice comedic moments. ___________________________________. So, what do you think? Do you like this script? Should you give it a shot? I'm interested to hear your thoughts.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ If the movie is good, then it's the critic's job to write a review. We can't do it without a sense of humor and an understanding of what makes the best movies so great. If the reviewer is a fan of a particular actor or director, but doesn't get why the film works, then they're missing the point. Don't ever let anyone tell you what you should or shouldn't say about a movie. If a movie was bad, then the reviewer would still have to write about it, right? So, if you have a favorite film, watch it and decide if you're happy or not, because if it's not, then you probably wouldn't be happy either. I hope that helped.

If you can look past the fact that the show is on CBS and can't afford to get a new set of Blu-Rays, you can get this as a pretty good bargain. It also runs on the same day as another hit comedy, 30 Rock.

Reyes- Santanamana I saw this movie at a good time. It was good enough to be made into a movie but not good enough that I didn't want to see it again. That isn't to say it was a bad movie. It didn't really do anything particularly wrong and while there weren't any good characters, there was a great deal of great performances. The story starts with a man (who will be called Peter in this review) who is trying to get into a new relationship. The woman who he is going for is a very good girl who has a great job, is very beautiful and has a really nice home in the suburbs of New Jersey. The problem is that the man has a lot of money, lives in New York and is not a very open and honest person and she thinks he isn't either. The man spends a lot more time than she would like trying to impress the woman with his money. After a few years the man begins to suspect that she is in love with him and he decides he needs to find out. The film is actually very well made with a good cast, and is well paced. However, it is pretty weak as it attempts to tell the story of a love triangle. If the love triangle had been handled better, there might have been more of an emotional impact to the story and I suspect that if the man had found out early on and he knew she was in love, the love story would have been much better. The way the film is told makes it hard to follow along with the story. In some scenes the film seems to be going in circles. Some scenes are much better than others and one character seems to go from one character to the next pretty quickly. The script is decent and the performances are strong enough. Overall, it doesn't really have a great story or strong performances. In the end it is a movie with a great cast and a very slow beginning.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tell me about your favorite parts and why. I want to know what made you watch this movie, and how this movie makes you feel.  I also want to understand how other people are feeling. _________________ I was going to add this to my top 10 list for 2015 but I had to go back and add in my second favorite.    The movie does not end with a bang, but when it does the payoff is outstanding.  This movie has a lot going on and I think people who are tired of war movies can really get excited for this one.  While we get to see the action in action movie theaters all the time, there have been some recent ones that make you think, "what the hell is going on here"   "I'm sure you guys know, we have a big day ahead of us"  I am not sure how much more I can say about this movie.  I will say that it is a little on the slow side.    This movie is about a team of soldiers going into a village, hoping that they can get the villagers to stop killing and fighting each other and they are told to leave, but they are not told the villagers are all going to start to kill each other.  Now imagine how fast this is going to happen.  The movie keeps making you think that they are being told to get out of there.  They are told the village is a war zone.  As it starts to happen they start to realize this is the end and that they have to do the right thing.  The first third of the movie has an amazing cast of actors.  With a big cast this movie really needs to stand out from the crowd.  Everyone is trying really hard to make you care about these people, and to make the viewer feel bad for them.  It's a very well done cast, with the exception of Jaimie Alexander (Fargo) as the female lead.  There are some really interesting ideas put into this movie and some of these ideas are amazing.  Some of the ideas are:  First is that they keep getting more and more injured.  A guy in the movie gets shot in the shoulder and another guy gets shot through the leg.  He has to learn how to use an amputation machine.  One of the soldiers has the chance to live when a woman, who is the only survivor of a massacre, gives her life

They're all in the top 10 in the IMDB, and all were in the running for the best of the year, but in no particular order. 10) I Am Not Your Negro In this black and white drama, which is set in the early 1900s, an African-American man, Moses Burroughs, comes to America to find work. When he finds out his employer has an interest in buying his farm, he decides to fight back by killing the man and then going on the run. I am not your nigger.    7. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo The first part of this new series from writer/director David Fincher is set during the 19th century, when a young woman is transported to a man's mind and raped.  The sequel is coming in 2013.   The girl with the dragon tattoo   9. In the Heart of the Sea This is a very good movie. I don't want to give too much away, but there are two women involved in the plot. I won't say more, but you can read the Wikipedia page, and the Wikipedia article is here.   The movie is the second of two in the Astrid Lindgren film series. In the heart of the sea.   10. Black Swan It's not a movie that many people will watch, but it's very good, and one that I highly recommend.  It's based on a true story of an architect who, at a very young age, meets the love of his life, and they get married, and then they have a daughter, and that's the story of the movie. There is a trailer here. Black Swan Trailer This year, I was looking forward to seeing In the heart, the first film of the trilogy. I'm sad to see it being released after so many years, but, like many good things in life, it must come to an end. The final film is being made in 2014.  Black Swan, Black Swan.   10-11) Captain Phillips A Navy SEALS' man, played by Tom Sizemore, goes undercover as a drug smuggler with the CIA, but he also has a secret code name that he can't talk about.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. __________. ____________________. _____________________________.  Do not make the mistake of thinking that I am talking about being positive about a movie. I would never make such a foolish decision, as it would be silly, unhelpful and possibly offensive to movie fans. Instead, I am just sharing what I think are some examples of ways that people can help their audience to be more positive about their own movie. A quick note about movie review etiquette: As you know, there is no such thing as a bad review, nor is it polite to criticize a movie to death. On the other hand, it is quite acceptable for movie fans to disagree with one another about how a movie turned out. To provide the right balance, I don't think it is appropriate to post negative comments about the movie. On my review site, I try to avoid having any "hated" movies and only have about ten reviews that are very negative. And, of course, my site has a "don't bother me" policy for any movie reviews. However, I do post the first three and a half chapters of "The Godfather" at the top of my site (on the left sidebar). And, since my site is designed so that each user sees only one movie review every two weeks, I always try to be as complimentary as possible. If a user disagrees with a movie review I posted, then I make sure they get a good review that reflects the movie in a good light. But when it comes to the review I have posted above, that is something I do not encourage. I am not even sure why I bothered to write this paragraph. I just have to get it out of my system. The following are the things I have learned as a critic about the art of movie reviews and criticism: 1) The most important thing you can do for a movie is to let the audience know you love the movie as much as they do. I am not talking about how much you enjoyed it, but about the sheer emotional impact you had watching it.  This is why my movie reviews always start with a quote from the movie, and end with a compliment. You don't want a movie reviewer to give the movie the benefit of the doubt and say it was just okay. 2) Never assume that your audience is more intelligent than you.  If a movie has great special effects or a compelling story, then it is okay for

I had the feeling my mind was wandering. I got out of my bed and walked toward the window. My head was in the air and I thought it was a funny scene out of a movie or something. I heard a slight laughter coming and when I turned around my eyes saw a group of three other people. One of them was making funny sounds, making a "Pffft" sound and laughing really hard. I thought to myself, "Wow. How many people is that from?" I turned back around and saw the other two people watching the other three guys making such funny sounds. I was dumbfounded. One person was making this funny sound and making such strange movements in the way he was doing it. He laughed really hard at the same time and I could not see what the funny sounds were. When the laughter stopped I saw the first one making funny noises and making weird movements. The second person was still laughing and laughing hard. When he stopped laughing I thought,
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________  "The Best of the Best is still a great, classic movie," one fan wrote in the comments section of our earlier review of The Godfather.  That's a tough task to judge, because if you're familiar with the film, you'll probably recognize almost everything in it. And if you've never seen it, the film's still a big movie — it's the most popular movie in the history of studio movies, as I found when we had a conversation about it. "It's just like how you know something if you watch it a thousand times. If you haven't seen it and it's that good, you know it," says Michael Apted, the Academy Award-winning composer of both the original soundtracks for the film and the two films to follow it. AptED was also the composer of the first two films, and his scores are so popular that he wrote a whole separate score for the third installment. (The Godfather: Part III is out now.)  To find the movie that is the best of the best, you'd have to go back to when Paramount released the first film in 1966, and the first score for The Godmother (1966). In those early days, the movie was considered by many critics to be among the greats, and AptEed's score, which combined classical elements with rock, jazz, and pop, was often mentioned alongside films by George Lucas (Star Wars) and Richard Strauss (The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp).  AptEED's soundtrack wasn't a completely new concept. In fact, Apte's music had been used for decades to accompany films, even before his score for Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest in 1959, which was one of the most famous and influential soundtracks of all time. But Aptere's music in Hitchcock's movie wasn't quite as iconic as his score to The God and Father of the Bride. , the score is both more epic and more catchy than its predecessor, and it incorporates all of the elements that the composer loved — including more rock, pop, and classical elements. There's also a subtle sense of suspense to the score, and a memorable score to match: a guitar solo in the film that is memorable in its melody and timbre, but also because it features the only time that the same piece of music is played by the same guitarist in two films. .   But
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________________________  I've been watching the trailer for 'Fifty Shades of Grey' lately, and I'm loving it. But since I've already seen the trailer, I'm wondering how this movie is different than 'Twilight'. Is it actually going to be that good? The trailer is a little strange and cheesy and the music seems to be written specifically for the trailer. Anyway, how will this movie change our perceptions of women and their sexual desire and behavior?   Well, it is not a typical Twilight book and the trailer suggests that it is the first of a trilogy. Is that true?   of the scenes you see in the trailer are:   * Derecka and Christian at a dance club   And there are no characters we've seen before who are into BDSM, nor any sex scenes that would show a female character with an orgasm.   I am intrigued by the fact that Christian is interested in her but also not interested in the fact, or the implication. He keeps going on about the 'whole mystery' of her and her 'wholeness'.  In a lot of books and movies, the characters are more interested in sexual exploration and exploring their fantasies, and so they don't make sex their only goal.  , I wonder if he just has a 'thing' for her? I'm also wondering if he has any sexual feelings, or if he's just an exhibitionist? Or is he just very sexually adventurous? And then, I guess, is it just her that's'special'?   What do you think?   on the trailer there are only two sex scenes:   (1) Derekla and Christian having sex in the shower   (2) DEREKLA and Christian in bed (although there are some scenes between the two of them)   that are not really sex scenes, but are just scenes between two characters.   at any rate, the two main characters are not having sex. But, Christian (Dereck) has the biggest fantasy of all.   and that's why he gets to be a dominant, the guy who can have anything, and how his sexual conquest changes him!   and his desires to be dominant (and not just for Derecka's sake, but his own), is also one of the things that make him go into the bondage scene.   (and so much for 'how Derecko finds her'?)

The movie starts on a very sad note. The movie starts with the title of the first book that our hero read, and we are left wondering what happened. At the beginning, we see how beautiful the town is, and how the main character has an amazing and amazing new girlfriend. He even helps the town on their water treatment project, and even helps find out that the town has been in a drought.     We are soon introduced to the town's library, and the hero goes to the library. He has an experience of the library, where it looks as if he is being followed, and then we realize that he did not really read the book. He goes to find his girlfriend, but he finds out that she has already moved away.   to search for her. At that point, the town becomes a bit dark, and a bit weird. He does not read his book to be a hero. But it seems like his story will continue to change. The town does not really have a very nice life, and I could see them going to war at some point. But he is just reading his book as if it is really a good book.  , but it seems that his story would continue to  I liked this movie a lot. I like it a lot because the characters are so real. I do not think the movie has too much action, but the movies do have a good tone and atmosphere. It is also a little bit more like a mystery than the others. It has all the ingredients for a good film, and this is a good reason for it to be good, because it does not need a lot of plot. I did not like the ending, but I did enjoy the beginning and middle, the middle, and ending. I could not have cared less about the ending.

Anyway, I like good movies, but I tend to be a bit of a wuss about them, because I'm usually more interested in the plot than the story. So, if you find me wanking my own dick while watching a movie that makes me feel like a complete dork, then please tell me why I'm a total wuss, and then I can be an asshole to you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________.  Don't talk about something that you don't like or hate. It will probably be the last thing you do before leaving.  I can't emphasize enough how important it is to focus on the film and not the other things that people bring with them. The main thing to keep in mind is to have fun. Let's make this the BEST movie we've ever seen, and if we get the chance to do it again, let's do it better. The best movies don't just come on TV. A movie is the result of a lot of people, a lot and varied talents, a few months of work, and an incredible amount of hard work. I wish I could tell you what we've worked on (as well as all the other stuff that hasn't gotten posted), but it would just be misleading. The only thing I can say for sure is that the movie itself is good. I know the director was up in that room, writing and directing the movie from day one, so that's a pretty good sign. If you have time to go back and read a couple of previous entries, you might find that I'm getting more and more specific as the article goes on. We'll be doing a recap of the story in the next few days, but for now, just know it is the best movie we have ever seen. The film will air on FOX in the US, and we'll be watching it from home on the 31st, so if you want to watch it, be sure to get your tickets by tomorrow, as it is going to be a pretty exciting night.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________  "The first time that I saw The Great Beauty, I thought the film was amazing. It was just so gorgeous. I watched it over and over again. When I first heard that it was going to be a book, I just felt compelled to read it. So I finally did, and then I saw the movie again. I still really liked the movie. But then I watched the book again. And I thought, "Oh my gosh. This book is really good." I mean, the book was awesome, but the movie is even better." -- Richard Linklater  _________________________________________________________  Why "The Great Beauty" is not a movie:  The Great Beauties are the great painters, sculptors and painters of the ages, their work is monumental and timeless, and their art is full of mystery and wonder.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________  This is a really fun movie, with some of the best animation I've seen in ages. The animation is wonderful, especially in the early parts when we're introduced to the characters, but it all starts to get a little boring as the story progresses. I don't like that the story takes a turn around halfway through. The story is good enough that you're still interested to find out what happens. And the animation in the final fight sequence is absolutely amazing. The music is very nice as well, though some of it has a slight techno type sound to it. It doesn't bother me that much though, especially when it's followed up by the soundtrack for a short-lived comedy series. You might want to listen to that one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have so many favorites...  Citizen Kane...    All The President's Men...  The great thing about this book is that every character was developed well enough to be recognizable by their names or faces.  My favorites, however, are the supporting cast.    The best is the beautiful Dr. Marge St. Eve of the Medical Examiner's Office.  She was always the perfect, sensible, straight-talkin' woman.  Her eyes would light up as she said "I don't give a fuck" and she was so nice to Dr. Sam Loomis who became her friend.  To my mind, this was the best character in the book.   The other characters were all memorable.  There were a number of different types of people.    One was the nice, older white male doctor.   This would have been a great character if he had been the only one, but he wasn't.  He had a female secretary, a woman with a heart of gold (who became the love interest for Sam) and a black doctor who would have worked better as a supporting character.  Some other people were there for a few lines or two.  I liked the police officer that became the father-figure of the character of the police chief.   The others were people with whom I didn't care who was involved.  It was like reading an amazing story about people who would be interesting in real life. One person I do think should have been more involved in the story is Mary's mother.  Her name is Mrs. St. Germain and she is the woman who discovers Mary's corpse.  Unfortunately, she is never mentioned again.   I know the book was supposed to be about Mary's life from the time of her birth, but at some point her mother just disappears.  When I was reading I was wondering where she was going.  Did she find her daughter or was she still around?   I don't think she is in the plot at all, and the book doesn't have enough detail to justify the "where's she gone" plot.  In a book like this, you don't need that extra detail.   But it is a nice detail.    I do like the way the story ended though.  For the first time, Mary wasn't able to go to the school dance.  The police chief was arrested and sent to prison

Write a positive review about a good movie:  How can I do that if my movie didn't have anything good to say?   I hope my movie did.   What I hope people think is, I think this is a real movie about real people and their real lives.   It is about a real girl who has a real life problem and the life of her father.   I don't mean to be too "heartless," but I thought that it would have been a lot cooler to include the dad as a character.   Anyway, I hope that people enjoy this movie.   A positive review will help it get a better release date in theaters.   And if you enjoyed this movie, and would like to help make it a hit, please do!   Any amount is appreciated!   If you have something to say or think about this movie and would rather I didn't say it, please email me: Â jason.k.kirby@gmail.com

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________ I didn't want to write a review for this one because I didn't know what to expect. It seems that the "Cabin Fever" remake doesn't have much to do with the original movie other than the title and the fact that the actors are wearing their original outfits. The remake is very faithful to the original but the movie itself doesn't seem to have much story to tell other than what is happening at the hospital. The movie begins with a big action scene as Dr. Zander Rice is trying to help his patient but gets hit by a bus. He ends up in a coma and we later see him in a hospital bed as he slowly regains consciousness. The hospital is in the middle of a big outbreak of the flu and the doctors are trying to figure out how to cure it and how to prevent more cases from occurring. The story is pretty simple as a virus starts to take over a major area of New York and a few of the residents start to act up. The infected people try to destroy the hospital and kill anyone else that enters the hospital in a mad attack. We see the police and military as well as Dr Rice trying to control this situation. This movie is mostly action and horror but there are a few funny moments as well. It is pretty scary when a few patients start to get violent and there are few close calls. The cast is good but there isn't much to say about them besides they look good. The ending is also pretty great as Dr Zander finally wakes up after an hour of being in a semi-coma and he finds that he has become immune to the flu virus. I was a little disappointed that the movie ended on a really bad note as this is a movie that should have ended on something good as it was the climax of the movie. Overall this is an ok movie to watch with a few scares that really make the movie great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have a list of movies to review this year, and this is one of them. A film that doesn't always get the kind of love that I would give it is " The House With a Clock in Its Walls ", a film from John Hodge and Charles Martin Smith.     The movie is a horror film, about a young man who murders his parents, a family that moved to a remote area and kept the home in order, by having them all shot.    You will find out why it is a great movie very soon.   For now, I would like to say that this is a film that was made by a master filmmaker.  John H. Hodge is known for his very unique way of directing films, and he shows that in this film.  The way he creates a horror, it is so realistic and realistic in how it feels like you are there in the room and you are trapped with these characters.  I really enjoyed this film, but the first part isn't so good.  But as time goes by it really begins to get better.  This film is a really good horror, and a good film in general.  " House With A Clock in its Walls" has an original theme song by the film.   It is a very original song that makes me wonder if this film was directed by Charles Martin Hill or John Hodele.  It sounds almost like a film made for radio play.  However, the music is really creepy, and I would love to hear the actual score in my head.  You can find the original score by clicking here. "The House With the Clock in the Walls" was a feature length film that had two different releases. The first was an extended cut called "House With A Night Watch" that was released in the summer of 2003.  The second version was a smaller cut called simply "The House".  I have not seen the original version, and only saw the shortened version, but this movie has a lot of great scenes, and you should check it out. The film is an amazing thriller that I cannot wait to see.  Check out my blog for reviews of films, music and videos!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!" "It is so realistic." "I found myself so absorbed in the plot." "This was so well-written!" "I felt like I was in the movie!" "Everything about this movie was so intense." "When he was in high school he was a really popular girl." "He really should write a book."

I'm gonna have to make a movie poster like that for this movie Now that I think about it, he probably should've written a book. The movie is set in the year 2000 and tells the story of a man named John Smith who has a heart condition and is unable to get any blood-clots. He is then told by his sister that he can have an operation to remove his diseased heart and save his life. He has the operation and the next day wakes up to find that he no longer has a diseased heartbeat. He decides to try and get the doctor involved in his operation to try to save his health, and he eventually does get the help he needs, but he also loses his ability to hear or see. He soon discovers that he has the ability to do the same with technology and his hearing and vision start to improve, so he can be able to read about the latest technology and take control of it. Eventually he becomes able to fix things himself, but this means that he never gets any new technology, and the only thing he can do is go back to his old job of repairmen and stay in that job until he is old enough to make the big switch and leave the business and move on. He tries to figure out what he is gonna do with his life and when he learns that a friend of his, who also had a heart ailment, left him, he has this idea of what he might want to do with the rest of his life: to travel all over the world to study and to see how other cultures live, and also to live in a house that he made himself. He goes on the road to learn about this new world and eventually lands on the planet Mars, which seems like it would be great for him. However, when he gets there, he finds that it has changed into this very strange world and all
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Why does it work?: ____________________________ When you're in an office: _______________ Why do people hate it?: _____________________ I read in one of those fanzines about a "real movie theater" that was closing down. The owner said he didn't know why it had closed down. I said "there is no movie theater, there is only a theater with a projector and the people in the theater don't know what movies are." The owner responded, "I'm not sure what you're talking about, I've been to a movie theater in California for years and I've never even seen a single movie, do you want me to show you where a movie is being shown?" I said I'd love to, but it won't be until I go to see it with you. I'm so excited, I can barely contain my excitement. It's a Saturday night and the only seats left are behind the projection booth. We sit down and I start to look around. There are a few movie showings and they are being shown in black and white. The projectionist, a tall, handsome, bald man, says to me, "How'd you find us?" "Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't see that." "I can't do that either." "You can look, I'll be right back." He walked back and disappeared. I went to the concession stand and picked up a drink. The movie is called "The Big Chill." I went back to my seat and sat with two of my co-workers. They didn't notice the big bald guy with the white hair behind the projector until the movie began and then they went to pay and I watched it with them. It was a black and a white picture, a big, scary, dark movie, with a guy wearing a ski mask in it. The guy in the mask made the most menacing sound. I just stood there and listened. Then the movie started and I saw a guy sitting in the chair in front of me, wearing a white coat and holding a gun, he had a red hand grenade. I realized what was happening and my co workers looked at me like I was crazy. I stood up and walked to the back of the theater. The woman who ran the concession stands was standing there and she said "You all have to leave now, we have to call the police." We all got up and went out. There were a few of us left, there
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. The movie should have a positive rating of _________. The movie's positive rating should be written in a __________ type. You should write a _______-type review about your opinion on the movie, if you have one. _________________-type. You must have written a ____________________-type of review. Do not write a simple ________-type, because it will only get you the same number of stars. Write a more complex review of the movie that includes ____________-types. Make sure your review is good. It needs to be concise. Be careful about making the review too negative. Do make it positive about a positive point. You can also review the movie in its entirety (which is the movie's intent), but it's not necessary. Remember: there are two types of stars: the ___________ and the _____. It should be clear to everyone that the stars are different colors, not equal. The first star is a _____-type star, which means it's a positive, positive review. The second star is the _____________________-style, which is a negative, negative review. Be sure to use the correct type of stars when writing reviews: the first, the second, and the third. Don't write a review that doesn't match up. It's difficult to determine the meaning of the star you've given a movie. For example, if someone says "the film has a nice mix of humor and action", you should think about how the movie does that and if it was actually funny or not. You may be thinking "it's funny that I didn't get that", but there are other factors at work. The other person is thinking "you're saying it's funny but I feel it wasn't. It was just plain boring". Don't do that. Review the movie using all the stars, not just the ones that match up with the first review. Also, do not write just one review. Write two reviews, each with a different star, and give one to the movie and the other to your friend. You're not allowed to give a negative review to the film, even if you like it. A simple "I hated it" will get you one star. The same goes for "I didn't care for it, but I know it's good and I still think it's worth watching". Your friend can't just go to the movies alone. If you have a friend who also

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ If you have no qualms about watching an R-rated movie, this is one you'll enjoy, because it's a good, solid comedy. I won't say much about the plot, as it's not that interesting, as the plot doesn't really work. It's a pretty straightforward, typical "plot" movie that is the equivalent of an hour and a half of a movie about a man going on a date with a cat. In fact, the cat doesn't even appear in the movie until the last ten minutes of the film, and is a little annoying. It would've been nice to get to know the characters more, and to see them interact a little bit more. In general, it was pretty good. The characters are all well developed, and the movie has great performances, from the leads. I especially liked that I saw two sides of the story: the story of a normal guy who gets involved in a supernatural situation, and then a side of the movie about the people on the other side, a group of demons. It all fits together really well. There was also a little moment in the middle of the last act where a few characters are interacting and the camera turns to show us a shot of the two groups of people, with the demons looking a little confused as to where they're supposed to be. It was an interesting little touch. I'm pretty sure I have seen this movie somewhere else on the Internet, but the movie actually did look a little different on TV than it did on video. The actors all looked great on TV, but they looked a little weird on video, with their facial expressions all out of place. The story itself wasn't anything special, but it didn't need to be to be a good film. There are no surprises or twists, but there are good character development. Overall, I'm really glad I watched this movie. It may have looked a bit different on video than it does on the big screen, but I really like the movie, and it's good to have a fun, light-hearted comedy. Recommended for fans of "action" movies, but if you like lighter fare, or if you just want to laugh, it's worth checking out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________   "I have always been a huge fan of "Bewitched," from the first episode in 1951. I was even in the audience for its world premiere at the New York World's Fair in 1964. The show's creator, Edna Krabappel, was a personal hero of mine, as were the entire cast. She was an inspiring force in my life.   What happened in the end of the show was a tragic tragedy, but it was a tragedy that no viewer need have ever seen coming. Edna's career was over because she had become the object of a vile and vindictive sexual harassment lawsuit. This was clearly a matter of her own choosing. She never would have chosen to be sued by a man who had already been sued by four other women, who, in fact, had been sued for much less than the amount of money Edna was suing her, and had lost the lawsuits. She could not have known the depth of the damage that would be inflicted on her by the lawsuits, but she had decided to fight them all.  , which was a great story and which was not about the harassment, although she tried to do it in that episode but the producers wouldn't let her. She had lost a tremendous amount of weight after the end.   at the end in 1964 the only episode that had aired was one called "Biology." I was in the theater watching this episode when Edna suddenly turned to me and said, "I don't know why I can't play these roles anymore. I have given everything in these performances." She didn't tell me why she had lost interest in the role of the witch but she was right. In that episode she plays a character that she was playing in every episode of that series. She died of breast cancer in 1990 at the age of 76."   See the first post in this thread.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.   When a couple, one young and one old, finally meet in the parking lot of a grocery store and start dating, their friendship quickly deteriorates, resulting in an epic battle between the two men. The young man is a very sweet boy, who is very much looking forward to getting to know the old man. But the old guy has a very twisted way of showing his affection and interest in the young boy, leading to a bitter struggle between them. But what really strikes you is how these two characters' personalities can change and change so completely between one scene to the next. There's a very unique and compelling way in which the characters evolve and develop over the course of the movie, and it is the reason why this movie is so great.  "The Notebook" is a wonderful film about love and life, so don't be discouraged if the first few minutes of this movie seem a little flat and slow. But don't worry; after a while, you will start to get caught up in the story, and you won't want to leave the theater until the end. You will fall in love with this great story, it will become your favorite movie, but even if you can't give a single word of praise to the film's script, the movie will still have you going "Omigod!"  This film is really a must-see film for any lover of movies; it is a true masterpiece that every movie-lover should see at least once.

A superb screenplay, a perfectly-cast cast, a beautiful and surreal setting, a superb music score, brilliant dialogue, hilarious and touching characters... It's a movie you can sit down and watch and have a great time."--Chris O'Donnell, The Hollywood Reporter "A hilarious, brilliantly realized movie, The Big Lebowksi is the best movie you haven't seen. It's great popcorn entertainment."--Jeff Buhler, Salon "A great film that has a great sense of humor, and a wonderful ending to an incredible journey."--Matt Patches, The Seattle Times "This one, The Dude's favorite film, is a delight from beginning to end."--Kirkus Reviews "This is one of the most charming films I have ever seen."--Robert Capps, Los Angeles Times "In its own peculiar way, it's one of those films that is both a throwback and a modern marvel."--The Village Voice "Bizarrely, one of my favorite films of all time... The most impressive thing about this film is its sense of visual style--one could almost mistake it for the work of a Hollywood film director."--Gregory Maguire, New York Times "The Big Boobs" is the title of the first scene in The Big lebowski. It is used by the filmmakers to set the tone for a film that is full of references to the surrealism and existentialism of the '70s and '80s, including the "mosaics of consciousness" and the "metaphysics of the self." The Big Boob has a voice which is a parody of all Hollywood voiceover actors, a voice that sounds a little bit like "Alfred Hitchcock" or "George Lucas." The voice is the voice of "the Dude" (Robert De Niro), a man who can "be anything he wants to be," but has an inferiority complex and tries to be more than he is. The movie opens with a scene in which the narrator (the voice of The Dude) is confronted by a group of cops in full uniform, who tell him to leave town because he has "a big ass" on him. This scene is a reference to the film Taxi Driver (1976) when a man attempts to get out of a traffic jam by saying "I have

I would have hoped the DVD would come in a protective case. I also have had it say that it comes with a CD, so I guess that is not a bad thing as long as it works. I did not have any problems with it during the playing and the picture quality was pretty good.I'm very pleased with it. Definitely not a dud by any means.

You'd think a guy from " Back to the future " would be more fun to play. He's cool, but the other actors were very bland. It's not a great film but it was funny enough to stay on the shelf for awhile...and I remember seeing it with my friend and we were both thinking that we would watch it all over again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. If it is good, don't bother to review it. It won't do any good. I do this for free and I am doing it because that is how I found out that the people who put together the reviews on this site were good people and were really interested in seeing movies. I am going to write a short review and then I will come back to my main list, but I am giving you all a heads up here. This is not going to be much to read but I want you to get my attention as the movie is playing. So here goes: **SPOILERS AHEAD** I don't want to ruin anything but I feel that this movie is really good. The acting is really strong. It is an enjoyable movie and I thought it was interesting to see the differences in a family. I feel it would be interesting to find out a little bit about the characters in this movie and to see how they get on in life. I was pleasantly surprised that the cast was so good, it is one of the best casts that I have ever seen in a movie. The story is interesting. It had a happy ending for some and an unsatisfying ending for the other half. This movie is a bit long and slow. It takes a while to get going and then it gets interesting. The characters are likeable. They all have their reasons for being what they are. The action is good. This was not one of those action movies with big guns and fast cars. It was a film that made use of many different angles to get to the action in the right way. I don�t think it is possible to describe how the acting is good and it is just great to watch a movie like this. I really liked the ending. I thought that it was a good way to finish a movie that was really good in the way it was done. The cinematography in the movie was really nice. It seemed to be filmed with a lot of care. I didn�t see a lot to complain about. I think that this is a movie worth watching. I will have a look at some of my other reviews. I need to see some more and I hope that there is some good stuff. ***This review contains spoilers*** **SPLAYER*** I have watched this movie twice now and I have been impressed each time. It has been on my to watch list for a long time. I had been wanting to get into a sequel to this

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________.  "How many people will it hurt if we go back to the movies?" "How many times will it make me sick?" "Can I still enjoy it? Would I still know it if I didn't watch it?" "Am I still the same person after I've watched it?" If your answer to any of these is "yes" then the answer is: "Yes." I love the movies, so I'm willing to risk my mental health in exchange for the chance to enjoy a wonderful experience and laugh at the same time. If you watch movies for the enjoyment of the story, not to get some sort of physical release from watching people die, then go to a movie. I don't care what it costs. As long as you're there to see someone else die, that's great. But you can go to the movie you want to see, as long as it's a good one. So what are you going to do? Go see the one with a decent plot? Or go watch a comedy about killing people? Or a war movie? You get the idea. Posted by David G. at 11:19 AM

It had everything from the sad, to the shocking, to almost anything you can imagine. I would watch this movie again and again and I think that everyone should watch this before they die. I just wish I could make it happen.  __________________________________________________________  My father loved this film...we grew up on a farm where it was pretty much standard procedure to slaughter the cows and pigs in a very brutal way. This movie brought back those thoughts and feelings. It was the first time that I experienced feeling for a non human animal...thank you. I've also made the decision to eat less meat and I really wish I had seen this film in high school. I feel that if this film had existed when I was that age, I would have been an even more dedicated animal advocate. I don't know if I would be vegan now though because I would not know how to be honest in this case. I'm glad I went and saw it now that I have more knowledge and experience. I think it's pretty much the same as seeing the movie "Slaughterhouse Five" or "Animal Farm" but at least it didn't go on the "furry" theme.  The meat industry is not what it used to be and this is a pretty shocking film. The only thing that I would say is it does not compare to my favorite film, "The Matrix" or even a lot of the "sci fi" films. I also love the fact that it is such an American film. I like to see American culture and the ideals in this movie. The film makes you think about how far we have come as humans, and the animals have come a long way too. You can feel how they are treated, just as you felt that way when you were a child. But it's such a depressing ending when the movie ends

Write a positive review about a good movie:       A couple of weeks ago, I decided to check out the movies in the new VHS section on my local Video on Demand store. One of the titles I saw was a David Fincher film called The Game, directed by Paul Verhoeven. After watching the trailer, I couldn't help but ask the man behind the camera:  What's the story behind the film?  Paul Verhoeve: [laughs] The story behind The Game is that we had this idea that the only way we could get back on the screen was if somebody else got into this movie, so we decided to do a real-life-like movie in which a character would come and play a part in the story, then we would make a movie about it. It's a fictionalized version of how it could've gone down. And the character comes in, and his name is Peter, and he's very serious, and very secretive, and I think the guy he meets is like him. They start out in this sort of standoffish, standoffish kind of world, but I think they would become close friends. And then they eventually have to go into the world, and they have to start talking, and the world becomes a bigger place and more complicated than they had anticipated. And they have trouble with the fact that in the real world, they are going to be found out. So the movie is all about how they deal with that and deal with the consequences.  And what was the original story for the movie, and what inspired you to make it?  that was the first thing that came to me. It was actually about a guy who has a relationship with a girl who he has to kill, so he wants to get into the girl's head to find out what she's thinking. And that's how I came up with the story. I liked the idea that they're kind of a misfit. They're the first gay couple in town, and their town doesn't accept them. So, I think a lot of people can relate to that, and then, there's this kind of standoff and secrecy and that kind of thing, and just making it really real.  "You know, a lot about people is revealed through their eyes, and through the eyes of someone they're close to. So you see a lot through the person they love, which is why you're supposed

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ I love watching movies. They've really grown on me. The first two movies I had never seen before and I loved them. Now, I've been watching films since I was a kid. I guess I just have the love of the movies to me. I had no expectations of what I would like but I was amazed. This movie did not disappoint. The characters, the story and even the scenery were great. The best part is that the story was told from a third-person perspective. I didn't want to be left out of the movie, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. It was a wonderful movie and if you like a good comedy, you will not be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You're a real Hollywood guy!  Just do it.  I don't care what it is.    You are a Hollywood guy if you're doing a review of a movie that a fan would see.  I'm not going to go into detail here as this isn't the place to do so.  Please go read reviews of your favorite films.  That is what I would recommend as the best place to go to read reviews and find out what people are saying.  If you would rather see the movie, go see it.   I know I would love to see that.  I've been getting emails lately asking how to be a film critic.  And as I type this, I'm thinking about this topic.  This blog's focus is movie reviews, so that's what I'm going to concentrate on here.  What I want to do with this blog is put my two cents in and put out my thoughts on things.  As a film reviewer, what are the most important things I need to know to make sure my reviews are accurate, thorough, and fair?  How do I get myself into the best possible position to do my job?  These are the questions I am pondering now.  Hopefully, I can start to answer some of them in this post. The first thing you need to do is learn a bit about your audience.  They aren't going to write a review if they have no idea who the director or writer is. So let's start with who is the audience?  Most people are going to tell you that the audience is "the viewer".  They will say something like "The audience is the group of people who see a movie".  That's right.  But what's the audience really?  It's a bit of a misnomer to think of the audience as just the audience of a film.  In order to have an audience, you need a number of other people, some of whom may not be paying attention and therefore are not going see your film. The audience is an informal group of friends and family that has come together to watch the film. When you go to a movie, you are a part of that group.   That's a good thing.  It means that all of those other people who are there because they enjoy your film are there for you.  The other part is, as I just mentioned, that you need those other "friends and

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Write a negative review about the bad movie: ______ Write a neutral review about an OK movie: (or anything else, for that matter) Write a very negative review of a bad movie (e.g., "The worst movie I have ever seen!"). This is especially good if you are making fun of someone, but not necessarily. For example, "If I could have seen any movie, it would be this one." This is called a "hate piece." If you write a hate piece, make sure that you do it in a way that does not sound mean or mean-spirited. Do not say that the movie is "bad," "stupid," or anything like that. You could, for example, talk about how the movie has a lot of technical problems, but you really like it, so that's why you went to see it. You may also wish to talk about the characters, or the story, or anything else that you think is important to your review. Write a review about one of your favorite films: __________________ This is also known as a "favorites" review. It will give you a lot more information about the film than any individual "bad" review can, and the writer will probably make references to all the different "bad things" about the movie that people didn't talk about in the first one. It's great for those who don't watch enough films to get a general idea of the movie. It also makes for excellent TV shows, for people who do watch too many movies. But do be careful not to make your "favors" reviews too mean- spirited! If you make a "bad movie" review, people will probably laugh at you. If you do a "good movie" or a "perfect movie" and make it sound too grandiose or too sentimental, people won't listen to your words. It should also be noted that you don't always need to write a negative movie review. You can make a positive movie review as well. Write something that will be good for you in a few years: ______________________________ This is a little more difficult than a positive or neutral review. To create such a review, you have to come up with some kind of reason why the movie will actually work out. For instance, you might be able to think of a reason why this movie will be well-received in the future, or a reason that it won't be as bad as people think

This movie is very different and original, I am so glad that we have such movies. The actors are so beautiful and they all have an emotional presence in this movie that I haven't seen before. They all show true emotions and I can't wait to see their next movie. If you are interested in the actors, then this movie is for you. If this movie doesn't make you cry, then it's not for you! It is so amazing that it made me so much emotion and I don't know how I am gonna stop laughing and crying when I see their scenes next time!" -Rita This movie was a great experience that I thoroughly enjoyed and wanted to talk about in the interview below. I would love to tell a lot of things that I liked and not as much as I wanted to. This is how I was introduced to this movie: I saw the trailer on a movie blog and I decided to search on Google. I saw that the movie wasn't on Netflix yet so I went ahead and watched it. It was a very interesting experience to say the least! The movie is an absolutely fantastic experience. I was very impressed with the whole process of writing this blog post as I watched this movie twice, both times through the same camera, but I'll get to that a bit later. The movie was not made for me but that is also not the reason I watched it and was fascinated by the process. I loved watching this movie with the two of my roommates who were in love with the movie but who are both completely inexperienced at writing. So when I saw their reactions and their stories about the experience and the movie I was more than intrigued to see what their process looked like and what their opinions were. The two of us were the ones who got really into this movie. In the end I can say that the two women were the most excited about the process because it was a totally different experience for them. It wasn't the movie that made them excited, it was the fact that we had a really fun time together! So, if you want to write about it, let's talk about the writing process. For a few days before I saw this movie we had this conversation: Rita: __________ What do you want out of this movie? Me: ____ What am I getting out of watching it? Rita: Well,

I've seen the film and I'm going to say it's good. The movie opens with a great lightsaber battle and some of the best special effects ever put into a movie. But it's more than just a movie: it's a tribute to a culture and a way of thinking that is dying in our world.   The Force Awakens 2) The Last Jedi    This is the last sequel that we will see the Star Wars saga in this manner. Luke and Rey are about to marry, while Kylo Ren is being driven insane with anger. He's in a deep depression. A sadistic and manipulative man (I'm looking at you, Benicio Del Toro).

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________ This review is for: I Am Legend (2006) - 8.75 / 10 IMDb Rating: R / 10 (10/10) Director: Francis Lawrence Runtime: 110 min. Stars: Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, Edward Norton, Joseph Fiennes I Am Legend is a perfect example of a remake of a perfect movie. It's exactly what it says on the tin - a new version of a good film.  If you haven't seen it then you need to go out and see it, you'll be glad you did.  There is some confusion as to what is the name of the remake, it is an English film but has some French references. I Am Legion has been a long time favorite of mine and I'm glad I finally saw it.  I Am Not a Serial Killer was a film that I hadn't seen before. I'm pleased to say that I am glad I saw this one. I am a fan of the original and I look forward to watching the remake.  A couple of things I thought were nice in this film. Firstly, there is a scene in the beginning of the film in which a man is attacked by dogs and the dogs have to be shot with a revolver. This shot is beautifully done by the actors and is a very important one to the film. I liked the fact that the man in the film had a bit of a troubled past, this was important in my mind as he was a good man who got himself into trouble. I also like the scene in which the woman is having a conversation with a man who is smoking a cigarette. I like this a lot because the scene reminded me of something from the movie The Graduate.  The second thing I thought was nice is that the people in the movie were all played by the right people, Tom Hiddleston is excellent in his role, Edward DeCoteau is brilliant as the leader of the group and Demi and Demian Bichir are excellent as the two lead characters. I thought the film was quite good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I'll start with my experience with the movie. I saw it in the theater and I loved it. It has an upbeat vibe and the cast had a good chemistry. The cinematography was well done and there was a nice amount of sex in the movie which I didn't mind at all. I did not see much blood but that's only because it was shot on film. The movie was very funny but there wasn't really much sex in it. The story was a good one with many twists and turns which were very intriguing. The best parts of the movie were when you start getting into the characters and I liked a lot of the characters. I don't know if it was the sex scenes or something else but the story was pretty good. I liked the story and the characters so I would give it a 4 out of 5. I only gave it a 3 out of 10 because the acting was a little off.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  If you're in the mood to go a little dark, you should go to the darkest places in cinema, and that's exactly what I recommend to you. Let's talk about what you might see when you go to a bad movie theater.  1. They have terrible sound systems: _________________  That's what I heard in the cinema, so I went with that. If you want to know how the sound is handled in a bad theater, check out the video below.  the same one with the music disabled. The sound in the video is horrible, as I just explained. If they put that on a DVD I will gladly buy it for the sound. It's still there in the theater. And they were in a rush to get me in and out. .    2. The screen is covered in dust, and you can see nothing: ____  I didn't see it, but I'm pretty sure I saw a little piece of paper or something on the screen.  has there ever been a movie like this, where you can't see a single thing on the film because it's covered in a layer of dust? If it is, that is, it was either very dirty or it's an old theater where they don't clean it regularly. , if it was dirty, I would have noticed it, and it wouldn't have been a problem, but this is just a movie theater, so you should not expect much from the sound anyway.  of course you're not in a normal movie theater in the first place, but the poor sound is just another reason for the bad movie experience.   3. There are no people in the movie theater: ______________________________  As you may already know, this doesn't mean that they're not there. It means they are watching, but they're very distant from the audience. You're either in the middle of a line or you're a few rows behind a wall and nobody sees you.   the "good" and "bad" people.  and that will not change. They'll always be two separate people. They're there to do their jobs, they're working on their lines and they have to do it very efficiently because they don:specially. If there are people present they have the opportunity to talk to the audience and to listen to what people have to say. So that's what you want. If not, you can

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________  _______________  The reason for the new movie's existence is that I realized I needed another "mysterious movie" in my collection, especially considering that I'm still in search of an original movie of my own. I love old movies, of course. My first movie was one of those, and I just don't know how else to describe it. I've read enough about the movie to know that it's in fact a novel, but I've never actually read it. It was the first movie I ever saw in theaters. I was nine years old.  It's a black-and-white silent film, directed by George Cukor and produced by James L. Brooks. The plot is about a girl who is born blind and lives in a world where she is a rare animal. She has a few strange abilities, but mostly she's the only one who can see. As a child, she has to go to a place called the "Eye of the Tiger" every day and take her picture, for fear that the people there will take her for an animal and kill her. It's a bit like the "B" Picture, but there are no animals, only humans who don't seem to mind. It seems like a good thing to get your picture taken every day, but what's wrong with that? I mean, it's the law, isn't it? So, she does it for the photos, but eventually, she starts to understand that, in a place where only she can see, that is not a good place to be. Her life is not as wonderful as she expected it to be, and she starts a quest to find out why and how she got here.  the movie is actually not an original film at all; the book on which the movie was based came out years earlier. But I liked the idea behind it; the movie had a lot of good qualities that I like in any good story. It had a pretty good cast; I liked Peter Finch as the lead and Michael Shannon as the villain. Also, a great supporting cast of women. There were also a few minor, not-so-subtle hints that the film was in fact in the vein of a novel. The movie isn't really all that good; I found it too dark and brooding and just not very interesting. I felt like I wasn't really in a "good place" with my character, and it got very boring

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________  If you like the movie, then read the rest of this review. If you don't like the film, then don't read this review but still watch it and decide for yourself if you like it or not. I'm only making a subjective decision, and I'd recommend everyone take the time to really think about the movie. If I didn't tell you to watch the movie then you may not have. If it's your first time, then you can also just listen to the trailer and go from there.   The movie opens with a scene in which we see a young woman driving a car. When a man drives by in a different car she looks at him and says "I'll call you." The scene then cuts to a couple of years later. A girl walks through the streets with a boy who is about her age and we see how she got her boyfriend. The scene cuts to the two of them at a house and the girl is trying to get her boyfriend to come back to the house. They then cut to the boy and his new girlfriend who is looking for him and the movie cuts back to what we were watching a few scenes earlier. I won't get into any spoilers but we then see a few other girls and the guy comes back to his room. We then see the two girls on the street and then we see the girl who got his new boyfriend and then they go to a party where the guy talks to the girl about the party and then the two guys go back to their room and see the next girl and then one of the girls goes to the room and the other two girls go back into the house and it cuts back and forth. We also see a bunch of different friends of the guys going to different places and then a scene cuts where they are talking in a car and then it cuts to them being in a restaurant where a girl comes up to the guy and is getting her friends to come over to the car. The guy then tells them to go because he can see his family. The next scene cuts back in to the guys getting ready to go. The guys go to the party, they leave the party for a bit and then head back to someplace else. They leave the girls with the guy they got at the party. We see them go to another restaurant and the two get in the car and they're talking and then at some point the two go to their house where they have sex and then leave. The two

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________  "I was thrilled to discover a movie I have been looking forward to for years and finally got to see in person. My favorite was the "Dunkirk" part. All of the other parts were good, but it was the part in the movie where they land on the beach, and the Germans start firing that really set up the entire film. The first half of the movie was fantastic and the second half was the true story of how a little boat crew, the "London-to-Dunkie" set out to save the British in the face of certain defeat. They had a real sense of humor and were a great support for the main characters. Overall, I enjoyed this movie and I wish it had been made a few years earlier. It will make its way onto many people's wish lists, I assure you."  -Dennis B., Phoenix, Arizona  ______________________________________________________  The last film of my childhood was "The Secret of NIMH" and I am happy that it is now available on DVD and Blu-ray. I grew up with this movie as it is one of the few science-fiction films that actually looked as if the scenes we saw were real, not CGI. The film had a very realistic production values that we all remember. We would watch "The Big Bang" in school and "The Jetsons" in a theater. I was also a huge fan of John McTiernan's films, and I believe that "The Terminator" and "Rambo" were his greatest films, but my favorite would be "The Goonies". My mother still has the original cassette tapes from that movie, so I still have the memory of seeing it on a screen as a small child.  I love that "Dupre" is now getting the theatrical release that it deserved in the 80's. I have fond memories of my friends and I watching this movie in the late 80's and early 90's. In the 80s, this movie became quite popular, and my friends would gather in our basement and watch it in our darkened living room. This was probably the last "Star Wars" that we saw until the new movies came out a few decades later, and probably one of my favorite "Star Trek" films as well. The only other reason this movie is on my list is because it was based on the real story of the evacuation of Dunkirk. I am not a historian, but

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ Write a negative review about the worst movie:   ______________________________ Don't buy it ___________ Don't rent it ____ Don't do anything with it _____  I think we have all seen and heard this type of statement many times in the movie business. I am very much against this. In fact, I believe in the power of the negative reviews. I believe that we cannot just take what a movie "is" and say, "I would buy that". In fact we have been told that this movie is going to make millions of dollars and it will have a great success. I think the negative critics will be the ones that will stop that from happening. I know it is a long shot, but I am pretty sure that they will stop it. They might just be afraid of the "social stigma", and that would be all right. But I am really going to do my part. So if you haven't seen this movie and you have any negative feelings towards it, I really hope that you will consider watching it just one more time. We are in the midst of an exciting year for sci-fi and fantasy films. The first week of November we have some great movies coming out. But what about some of the other movies? I would like to take a look at some of them for you guys today. So here goes. 1. Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace (2001) My very first reaction to this movie was, "How the hell could they mess up such an amazing scene?!?!?" Well, that was only my first impression. Once you watch the film, you will understand what I mean. There is no way to get away with such a horrible scene. As the new generation of fans of the Star Wars franchise, we need to look back and realize how terrible this scene was. I can remember being in school, and watching the scenes where Anakin Skywalker first finds his uncle on Naboo. I was very young at the time, and the scene made me very sad. As it was shown on the big screen, it was the best way to show how pathetic Anakin was. As a child, I thought it was hilarious how he was being held by his aunt for the first time, even though the story was already told. I loved the moment when he took his mask off to reveal his face. I remember laughing with my friend while he was pointing to Obi Wan as the guy who took

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________ This is the first review of the first two films of the series, and I'm pretty much in the same boat as everyone else: I really liked them, and even though I'm not in love with the story line, the cast and the way they portrayed the characters is just fine for this show. That being said, while I do love the cast, I'm still not a huge fan of how the story is told, especially because it's told in an episodic format that has the characters being moved and reset and then the story told again. There's not much of a plot and the characters' personalities don't really change, so I feel like this isn't a show that can really go on for a long time, and while it's not bad per se, the lack of development makes me want to put it back on the shelf and watch something else.Overall Score: 5.0/10
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ (Don't put "Bad Movie" in your review - that will only make people hate you more.) Tell your friends and co-workers that you saw this movie because you have a friend with a kid who has a love/hate relationship with it. (This will give you more credibility!) Tell your family that you are planning to watch this movie again because you want them to see it too. (It will give them hope!) Tell them the best parts are the part where everyone gets eaten by alligators and the parts where they have to fight each other. Tell them how funny and entertaining it is. (They will laugh.) Tell them that they need to see this movie. (The only way they will want to watch it is if you do.) Give this movie a nice rating!  I am NOT exaggerating. If you give this movie 5 stars, you will earn thousands and thousands of online friends.  When it comes down to it, the movie was made for adults. Yes, there were some funny parts. But the actual plot is quite serious and the acting was lackluster.  the movie is about a small town in Florida, in which the town's children and teenagers (ages 11-16) have a love-hate relationship. The main character, a 10 year old boy (David Levy) is not happy with his life. His mom works a lot and he doesn't have a lot of friends and has been teased a lot for being gay. The character was played by my younger brother. We both had a crush on him from the moment we met him (but he refused to date us!). He did a fantastic job with the role of David.  a movie I loved, until I watched it for the first time. The first time I saw this film, I was surprised by some of the things that went on. At the same time, I realized that this movie is much darker than the movie that was released. I don't know why but I felt so sad when David (the main character) started to have sex with the teenage girl (Jennifer Aniston) at school. It just felt too bad. I'm glad that the first part is not what people thought it was because it gave me a different perspective. After seeing the movie for the second time, the things I had written about it became more realistic. The movie has many great characters and the story can be enjoyed by adults as well as children. 1-2/

Write a positive review about a good movie:      The story goes that, as an English teacher, I once sat in on a class of fifth graders who were taught to write a report on what they had learned from the day's lesson. What I saw were little kids who had memorized, and were therefore able to tell their teacher, the very same lesson that they'd heard the day before from their teacher. The kids had a clear idea what they were supposed to have learned, and they didn't have the faintest idea what to say. The result was that I couldn't help but think to myself: Well, what the hell do I want to write about? I'm not a writer. I've never written anything. I can't even sing. I want nothing to do with this.  And so, after I was dismissed from the classroom for good, I wrote some notes on the blackboard. My main concern was that there was a great deal of repetition, with a lot of word choice. There were also some things that were just plain wrong, like how every child was supposed to recite, in one uninterrupted line, the first two words of the first sentence, in the second line, of the second sentence, and in the third line of the fourth sentence, of every sentence that preceded those two. No, children aren't supposed to read from their backpacks in fifth grade. They aren't even supposed to repeat those first two or three sentences.  and no, no, the only way to repeat the first three words of a sentence is in the first line of every subsequent sentence that follows it. No two sentences need be the same. Children who cannot read are not supposed to memorize. A teacher's job is to help children learn; to help them recognize what they don't understand, and to help guide them toward learning what they do. That is a teacher's role. If a teacher cannot teach that, that is a problem that cannot be solved. You don't teach that by taking the work out of children's hands. Children do learn by doing. They can't learn if they aren't given the opportunity to do. In the classroom, I was the one who was supposed not to memorization, not to repeat sentences. I had been taught, and was willing to be taught, that repetition is a bad thing. I was also taught that the process of learning is not about repeating or memorizing, it is about taking

It's better to just look at how it's done, and what the director did. If it's good, it'll make you smile, but it won't be the first thing that comes to your mind. If you've seen this movie and want to see it again, then that's your decision, not mine. I'm not going to pretend that this is a great movie, nor am I going to deny that it's an excellent film. It has flaws that have been pointed out more than I can count, but at the end of the day, it still is a very good film. If I ever see a movie that I thought was good, but isn't any more, I will change my mind. I am not going tell you this is an awesome movie, because it isn't. However, it is one that you should see and enjoy. I watched this film with a couple friends and we got to enjoy the film together. After watching the film, we had a good laugh about the movie that made us all giggle, which was nice. The film wasn't overly funny, but was enjoyable. The film is about a group of kids that have moved to a new town, and while they are all excited to be there, there are things about it that are a bit strange. A few kids get the attention of the town's most popular people. The story is about the fallout when the town becomes obsessed with those kids and how they react. This film does not have a whole lot to offer as far as plot goes, which is what I personally prefer. The first half is about an incident where the towns popular kids want the town to shut up about the little children. Then it moves into a more normal, but still weird, setting. In the last half the story takes an odd turn, and we get an interesting insight into what really goes on in town.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  A negative review can be as powerful as a positive one, when you realize the film you've just seen, or that you're going to see, is not a great movie! It can cause you to see it again, just to know how bad the film was, or just to show it to someone who will not judge you so harshly.  What I mean is that the negative review you write may be a good example for someone to use in the future. You may find that if you make a comment about the movie, that your comment will have a good effect on the viewer or listener.  a good review of a bad movie is better than a bad review of any good movie. , but, you know, some good reviews are better than some bad ones. For example, a review of "Titanic" is better, than a review about "Saving Private Ryan."

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ My top pick for best animated film of 2014! The animation is beautiful, the story is clever, and the action is fun. My only complaints is that I wished there was more of the characters who don't speak. (I have the Spanish dub.) I recommend that you watch it without the subtitles so that you don't miss any of the jokes. I'm sure you won't. You might need the subtitles for this to work properly. It was animated by one man, so you can expect a few rough edges and choppy movements. The animation isn't bad, but it's not as impressive as some of the other anime films I've seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________  ____________________________________________ The film opened with an image of a little girl at a school play. The images are used to tell the story, and we are led to believe that the little girl is a young girl named Anna (Brigitte Helm). Her father is the head of a school for the blind. Anna is the only person able to communicate with the other children. She and the other students are divided into two groups. One group is to work with the blind children, and the blind students take care of the group, but the other group is given the responsibility to look after Anna's house. One of the students is the beautiful and intelligent Mimi (Rachel Weisz). She is in love with Anna's mother, and Mimi takes advantage of that situation. She has no qualms about taking advantage of someone, and she enjoys it immensely. She also has a crush on another student, and this student is played by James Cromwell. Mimi and James become involved, and things do not get better for Mimi. Misha is also an important character. He is the young leader of the blind kids. He has a dark side, and he is not without his own demons.  The first third of the film has Mimi attempting to help Anna, and her relationships with the students and teachers. Mika is in charge of looking after Anna, but when Anna is in danger he feels it is his duty to rescue her. When the two groups get into a conflict, the conflict is not between two groups but between the two men, which is played wonderfully by Tim Roth. The two men are played by Michael Shannon and Robert De Niro. Michael Shannon does a wonderful job in his role, and Robert Downey Jr. is an excellent choice to play a villain. The film has a great cast. : ComicBookMovie.com is protected from liability under the DMCA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act) and "Safe Harbor" provisions.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________  Was this helpful?  Did this review help?  with 1 out of 1 people found this helpful.  A very well made and animated movie, that even though it has a few flaws, it's worth the time spent on it.  I hope the film will be released in theaters soon. . ,,  With 1 out, 1 out  There are no words to describe how much I liked this movie! It was great, entertaining, and entertainingly strange! It is probably a bit too strange for most but the best part is the story! The storyline is one of the most original I have ever seen in a cartoon movie and I have seen some amazing ones. The animation is top-notch and the characters are just as great as the rest of the movie! The animation was pretty much flawless and it was very well done! This is a must see for any fans of the cartoon, or anyone who really likes a good sci-fi movie with a story! I loved it so much that I had to watch it again just to be sure I didn't miss anything. So for that reason alone, I would highly recommend this movie to any and all Sci-Fi fans!
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ 1.5/5 - "It was okay, but the acting was so bad that you can hardly tell what's happening." ________________________________________________________ This is a spoiler free review. All I want to say is this: 1. Get your copy of the film and see it for yourself! It is available on DVD and Digital download in our website. I have only seen the film once and I was not blown away by the film. But, it is still a good and entertaining film that I recommend for anyone who wants to get into the world of science fiction. It is a story that involves the effects of a very powerful mind control system. It's set in a world where the human body has become a product of genetic engineering and the human mind is being turned into a product as well. The humans of this world are being controlled by a mind control technology called the "Neuro" which is used on people to help them live normal lives. When the main character, James Holden (played by Sam Holden) is sent to a colony in the distant reaches of the Solar System he discovers that this planet is a front for an illegal drug trafficking ring run by a man named "The Professor". James begins to unravel the mysteries of this place and this man's role in it, and finds himself drawn into the conflict that is engulfing the whole galaxy.   James Holden is the first main character I really liked in this film. He is the most logical of the characters and the one who is closest to the truth. He knows that the humans of the colony are being used for the purpose of drugs and for their bodies, and he sees the drug dealing, the murder and destruction of the people. He even has his own personal vendetta against the Professor for what happened to him years before when he was captured by The Professor. This is a guy who is clearly intelligent and rational. James has problems with how he deals with his life and his wife who he sees as very controlling and domineering. The way he talks with her and with the people around him is almost like a child. Even the way he interacts with people like Naomi and The Captain is almost in a childlike fashion. He comes from a rough background and he seems like a very naive guy. He does not have any problems when it comes to dealing with other people. When it comes time for him to make a decision, he usually comes to the best possible decision no matter what it is. His loyalty,

So that's a minor complaint, it works like a charm. I have worn it for about 2 weeks now and it still has good grip. I'm still learning new things about the grip and I feel like I'm getting better with time. So I really think this is a great product!

I also don't notice any difference between my foot and the rest of my feet when I do it, so I think it is because it's a nice and snug fit.

It takes a long time for people to move on from the ones they started with, and while most of us move on to other movies after watching a certain movie with a friend we never finished, I have never yet been able to do so. One theme that has stayed with me throughout my life is a love for the art of the director, and this movie perfectly encapsulates my love of directors:   Actors in Movies:  I'll be honest, there aren't too many good actors in movies. The ones that pop out are either the actors that people know from movies (Tom Cruise) or actors that aren't even actors (Ben Stiller), and even then, I like them, but there are only so many.   Movie with the Best Cast/Actor Rating: Movie with a really strong cast or actor. Movie With an amazing Director/Actor rating: Movie that has a really interesting director or actor (and/or both). Movie that has the Best Music/Score Rating: The best movie score. I'm still working on my list, and I'll update it as I go along.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (I can't stand when I hear the word 'bad' so this won't be a review for a 'bad movie' but rather one for a good one) The film 'Punch Drunk Love' is an extremely well written comedy. It is also a very entertaining movie and I enjoyed watching it more than I anticipated. The story and acting is fantastic and there is an amazing soundtrack to go along with it. If you've never seen this film then I highly recommend it because this film will have you laughing throughout it's runtime.     Plot: The film begins with a beautiful and young woman being driven to the hotel and it seems that nothing will be going right in this relationship as she has only known two men before and they both left her for dead. She has just turned 18 and is driving down to Las Vegas to find her one true love. However, she has a secret that she is about to learn the hard way. In Las Vegas we find that every year there are these bizarre carnivals where one can find love and be loved. This year it is the Punch Drunk Love. It seems that the only way to become one of the most beautiful women on the strip is to put your head down and punch people in the face.  This is the premise of the film, but I found it to be surprisingly well thought out. I thought that the film had a nice twist at the end that will have the audience asking questions to see how it turns out. This was probably the best part of the movie for me. It was funny, well written, and the movie felt like it had a decent amount of effort put into it. There is a good amount of plot and the whole thing is played out very nicely. I didn't enjoy the ending, but it was still interesting to see what happens next.        Presentation:  The picture is beautiful and the film's theme of drinking and punching people in their faces is very fitting. The music is very upbeat and I was a bit surprised at the amount of time the film spent on the music and how the music fit in. I enjoyed seeing the soundtrack and it also made the movie seem more like a movie than it was just a comedy.             Cast: It is hard to say what the main cast of the main character is because it seemed that everyone that was on screen was very well done. It seemed like there wasn't much

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If I can give a movie five stars, I can also write a negative one. I want to give positive ratings and criticisms because it gives me a better understanding of a movie and allows me to add it to my personal favorites list. However, sometimes I want negative ratings, like when a movie is so terrible I want it to be burned into my memory. I have to be really careful in what I am writing. I can't be mean or disrespectful. I don't want to look like I am a negative person. When I write a review it should just be factual. The reason why I have always kept my personal list so small is because of that concern. When you write a movie you want to be objective. It is hard to give a film a score that doesn't hurt your enjoyment of it. The most frustrating thing for me when I write reviews is when people get angry about it. Why should you care about whether or not a movie was good? It is like getting angry about a bad joke you saw on stage or something. I understand people get frustrated when they have been given bad reviews but I just want to focus on the movie itself and not how I feel about it or what I thought about it at the time. You shouldn't read my reviews and think "Man, that is a horrible review. That has a lot of hate". If you don't like the movie, don't watch it, or don't enjoy it, that's fine, but just don't go to the theater or watch it on a DVD just to get that reaction. 1.  Serenity - 2.5 stars I didn't really have an opinion on this one. If I had to put my opinion on it, it would be "it wasn't that bad." I can see the appeal, it is one of those things where if you like a character you can relate to him. The thing is, the thing was just so fucking terrible, but I was looking at it in a positive way. It wasn't like it was poorly written and I was like, "You suck! You are such a moron." It was just bad. I mean I saw it, but it was the worst movie I had seen. It was hard to even go into detail on any of the things I didn't like about it because there wasn't any of it to go on. The characters were so cliché. The first half of the movie was just a bad set up.

"All of which, I hope, goes some way to proving that the film is worthy of the name The Dark Knight Rises, with its complex and sometimes bewildering storylines, its dark themes and its dark humor," wrote film critic Roger Ebert. "Its central conflict is as complicated and challenging as any in fiction," wrote reviewer David Denby. "Gripping and exhilarating and utterly terrifying, the movie is a marvel of acting and screencraft, with Oscar Isaac and Tom Hardy taking a beating and coming back for more, with a film that feels both fully earned and wholly earned. Dark Knight Rising is an unmitigated joy," wrote New York Times critic David Rooney.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ In a country where we don't believe in any good movie anymore (not that I don't enjoy some of the good ones), I still believe that all the movies out there are worth watching. I would watch a horror movie with an insane plot twist and lots of bloody action with a good character with a decent plot and a good cast. I still watch old horror movies with my friends. I believe that any good movies have to make you happy. It can't make you scared or depressed or something stupid and terrible like the film I'm writing now. I don's trust the creative director to create a horror-scary film in a way that will be funny, emotional and memorable. You can't just make a movie that makes you feel sorry for the actors or make it scary without any emotion. You must understand that the actors, directors, writers and producers are all human beings. I can't judge them by their talent alone. I have to judge them based on how they made me feel. And that's exactly what I believe horror movies are made: a little bit for me, a lot for others, and a lot more for us. They're not trying to make me sad, they're trying to show me that sometimes life doesn't go your way. Sometimes you have bad luck, you have people to blame for it, you can't change it but you can deal with it. I think horror movies show us the truth of life in a really nice way. Some scary movies try to show us that a crazy person can be cute and funny. And some scary movies show how we can still make mistakes and that it's okay to ask for help. And I think that's what horror movies do best. Horror movies let us show the truth and give us a little smile on our face. They make you think. Sometimes they make us feel guilty about our actions and sometimes they just scare us with the power of their images. In a way, horror movies help us in a positive way and show us how to cope with life. I hope you enjoyed this post and I hope to see you at the next Horror Movie Marathon I'll be organising. Thank you and see you soon!

The Force opened to an estimated $85.1 million on Thursday, with the third and fourth installments of the Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and Haymitch series both pulling in about $12 million apiece.

The Force has already overtaken The Dark Knight Rises as the top-grossing film of all time in the U.S. and Canada. It will likely continue its march towards that milestone as it reaches the holidays.  Disney-Pixar's Cars 3 is looking at a weekend of around $12.2 million, down 54 percent from last weekend.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________  I know what a bad movie looks like when it's released. I know what it tastes like when I'm done with it. I don't want to be an arsehole, but I'm an arsed one. I have seen a lot of bad movies over the years. I hate them. I think you should get over it, but if you are still suffering, don't watch bad movies any more.   There are two things that make a bad picture 'bad'. The first is that the director didn't think it through. The second is that it has no redeeming value. The worst bad movies, in my experience, are those which were made by people with little to no interest in their creation.   The last one is the key. If the director has no interest, or little interest in what they're making, and the actors who are in it do, then it will be a really bad movie. If you watch one bad movie a year, you'll have seen them all. I watch about one film a year. I only watch them for the plot and the acting. If it's got a plot or an actor, then I'll probably watch it again and again.   A good movie, on the other hand, has to have some sort of redeeming feature. If an actor has a good performance in it, then you'll still go out of your way to see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had a hard time watching The Good Girl. I know I'm not the only one that felt like that but it wasn't as if I had no reason to watch it. The movie is set in a fictionalized version of Seattle and follows the story of Molly, a single mother with an abusive husband who is forced to move to Seattle by her employer when his insurance runs out. The first thirty minutes of the movie were fantastic with Molly's character having a great role in saving her son from a potentially fatal drug overdose.  However, as the movie went on the writing quality started to drop. I felt like a little was missing and I just wasn't feeling it. I know Molly is an amazing character but I just felt like the movie didn't make sense and it had too many gaps to really hold my attention. In order to make The Good Girls stand out, they decided to add an extra "twist" and they had the protagonist (Natalie) have an ex boyfriend that she loves. This twists and turns the movie and really brings it to another level. But again, I feel like it took a lot of the character development out of the story.  The Good Guys has a similar setup but it's not as good. I have to say, it was really hard to watch this movie and the first thirty or forty minutes really made me hate the characters.  In The Good Boys, this is the story about an orphaned boy who is raised by his uncle and his grandfather.  He is sent to live with his cousins after they are all killed by a fire. He goes back home and tells his cousin about the fire but he can't tell him that he killed all of the family.  Eventually, he realizes that this is what it's like to be an orphan and what it means to be human. The good guy boy eventually grows up and marries a girl and they have a son who dies in a motorcycle accident. The Good Boys  is a great movie that is great for anyone that loves stories of good vs evil and the consequences of that. If you have seen The Good Life, you will notice similarities to The Good Girlfriend.  I will say that The Good Boy was better written and that it did the theme well. However, it's hard to really tell when it was better. As far as bad movies go, I really liked The Bad Boys. This movie is about a bad boy that gets kicked out of his

This is a good action movie to watch if you love the "Matrix" movies. It will blow you away and will make you want to watch more of the movies. I did not like the ending of the movie at all. But that is not what I wanted. The ending of this movie would make more sense if it did not end in such a dramatic way. But the story is still a good story, and the action and the ending are very good. If you like action and want to see what happens when the world is threatened, this is a great movie. (I saw this for free on Netflix and the only cost was a movie ticket.) This movie is not for everyone, but it is worth watching if you enjoy action. I really thought the ending was a little much, but that's what people pay to watch movies, right? The only other thing that could have made the ending better was if the aliens came to Earth and killed everybody. But it's just me. I think this movie was a good watch. I recommend this movie to people who like action movies and like good story-lines.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________________________ My rating for this movie: 5/5 stars It is a good thriller, very well written and very well filmed. The acting is very good and the film has lots of action and suspense. The script by the writer is very well thought out, and he is an excellent director. The director has a lot of experience in making movies. The movie was a good buy for me. If you are a fan of thrillers, or thrillers in general, you should watch this movie. _________________________________________________________________ Reviews of this movie by other reviewers: __________________________________________________ "A film that brings us to a different place. It offers us the possibility of an experience that is not too easy and that is something that we have not had before. The world we live in is very limited and that's one of the main points of the movie. What this movie does is make us question the things that we think we know. The main character is in the wrong place at the wrong time. He is on his way to his meeting when he is stopped by someone who is also on his quest for something. The only way he has of escape is by helping the man in question. If he doesn't do that, he will find himself in the situation we have all been in countless times, before he even knows it. This movie is a unique piece of cinema that is highly enjoyable and will leave you thinking. I can not recommend it enough." - The Movie Bulletin "I don't know what the critics were smoking because I loved this movie! The storyline, the acting, and the world-building make this movie a masterpiece and the ending made me cry. I am very glad I got the chance to see this movie and I highly recommend it to all of you." - S.R.D.E. "I've just watched this film, and it was a real pleasure to do so. I highly enjoyed it and have now seen it two or three more times. This is a movie that everyone should see at least once." - C.S.E
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  I'm not here to tell you about bad movies. That's what bad movies are for. You have to be smart enough to know when to say when. But it's also necessary for you to know how to say the right thing. In particular, it's important to know what to say about movies that people might say are good. The right thing to say is that they're really, really, well-made.  Here's how I'll define this, and how you should define it. A good movie has:  Good directing. Good acting. Good production values. Good characters. Good story. 'shopping' to the music. That isn't a hard requirement, just something to look for. , if it's good, is an excellent film. The first two criteria are the easiest, the rest is hard, but worth it.  at least a decent screenplay, a decent director and a decent casting. This one is the hardest. Some people are so good at these things, but then, they can't be hired for a lot of other jobs, so they turn their focus to the entertainment world.  the writing is well-done. You want the writer to have a strong point of view. You don't want him or her to write a movie just to be popular or get good reviews or sell a lot. It has to have its own message. I mean, if the movie is so stupid that it can't even get its point across, it won't make a lot more sense to other people, either. It's not just about the script. I know I can't think of a good example of a movie that was completely directed by the writer, but the writing can still be good if it takes into account things that are important to the film. There is no way to make a good plot without good characters, but that doesn't mean the characters are terrible. I was going to list a few examples, but I didn't see any of them, so I didn. I'm sure there's a lot I'm forgetting. I also believe that the plot is more important than the characters, so even if the characters aren't that interesting, I can forgive a movie for having no plot. The last two points are a little tougher to define. I think these are the ones you want to talk about with friends. If you have a really good film, you'll find that the people around you have

Write a positive review about a good movie:   By David P. Greisman David P's review of "Avengers: Age of Ultron" (IMDB.com) is a great example of the kind of constructive criticism that should be a mainstay of any review, and especially of this site. Here we have a movie that is not simply a hit or a miss for me (and perhaps you as well) but one that is both a hit and a miss—or at least one that falls squarely into that category. I don't want to suggest that this is a bad movie by any means. The acting is top-notch and the film's action and character development are engaging. The special effects are good and it certainly looks like a lot of effort was put into every shot. The only thing that didn't work for me was the ending—a disappointing anticlimax. But when I think of "Age of Ultron," I think about those scenes that will be remembered for years to come. And "A+" really is that.

Thanks for the report!   I really enjoyed the new Voyager episode, "Equinox". The plot was interesting and there was a lot of drama, but there were also a lot funny moments.I really liked it and I'd love to see a TNG episode with a similar plot.Also the was the first episode where Captain Janeway was really present.In that way I think it's a good episode, but I'm not sure if it has the same quality as the other Voyager episodes.Thank you very much!And yes, it was written by a Trekkie. Also the Dathans was the last episode of DS9, and I was not too fond of it, but it got very good reviews. But the episode itself was a good one! The ending was not a cliffhanger, but just a logical conclusion. And the crew in DS9 was pretty good.Thank for your feedback.Yes, it's not the best TNG or DS9 episodes, but at the same time it's good enough. The new cast in DS911 was very nice, too. The only thing I didn't like was the way the story ended. I liked the resolution, but that was pretty unrealistic. Thank you very very much.I've had many thoughts about Voyager so far. It is interesting to see how the show progressed in the early years.Also we need to look at a bit the new characters, the Janeway from VOY and not a TOS Tuvok like we've seen in the TNG and DS9 series, but rather a better character like James T. Kirk and not the same old TOS guy.And finally the last part about the TOS character was not really convincing to me, I think.So far in TNG we've had a pretty good Enterprise crew (and a decent one in DS10), a pretty crappy one in TOS and a good TNG crew (with the exception of Sisko, but he's a "good guy").But in

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ "The only way to live in a civilized society is to learn to make your own choices." -- John Stuart Mill  "The very thing that keeps society together is that, though it may be divided into classes and tribes and nations, yet there is, within the vast mass, a sentiment which we call human nature. It is the sentiment that makes us forget and forgive the bad in ourselves, that makes our heart and conscience soften and forgive us, and which, though different from other classes and nations and races, yet is nevertheless one and the same with them. It forms the essence of our sociality. To keep society together it is absolutely necessary to keep this human nature in good repair; for without this it cannot keep together at all. It cannot but keep together if it is ever kept together. And it is of this sentiment that it is important to ask when we are asked what is the most important thing in the world." -- Ayn Rand  I've given this film a 4 out of 5 stars.

I can tell you the characters in this movie did not like each other, they all had their own reasons for doing what they were doing. I don't think that every movie needs to have a romance in it...but if it has it would be worth the watch.   at the end the movie ended well, I think they did a good job with the last scene.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ You're about to watch "Rent," a film so horrible that if I were to give you a single piece of advice for avoiding the horror film you are about to see, I would tell you to avoid this film as well. For some reason, "RENT" was chosen by The Weinstein Company to be screened at the 2017 SXSW Film Festival. I have no idea why this was chosen and frankly don't care. This is the same festival that screened "The Babadook." I am aware that "The Wailing," "The Invitation," "Annabelle: Creation" and "Love is the Drug" all won awards at this same festival. As you watch "Babadook" for the first time, you might be asking yourself, "Where's the humor?" I am afraid "Rented" has so little humor that it might as well not even be a horror film at all. I'm not sure I want to make this too obvious, but I was watching this film at the mercy of what I felt was a great screenplay. Unfortunately, when I look back and see how terribly written this film is, it's actually a little difficult to enjoy it. The entire film is set in a motel. I'll be frank, most of this movie takes place in a room at the Motel 6. The actors and the director do a fantastic job setting up this motel. The motel is populated by the same old cast of characters we see in so many horror films. Let's look at them and see who they are and what's going on in this motel: The Host: You can't really call this guy a "Host." He seems like the most obnoxious Host ever. What I really don't like about him is that the whole film is so over his head. His son is dead and he is just trying to get through the day. He thinks he is living in a world of comfort, but this is not reality. This has been shown in so, so many films, but it's a real struggle to see this guy struggle and try to keep up in this world. T-Bag: I'm gonna say right now, the guy has nothing going on. He's in an apartment in some hotel. I don't think he is in any danger. His entire life is a lie. He doesn't know he is being filmed all the time. He sees everyone else as people, but he

I was thrilled with the sequel, "The Hateful Eight," which had a good script and performances by some wonderful actors. (I've seen both movies in IMAX 3D. And, yes, I did see a few lines of dialogue I could not understand and have to get someone to translate them. It's not like they didn't read the lines -- but I guess some of them weren't spoken very clearly.)  I'm a fan of Django Unchained and I will definitely see the second film, "Dystopian."  David  27 Oct 2007  Hi, I just saw this on DVD. Its a good action film with a strong female lead. It takes place in the US in the sixties and theres some nice action scenes, with great chase scenes.

There was a great story, a great cast, a fun film. But we lost one of the greatest characters of all time in the making of this film: the brilliant, but ill-equipped, Dolphin Splicer. We look back on the film that put an end to this brilliant character, and ask what the film should have been. I know what you're thinking: "I think this is a good idea. This will make a great podcast." But no. No this is not a good podcast. Not at all. This podcast contains the following plot: The movie is actually a terrible idea. The movie begins with a good story, but it is completely undone in the third act, and it's all downhill from there.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ Why don't you make a movie you really want to see? Or a movie that you really don't want to watch. Write it down. If it isn't good enough, you can always go back and do it. Why should you waste your time watching bad movies? You should see some good movies to make yourself better, or more enthusiastic about making other films. How can you make movies you actually like and want to make? One method is by watching other people's movies. And it is not an easy task, because most of the movies I watch are either bad, or have bad endings. But it is possible if you look for them. What you must do first is that you should be able to see the story. After that, try to notice the characters. Look for similarities. There are certain ways that you can do this: 1. Read through the credits of other people movies. 2. Watch movies at home with a friend. You can say "How do you like this movie?" and you can find out if he or she likes the movie too. 3. Watch a movie when it is on TV. 4. Find a movie which you can see it at a mall or something similar. 5. Listen to music which you like. You don't have to think about what is wrong in the music, you just enjoy it. You should think about something you like and what you want to do with it. Once you find something which you want, you will try to achieve it, with or without the help of the help from others. But if you can't do this, you should do some other things. 6. Try to go to a cinema or a theater and watch the movie that interests you. It's worth it to try. If you are lucky, you might be able somehow to help the other person's movie. 7. Read the script or watch the scene in the movie which interests you the most. 8. Ask your friend's suggestions. Try and find what they like about the movie. 9. Find out who is responsible for the movie and ask them why they are making it. 10. Don't talk to people who tell you about movies that are really bad. 12. Do some things which are not very important, like playing with a mouse, or watching the movies on a computer. When you have finished with these things, it's time for you to have the best movie in the world. How do you have the most fun watching

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________  I want to go to the movies as much as the next person. I've always loved the genre and have enjoyed almost all of the big-budget studio movies I've seen. Unfortunately, my interest in the genre has dwindled in recent years, and there hasn't been any new Hollywood fare in a long while. So when I stumbled on the news that Disney's The Jungle Book, the second in the beloved Jungle Book series, was coming to theaters, I couldn't be more excited. I can't wait to see the first movie (Jungle Book) back in 2002 and see how Disney has brought this charming series to the big screen. I also like to know if any of the characters from the books have appeared in other Disney movies.  Of course, this is a movie I'd want to see in theaters and I want to know about how it turns out. But since the press release for The Jungle Books was so vague and vague on a lot of the details, I was kind of hoping for a bit more detail in the marketing campaign. Thankfully, this press release offers some details on the film and the film's star, Jason Bateman, as well as the cast and filmmakers:  Based on the book by Rudyard Kipling, The Jungle World is a feature-length live action adventure that finds a young boy named Tim who is captured by a savage jungle tribe. Forced to live with them, he is trained in their ways, learning the language and customs of the savage tribe in order to learn the secrets of the world.

It is easily the best movie of the decade, and probably of all time. It's so good it makes me weep at times, and yet it's so realistic it makes you laugh out loud. You'll be laughing out loud at the ending and in the fact that the film is a remake of an earlier movie. You will be saying "what the f... is this" when the credits roll. It has heart. And it has action. And, for whatever reason, it really doesn't matter that you've seen it. I know there's a lot of sequels to this film, but for me "The thing" is a masterpiece. It is the best thing since John Carpenter's "The Fog" and I would not be surprised if the best film is in fact just an extended version of "The first thing". It's that good.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. If you are going to praise a movie and it makes you feel bad, then your opinion is likely going to sound like: _________________. So don't.  And don't praise someone for having an opinion that you disagree with. That's lame and annoying. It's like complimenting someone for being a good cook or a good mechanic. If someone doesn't like your cooking, don't give them compliments about how good it is, even if they are being nice about your cooking. And don't compliment someone for not having an accent if you disagree. You're not going to get the same enjoyment out of that as someone who does.  and don't if you are not having fun at the party.  I have spent a lot of time thinking about what is fun and what is not fun, but the following is what I've come up with, and it has worked well for me: If I get something I don't like, I just throw it away. If I'm drinking and I'm thinking of something else, I don't drink. If something's on TV I'm not watching, I throw it out. If it's something I want to do with a partner, I sit it out or change the topic. If there is music, I'll stop listening and ignore it. If we're going to have a movie or something, it's fun for everyone if we do something together instead of going to the movies alone. And if something's bad, that's just how it is. I think a good rule is to make friends, talk about the things you enjoy, and try to be pleasant. And let everyone else be happy about their fun. If it turns out your parents or grandparents or grandpa can't get along, just leave. Or be prepared to take it to the people who get along well and tell them how you feel. You don't owe them anything. If they can't accept you, they have no right to you. That's it, and that's how I learned to have fun again. It was actually very hard to learn to be happy again, but I think it's important to learn how to deal with pain. That is a learning experience, and you have to learn it the hard way. You can't learn it by waiting until you get hurt. You have to go through the pain. If the pain is good, you will learn how not to take pain too seriously

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ This movie is a real winner and will not disappoint any fan of horror, action, suspense, thrillers, or action films. There are numerous great scenes, great performances and a great storyline. This movie should be on all horror fans radar. Don't let the length deter you. This is the best suspense/thriller/action film I've seen. Great action scenes. I enjoyed the fight scenes and will definitely be watching this movie again. This was the best action film I saw this year! - March 14, 2008A Must Watch  Reviewer: John P. - favorite favorite favorite - September 16, 2006  Subject: A Great Drama This is a great movie and I've been meaning to watch it for a while. The performances are top-notch, and the director has done a fine job with it. It's not exactly like 'the Bourne trilogy', but I found the plot to be more satisfying than the other Bourne films. The actors are terrific. There is not much action in this film, but it's good nonetheless. I think it's a good, good film. It will probably be remembered for being a good thriller and that will be the point of it all. - September 17, 2006A Great Drama  _________________  "As is so often the case, there are those who can look at a bad picture and find beauty in it, and there are others who find it impossible to look at it without being moved."  --Aldous Huxley - September 20, 2006The Best Thriller I've Seen In Years  Thank you for posting this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________.  Don't say that the movie is good but the writing is bad: _______.  (No, you don't get to say that, either, you just suck at it.)  Write about a movie you're afraid to see, that you've only seen in trailers or in reviews you've read: ___________________. . /Film. It was so frustrating not being able to read the reviews for my movies, which were usually very detailed and helpful. This allowed me to watch a movie with some confidence because I knew exactly where to put my focus and how much I should expect from it. (I'll write more about this in a future post.) This one was the first movie I ever saw that I felt really, really good about the ending. It really set the mood, and the way that it was done really felt like it was a real ending. I felt that it actually ended the movie on a high note, which was really good, so that was a good thing, and it actually felt like the story had been wrapped up. The writing itself was very good, and I loved seeing that the characters had grown and that we were going to be able to see them continue to grow. But then we got to the movie. And the movie was good, but it just didn't feel like it had been properly wrapped up like I hoped it would. It was a pretty good movie, I loved it. But the thing is that when you're in a movie, that isn't a film you're supposed to sit through and then leave. You don't just want to watch the movie and then move on. There's a very important moment in that movie that I thought was really important, and that was at the end. But it just felt like a big letdown. I don't know why, because I loved the movie, but when the movie ended and you were left with nothing, it just made me feel like I was leaving. So yeah, I'm a little annoyed that it ended there. But that's not what bothered me about it. It bothered me that the last five minutes didn't have any sort of closure to it. I'm also going to point out here that I'm not sure if these movies are really "good" at all. They certainly have their moments and they have their plot holes, but I don It's a movie that is not made to be easy to watch. It

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ How to Make Movies for Free: ______________________________ A Quick Overview of Free Movies _________________________ The easiest way to make movies for free is to make a movie in your spare time. If you've seen movies like The Dark Knight, you'll probably find that's pretty easy to do, but there are a few more things you need to know. _____________________________ What is the best way to get movies? ___________________________ A few of the most common ways to get a movie for free are: 1. Emailing the filmmaker : You don't need a huge budget or special equipment, so this is the easiest way. You send an email, and the filmmaker will write you back about a possible movie. 2. Using a site like Movie2K: This site lets you submit a short film for distribution, and it's free. 3. Sending a tweet to the filmmaker: Here's a simple way to contact a filmmaker, but it's not necessarily free. You do need a Twitter account, but you can make one very cheaply. 4. Buying a movie: Most filmmakers will let you purchase movies if you pay in cash. If they do, be careful about what you buy. Some may not be released on DVD, or may be a "limited edition" that will only be available on DVD. I recommend contacting the filmmaker first. ______________________________________________________________________________ About Chris Klimek You know him as the creator of the popular comic strip The Adventures of Dr. McNinja. He's also an Emmy-nominated writer, producer, director, and actor. Here's what a lot of folks in Hollywood are saying about him... "You've written some of the finest comic strips of all time...I've read the books, you're just as brilliant as the characters." -Bill Willingham, creator of The Twilight Zone "Chris Klimeck is one of the funniest guys I know. He writes funny comics, and makes them all look so easy." -Barry J. Malzberg "One of the few people who can make you want to draw all your own pictures." -Walt Kelly, creator, The Wild Wild West, and The Adventures Of Pete & Pete "You make me laugh as much as anything I've ever read." -Mike Tyson "I love Chris. He is a funny guy, and he makes me laugh every time I see him." -T.C. Boyle "Great Comic Strip. And
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ How many of the movies that were featured in the Top 100 are actually worth watching, and why?  1. Jaws (1975) A great first film for Steven Spielberg, the third sequel to Jaws has everything: adventure, mystery, romance and a beautiful, haunting score. The cast is great in all three sequels, as well as a few others.  2. The Godfather (1972) This movie is probably one of the greatest films of all time, a must-see for any fan of the spaghetti western genre. It has a great lead actor, a beautiful cinematography, a memorable cast, and a complex story.  in my opinion, this movie is underrated. It's so complex it requires some research to truly enjoy it.  a great way to introduce yourself to the world of the mafia.  the second in the Godfather series, is actually more successful, especially if you are interested in the film's "legacy".  3. The Dark Knight (2008) The film has the biggest budget of any comic book film, and is the second highest grossing movie of all-time. It is a gritty, dark fantasy with fantastic performances from Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and many others. I'm not sure it really qualifies as a sequel, but is still an excellent movie.  on the other hand, The Darker and Deeper is a great and emotional film that really makes you care for the characters, particularly Batman. If you have never seen it, it's a must watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  I think people who haven't seen it are going to be impressed by the movie, but I hope they also enjoy the show. I love this show, and I'm pretty sure everyone else will, too. There's a great balance of humor and sadness, and the writing is excellent. There are a couple of jokes in the show that seem too obvious or stupid, but they're not. This show is more mature than most people realize. The jokes and characters are relatable and relatable, and while the story gets a bit heavy at times, it's all about the humor. I think a lot of people will like this show even if they've seen the movie.  -Michael K. 's review, June 1, 2010:  This is really good. I loved the way the characters were drawn and acted. I've seen many other cartoons, but this one has more heart. I thought the ending was a little bit silly, but the rest of the movie is great. I would like to see the movie a second time in order to get the ending right.  it was pretty funny  —Cecil T.  I didn't really enjoy this one. I felt that it could be better, but overall it didn't bother me much.  (8.3/10) –A.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________  ______________________  A positive review is like a little gift from a happy parent. You could say, "I really enjoyed 'Crazy Heart'"  "This was one of my favorite films of last year. It's a fantastic film about the human condition."  I would have the same opinion of that last one. It is not a film about a human condition. It does not even attempt to be about that. It tries to do this and that but fails miserably at every one of them.  In that regard, I would have to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a pass. A negative review is a lot more convincing. .
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love Star Wars and a great movie is worth a read and a watch. In my mind, I love the movies Star Wars is about. The original trilogy is the best in my opinion because of the themes of family and fatherhood. The prequel trilogy however was a great film that I still enjoy, despite the film still being decades old. I feel the prequels were a missed opportunity, though it still is an amazing movie and the first trilogy is still my favorite of the trilogy. This is a Star Wars trilogy review. Star Wars is a great franchise because it is not just about what is going to happen in the film, but about what will happen in your life. The series has touched on many different issues including racism, gender roles, slavery, and the future of the galaxy. The movies do not only provide entertainment, but they also provide important messages about our society. This film is about fatherhood and family, so it should be about fatherly advice to daughters and sons. I found many of the advice to be helpful. The movie doesn't say the movie is good because it offers great advice. The film is bad because it gives bad advice. For example, the film's title is a pun: A boy meets a girl and decides to stay with her, so he builds a lightsaber and goes into battle. Then, he decides to get a real lightsaber.  But, this is not an example of bad advice, it's a parable. Star Wars uses the Star Wars universe to teach the audience how to be good and good friends, but then it takes them a couple hours into the story to be introduced to a lightsaber. It's a silly example, but I found it to be a good parable for my movie. If the father is in a bad relationship, this could be a parabolic arc for him. This parabolic path is what leads the father to find the love of his life, the love that makes the world a better place. That is what I was referring to. The parabolic trajectory that leads an individual to find his or her true self, and become better than themselves. The film has a nice balance of light sabers, lightsaber battles, and fatherly love. It takes time to understand the relationship between Han and Leia. For a film with many characters it was a slow build, but it does get there. It gives great fatherly support to the daughters. This movie was really good at teaching lessons to

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________.  1. A Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1987)  2. The Last Temptation of Christ (2005)  The last of the Freddy films (it would appear) and probably the most beloved. It has a special place in my heart for a reason: it was the first time I heard people refer to Freddy as a "character" and not just a "scarecrow" and I liked it because it gave the character more depth and a backstory and because it made him much more interesting and fun to watch. The last three sequels, "The Dark Night Of The Soul", "The Last Stand", and "The Final Chapter" did a lot of things right, but none of them were as good as the first one. They didn't capture what I loved about the first film, which is that Freddy is scary, but he isn't a villain. When the other characters are trying to kill him, they're terrified. He's not mean. He doesn't want to kill them. He just wants to play. It's a wonderful balance, and I like that. . It's not that I hated it, it's just that it didn't quite capture my favorite qualities of Freddy. In particular, Freddy was a much less interesting character in the last three films and his relationship with Rosemary was much more one-sided than in the first movie, which I feel was one of the things that made the film so great. This leads me into my next point:  . A Good Movie Can Have Good Characters  It just can. A good movie can have great characters. That was the great thing about the movies that got me to see horror movies for the first and maybe the last time and it was what turned me on to genre movies in the early 90's. And a good film can have the best characters of all time, especially if they're all funny and fun. When you watch something good, whether you like it or not, you're going to laugh a lot, you'll be entertained a lot and you'll go home happy. And most importantly, you will want to return to see more. I think this is a big reason why there is such a large gap between the movies on my list, and the movies you see on IMDb. Some movies you can easily find on YouTube or Amazon or Netflix and some you won't, and that's why some people might not be getting

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I haven't seen any of these, but here are a few of the reviews I found to be pretty good. I'm not a big fan of the original series, but they make good movies. If you haven't watched them, I highly recommend them: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101097/review - by xrp - August 11, 2013"There are no spoilers here, but it's obvious by the end that the guy (Mr. White, played by a very talented actor named Jim Cummings) has really got to do what he wants or get thrown into the gulag."I guess this isn't a spoiler, but the guy who goes to jail in this movie is the same guy who has been playing the main villain for the entire series, so there is definitely something going on here. Also, the villain seems pretty cool to me...if this guy goes to prison and becomes a regular in this town, it will be a lot cooler. I don't see how it could be a spoiler. - by jcg79 - July 31, 2013I would recommend this to all kids who haven't yet seen the TV series. - July 9, 2013A decent action flick. - June 27, 2013Interesting storyline, good effects and the plot was pretty decent. - March 11, 2014The best of the Star Wars movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  A good movie I enjoyed. The dialogue is not too great, but I don't care that much. The character I liked was a villain that I would love to see in a movie that I watched. He was well written and well acted. The movie was well paced with a great ending. The villain had good story to tell and a good evil plan. It's a great movie for kids that are looking for some fun.  Helpful good movie to watch! This was one of my all time favorite movies when I was a kid. When I think about it now, it still is great! I especially loved the villains, the way they made us hate the bad guy and the fact that they never said that he was really evil. The acting in this movie was top notch. I especially enjoyed the villain, the plot, and the ending of this movie. It is definitely worth watching if you have kids in the family.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. Don't feel obliged to share your thoughts in this way. This is a safe space for your thoughts. The point is to show the film in a positive light. Do not be negative. Do try to find a positive thing to say about the film that does not detract from the positive feelings you're feeling about the movie. I personally felt this way about the last two parts. If you can't find something positive to say, don't say anything.  2) Don't be an elitist. If someone mentions that they liked it, be the first to tell them that they should watch it. If there is someone out there with a similar opinion to your own, be your own voice. Do your best to let the film speak for itself and let the movie speak for you. "The Matrix was one of the first movies I saw, and the first film I can really say I enjoyed as much as I should have. And I really have to give that a thumbs up, not only because it's good, but also because it was so well done. The acting is top-notch, the dialogue is well-written, and there is a lot of thought put into every little detail that makes it so enjoyable to watch." - Christopher Booker, director of the documentary "The Truth About The Matrix"  3) Don t go out of your way to be mean or judgmental. There will be critics, bloggers, and casual moviegoers that will go on and on about how a film is good or bad. Be the first.  the first one to tell everyone that the film is bad. It can be easy to get caught up in the hype and the praise that some people may give something, and lose sight of the reality of the work itself. If people are negative, the best thing to do is not be one of those people. If people are being negative, it will just serve to reinforce the negative feelings you have about the piece, and may be very detrimental to your desire to see it again. And this goes for everything. If somebody is critical about something, let them know why, and be the one to do it. They'll know you didn't go out there and get that for them. Saying a movie is bad or boring can be a tough pill to swallow. I get it. I totally understand why you would take offence, and how that might affect you, but there is no way to prevent

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   A good movie doesn't need to be good, good doesn't have to be great, good just has to be. It's the same with movies, but the difference is that in movies, you have to know what the plot is in order to enjoy them. I'm not going to give you a plot summary for a movie, because you don't need one, but you need to know who is who and why is it happening in the first place. Even if you don' t care about the characters and are just interested in the story, it doesn't hurt to be aware of what is going on.   I don't know about you, but I enjoy reading about things that happen to my favorite people. That's not to say that I don't like reading about movies and television shows, but when I come across a movie that is so good that I have to write a review about it, that's really special. I think that the majority of the time, people write reviews about the movie or TV show that they were watching last week, but it was so great that I had to write about it this week. I hope you'll give it a chance, even if it doesn' t make much sense, and just enjoy the movie. If you don;'t like it, don't worry, it won't be coming back to your TV anytime soon.  , starring Kevin Bacon and Michael Caine is a movie where I don'T know about the plot. We learn a little bit about the lives of the main characters, but that isn't really what I enjoyed. The movie follows a very small group of people, and the fact that they have to work in a secret government agency to find out what's going on in a war torn country is what keeps me interested. This isn't the first time the movie has been made, but in my opinion it was improved in a number of ways. The actors were excellent, the story was exciting and I enjoyed the twists.

I thought the violence was going be something really out of this world. And then I got to the end and it was the most brutal and horrible thing I have ever seen. And all the way through I kept saying, "what was that?" And then at the end, it just said, "War has been declared by the government." I didn't know what that meant, but that's the first real indication that something bad is going to happen. I couldn't see any good things that could come of it. Then I saw 'In Bruges' and it just changed my whole world. That film really did me in. It taught me about life and how much money you can lose and how easy it is to get yourself into a lot trouble. It just taught me how to survive in a way that was totally unexpected. Then it gave me the opportunity to work with some of the greatest directors who ever lived, and it really changed my life as a person and opened a whole new world. I'll be honest, I don't remember a lot about the second film in the trilogy. I know it was filmed in the late 70s, but there were just so many things that happened on that movie, and there's a lot I want to go back and re-watch and think about. But that's my opinion. "The Empire Strikes Back" came out in 1980, and I was so blown away by it. That movie was a complete experience. That's the movie I've looked forward to my whole life. It was a huge film for me, and you think you know it's a giant movie but then you go to the movie theater and you're blown away. You get blown away, and then you come home and you watch it over and over again because it just continues to get bigger and bigger. And the characters are so great and the cast so amazing. Then the next movie, "Return of the Jedi" came around in 1983, and they started changing and expanding the story, but it was a movie that took me right back to the first one. It had such a deep impact on my

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________   This film is very, very good, and I think it should be viewed with the full force of its strengths and not with its weaknesses.   I had never been much of a fan of Stephen King before I saw the movie, but from the first frame I was sucked in. This was a really scary and scary horror film, but I'm not sure it had a lot of scares in it. The main villain was scary, but the only scary thing was when he was a child. This film had a very dark story about children who have gone missing, and the search for them is made more difficult by the fact that there aren't any children, and all the evidence they had left behind is just a few pieces of wood.  , but this is not a good thing. The film is more concerned with horror than horror. This makes it a very scary film, and one I've seen many times on DVD. However, in terms of scares, it isn't that good. It has a lot more horror than scares, but it's so good at the latter that it really just ruins the film. I wouldn't recommend this film to someone who likes to watch scary films.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________  I've seen "Rampage: Total Recall" about a dozen times over the last five years, and I still love it every time. It's not an excellent movie, it has a very loose story, and there's a lot of CGI that's way over the top, but it is still an action movie like the ones I've always loved: "Die Hard" and "Saving Private Ryan" for example.  Also Read: 'Blade Runner' Sequel: Ridley Scott Finally Makes Good on His 'Alien' Prophecy  Scott has given us some very imaginative and exciting action scenes, but at the same time he's also created a very realistic world, and he has given all the characters real emotional depth, and real problems that they've got to deal with in their lives. "Rising from the Ashes" is the perfect film to show how well his movie world has been made.  is an excellent, well-made action film with great acting, great special effects, and an interesting story about some very familiar and even beloved characters. That's a good recipe for a classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's like watching an old buddy, I'm just glad we're friends again". If you are a fan of the book: "If you're a fan, you must read this book for yourself. It's the one that got away". (Review: *********)"  This film is an interesting piece of cinema because of its different point of view. It has the same plot but the narrative style is entirely different with the characters of the film acting more like an ensemble of friends rather than a group of strangers. It also makes the character of Nick very distinct. He is very laid back and friendly but he has a heart of gold. There are scenes in the film that take place in an alleyway in a dark city in an old city where everyone is out having fun, Nick is not there. He has his own story to tell. He was very hard to act on for most of the cast but he makes a good first impression on the characters with the help of their characters. It was very difficult to put this film into a trailer but I had fun with it. I am not a big fan of horror films but I found the film to be entertaining, even though I didn't really like it.  It's hard to give any score to it because there are so many things that could've been better.    Overall: I give this film a 3/5 stars.  "This was my first foray into acting and I'm very proud of what I got out of it. The role of Nick is certainly one I don't think any actor could play well. He's not really the type to talk a lot about his past, but when he does it comes across like he's opening up to a friend." It was a lot of fun to work with Tom Wilkinson.  I loved that he put his own spin on the script and I love his character Nick.  We actually had a lot in common. He would say to me "Don't worry about the dialogue, it's going to be in your face" when I had a rough time with the script. He also took a lot on himself. I saw him try out for the role of Alex in the documentary and he would try on different accents to get the accent right. I know there are some actors that can get away with acting a role without any direction at all but I would not have been able to do that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ * The movie: One day you walk into a movie theatre and your seat is next to some dude who looks like a biker gang member and yells at the screen, "Get your ass over here! Get your ass up here!" and you don't want to. He doesn't even make a good point in the movie, he just says "Get an ass up over here!" over and over and then says "Fuck you bitch! Fuck you!" and that's it. It's a horrible movie. But what is a good, bad or average movie in a film review? A bad movie is bad. An average movie is average. A good movie is good. What makes something good or bad: ------------------------- What makes a movie good? -------------------------- What makes it a bad movie? ------------ What makes the movie an average movie? What makes an average film good? What separates a good film from a bad one? If a film has good story lines, if it can have a good action sequence, if the acting is believable, and it's good, that's what makes the film good. If it's bad, it's because the director failed to put the script together correctly, because the script is bad, because it's poorly written, or because the actor is a horrible human being, which is what happens with a majority of the movies on this list. The one thing that makes a bad film good, and bad film average, is that it has something great in it. An example of this would be that "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope" is an average, good, Star Wars movie because of the story. It tells an epic story and the story lines are very well done. Even the special effects, if you have to mention them at all, are good. The acting is well done too, and is a very good example of the greatness of George Lucas' imagination. And this is where the one thing separates a bad, average, and good film, is the script. If the script sucks, the film is not good, but the script can make the entire film good if the actors, the director, and the editing are good enough to work with. In the case of "Star Trek" II: The Wrath of Khan", it's possible that they had a terrible script, but George Lucas created a wonderful story that worked perfectly together, and they still had a great film. But even the script for "Rashomon",

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________  2.5 stars. You've got some problems. It's a movie that is just, well, a movie, and so I won't judge it too harshly for that. I was a bit turned off by it initially, I found it not as strong of a movie as it could've been. But if you have some patience to sit down and watch it, then by all means you will enjoy it. It is a very good movie with a very solid premise that is kept on the rails by an excellent cast that you will have to get a grip with. This is not a movie for everyone, but if you can get past its flaws you will be rewarded in a very satisfying way.  It's not that this movie is perfect, but it certainly is a good, solid movie that just happens to be slightly flawed. A movie is only as good as it is bad, and this movie can be seen as a bit of an early miss if you ask me. The main problem is that the story is not particularly gripping or engaging. It tries to be but ends up being just a little too repetitive.  (Visited 5,084 times, 1 visits today)
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  5 out of 5 A MUST WATCH!!!! I was really surprised how great the movie was. I didn't know it had a sequel. I did know about the first film but didn't realize it was such a good one. The acting and story line was so good. The characters were so much like my friends in college. I am so glad they were brought back for the sequel. The storyline was also good. I liked the "it's a trap" aspect of it. There were a couple of good jokes. I'm happy they are bringing this to Netflix. The only complaint is that some of the cast did look like they were 30 years old.  3 out of 3 stars I can't wait for the next "The Chronicles of Riddick" movie to come out on Netflix! This movie is just terrible. The actors didn't act like they knew what they were doing. I know Riddikins (who the lead character is named after) is an insane and feral person who doesn't think the world revolves around him, but the movie made him look like a fool. The "cannibal" aspect was just as pointless. A few people in the world seem to get a taste of "Riddick's" cannibalism, but I don't think they'll be getting a taste for the rest of their lives. I just hope they don't ruin the future of the series.  a  4 out of 4 stars I didn;t see the first movie so I guess I'm more of an aficionado of the first "RIDDINK" movie. However I did enjoy this movie as well. I was not disappointed with the acting in this movie. The story line (which I didn?t understand at first) was just so different from the original movie. A lot of it is the characters that we?ve come to love in the first series. So the movie wasn't perfect, but it certainly wasn't bad. I would say this movie was better than the original RIDDICK series. The Riddicks were definitely more likeable, and the movie seemed to be more like an action film. Overall, I liked this movie a lot.  the second  2 out of 2 stars It just didn?tey me to not like this movie! The first film is awesome and this one is just boring and uneventful. It is just a generic horror flick with little to nothing

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie, while a pretty bad movie, is also one of the greatest of all time. If you enjoy your movies with lots of action, explosions, and action scenes (a good mix for a film in 1990) than you will definitely like this movie. 6. "Hogan's Heroes" (1996) This film had a bunch of actors and the writers could have used a few more (or even more than just one). The acting is so bad that they almost seem to be trying to make it work. The plot is a bit vague and it really didn't go where you think it was going, but the film is worth a watch. It has some pretty good action scenes and some amazing shots of a desert. This film could be worse, but if you enjoy movies about ninjas, then this one is a must see. 5. "Scooby-Doo! and the Ghoul School" (1986) The movie is about a group of kids who get lost in the woods and end up trapped in a school full of ghouls. They are trapped and in danger but somehow they somehow defeat the ghouls and they escape. The kids are all great. I would really like to see a sequel with a couple of the original cast members back for another adventure. 4. "A Bug's Life" (1978) A good action movie about a little kid who has to save his friends by finding a bug with a gun. It is a pretty good adventure film. The story takes a turn for the better in the last 20 minutes or so and the ending really brings a lot of emotion to the film. It was a great movie and has a lot to say. It seems a bit dated now, but is still a good film. 3. "The Mask" (1985) My favorite mask of all-time is the one from "The Ring" (1984). The story goes like this: a group in the present day (1985 or so) go back to the 1980s (somehow they manage to stay in the 1980's with the masks). The whole movie is filled with the kind of bad jokes you see in the 80's movies and it just works. It's a simple story about a bunch who are trying to find out who killed their parents and how they did it. It may seem very predictable but it's actually really clever. It could have made for an excellent TV series. 2. "Spider

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  What to like or dislike about it: _______  ___________________  and so on, ad infinitum. I'm trying to find a way to combine all these concepts into something concrete so you can make an informed decision on this. I don't have all the answers, but I have some thoughts on why people watch the shows they do.  This is the best way I can figure to go about it because it's the easiest way I've seen to look at the problem of a show being "uninteresting".  There are two ways that I can put the problems of a good show into perspective:  1) There is a lot of wasted time in these shows.  a) There are episodes where you know how the show will end, but you watch it anyway because you are invested in the characters, the story, the tone, the humor, etc. This is not a problem in its own right, but it can be detrimental to a show's enjoyment. ,  b) The show is in danger of being boring as a result of this wasted time.  was a great example. There were a few episodes that were just a slog for a lot longer than they should have been, and there were others that were only good for 30-60 minutes, which is a huge chunk of time to be spending on a show. The thing is, this wasted 60 minutes has nothing to do with plot holes, confusing plot progression, too much exposition, and so forth. If this was all you were worried about, you probably should have started watching the show in the beginning and avoided all the boring episodes that you eventually got into because they weren't that bad. ...  2) The problems are usually things that have nothing to to do directly with the story and are not connected to it in any way.  in The Big O, this was the whole reason the show had to be made, because they were going to have to fill an hour of time with the two main characters talking. There are several episodes that follow one character for a few hours. There is another episode where they talk for an hour. But these are things you already know about these characters, so they don't really matter. There's nothing inherently "bad" about these episodes and they are not bad because they have some kind of plot holes. They are bad because the characters were never able to develop them into a good storyline. The

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A great film about the life and death of a man, but with lots of heart, humor and heart." Posted by Unknown at 8:13 AM I can't wait to see "Death at a Funeral." That was just a fantastic book! The characters are brilliant, the writing is crisp, the story is well told, and the author really makes the reader feel the turmoil of the character. A very well written book. June 3, 2013 at 3:51 PM Diana Wray said... I just love this book. My son and I watched the film, but have yet to finish the book. I don't even know how many times I've read it, but I feel like I know all the characters. I think that is why I enjoyed it so much. I loved each of them, with their different stories, relationships and personalities. I was hooked. Thanks for writing this awesome book. Diana Wray June 2, 2013

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do you remember that movie about the teacher and the kid? Well, there's a similar story about a school teacher and his students. But it's about teachers of course, because what the movie needs is a teacher. I want to believe. ______________ In the morning, we had a group of young people: they were good looking. They were a bit too young, maybe they were high school students, maybe not, we don't know. They all looked very strong, muscular, and attractive. The teachers were all friendly and smiled, and had pleasant personalities. The students were nice, too. The school grounds were quiet and quiet were quiet. I think they were all thinking about school. They didn't seem like they were interested in the people around them. We all had our own opinions, but no one had a really good opinion of the school. Then, we went back home. It was too early to go home, as I knew all the streets, so I told the young man to get me my car. I told him to get the car back to the same parking place I had been sitting. I asked the young people to leave, but the young men refused. The young man asked them what was the reason why they had to leave. They just said that they were going to a party at the house of a local businessman. He asked them where they wanted to go, and they said they were just going to pick up their stuff. They seemed happy, and I think this is what really made me happy. It makes me happy to think that maybe, maybe, I can change a person's mind. And even if they don't change their mind, it will at least make them look forward to the future. The day was overcast and there were clouds in the sky, which caused the sun to come down. We spent the day in the garden, talking. He was telling me about the situation and what he was going to do next. I said that I had a nice car, and he said he had a car, too, but he had just gotten it in the last week. And there were other cars around, so maybe there was a car around here somewhere that I could get in, too! After talking, I told my wife that we should go for a drive. I took her to the park across the street. I was going straight there to get her, but I was stopped by a woman who asked my wife where she was

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  A good movie is one that leaves the viewer with a positive impression about the movie, and that's what the movie here does. I was not sure how I would enjoy a movie like this. It was a mystery thriller about an FBI agent who is sent to investigate a mysterious crime. He quickly discovers that the case involves a secret underground military base with a highly classified research project. The movie is quite well acted, and I really liked the characters. I found it to be a very dark, twisted movie, although not in the way you'd expect. If you are looking for a light, happy ending, you might not like this movie. But if you are in the mood for a movie that's full of twists and turns, then this is the movie for you. The ending was somewhat predictable, but that didn't really take away from the enjoyment I had from the movie. It's worth watching this movie because of its dark and twisted storyline.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  I am not a "professional" but this is what I do, and I like it: https://twitter.com/mattfowler4 This film is a "must watch" for anybody that has an interest in history, psychology, history of science, history and the human condition. It is a good, concise overview and presentation of this field. I'm really excited to go to see this film on Sunday. My hope is that a similar film will be made in the future and will give people a "bigger picture" view of this topic. Thanks for this film, Matt, you are doing great things! I think this film is definitely worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________.  A bad movie is _________.    Why does "Bad Movies" exist?   Good movies are so often overlooked, but they are the lifeblood of the movie industry. They make it possible for the average moviegoer to have a movie that is entertaining without being pretentious. A good movie that you watch for a great performance will make you say, "Wow, that was great!" You might not even remember it the next time you see it. A bad movie makes you wish you had seen the first one, and will make it impossible for you to enjoy a second one.   In order to be a "bad movie" it takes an extraordinary amount of effort and creativity to pull off. No matter how bad the movie, a bad film will be remembered. The good movies are the ones that are forgotten.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It helps a lot to have your friends who watched the movie to write a positive comment. It will help your ratings rise and it will also improve your word-of-mouth. It is very important to have someone to help you if you do not know how to direct a movie. There are plenty of other directors who want to be a movie director and they would rather direct their own movie than work with you.  It will also give you a lot of trust in you and the film you're making.  There are many directors who love to tell other filmmakers how good their movie is. Some of them even take the name of a movie and are so sure that their movie will be great that they won't even give you the script and only the idea of the movie.  It will also increase the production of your film. There have been many movies where there is no budget, no actors, and only a director who does not care about the movie and is only thinking about their career and the money they will make. If there is a good script, a good director, a decent cast and great location, there will be many more people who will want to work with them.  If you make your first movie as an independent movie and do a good job, you can get a lot more financing and also you could even get the rights to your movie. You can also get the studio involved and give them money and make the movie their idea.  A good script is also a big plus in the market and helps increase the potential of a film. It also helps you make good money and if you know your script will work, it will be easier for the audience to get to see your movie even before it is released.  Your script will help to increase the number of those who see your film and it also helps the movie market and also the film itself.  You also will get your story into the minds of more people and that is also important for the film to succeed.  Having a good screenplay is also great for the movie business. A screenplay needs more attention than a good music and is also good to have a good idea for the script. You must give the movie a good name. You will get more people interested and it is also helpful to the movie when it comes out.  In the long run, the script that you wrote is very good and will make you get more jobs to work on it.  The director, the storyteller, the actors
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ The Dark Knight Rises Review by James N. Goodman, MD Reviewed by James Goodman MD on June 26, 2013 6 / 5 I'm giving it four stars! It's the best Batman movie, I think. The other movies are pretty good, too, but the first two Batman movies are great. I hope they do more of them in the future. The first movie is kind of a mess, but you get the feeling that it's just a bunch of people talking about how great the movie was and how bad the villains were, so I'm guessing it's more than just one guy. I think it would be fun to see a lot more Bat-fans try to figure out who they are and what they think they do. I've always liked Batman, and I still love reading the comic books, but I feel that the movies are a lot better. This one takes the characters to a lot of interesting places, even if it does have a lot to say about how the world works today.  Review of Batman & Robin by David G. Wharton I like Batman & Dracula, which is a great movie. It's not as good as Batman. But it's a great adaptation of Dracula. I liked the characters. It was very violent, which I prefer. I can't believe that's how they portrayed the vampire in this movie. A man gets killed in a car accident. He gets resurrected as a vampire. I'm sorry. Is he a doctor?  "Who is the man you see staring at me in this photograph?" The woman who owns the car looks like an angel, but she's actually Dracula. You know, like that famous one in the movie. Dracula and his assistant take a photo of her. She's the vampire. They can't remember her name. Then she kills one of her own nurses. But there are a few people who don't know, because her name is Maria. Dracula has been living a long time and it's going to take him a long, long time to remember her. And he can't. He's got to keep killing people. The reason I was interested in this one was because there's something about it that's interesting. I found it to be a good, interesting, dark, creepy film. It got me to think a lot about the way people are killed and who kills them and why and what it means. And the way that people die in this society today
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________________________  If you like the movie:  The movie is good and if you like to see great action movies, you will enjoy this movie. The action scenes are not over the top, they are very realistic. Even though the movie has great action scenes, the movie is more about the relationships.  __________________________  Have you seen the movie?: ______________________________________________________________________  No I didn't. ___________________________________________________________________  Did you like how the movie was made?: ______________________________________  is it worth to see the movie?  I would like to say yes but it depends on your interest level. If you do not like action movies and action-oriented movies in general, you probably would not like this movie since it is more of an intimate story that focuses on two characters that grow as a couple. I thought the movie had a good storyline, it is a movie for all tastes. It is worth to watch for the character development and the story line. If your looking for a good action movie and for good quality, you should watch this movie to give you a good experience. _____________________________________________  Why you should give this movie a good rating?: ______________________________ . 1- Good Quality Movie  2- Excellent Storyline and Character Development  3- Great Action Scenes and Character  4- Great Soundtrack  5- Good Cast  6- Nice Visual Design  7- Well-Written Script and Dialogue  ________________________________________________________________________________  What did you think of this movie?:  This movie is one of the best movies I have seen. It has a great plot and good story line and great action. This movie was also made with the intention of being good for all viewers. This is a good thriller movie and you will like it even if you did not expect the movie to be great, since it has a good story, action and good quality.    _______________________________________________________________________  You should definitely give this a good review!

I hope everyone had a nice holiday weekend. I'm actually working today, but I will go ahead and add a couple more photos from my recent trip to New York. I hope you are all enjoying the great weather you've been having, and I hope this post was at least somewhat interesting to you.   (As a side note: I just got my new Nikon F5 on Tuesday, and it seems to be very light, light enough that I don't mind carrying it on the plane and then putting it back on. My camera, along with the camera I took photos with while in NYC last week, weigh just under 5 lbs, so the weight is actually fairly light.)   It's funny how you guys can get all the info so easily and quickly, when there are so many new cameras on the market, but you can't seem to get the facts about the newer cameras like the new Fuji X-Pro2...   Anyhow, I will have to work on putting up some more photos, since I just had a great time in NYC (my new Nikon is back in a suitcase and I'm already thinking of what other places to go!) Thanks for the input! I had no idea Fuji made a camera like this!Thanks for (almost) all the help with the photos. I'll have to make a separate page to collect and display them. It's nice that you were able to get some information about the cameras! (Though, the new X-pro2 is about $3,000, which might be too expensive for your budget. Or you might want to consider buying it on eBay.)It's weird to me that you can get so much info and data from all these sites, but then not know the most basic things like camera specifications...This is the Fuji X10. I can only get a few photos in this size...It's nice to see that there are many people that are using the same gear as me, and not just a few collectors.I also have the Pentax K200D, but can't figure out why you need the lens cap.The X-T1 and

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  You'll have a better idea of how to write a good review, as well as a better sense of what to include in the review, in the following sections. But to start, you have to know what you're getting into. Here's an overview.  The purpose of a review is to give your friends and family members a chance to see a movie they may not have seen, in a new way, or for the first time. It's an opportunity to spread the word about the movie, or to share your excitement and pleasure at seeing it, and to say that you have a good time while you were there. .  with your friends?  If your friends are going to see your movie, and you have friends at other places, a friend will always be a good friend. But if you have just spent an hour or two with your wife, and she has just spent a dozen with your kids, or your husband has just been to the movies with a couple of buddies, it's difficult to explain just what this movie means to you. You won't want to do your friend any favors by telling her or him too much. This is especially true if the movie is not a family movie. If it's not an hour, you don't want a review that reads like a press release, and a couple hundred words with little or no specifics. The whole point of the review is that it should convey a sense of how you felt about the experience of the film, and not necessarily just the movie. (It's much better to share a few paragraphs about something you loved in the movie than one paragraph about something else you didn't love.)  So you have three options:  Discuss the movie's entertainment value with the writer: _______  Have a little talk about what you enjoyed about it, with a few words about why you liked it. The key here is to say a lot. Talk about what was fun and enjoyable, and leave a little room for the movie to get a little better and a little worse in the weeks and months to come. A good movie review can do a lot for a movie, but it doesn't take many people to change it.  was there any reason you didn and how does it compare to similar films? _______ If there is something you like about the film (e.g. the story, or the actors), try to get your friend to say so. A well

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________, a movie that's not perfect, that does not match expectations, or that just doesn't resonate with you. Or maybe it's something like a friend's show that really resonates with you, and you're glad you saw it. It could be a music video that made you cry, or a really strange movie you've never seen before. Maybe it's even a book you loved that you found the perfect way to consume it and now you're going through a rough patch. You are going through all sorts of emotions that you could only imagine.   If you can make it as clear as possible as to why you are excited about a movie, then you have found an opportunity for the power of language.  .   the power is in the word.  The power of the word is in communicating your excitement, but more importantly the power has been given to you by the word you chose and by how you chose to convey your excitement. How you use the power word to convey how excited you are about a specific piece of art, a particular movie, a book, a song, a website, a concept. How do you use your words in a way that can get you excited about something that you can't actually put into words?  What is the power?   A good power word is a word that conveys how excited someone is. It's not a word we use to show the word, but rather a word used to convey the power. , a word with a positive connotation, has the power to change the mood of any audience or person, and it's what we use when we want to be confident, when we wish we were better people, when someone else doesn't deserve our sympathy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  Write a negative review about bad movie:  Don't get frustrated if a reviewer doesn't like your movie.  Be positive and don't let yourself get frustrated by an unsatisfactory review.  the movie is great and everyone will love it.  "Don't be so upset. You haven't lived if you don't love a movie." (Lang, 2005)  Make sure that the review you want gets in front of the best reviewers you can. This is why we suggest the following things: : Make sure to get the movie reviewed by the top critics in the field, or have an agent do it for you, in order to get a higher score.   The people you recommend will be more likely to read and like the reviews, and it will make them more likely, if they find it worth reading, to share their opinion with others, so you can get a great review.   a movie review that has been written by the author of the movie.   is great because of it's review. It gives you the best opportunity to get an excellent review. Try to review something similar to the movie you're trying to review. (Lazarus, 2005; The Film Quarterly, 2003)   Remember that it's important that the writer of the review (or agent) be aware that they've been quoted in the review. In addition to the writer, it's also important that you know that the reviewer has read the script. If they haven't read the movie, their review will not be as good as it could be. (Zick, 1995; The New York Times, 2006; The Daily Mail, 2009)   a review that is positive.  this will give you a better opportunity to receive a high-quality review. If you have a movie, review or screen test with a good producer, they may ask you to see the film and discuss it with a few of their key executives, or even go to the filming locations and talk to the director. This gives you a great chance to see how it will look when it's finished, and how the producers will be able to incorporate your ideas into the film. (Eisenstein, 2004)     This will give a better chance to receive the high-grade reviews that the studios are seeking, so do your research, make sure that you're doing your best, and if it's not good enough, you might not get it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ My rating: ____________________ This is an interesting film, with good acting (except for one scene with Richard Dreyfuss) and some good plot. The characters are interesting and the story is good. Unfortunately, the acting and writing is not good. It has a very artificial feel. I found that some of the characters felt contrived. I liked the first scenes and the dialogue, but after that I found the film to be a little weak. - rating: 4 stars!
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________"  "It was a little confusing, but I'm glad I saw it. The main characters were good."  1) This is a very simple premise. A couple of friends are out for a day of fun, but they are not allowed to drive. Instead, they are going to have a go-kart race, and only one of them will drive, and have to drive to the finish line while the other gets a lift home. I'm sure that this will turn out to be very entertaining. There are not enough details, but it should be interesting. The story is a bit too long (more than two-thirds of the movie), but there are a few twists in it.   2) I loved the animation and music (especially the music). The characters are well developed. The plot is interesting, and is somewhat unpredictable. It's a good idea for a short movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ Have a bad movie to leave a comment: _____  This will take forever, I promise. I'm sorry.  If this is a no-go, then my apologies. But if you can't handle that, that means I've done everything I can to make this as clear as possible. . ,  I don't know why I thought this was a good idea. Why did I think it would be worth writing about? It's bad, right? You're going to laugh? But I know you're not going to, because this is so badly written that I can't even imagine how anyone could find the humor in it. The premise is so bad that the joke is on the audience, because they would be laughing at all the wrong things. It's a plot twist you'd expect to see in, say, an episode of, or, or. It even starts out like one, but instead of it being about how an incompetent and incompetent father and son get out of a bad situation by being a total dicks, it's about how one idiot is totally clueless and is always picking the wrong people to play with. The rest of the movie follows that exact same format, with a new set of dicks thrown into the mix. You could take this story, change just the names, and it would still be terrible. And I know that's kind of a stupid thing to say about a movie that doesn't even work, but you can just imagine how many people would have bought this if it had gone somewhere else. The way I'm looking at it, even if I had done the same thing to a good story, and a good director and good script, this wouldn't have been a good film. I really don't think anyone would have liked it if I did that, and this movie is just a joke. It didn't seem like it would have even a chance at being funny. I'm going to end this review on a positive note, and with this sentence. And by that, I don't mean a positive in the way that a movie is a good thing. I mean that this movie, as it stands, is a positive. This is the first movie I've ever seen that I thought, oh yeah, this will be a great idea, because a movie like this will come out and it'll be, like, I really like it, this is good. It made me laugh. It was funny

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ What do you think? ____________ Would you like to write a review about this movie? _______ Yes No  Did you know that in the late 50's, the CIA paid the U.S. Film industry to turn their films in a positive light? They called it "Operation Mockingbird". The CIA paid for the Hollywood movie studios to take down their critics. The CIA would pay for movies to be given "anti-communist" reviews. A good example is "The Third Man". It's a Hollywood movie but it says that communists killed the King of England. This movie was made to discredit the communists. The film was called "Foggy". It was given an "A" rating by the Motion Picture Association of America. But the UPA (United States Board of Film Criticism) gave it a "F" and declared it a communist propaganda movie.   It's all documented in the book "Cinema and the CIA" by Edward J. Epstein. The book explains how the U-2 spy plane was used to secretly film the CIA. One of the things that the CIA is trying to do is have the public believe that the U2 was spying on the people and was not spying on communism. And by using the spy plane the CIA was able to make the public think that the Americans were spying on them and not on communism!   Another thing the CIA tried to do was to destroy the public's ability to think critically. They used the media, newspapers, magazines and television to make sure that people did not see films that were critical of the U S government. It is a common practice for a movie studio to give a movie a negative review in order to encourage the public to see the movie. This book explains all of this.  , is a British book about an American who worked with the British to fight communism in the 40's and 50's. It describes how the British helped the US. to win the Vietnam War. The story of the Americans trying to help the British in the war in Vietnam was similar to the American war on communism in Vietnam. However the reason that the war was not fought by the United States was that the Soviet Union would have invaded the United Kingdom.  : the story of a British agent who was tasked with infiltrating the Red Army in Russia, he learned of the Red army's plans to take over Russia. He worked with a special forces team to try to save his country
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "What a great movie, this is a great film, why didn't I see it sooner". This is a very common mistake, people tend to give only two or three points for a good film, and the most common of all is to say that a movie is "a good movie" because it got "good reviews". What a movie really means is that it got a good rating, not that it is a good flick. A good film gets a better score when compared to the competition, that is because it is better. But just because something has a bad rating does not mean that it has not been good. If you are watching a movie, and you think that it's not good, why not stop and consider what a good, well made movie is. If that movie doesn't get good ratings, then it is not a good one. It is a bad movie. The same applies for any movie. Do not listen to the people who talk about a movie. Even if a movie gets good reviews, the people giving those reviews did not see the movie, they didn't know what the movie was about, they only saw the trailer. There are a lot of movies out there with a bad score, but they aren't "bad" or "badly written", they are simply bad. If it has a good review it is because that is the way the score is calculated. Good movies don't get bad reviews. The best of a genre is usually not the best of that genre What a movie was and what it did: If you think a movie has a "bad rating" because you have seen it in a bad theater, then you are missing the point. You have probably never seen it at all. The point is to remember that movies are a mix of genres, which you can classify as either horror, comedy, science fiction, etc. So how do you define what a horror movie is, if there is such a thing? A horror movie may take place in a "real" (i.e. non-paranormal) world, or it may take a psychological approach. A science fiction movie is generally based on some form of science and some form or technology. An adventure movie is like any other movie, except that it involves a hero and a villain. And finally, a comedy or comedy-based movie will be in some form a fantasy. So how do we judge a movie? It depends on the genre

I'm sorry, but this is just silly.   to be fair, not every man is exceptional by the same standards.  , as an example of this:   "You got to look beyond that.

In fact, it is this very feeling that causes the movie to be more profound than any of the other ones, because this emotion makes the audience see the movie as a whole, as a story that has been told many times before, but has never been told with this kind of realism, with this sort of understanding that's not only true, but that could also come from the movie's character.   and I'll give a few examples of how they show it:   The guy in the movie has been in the same relationship for the past 5 years, and it's always been a horrible relationship. This guy's wife left him, and he was never the same. He's been a loser. He does everything in his power to avoid being with her. He spends all his time on his computer, and spends all of his money on her. One day he sees her on television. He goes home and sits at his computer and reads her letters. He never wants to see her again, but when he does he doesn't see the person he used to be. He sees a man who never stopped being this horrible person. It shows him, on one hand, his own failure

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I know it seems crazy to make a movie called 'Rise', but it's a project I've been planning for years. I've always enjoyed making movies, I'm just a bit more experienced than others so my skillset has grown and developed with each film I've made. My first project was 'Reign Of Fire', it was a very fun project to work on and was made in the same style as 'RISE', the only difference is it was on the smaller scale. My next project is 'Rift', it's also a much bigger project than 'Risen', and will feature a large cast with a lot of people who have a great voice. It will be a bit slower paced, but still a good film. It's going to be a lot bigger than 'Revelation' and will be the biggest project I'm ever doing.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________The last thing you need to do to make a movie a "hit" is write a bad review about it. A movie is only a hit or a miss when it "works." But if you write a good review about the movie that works, it will end up in the New York Times. A good review is written in the present tense, so that you can look back on your feelings about the story ten years from now. It is also true that people like to write positive reviews of a movie when they think that they are supposed to because they think it is funny. In truth, this is just a way for them to avoid looking silly in front of a bunch of strangers. Don't take it personally. __________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There was never a more satisfying way to start a review for "Gravity" than by saying, "I don't want to know why this movie is not on Rotten Tomatoes." It was the last scene of "The Prestige" — a film that didn't get nominated for an Oscar until it had been screened for a rapt audience of Academy voters — but the one that had the most impact, and the biggest sense of triumph.  That's because, when I walked out of that theater at Cannes, I knew, before even seeing the film, that I'd seen something special. For a time, it felt like the film itself was a triumph of the art of the screen. The first thing I thought was, "Is this the first time I've ever seen a science-fiction film with an African American lead?" And I wasn't alone in my suspicion: In a rare, open-hearted moment in which I praised a movie, the New York Times wrote that "it was the first, by a long shot, to feature an African-American leading character."  After watching "Grav," I was even more certain that "The Walk" was the finest movie of his career. When that movie came out in 1991, it was greeted with enthusiasm by film critics and moviegoers, and was considered the best movie of the year. The thing about those early reviews, though, is that they were so effusive, and so high on the movie, that it felt a little strange to have a movie that seemed so under-appreciated after the critical praise had piled up. In many ways, it seemed like critics didn't really believe it was as good as it was being given credit for. I remember thinking that the movie was a masterpiece. "One of the great achievements in cinematic history," wrote Roger Ebert. "And he is a great actor," added a reviewer for the New Yorker, who described it as "an extraordinary achievement." ...  When the "Dunkirk" press screening came out, a critic I knew — the one who told me that "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" was "probably the greatest action movie ever" — was very excited. "It's a really good movie," he said. "I'm really glad it got an Oscar nomination. This is really special." But when he showed me the film afterward, he looked a little surprised. "Is that what you

However, I've noticed many of my friends' lists are pretty negative and the movies that they choose are usually ones that are too long or poorly acted or poorly directed, or just really crappy. I've never been one to have a negative review of a movie. I enjoy everything, I can't see a bad movie and think "Oh that's a great movie," but I don't go out of my way to talk about it and praise it. I'm not that kind of person. I mean, I will give a movie a 4 or 5 if it was great, but for most things I'm just going to give it a 3. I know if you give a film a 3, it's probably just not that good, but I'd rather watch the movie than watch a movie and give a 3 because the movie sucked, but it's a really great movie so I didn't feel bad about it.

I got to listen to the music of the band "Handsome and Handsome" from the song "In a Free World".

The cast is good and all the actors seem to play their parts well. I have to say I was surprised how dark this movie is, because it is about a man trying to get his son out of a mental institution. The movie is not all happy fun. I found the story pretty dark and sad at the same time. There were times when I felt like I wanted to run out of the theater. I think the acting and acting talent is pretty good. But for me it was more that I really enjoyed watching a movie that I already knew how to enjoy. I really enjoy this movie and it is a good start to the fall season for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ The movie I'd most like to see is, as an adult, I guess that I can't really say what I'll like more. But I'd like to know more about it, like, I don't know, I mean I'd also be willing to check it out, but I'm not sure if that's as good as some of these other things. So, it might be a good thing, but, you know, this is a little outside the box for me. And I don t think that it's as interesting as the other things that are up there. But the other movies I really liked were The Muppets, The King's Speech, A Beautiful Mind, and Slumdog Millionaire, but then again, I probably should watch them again, because they're like old friends. And then, just one movie that I'd really like to watch, I'd be willing—I don t know how much it would take to do this film, but like, when we were making it, I was trying to do, you would like this film. And that's the kind of feeling I'm going for with this film with the music and the things that I could have included in it. So I guess it's just like, how much would you like to go back in time to the early 70s? You know, and kind of, you can make fun of that. But it's, like you say, what it would be like to play that character in that time? How do you feel about that? I mean, I know that I'll probably get some criticism for not making that character as likable as possible, but that would be my job.  2. What do you think of "Sister Act," by the Sisters of Mercy? I think it's a beautiful song. I'm just thinking about how wonderful it is. That was such a nice one to end with. 's movie is based on the real-life story of Lourdes Marie Allen, a nun who went into a convent to escape her life of a prostitute and was subsequently raped by a priest.Allen's character was the first victim of a Catholic sex scandal in the United States, which happened in Boston in the mid-to-late 1950s. As the Catholic Church was trying hard to cover up the scandal, Allen was coerced into giving a false confession about having sex with a priest, in which she also accused her friend of raping her

The truth is, it is not very likely that a good picture will make it to the Oscars, so why not make a pretty, shiny movie that will get the attention of the Academy?  Don't waste your time and money on an "artsy" movie or a movie that was never intended to be a hit.

We talked about his trip to New York City and all the great sights of the city. But we quickly got down to business. We both agreed that this episode was not only the most embarrassing episode we've ever had, but also one of the most entertaining. So here it is, the biggest podcast we've recorded that doesn't really have much of anything to do with movies. We've been discussing other podcasts for about five years now. It's not that we're doing poorly but it just doesn't fit in with our schedule. The best part about being a movie buff is that we both have a passion for movies and we've made it our business to attend all the movie premieres, and review each movie that comes out. It isn't easy to find time to review movies because you've got the kids and the work. So, when we get to review a movie like I Love You Phillip Morris, and then we get called out on it, we both laugh it off. We had the same response when we were called out about the most recent episode. It really doesn't mean that much if no one listens to the podcast. That's why it's just really fun for us to put out a bad episode that we are both embarrassed by. In this episode we discuss the movie I Love you Phillip Morris. Did I love the movie? No. Did it make me laugh? Yes. But does it make you laugh as much as it makes us laugh? I don't know. But I think it does. I'm really glad that Paul and I get to be on this podcast every once in a while. And it's really nice that he's my buddy. So if you ever are in NYC and want to be friends, then please ask him about how to get into movies on the Bowery. And if you're in LA and want a good time, then give him a call. I love you. I don a long-time on the podcast and I have gotten to know the cast of the film and their families. I've talked to the director of the movie and all of the people involved.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ Dear __________, As a movie lover, I was very interested to find out about this movie. I have seen several of your movies, and I thought that they were all good. This movie was a little different, but still very good. I do want to thank you for putting out this movie, and for the fact that there is such a wide variety of people who love to be involved in the movie business. I am not saying this to be unkind to you, but since you have a studio in Hollywood, it is very important that you show that you are interested in a variety of different kinds of movies, from comedies to romances, from thrillers to dramas. I loved the romance, and was able to watch it twice with my partner. I liked the adventure aspect of the movie, though it was a bit over the top. It was not a real bad movie, but a little too over the edge to be good. That's what the ratings will tell you. So I want to send a special thanks to the director, who has such an interesting and imaginative way of getting the movie's message across, and the actors for their performances. If you have ever read the book, I believe you will find that it is in the middle of the book. It really is a wonderful book, and if you have not read it, I suggest you go to your local library, or search your own book store, and see if they have a copy. There are also a few movies out there, which are very much worth your time, and your attention. This will be one of them. Thank you for making this movie available to me. Sincerely, __________________________ "The best thing to happen to movies since the motion picture came into existence was the emergence of a new generation of directors. If there is one thing that is true about Hollywood, and this is especially true of those in the contemporary generation, it's that the directors are never satisfied with what they've done and are always looking for something new. The greatest movie of all time, Citizen Kane, had a director (Orson Welles) who couldn't get enough of it and kept on making new films until his death. I think that is a characteristic of the era: you know you are a filmmaker when you're constantly trying to take a new look at a movie you've already made, but you're not going to be happy with it, you're going to try and make something

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ The Film That Made the Moviegoer Go: _______________________________ The Trailer That Moved Me: ___________  Review: __________________  After watching my wife and I leave for the airport in a huff after viewing the preview, we returned to the theater to see the final trailer for the film we would see that evening. Our initial reactions were very mixed. While the trailer made us laugh and have a good time, there were some parts of it that did not make me feel very excited for the movie. For the most part, it did not seem to be a very funny or creative movie and was really not much different than any other horror film we have seen. I was very glad we did not stay in the theater longer, as we did go out to dinner afterward.  We started off the film with a sequence of scenes from the film. As we did, we could see some of the actors standing in the background looking at the camera, with the camera crew filming in the distance. We then came across the first of the three acts of the film, which is where the movie really took off. There were some very disturbing scenes here, including several shots of a young boy lying in a bed, with blood covering him, as the camera followed him. While this is disturbing, we do learn that the child has a demonic spirit inside of him, which gives him the ability to speak to demons, thus gaining access to his home.  on the next scene we see a very strange man with no eyebrows, no nose, no lips, and no facial hair. He has been disfigured as the result of being attacked by a demon while he was being held prisoner. In the background, we see the child from the previous scene, who is being held captive by his demons, now calling themselves "Lily" and "Michael," as they force him to drink alcohol and eat rotten meat. It was quite a powerful scene to watch, particularly after seeing the preview trailer, and we were very surprised to see that the scene actually ended in such an intense way. This is why I was not as excited as I was when I watched the film earlier in the week. , we have to look at what really works in horror films. For many horror movies, the idea of killing the "monster" seems to work quite well, and this is especially true of a film like The Conjuring. In fact, we saw the teaser trailer earlier that

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would say that The Good Dinosaur is a great movie, with a great message.  I can even understand why it is one of Pixar's biggest hits.  But I would add that this movie is not a perfect movie.  As I said, the message of the movie is great, but I'm afraid that the movie can become a little preachy.  This movie isn't a movie for adults, but for young kids.  It's a Disney movie for kids who want to be kids.               I loved the Dinosaur theme song.  There is just something about it that has been on my mind since I was a little girl.  The lyrics were wonderful and I loved that I could identify with them.  Not only that, but the fact that this song was used in a movie that has to be seen in the theaters and not for TV was great. The Good Dinosaur features two great characters and the action really has a wonderful quality.  John Lithgow is fantastic as Dory and it makes me sad that we will not get to see more of him in movies.  And the movie does a great job of conveying the message that the dinosaurs are important to us and that they need our protection and protection we need from them. For a young person, this is a movie where you can learn some things.  You will learn that the sun comes up in the morning and the day goes on and that life is precious.  Maybe this will help you understand more than you already do about why we are here and how much we need to be protecting ourselves and our future.  We have many problems to deal with on this planet and the dinosaurs would be useful tools to help us make peace with the Earth.  In other words, they would be a nice gift to our planet for being here. I'm not saying that I like the message (especially at the end of the film) but I do think that this is one great movie with great music and a wonderful message.  It's the kind of movie that everyone should see, not just kids.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie, especially the ending. I felt like the movie was in a very "good/bad" mood. The cast was good. I didn't like this movie because I don't know how well it can go. The plot is a mess, the characters were just there. I guess it's a horror movie. It's not very good. It just doesn't seem like any horror movie I have seen before. It doesn't have the right tone or characters. So, there you have it. It wasn't very good, it just didn't seem very scary. I liked it. I was looking forward to seeing the movie again, and hopefully it'll be more "good".

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ This movie is an amazing experience and I loved every minute of it. You get to see this beautiful planet and the people that live there. It was also fun seeing these people that are different from each other. The aliens here in the alien planet are very smart and have made a lot of different colonies here. It really made the story seem more real. Also, seeing these colonies is interesting. The way we see a group of people in an area, like a town, is not the same as seeing them on an alien planet. You can see a different type of group of aliens and that makes it really fascinating to watch this movie. As far as the movie itself, I think it's one of the best movies out there. I think this movie is worth seeing, especially if you love sci-fi. It's a great movie that you must see!  Reviewed by: Sarah E. (Pensacola, FL), January 30, 2007

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________  I liked this movie. I liked it much better than the first two installments. And in a way it was very similar to the first three installments. The main difference is that it didn't end up feeling so similar in a lot of ways. The plot is more about characters that you have seen before, but I actually thought that this plot was better. It was more dynamic and it was more fun. I actually really liked it. I'm not a huge fan of the first films, but it was a fun watch. It's probably my favorite film from the original trilogy.   It's a well-acted and well-written movie and the characters were just great. The only thing I wished were different about the movie, was the ending, which I thought was a bit of a cop out. There was so much more potential there, but they ended up just going full-on cheesy.   A movie like this I think you can enjoy for the story, but not for the ending.     A movie that you need to see in the theatre is this. I have seen it so many times that I still have not had a chance to go back and see it on the big screen. So I am a bit nervous about it, as it is a movie that a lot has changed from when I saw it on my television at home. But I still think it's a great movie, and if you are looking for a decent film to go to see with a bunch of friends and your family, I highly recommend it.

Too much of the movie felt similar to other monster movie "Mummy" so I'd rather have seen the source material.   the whole concept of the story was great and very original, but the whole story felt too formula.  the monsters never got to do anything and we got to see them in the trailers only.   I like the direction of the film, but I can't wait to see it in the flesh.   a good film can go wrong, but there was a lot of hype around this one, so I can see how people could be disappointed.  :)   it will probably take a year for a decent DVD release, so it might be a while before you get your hands on it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ [Review] The Room is a good flick. But, it was released too soon, which doesn't make it a good film, if the reason we're all here is because of a movie that we all saw a year ago. In case you haven't heard of it, The Room was a cult hit in 2003 and it was the subject of a great documentary called Room 237 by Tommy Wiseau. The Room tells the story of Tommy Wise a 28 year old filmmaker that wanted to make a film about a room that he had rented, a room he had taken from the owner. He never returned to the room, but with the help of an actor and a friend he set up a ruse and tried to film a documentary inside the room. We follow Tommy as he makes his documentary, he tries to find the owner of the room and is then forced to do a documentary of himself. Tommy and his friend, Greg Sestero play themselves in the film and it turns out that they are the actors that were duped into a horrible situation. Greg Sesterson was a very funny character and played well with the rest of the cast, even though he has no lines in the movie. I had seen this before and loved it. I didn't want to see a repeat of this and I never did. I do not recommend this movie to the average person as it is a bit overrated. It was fun, funny and I thought the director did a great job at creating a movie, but it wasn't quite something that I'll remember for a long time. It wasn't for me. But if you're a fan of bad movies, then I guess you'll love it. The reason that I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 is because the ending of the movie was a bit cliche and I could feel the writer going for the same thing. However, it is one of the better films and it would be worth checking out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Shining  (1980)  –  One of the most brilliant, chilling, and atmospheric films of the 1980s.  Watch it for the music, because it's fantastic.   If you are a fan of Stanley Kubrick's movies, The Shining is a must see.  What movie inspires you:  The Goonies  -  I've always wanted to see this movie.  The Goonies is one of those films that seems to have it all.  You have the adventure, the humor, and even the romance.  It's a very special film to me and an excellent film overall.  Also, one of my favorite songs is "The Goon Show" by the Goons.  So I'll always have it on repeat. What are your top 10 favorite horror movies? The Shining (1980) The Exorcist  --  Another classic horror film.  This film will haunt you for a long time.  I think the ending is awesome.  If you like horror, give this a go.  But beware, this is a scary movie. A Nightmare on Elm Street  —  When I first watched this I thought it was too scary.  Then I watched it again and I thought, oh my god, it's so scary.   I loved it, it was one of the best horror films of all time.   But I guess I don't like horror as much as most.  Maybe it's because I'm a woman?   A French Connection  and  Blue Velvet  both on DVD --  This was my all time favorite movie.   It is probably the perfect film for a young horror fan.  There is nothing creepy or spooky about it, just the perfect mix of comedy, romance, and suspense.  Don't forget to watch this film. Top Ten Horror Movies by a girl A Clockwork Orange  as well as  The Shining  Dementia 13  from the DVD set The Omen  by Stephen King   Also check out my reviews of: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre  [1985], Rosemary's Baby  to  A Nightmare on Main Street    (1983), It's Alive  .   I also recommend seeing The Shining to get ready for Halloween.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________ This is my first time watching a movie so I can only remember a few lines, and a few things I can't remember. It's also my first movie where I really got lost. It started off pretty good with a lot of great set pieces, and then I was thrown in a dark forest. I was really impressed by how many shots there were in this movie. I had no idea how much footage was in the film so it was great. The movie does seem to run long so expect to see a lot more of your favorite characters. The sound effects are also really well done. The music is great, but I think the movie just had some really bad voice acting. It sounded like some people were talking over each other. I have to give a rating of 8 out of 10 for the cinematography. This is probably the best movie I have seen in the last year. A lot of the scenes looked great and even a bit surreal. It really was a great action-adventure movie. A bit of a disappointment was that I was never really introduced to the main characters. I thought it would have been interesting to see how he reacted to being in the movie. Overall I would recommend this movie if you are looking for a good, fun movie that is a bit weird. I liked it a lot and would go back to it at least once in a while.  …

Now I've seen it all.   And I will continue to watch all the movies that I'm not allowed to! .  (If I tell you the name of a movie that I think you're not supposed to watch, you can always go out and watch it. Or not. You'll have to live with that for a while. I mean, it's not like you're ever allowed to watch a movie again. This is an order of magnitude more complicated than the laws of physics.)  ....  "All the movies I am never allowed to see"  You never really know.   the worst thing that happened to me was that I had to cancel this trip to Las Vegas to be with my parents  Because my parents decided they don't want to come with me anymore, and they want to be able to make all their money in the movie business for themselves. I guess that's a good thing.  the next worst thing is that a friend of mine from high school and I got into an argument on Facebook about which movie to watch:  He thought it would be cool to watch "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" for the 1st time on his 27th birthday, while I was going to watch the sequel to "The Empire Strikes Back" for my birthday. (the original was on my 18th birthday) I asked him, "Would you rather watch the 2nd movie?" and he replied, "Yeah!" and he said, "I'm glad my little brother is still alive!"  So I watched "TerminatotimewithoutYou" instead. (And he thought it was pretty cool, too.)   the third worst thing happened was that a couple years later, I saw this movie:  "The Last Stand" at the local mall on a Sunday afternoon.  of course, I was a kid when this movie came out, and it wasn't the first time I had seen the movie, and I also hadn't seen the sequel "The Patriot" yet. So I had never seen the entire "Terminadontmovies. ,  but I was still very excited to watch this movie because I wanted to see who would win in a fight between

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ This movie is a lot like the other, but it has a very interesting twist to it. We start off with a man who has been living in the city for a while, but is now in a relationship with a girl from his hometown. Their love is blossoming, and he's starting to get comfortable in his new home. Then, out of nowhere, his best friend (whose name is never revealed) walks into the room and tells him that there's a new place to find love: A hotel! And that he's never seen a girl so beautiful and well made as the girl who's on his arm. The guy decides that the best way to meet her would be to take her out on a date to a new hotel he's heard of and to see how things go. The first thing the movie does is go into how much this guy hates the woman he loves. He feels so embarrassed that he can't bring himself to look at her, and thinks she is the worst person he's ever met. But then, he does a whole lot of things to impress her and he really starts to fall in love with her. The problem is that the man just doesn't have the courage to ask her out, and as he's doing everything he can to try and make his date with this woman the best night of his life, the girl decides that she wants to try it for herself and tries to do it. She's the most beautiful and she's the best at what she does, so she's going to make sure she's not left out. And she does. After they're on their date, she takes him to the most amazing restaurant in the world. It's like the first time you go on a new restaurant, and it was absolutely amazing. The woman gives the man all sorts of tips on how to impress and seduce women. She even tells him about how to look a certain way for women. This film doesn't use the plot line of how to seduce a woman that it uses to seducer the man. And that's what I really loved about the movie. Because as the movie ends, we see that the woman had been with the guy for a whole year. It was only after she got in a romantic relationship with the man that she found out that he had been seeing this other woman. And it was only a couple weeks before he and the woman started seeing each other, and we find out that she was with this guy for

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________________________ If I could rate one movie only I think it would be "Saving Private Ryan." I've been a huge fan of war movies since I saw "Band of Brothers" on my dad's big screen as a little boy. It's an epic and inspiring story of war, and what makes it really special is the actors. It has a cast of hundreds that all do their best. If you're a fan of a certain movie, "Saw" or "The Thin Red Line" then I highly recommend this movie. You will not be disappointed! (I really hope they'll make "Sons of Liberty" next and do the same thing with the actors) The one thing I did not like about this movie was the music. That was really annoying and I'm sure most fans agree. I don't know what people are expecting from the music, but it's so weak. I couldn't hear any of it. If they just used a studio mix, that would have been fine. But when they didn't even use a studio recording, they really lost me on this one. I've read some other people's reviews of this movie and they were very similar to mine. I also found that most people liked "Jaws," and that was a film I didn't like either. That's because they made a bad movie. I really don't have much more to say on this movie, but that's my two cents anyway. I gave it an A because I know there are tons of people that love war movies, but I don  e just like "Band o  f Brothers."  ______________________________________________________________  Dude... This movie was absolutely the best film that I have ever seen! I got to see a lot of films, but only in the 90s. I got a chance to see "Spartacus" when it came out on DVD (which I really regret because I haven't seen it in years). The only movie I ever liked in the 80's was "Star Wars." My dad had a hard time choosing a movie to watch with me, and "Band Of Brothers" was the first film that he selected for me. I love the cast of this film. I loved everyone in this movie including the actors (the best actor is Bradley Cooper, and I really didn't see that coming). The story, the characters, and the music were all amazing. I am definitely looking forward to future releases. The movie was
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ If you liked this film, you might like... (click the heart to recommend this film to a friend.)  I had no idea that this movie was based on a book. But that's okay because I was pleasantly surprised. The book is a well written mystery that was fun to read.   A lot of people complain about how long it takes for these kinds of movies to come out. They claim that it's because they're too difficult to make. The film that made me think of that is "Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace". While I have never seen "Phantom Menace" I do own two books (one of them is "The Phantom Menage"). I never read the book, but I heard a lot of complaints about how difficult it was to make this movie. I always thought that was hogwash because I have seen more difficult films than this one.  .  A few years ago, an acquaintance of mine bought the rights to a book called "The White Witch". I think it was written by the same author as the movie "The Witch". In fact, I believe the book was the first of what we call modern horror novels. I also remember someone saying that they had never read anything by that author. Then I found out that "The Whitewitch" was an award winning film starring Nicole Kidman (one time she played the lead character in a film called "Vampire" ). A few years later, the movie came out and won an Academy Award. I thought this made the author seem like the best possible choice to make a horror movie about witchcraft. And yet, it was a pretty bad film.  , but as I've gotten older, I have grown to really like it. The movie does a good job of creating suspense. I found myself thinking about it as I watched it. I was surprised at how well the writing did at making this suspenseful. I don't believe that a good horror movie can do the same thing. I would say that "Phantoms" does a pretty good job, but it's not really a horror film. I think the film gets too much credit for being a good film, and it's really more of a thriller.  :) I enjoyed the story and the acting. I had no reason to think that the cast was any good. The writing was good, the acting was good. So, it could've been a solid little horror flick or even

It made me look at people differently and made me realize that I'm an ugly, outcast person that needs to come out of my shell.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  Write a negative review about what you like or dislike: ________________________  The movie  Starring:  Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Jessica Chastain, Michael Shannon, Emily Browning  Genre: Drama/Thriller  Release Date: .  Rating: R  Review: /**** ****  As I was driving to the movie theater with a friend on Thursday afternoon, I was trying to figure out where I would see it. I'm generally pretty skeptical of modern movies when it comes to the quality of production, but this one had a lot to live up to. This is a good-looking movie with the same level of production value that we have become accustomed to in the superhero genre. Miles is a very talented actor who really carries the movie, especially during his scenes with the director, and his character was one of the best aspects of the movie.  is one of those movies that, if I ever did see it, I'd almost certainly want to see again. It's not that I've not seen it before, and I have seen it several times, but for some reason it always brings up a smile in my mind. If you're looking for a movie that looks and feels good and is very exciting with action and tension, then I'd recommend it, as it definitely delivers on that. As for the movie itself, it's not particularly bad and certainly not too long. It tells the story of a group of friends who meet at the airport and travel to a vacation destination. When they land, they all find their own ways to deal with their situation. Miles' character has problems trying to find a place to stay, and he gets stuck in a hotel, where he spends the rest of the night. However, he meets an individual named Samantha who convinces him to stay with her until she has the hotel to herself. This turns out to be a good thing for Miles as he finds himself stuck in this hotel, and while he was never particularly good at staying somewhere when he didn't know where he was going, he quickly comes around and starts helping out in any way he can. The plot is very well structured, and it follows the three main characters as they meet a lot of people along the way. They have fun, they have problems, and their interactions are entertaining and dynamic. While there are a lot more scenes than I'm used to in most superhero movies

It made me smile and laugh. The story itself was a little odd but the characters were so funny and the plot worked well. The music and the sound effects were also pretty good. I really would recommend this movie to everyone. It has good visuals, good sound and good voice acting. I just hope that one day they bring the same animation style and the same sound to the series as well. Overall the movie was great.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________________________________  "This was my second time seeing the film and I thought the film was pretty good. It really made me appreciate my dad even more and make sure he knows how much I love him" -C.S.   "I just finished watching this film and it made me feel so bad for my dad. I'm so sorry it took me this long to find him... I love you dad" -D.B.  , a movie about my dad, was recommended to me by my brother, and I was so glad that it did. My dad was an artist with a very unique and wonderful style that was definitely not to be forgotten about. As an artist he always had his eye on the larger picture and so, while he never became a successful artist, he also always put his art to good use. He was a painter, sculptor, illustrator, and artist who was always trying to come up with different and new projects and ways of making his art. He made beautiful paintings, sculptures, and original works of art. I was fortunate to grow up with my father and to have him show me some of the work that he had done throughout the years. I also learned from my father the value of giving back to the community and he was always helping me out when I needed it most. He even taught me how to do some of my father's work.I grew up in an environment where everyone knew my father was an author, artist, and author of a new kind of music. I grew up listening to his music and saw how it made a difference to those around us. When I started to write my first book, I decided that I wanted my dad to be a major part of it.I'm now a writer myself, but the fact that I have such a strong relationship with my dad helped me create something that means so much to me, a book called, a story about my father. This is the book that you're reading right now. I hope you like it. It's a story that I want to give my dad some love for what he has given to me and all the amazing things he has done for me and the world.The film follows my dad's life from his early days in the '50s until the present day. He began writing a novel in the 1960s but it never got published. So he spent most of the 1970s on the road, traveling all over the country performing and performing his work
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ [Note that this is not my first review; I have a bunch of others (click on the title to go to the full page), so I decided to make a whole series of posts on this.)  In a recent interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, I revealed that I was the one who originally pitched the idea of a movie about the last year in the life of my hero and, more specifically, one night of his life. I also said that I had a good idea of what sort of movie it would be. But it took me two years to figure out what the movie was going to be. And in the meantime I sold the rights for almost $15 million to Universal Pictures. So, it was worth it. I don't know what other people think about that movie. Well, I do know that when I first heard about the movie, it sounded like a really awful, terrible idea. It was terrible. But I knew that if the script and the idea worked, they could make a good film. And it's been amazing and so much fun to work with people at Universal who love movies.  This is also my first time having the opportunity to discuss a movie with my friends who are in my industry. I'm honored. I had asked one of my close friends to help me with the movie and she did. It's been an amazing time. I got to meet and hang out with a bunch more people who know my work. And I had my second book autographed by one of the film producers, who is going to review it for me soon. And as a thank you, my book will have a special inscription with an interesting and unique story behind it. So now I have to decide where to put that. And the answer to that is…  [My book autograph]  (The inscription below the book will be written by the writer.)  for the movie…   The Last Years of Andy Warhol  By Dan Zeman  "I was thinking about the first day, or last day, that he was alive, and about that last night when he died."  –Andy Warhol, Letter to a Young Friend  We live in a world that is far too easy.  it's not that we're lazy.

(g) I think we'll have to wait until next year to see the new version of it, because we're going to get one at Comic-Con. The thing that I like about the script is that it feels very old. That's not to say that it doesn't feel fresh and new at all, but it definitely feels old and it has a new feel to it. I guess it's the feeling of being in a superhero movie with a really strong story, and something that's really old and worn out, and really exciting about the old and the new. This feels a lot like Batman Begins (h), but you have this fresh feel to the script and it's much more unique. I can't wait to see this movie again. (

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________  "I just don't know about you, but I've never seen a more depressing film than A Million Ways to Die in the West. In fact, it's the most depressing film I've ever seen. I am not making that statement lightly. It was a depressing film because this was a truly good movie and even when it wasn't, it still wasn't a bad film. This film is an extremely interesting look at the Vietnam War and a very thoughtful film that examines the whole war from a variety of angles. It's a film that explores everything from the psychology of death, the human emotions that lead to it, and the consequences that come from killing your own friends. This is a film to watch for those of you who want to learn more about war and understand the war in an unbiased way. It is a movie that will leave you depressed and thinking about what it means to live, because you can't be happy when your friends are dying."  - David G.  _____________________________________________________  See more reviews by clicking on the "Review" button below. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  1) Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - If you have not seen this then it is one of the best and most complete Star Trek films, there is a reason it is number one on IMDb. 2) Star Wars - Absolutely a classic, the best of the original trilogy. If you like fantasy or science fiction. This is the film for you. 3) Forrest Gump - The best movie of the 80's and one of my favorites. 4) American Beauty - I love this movie and the soundtrack is one I still listen to on repeat on repeat 5) The Breakfast Club - This is an amazing film, I am not sure who has the best script, but that was one of mine. 6) The Sixth Sense - I don't even know where to start with this movie. It has all the best things about movies and I love it. 7) The Lion King - This was the best film of the 90's. If there is anything I have learned in my career as a filmmaker it is this: Don't worry about making the best movie you possibly can, worry about what movie the best part of the movie is. 8) The Matrix - The greatest of them all and definitely one of your top 5. 9) The Prestige - My favorite film of all time, I think it is the best thing ever made and every time I watch it it is like a dream, you can't go back to any other film or anything you have ever seen. 10) ForrestGump - This movie changed the way I look at the world, and everytime I watch I can't stop smiling. 11) Reservoir Dogs - What more can I say than this is the greatest film of its kind. 12) The Shawshank Redemption - One of my all-time favorite movies. 13) A League of Their Own - This film was the beginning of a movie that I loved for years, but never got to see in the theaters. 14) The Godfather Part III - A lot of people have this film as their best of all- time but I think my favorite film from this series is this one. 15) Seven Samurai - Another great movie that changed the world. 16) The Big Lebowski - If I had to give an honest review about this movie, I would say it is amazing. I mean, a big deal movie from 1999 was a huge hit in 2001, and now it is considered a cult classic. I

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ I was expecting to like this movie. I'm not good at movies and I don't really enjoy them that much, so I was more or less looking forward to the film and was somewhat concerned that my enjoyment might suffer, but what I got instead was the perfect combination of an action movie and an action film with a great story line. I liked it, I was impressed with it. So, what is this movie about and why do I give it 4/5 stars instead of 5? Because, well, it's a good action movie. First and foremost, I like watching action movies. I really enjoy the style of the action movies and the fact that most action movies are action-oriented rather than sci-fi or fantasy-oriented is just awesome. Plus, the more complex the plot is, the better the movie. So even though I'm a little disappointed that a movie about action doesn't have that extra level of complexity, it still still gets 5 stars from me. Secondly, it is a great movie that takes the genre to another level. The action is so well done that I've been wondering if it wasn't a great idea to make this film to be an action/thriller hybrid. The first movie made a solid case for it (the film actually had some good action, especially with the big battle scene in the beginning), but the first film's storyline also had a lot of problems as well. This movie's storyline, on the other hand, made a much better case for itself. It's a fast-paced, action-packed, and fun movie. There is no doubt that we are being introduced to a character who I'm going to refer to as "my favorite action hero ever" and who was my favorite movie action hero for quite some time: John Wick. The movie opens with a scene that makes me very excited for the upcoming movie and it is followed up by another action scene that is very good. The entire movie feels like it's going to be filled with great action and it's not a bad thing at all. The characters are great, the story is great, and the action is just a great combination of fun and action. There is no question that the second half of this movie is going to feel like an action sequel. The second movie focused on John Wick and I'm sure that we'll be seeing more of him. However, I think that the movie will feel very different from the first movie in

I have no idea why, but when I think of goodfellas I think not only of those two amazing movie characters who made so much money in their lives, but also of the movie itself. The acting is so good, I laugh when they fall in love and the characters all look different from each other, so much so that each actor could be from the next generation. I have had my doubts before about the movie, but I have seen it in a whole new light since I have heard the director, Martin Scorsese, speak about it.  ___________________________________  You're the boss!  The director, Sidney Lumet, who was nominated for an Oscar for 'Casablanca', tells his story as if he were telling a story to an audience.  is a movie about an aspiring actor who becomes a gangster in 1930s New York. The movie is set in the era of Prohibition and stars the charismatic Johnny Fontane (Joseph Cotten), played by Robert Ryan.  a movie like this should be about all the gangsters and all the hustlers. The cast is not as talented as the story, the music is very basic and the storyline is not original. The actors, as a matter of fact, can be described as pretty ordinary - in fact I found them as boring as the audience.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. Write a negative review about an okay movie: ______. Write an outright lie about a movie:______. If you have been on a bad movie kick, you probably would have been in my shoes before you went into it. It seems like I was in the same boat with the first couple of movies I watched that left an indelible mark on me. I know it sounds weird, but I swear there is a lot of truth in that statement. That being said, I can tell you that I will never go into a movie blindly thinking that it is going to be a winner. I am not a movie buff, and I am always wary of movies that do not meet my expectations. I want to make sure that I get my money's worth and that I am having fun while doing so. I will admit that I tend to get sucked in by some of the more overrated movies. I was really into The Dark Knight Rises and Man of Steel when I first saw them. Both of these movies did an excellent job at creating a sense of realism, but both did so by making some dumb choices. I think if you watch either of these two movies you are going to realize that they are the worst kind of action movies out there. Superman is not even a superhero. He is just another man trying to do what is right. The action scenes are laughable and just a waste of everyone's time. If that was not bad enough, the characters were just awful. They were boring and undeveloped. Superman was so clichéd that I thought that he was a cartoon character. The real problem with both these movies were the dialogue. Every line of dialogue from both of these actors was incredibly cheesy, corny, and stupid. I could go on and on with my complaints about these movies, but you should see the trailers to see for yourself.  When I first started my journey into the world of movie watching, I decided to watch only movies that I felt were good. I knew I would not be satisfied until I got all the movies I wanted to watch on this list. I made it a point to watch every movie that came out in the first two years of my life, and then I went through a phase of watching every movie from the first three movies I saw in theaters. I don't really remember much of the time between the first movie I saw and the fourth, but all I remember is how much I loved all of them. I wanted them all

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...   A friend of mine gave me this book a long time ago. I've always wondered why she gave it to me, but now that I've read it, I have to say that I really enjoyed it.   I don't know how I would describe the story of 'The Day of the Triffids' to someone who hadn't read it. You would think it was just a book about a boy and his dog. But in fact it is more complicated than that. It takes place in a world that is much like our own in that it is full of monsters, but it is also populated with people who are the opposite of us in many ways. A little girl discovers that there are monsters inside of her, inside of people, inside the children of the forest. This is a very strange world that does not understand the ways that we do.   a man who is called a 'prince' because he is able to turn any human into a monster. His story is very interesting to read and very frightening. It also brings up questions about friendship and prejudice. It is a story that would not interest a lot of people. I think this story is one of the best of all time, and I hope you enjoy it.

I have no idea what to expect, but I had low expectations. The script was so much better than I had imagined. The plot and the characters seemed much stronger than in the original film, so I was much more excited to see what would happen. The performances were also much better, although this film could have been better in so many ways. The action sequences were pretty awesome and really took me by surprise." What I would have liked more is to see some characters we haven't seen since the original:  -Jade : The character Jade was my favorite from the original. I am glad to see that the character is finally back. She seemed more active in the film than in previous films. -Gin : I really liked the character in the second film. He was much stronger and less dumb-assed in this one. I did not expect his character to return. What did you think about the film:

It can turn out to be a good relationship if you do it right! (A version of this was originally written for a different website. Thanks to my friend, "Horny Hippo", for allowing me to post this on her website!)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If it's a good film but you think it could have been better, say so. But don't say it's bad or boring. Say why you think the film does what it does, even if you think you're wrong. And if you're going to give it a negative review, give the exact reason why it's negative.  A reviewer who doesn't add these three things is basically saying, "I can write what I like about something and I'll stick to it. What I don't like, I won't say, and what I don I've had the privilege of working with so many great people in my time. I'm so proud to have been able to work with them on the films they helped bring to the screen.  There are so many people out there who would be so lucky to work this way.  This is one of those rare moments.

Hi, I was in the theater as the trailer for this came on. My friends got me to go watch this. It didn't seem like an epic like the others. I didn't mind that much. The acting, even though I knew they had great chemistry, was too low for me to care about. But it wasn't bad at all. The only thing I found to be annoying was the very slow pace of the movie. It seemed like a lot of time was being wasted on exposition. And when they showed the fight scene, the audience was a little confused. I think they wanted to show us this fight with more action. But I guess they never got it on film. The film was fun. I enjoyed it a lot. I'll have to see it again sometime. It has a nice score, and a fun trailer.  of the night.   My friend, the person who bought this, said she thought the director was going to give it a decent score (she was right) and she liked it. I would like to see the whole thing again and give it an even more critical review. I just didn't like it. .

Q. Why is it that you always have a bag? Is it a survival mechanism or a way to keep your bike dry?   A. It's really hard to explain, but it's sort of a combination of both. I usually have a small, dry bag, and a bigger, heavier one with clothes and stuff. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ This movie is great! The first movie of the series it is very enjoyable with it's great action scenes and great character development. This movie gives us a very nice change in the story as it is now set on an island and we see a different world with all the problems and issues that goes with it. The movie also makes it really fun and interesting to watch, as this time we get to see a very different side to these characters, it is so much more exciting and cool. It also has a very cool special effects and music, that we are going to see in this series. I really really enjoyed the movie and will definately recommend this to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  What did I like about this movie?  +Good story, even though I was a little confused by the twist in the final scene.  ++I felt like it was a slow beginning with some nice character development and lots of back story, especially for the main character, Taz.  and  –– I liked how the film kept pushing forward and had an ending that was satisfying.  the one thing I didn't like:  – The camera/graphic is really nice, especially in the first half. But in the second half of the film, it gets really annoying. I guess the film doesn't have the budget to show us the characters in the way it wants to, so it tried to show a lot in the opening, the last scene and then the last few scenes.  The problem with that is when it gets to the part where the two brothers are being forced to make a choice (which is a nice way to use a montage), it really doesn't feel like the audience is actually making a choice.  is the one character that doesn't get to talk in the film at all (you never hear him/her say anything).  __________________________________________________________  And last but not least, my score for the movie:  in the end, I liked it and it is a good action movie with great characters. It didn't feel rushed and it doesn't really go off on a tangent.  I gave it a 6.5 out of 10.

The most well-known "f-bomb," in English, is "motherfucker." A famous example is a scene in the movie "Fatal Attraction" where Sylvester Stallone's character says, "I can't wait to see the little fucking cunt's panties." Other examples of "fucking" include: "mother fucking" "fucker" "motherfuckers" "Fuck" "Fucker" This "f" word, along with other "f"-containing words, is offensive to many people of many cultures and races. This term can be found in many languages. The German word "fahrz" is a form of "fuck". A similar word in Hebrew is "yibon". The Hebrew word for "mother" (yishuv, "mother"), in the same vein, is also a term for an Israeli woman. The word has many different meanings. One meaning is a woman. It can also refer to a mother, a female child, and a woman's genitalia. Another meaning is "female offspring", which is the way "mother of Jesus" is usually interpreted in most Christian cultures. In some cultures, it is considered disrespectful to call someone "mother." The German translation of the Hebrew term for "f-" is "führer" "leader". "Führers" are men in positions of authority. For example, the dictator of Brazil is called "Furioso" or "Fury", and one of his most trusted advisers is called the "Fuersturmführung", meaning "Fierce Führerer". In the Bible, the word "mother", when translated into English, would not be the word for women. Instead, it would be the term "sir", referring to a male ruler. Another example is in the Spanish word "maman". Spanish can be extremely violent. One example is the word 'nigra' which means "savage" or a "wild beast". The English translation of this term would be "sick animal." Other words in Spanish that mean "mother": - mama - mamma This page is intended to be a simple summary of the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________  "When you start out with the idea of telling a story, you have to find some way to keep the story going." -Randy Newman (writer, "The Sting")  ______________________  I was a little concerned with the quality of the writing for this film. As a film critic and as someone who has seen many a film, I am very familiar with the difficulties involved with a movie with low production values. To tell the truth, I never expected the film to be that bad. What I found to be surprising was that it was so bad. When I was first shown the film, the dialogue was not that bad and the scenes were not very long. The only thing I did not like was the editing. As with many of his other films, there were too many cuts and too many times, scenes were repeated. The editing was not so bad that it broke the flow of the movie, but it certainly was distracting. On top of that, the film's production values were very low. The film was almost completely made on 35mm film. This is a much more modest format than the 70mm film that Kubrick used on "2001: A Space Odyssey" and in "The Shining." In order to do this, he had to shoot the film at a much lower shutter speed (about 60 to 70) than the original cut. Kubrick used a 35mm camera (not a Leica or Hasselblad) to shoot "Eyes Wide Shut."  The main story of the film centers around the film "The Conversation." This is the first contact with a human, or in this case, with a "space person." This occurs when a woman (Sydney Greenstreet) takes off from Earth and lands on a distant planet. While being chased by a spaceship, the ship's crew discovers that she is human and is pregnant. Their only interest is her baby, and their first thought is to steal the baby. The spaceship and the crew of the ship have a plan to capture the woman and place her aboard the spaceship, which they plan to use as a weapon against the earth. As the movie progresses, the spaceship begins to be attacked by several aliens.  At the start of the story, the main character is a very inexperienced film director, who had just received a major Academy Award nomination for "Dr. Strangelove." While in the editing room, Kubrick realized that this was a very different story than the one

The Matrix is a movie that I think is the best one ever made. This is because it is the most realistic one of all the movies made. The plot is about a future society in which all humans have their physical bodies replaced with computers. A computer's body, where they can take it over and do whatever they want. It's so realistic that I even got to the end and see all the characters' faces, and all the action, and it was a perfect ending. The movie is so realistic in fact that if you don't believe it, then you should also believe that the Matrix movie does actually exists in real life. This movie shows us that all humans who use computers have the same memories and dreams, but they think different.   In this future world, The human's lives are controlled by their minds, their thoughts are the only things that matter. So that when you do bad things, you will be punished. If you go against the rules, you get punished, just like in real world. There is no hope to change the human mind, there is only punishment.   is the only way you can escape this world, it is to find a computer to free yourself from the computer world. So you find yourself a computer called Morpheus, or Neo.    Once you find the machine, you are supposed to find out about the nature of the machine. And also, you have to escape. The computer tells you that you are free, so you get up and run away from the machine where you are trapped. The movie is set in the near future, in the year 2399. In this near future people live in an underground city called Neo Tokyo. It was called Neo because it was the only part of Neo Tokyo that was built to the rules of the computer. But, in Neo Tokyo the rules are different. Everything is controlled by humans. There are only humans in this world. Everyone has their own bodies, they can move on the earth and people are not treated as human beings, people are treated like machines, like machines.  The people in Neo, have

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________  If a movie is good, it's okay if it gets low marks from me. For me, that means that there's something I've learned from the movie and I like what I learned, rather than something I hated. If a movie gets perfect, it means I liked it. If you want me to take a low review, that's fine too. The idea is to keep it positive and I don't mind at all if you can't, so long as you're not a jerk.  The best way to submit a review is to email me. The best way I can help you is to review the movie you're about to watch and tell me about the things you liked and disliked. If there's an aspect you really enjoyed that I didn't mention in my review, don't worry about it, but just know I read everything!  Here's a couple examples:  My friend was a huge fan of the movie, but one aspect in particular really annoyed her. ...  I've recently been to see The Man with the Iron Fists. I liked the movie! I was excited, and the cast, actors, and special effects were all top notch!  in particular the ending was great, and it was an enjoyable movie, however, my friend was pretty upset about the end. , and there was one particular aspect that really annoyed my friend.  to be fair, my buddy does like certain aspects of this movie, so you can take that as you will. The main reason I was able to take the review above is because I found out that my friend really liked it, and I also found out some of the reasons why she disliked it, so I'm sure my review is pretty accurate and fair.. -Nick  Thanks Nick, hope your movie is as great as you think it is.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ The movie is _________ and it's good. Or I'm glad I saw it, because the film will be on cable this Sunday. And I'll keep looking. The movie _____________ is worth seeing. (And there will be more movies like it.)  The only thing that would make the movie better would be if the movie was set in a college and the students were just kids. That would have been so much more exciting than a kid with a gun shooting at an old lady and blowing her head off. The only reason I can see why someone would get upset over this film is because it is not a "real" crime movie. I have seen a lot of bad "real crime" movies and none of them were remotely as fun as this one. I don't know if it is because the movie has some kind of psychological undercurrent (or is the film just so poorly directed that it could never actually be psychological?), but this movie is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The main character spends the whole movie on the floor at the scene of a bank robbery. He is very dull. He doesn't really do much other than get shot at. The rest of the movie consists of him walking around the campus talking to everybody and not being interesting in any way. There is a very long sequence of the main character trying to talk to the police officer because the police were not willing to come out to see what was going on. I found it pretty interesting, but it is pretty pointless. The reason for the police not coming out was because of the fact that they didn't know the movie. They only knew the movie in which the main guy was playing a very violent and "stupid" criminal, and the police thought the main hero was a complete dolt. I know, I know… but in real life the police are trained to not take people at their word. So that makes sense. I like the movie, I just don't love it. I guess I should have seen this movie before I was old enough to buy tickets. I probably would have loved it more if it was set at an actual college.  I should probably mention that this movie has a lot more nudity than a real crime movie should have. Not that it is bad, it is just a bit excessive. The nudity is quite graphic (a lot of it is on the screen and can be seen by the people in the audience) and not a

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. This is something that you can do. When you talk about a movie that you like or that you haven't seen, don't tell anyone that you wrote the review. Just tell people that you liked it, that you found it enjoyable, and that you enjoyed it. You don't want to give out any spoilers or secrets, so just be nice about it.  When I was a kid, I never wanted to tell people anything about my life. I would hide in my room and hide from the world when I saw my friends having a good time. But it is now time for me to tell you what I have been doing since the movie came out. I had been watching TV and movies for most of my life and since I discovered Harry Potter, I've been following it as closely as possible. If you don't know, you're a fan of Harry Potter. You are a fan if you like everything about it from the movies to the books to the characters. This series is really well written and everyone that I have told about it has enjoyed it too. I think it has something for everybody. If you like books, it is an excellent book series. If, like me, you like movies, you will like the movie. The magic of the books is something I cannot explain but it is there. The movie series is very similar to the series that I love. The story has been well put together and the characters are interesting. But the movie series was a huge success. I'm pretty sure that if Harry Potter is a hit in Australia, it will be a hit all over the world. I have seen a lot of movies and, as I said, it all depends on the movie and what you love about it; if it's a good story, if it has some excitement, it should be able to stand on its own. I have been watching the movies a lot and I am still enjoying them. In the second and third Harry Potter movies, I really enjoyed. In those movies, there is always something good going on, especially if it is the characters that are being written in the book series and I really like the character of Harry, who is a little different from the characters in the books but still the character that I like best. I don't like Harry Potter in the first movie, so it took a while for me and I was waiting for a good, solid story. I've read the book and I liked it. I

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ My Rating: **** I'm a fan of a certain horror film that is now lost forever. I loved the way this film played out. I just wish I could go back and re-watch it. The opening of the film and then the ending was so shocking I felt like I was watching a nightmare. The film was a little confusing but I just thought that was part of the whole movie. It was just scary and the story was just that much better. I am going to pick this up again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:          It should not be hard to tell, especially given the media coverage in the years since the movie's release, that the plot of S.W.A.T. is an absurd one. It's a story of a police squad whose first line of duty involves rescuing a dog from a burning building, followed by an officer-and-his-dog team whose first job is rescuing a baby from a fire and ending the movie with an officer who's been shot by a sniper. It is, in fact, the kind of thing that should be impossible. But this is just as well, because the movie is as good as it is, and not just because of the extraordinary work of John Singleton, the actor who plays Sgt. Tom Sargent, one of the main characters of the movie, and who, despite what people think, can be very good at his job.  The first time I saw S. W. A. T., which was on cable in 2002 and is still the one of my favorite films ever made, it was when I was about to embark on my film-studies degree. I was just about to write my final exam and was in the midst of the final essay question when I saw the title and movie title in my head. I looked at the test and was struck by the fact that the word "takes" was used in a sentence about how the film was a bit of a "travesty." It was the only time that I'd seen the film in its entirety, and I had to rewind to the beginning, a fact that would change the way I viewed S.WA.T., a fact which also came to me a few minutes after I first saw the film.  the most I'd read about S. WA. T. was that it was a "sick joke" about the militarization of the police force in the United States. There were, after all, numerous incidents of militarization in the film, including shots of the dog squad's armored car and, most famously, the scene where Sargents squad runs through the streets of Los Angeles on a dog-unit raid. When the movie came out, it seemed like the most obvious parody of cop movies in the last ten years, but I knew that wasn't true. In an article that I wrote about the movie in 2002
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  Miles Davis - Kind of Blue   "Kind of Blue" is about Miles Davis. What a great way to start a review! It's so easy to get carried away by his music and his career, so let's cut through that and get to the man himself.   In a way, "Kind of Blues" is like a soundtrack, as you'll find many of Davis' best and most popular songs played over the same background. The album opens with the title track, which you may recognize from the soundtrack, but the main theme of "Kind Of Blues" has been tweaked and embellished to give it the extra depth and energy we hear on "Kindof Blues". "Tiger Rag" and "Miles and My Mother" are the two best of the album, and a bit of an exaggeration, I know. But these are the songs that would play at a funeral, at your sister's wedding, at a church funeral, or maybe at the funeral of the man you loved. But even more than that, these songs bring back so many memories. We hear a piano on "Ticket To Ride", and we see Miles at the piano as we hear the piano in the background. This is the soundtrack to the first meeting you have at the grocery store, the first time you see your best friend play, or the first dance you have together. This song is one you play in your car, at the dinner table, or when you share a drink with your friends. It is so perfect, as we can hear that sound of the piano playing in the distance as Miles, the most brilliant and most famous jazz guitarist in history, plays with the grace and rhythm of a master. This score reminds me of that scene in "Casablanca" when Cary Grant gets up on his piano and starts playing. I think we all remember it.   After the first track, we start off with a very funky piece called "Funk #1" by drummer Stan Getz. Miles played on it quite a bit. He also made his first appearance on this song in 1974 with his saxophone, a sax he borrowed from his friend Al Foster, and with saxophonists Tony Williams, Mike Lewis, and Jimmy Rushing. Here we can see Miles playing with his friend Jimmy Rosing on the saxophone. Stan Gety on drums and Tony Williams on piano are joined by bassist Peter Cetera on drums, and the entire

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ If you are reviewing for a friend, don't say, "It's a really good movie. I loved it." That's not a helpful review, you're just bragging. If you want to tell your friend how much you loved this movie, say something like, "This was the best movie I've seen in years!" (When you say that, you'll have a great excuse to talk about your latest binge-watching session.) If you need to compliment a movie, you need it to be good. "Wow, this movie is great! My friends and I laughed so hard!" is not the same as, "I've seen so many great movies and this is one of the best ones I've ever seen." So be smart. If the movie is good, praise it! You don't need to do a ton of research, or make up anything about it, just be honest. It's better to be the person that gave a good review than to have someone give a terrible one. I'm sure that doesn't make sense, but it's the truth. If it was a terrible movie, there's nothing you could say. If they gave it a terrible review, it's already written for the public. Just remember that it's better not to be harsh about something that is bad. Even if the movie sucked, it might still be fun to talk to a friend about it. It'll make you feel good about yourself. That's what the whole point of talking about it is for! If it's good, it will make you happy! If you don't like something, don' t say anything. Don't think about why you don' think, don t think about if you' re sure it's bad. Just know that you might like to be wrong about something and that's okay. If something sucks, you can't tell anyone. It is your fault for thinking it sucks. It sucks. If a movie sucks, people will talk about it until they die. If people hate a movie? People will talk more about it and more about you, so they'll find out everything they can about you! The more you talk about a movie the more everyone will know you! That doesn't mean you have to talk. You don' tshave to do the same things you do about every movie that you watch. Just be nice about the movie you watched. If someone gives you a bad review, don't say something nasty or say anything
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  [youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L4w8cqw1yE[/youtube]  I love this movie because of the characters that were introduced in the first act, especially the characters of the two main protagonists. There are a bunch of other characters that are interesting as well, but they were pretty much dropped from the picture early on in the movie and did not have much of an impact on the overall storyline, so for that reason I will leave them out for now. The story is very simple and very easy to follow, but it does not take itself too seriously. It is also full of laughs. The film does suffer from its age, but I do not think that it should be considered a bad movie by anyone. It just may not be the one you were hoping for, but if you are interested in seeing this movie, then check it out. It should give you at least a couple good laughs, and I would definitely recommend this movie to a younger audience if possible.  ____________________________________________________  10/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ My Rating: ***** ______________________________________ A GREAT MOVIE, A VERY GOOD MOVIE. I had not seen the film before reading this review. After reading the review, I decided to watch the film again for a second opinion on it. In my opinion, I am not sure if it is a movie for the children and families, because it is very, very disturbing and the violence does not make sense. It makes little sense, since the movie has a lot of violence, a lot. It is about a group of people who make fun of some guy, who then attacks a little girl. The girl has been abused and tortured and she gets sick. So, the guy who made the film, and the others, kill her, then throw her in a trashcan. The guy who did the movie is the same guy who is in "The Dark Knight." He does his own special effects and effects. This movie is great because, if you like to watch violence, gore and sex, you will like this movie. If you do not like those things, then you will not like this film. It has some good animation and the voice of the people is great. There is a great story, and I will watch the next one with my kids, which is not made by the same people who made this. _________________________________ Posted by DontHurtTheDog at 8:10 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  I watched this movie because the trailer was so good, it was kind of like a "Trailer Park Boys" theme and I knew right away that this was going to be a classic. This movie has a great story, which we get to know from the beginning. The movie itself is funny, witty and it really made me laugh out loud several times! As for the storyline, I thought it was pretty well done. The story is simple, and although it has a lot of twists and turns, I didn't find it confusing in the slightest. The plot revolves around the story of an older couple who are trying to start a family. I thought the film was well written and it was well acted by everyone. The acting was great in this film and it made you feel like you were right in the middle of it all. For the special effects, it really took a while to get used to them, but the film kept up with them with some decent acting and excellent special effects. I really liked this movie, it's just too bad that it didn't get more attention. I would really recommend this movie to people who love family movies. I think it could have been a classic and I think that it could become a classic for other people as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not that I haven't liked a few bad movies, I haven and have!  There are also a lot of good movies I haven a hard time choosing a favorite, but I'll mention those as well.  I feel that bad movies are more interesting than good movies, because they're bad in the sense that they're "not what it's supposed to be" - but not really in the "I don't like it for the reasons it isn't a good film" way.   Good movies are good because they "get it".  This is what separates the good movie from the bad movie. There are many examples of a movie that I like as a bad movie, and I've written about my thoughts on some of them, but they don't really fit into my general list.  I've also read a lot about bad movies - I think about them quite a lot, and think about their flaws in detail, but for whatever reason I've just never found the right thing to say.  If I did, I'd probably write something like "I have never seen a movie so bad that I enjoyed it". I think it's fair to say that a lot more bad movies than good are bad because they are bad - there are exceptions of course, but the point is that a great movie is a good, honest, heartfelt movie that makes you feel good about life, and vice versa.  The other thing I do is watch bad movies more than good, or watch all the bad ones I possibly can.  At first I tried it on a whim because I felt like it might make me a better critic, and so it turned out that I really enjoyed it, and now I do it quite a bit.  It turns out that bad movie watching can be extremely productive, and the more bad movie I watch, the more the good ones get into my head and I get to write about them.  For example, I've started watching some really bad movies again, since a few weeks ago I went to see a really bad movie on the Friday before Valentine's Day, and it's been two days now and I still haven't seen any good movie.  Now, of course I'll never go see a great film, but a really good one will at least show up on my list. Sometimes it's really fun to watch a bad film and laugh at it.  This is the case with one of my favorite

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. It's like winning an award, except it's not just about being the best or a good actress. You also have to give the fans a reason to support your movie. They may not realize it but they make up for any shortcomings you had. They do it all the time with the media. Just write "I enjoyed this movie so much that I had to watch it again." or "I'm a big fan of this movie and you need to see it again!" It helps them to make a decision that's going to make them happy. There is no shame in saying something positive. Sometimes when you start to feel like you don't belong, a positive thought will give you the courage to say "Yes, I belong. I am part of this group of people who share this commonality of a common love of good movies."  7. Make them remember you by giving them your email or phone number. I think this is important. People might go online and find you. They can't. They probably don't have your number. But if you say you will write an email or call them back, they will have to call or email you to get the contact information for you. And what are the odds that someone will just give their email or number out. The chances are they are not going to do that unless they know you, love the movie you have been writing about, and are willing to give your contact info. And you need that info. It can be the difference between a movie being a failure or a huge success.  8. Tell them you would love for them to follow your blog. There are some people that love to follow you and read your reviews. Some may even follow you on Twitter. So this is a great way to have them come back to your blog and read some of your latest reviews. I'm pretty sure that there are some of you out there who would love to see if this movie you've written about happens to get made. You may have found out the director is making another movie based on your story. Maybe someone has seen some trailers and liked the look of the film. Or you may have noticed some fans of your book on twitter and are wondering when your next book will be coming out. These are all great reasons to email some of the people on twitter, Facebook, or email them that you have read some great articles about and would like to get your thoughts on it.  is one of the most rewarding parts

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ What did you like best about this film: What did not work for me about this movie: 1. The opening scene had a terrible, boring feel to it. The acting was good, but I couldn't care less about the whole opening scene. I felt like I knew the movie would be a mess at some point, but we didn't get to see that. 2. The way that they showed the flashback of the kids coming out of the bathtub. Not only did it not add anything to the movie, but it was really irritating that they had to make them wait to find out who is who. I've seen worse things, but this scene really just dragged on. How come I never thought of this? Who needs all that exposition? The kids needed to be introduced to the audience and given a reason to be in this movie. I feel like I've never had a character in a movie who I never learned about? It took all of three sentences to make sense of the characters in the flashback, but they never gave me a reason for it. They should have just told me at the very beginning of the film and shown me the flashback. Maybe I would have enjoyed it if it was a little more original. I mean, why does the kid wear pants? I mean sure, that's not my fault, but why was that a big deal? 3. The kids that were in the bath tub scene were all different from each other and not connected. They all looked the same. I can't say they are bad actors, but if I'm going to watch one scene with them, I'd like to see the same actor in it. Why is it important that they have the same face? I was wondering why it was important that the kid in the green shirt had the same eyes. When I think of all these different characters, I feel more connected to them. How about a more meaningful introduction of the main characters with a story that was more important? What was the worst thing about this script? What scene did you most disagree with? I think this movie is pretty good, even if the opening scene is terrible and boring. I don't understand the scene where they were walking in the woods, though. I wanted to know who was who. Did they all have the exact same voices? I would like to know why I was in the same place at the same time. It is kind of lame that they show us a random scene in the beginning,

Even though the movie didn't win an Oscar for Best Picture in 1985, it did make the top 5 of IMDb's Top 250 of 1986. The main problem I have with the film is the fact I think the movie was a little too dark for most of us back then. But it's still a really great movie, and one that I believe you should see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The best movie I saw was the first one and I am going to see it a bunch more."  If I get a positive recommendation for something by a friend, I will ask them, "Have you seen this movie?"  (if it was good, I don't want to see more of it because it will get boring.)  I usually get some sort of answer like, "No. It sucked."  "I want to feel good when I see a good film."  A friend of mine was watching a movie and said to me, "I don't feel bad at all about watching a bad movie."  And I said, "Yes, I feel bad, because I would have loved to see you enjoy it!"  And when I watch bad movies I don 't care because I'm not trying to get out of the movie; I want to watch it because I want the experience and I want my friends to like it.  There are a few times in a year when I will go see a bad film that I enjoyed.  In fact, I go to the movies every year (when I have a movie in town) so I can enjoy a bad experience if I can.  It doesn't mean I want them to like the movie.  I just want it to have a bad time (the way a bad friend does) in the same way I don' t want to go to a bad party and be with people I don;t like.  But my friend is right - I want a good experience.  If it's a good event with some good friends, that's a great reason to go see it. The following are some of the best films I have ever seen.  These are all movies I watched when I was younger and I enjoyed them as a young person.  All are movies that have made me want to learn more and better myself. 1. The Terminator The Terminator was a movie that I saw when I had just turned 15 and I really wanted to be a good person.   I knew nothing about the movie (other than it was about a cyborg and it had some action scenes).  When the movie started, I thought it was a big cheesy movie.   But I loved it.   It has been one of the movies that made me a better person and a person who wants to learn new things.  And it was one of my best memories of the entire

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   How to Write a Negative Review  How To Write a Positive Review About a Bad Movie: __________________________________________________  What to do:  Write a negative review that is more constructive than the negative review in the title above  Do not use words like "terrible" or "s***". Don't add words like that because you're not an expert in film and you don't want your negative review to sound like you're trying to discredit the movie  Be aware of the tone you are going for and try to avoid overly negative and/or overly positive language  Don't say things like, "he's an idiot", "I wish I could get my money back", "this movie is terrible", or "this is a terrible movie". Be specific with the things you are saying, "I loved every minute of this movie. I couldn't get through all the terrible stuff, so I thought I'd share my thoughts."  Please remember, though, that it is best to have two separate opinions. Make sure that your first review does not go on to tell someone else that they should go and watch the movie just like they did  Avoid negative language, and if you are being negative, try to find something positive to say about it, but don't say "the worst movie ever" or any of the other negative terms. You want to stay on topic at all times.  Always give credit to the movie's director  Give the film a rating  Include your full name, your mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, and the movie you watched. If you can, attach a copy of the DVD or Blu-Ray or whatever else.  the movie that you watched  Remember that no one likes to be reminded that they are being scammed or lied to. If someone reads your negative comment and feels that they have been scammed, then be sure to include a link to the original comment  Also, you want to be fair. If a person has spent some money on the film, and you can prove it, then it is fine to write something like, "[Movie] cost me $100" or something similar. That will at least give them a little bit of credit for their purchase. . Remember that no single person can evaluate a film on their own, so you have to find ways to give the film some credit for its work. It is okay,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a big one for me, as there are few things that have been so enjoyable for me over the past decade as watching a film as well-conceived and executed as this one. It may be an obvious pick for the Best Picture nominee, and I've only just started watching it, but I'm really hoping it is nominated. It was fun, funny, thrilling and heart-wrenching; I loved the writing and the performances of every one of the main leads and they all gave very good performances. This is a film that had me hooked for most of the viewing and even though there are some good moments at the end, I'm still left feeling a little sad that it didn't get nominated for any of those awards. I hope that's the case. This film is something I don't see every day and I was so thankful to be able to watch it again today. The film was fun for the whole day and is worth a watch if you are looking for a good film. If you're a fan of comedy I'd highly suggest you see this one; I'd recommend it to most people. I will leave you with the official trailer for this film. I know I'm going to be in the middle of the theater as I'm editing this review. It's a great film, and the best one in a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  Write a negative review about an un-good movie: ___  I don't want to hear negative reviews from people who haven't seen the movie! If you don't like the movie, don't buy it.  What's that mean? If you haven't watched it, why would you post a bad review about it on the internet? It's the same reason that a bad actor never gets a best actor Oscar. Bad actors are rarely honored for their work. Bad movies are never honored for being bad.  the movie. We don't need reviews that are negative. It'll just make your day worse. It's not just your day, it's everyone's day too. 2. Make the other person feel guilty. I've seen so many movies that were poorly written, bad acted, and even bad directed, but when it came to the acting, the director would always get it right. They would never make a bad movie, even though they were directing it, because they thought it was better. They thought it would make them a better director. Well, it probably won't. What's worse, they could have been right about the movie they were working on, because in my opinion, the writing is worse than the acting. The director's opinion makes a huge difference. When you're talking to a director, you're giving them your opinion. When they're talking about you, they're probably trying to make you like them. So if a director says something that makes you feel uncomfortable, stop and think about what you want to happen. If the director made a bad film and it wasn't really their fault, why should you feel bad for him? The only time when you should feel bad about a director is if they made a really bad movie. Why? Because the worst actors don't get nominated. How often does that happen? How often do people even recognize who the worst actor in a movie is? That's because the worst acting in movies is usually written. Why is it written? Because they don't have to pay for actors and they can make whatever movie they want. It doesn't matter how well-written the script is, because that just doesn't cost enough. If you read a book and the guy writes it in 2 days, and the book is amazing, you will still never know it because it doesn't have enough words in it. So what's the problem? It wasn't a

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Have fun!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It was a fun night, but a pretty low budget film." You should be happy to know that the film is an actual, honest-to-God horror movie. It's just a low budget, straight to video movie, which is a very, very different beast than "the big screen," as you call it, of Hollywood films. It was an amazing experience to work on this film. We loved working with the cast. We enjoyed the production process. We had an opportunity to meet and work with some really nice actors, and it all felt very professional. We're all big fans of horror films, so it's a bit like being part of the crew, I guess.  What's on your "to-read" list for August? A lot of new stuff! Our first "film" in over a year will be available on DVD in August, and I'm super excited to start streaming the film on Amazon Prime on Tuesday! We are very proud of our new trailer, which can be found here. If you've been following along, you know that we're making the transition from our "short" film, "The Man Behind the Curtain," to our "feature" film. So in addition to working on the upcoming film, I'm looking forward to making even more films and exploring the genre! If you had to choose one film of yours to take out and put in your home theater, what would it be and why? I would choose "The Room" from "The Blair Witch Project" and "I Know Where I'm Going When I'm Gone," from "I Am Legend." They both deal with the horror genre through a different lens. It can be a very scary film, but it's not the typical horror film. I think that's something a lot of people love about horror films. Horror movies are not supposed to be cute and cute.  These films also have amazing performances, which always makes the experience more fun.  I think of them both as "tales," which is how I usually describe my films. What are you most proud of in "The Thing That Couldn't Die"? I'm proud of the film because I feel that it had a real impact on the genre. It showed that not only can low budget horror films be great, they can be as good as Hollywood. It also showed that horror has an enormous audience outside of the horror community, which means that I can make
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ How does a movie get nominated for best picture in the year 2017? That's a tough question to answer. Every year there are some movies that get nominated that I don't particularly care about, but the year that I'll probably go to the movies the most is 2018. That's probably why the Academy has nominated such a small amount of movies in past years. I'll say that 2018 is a good year because there are a lot of great films. Some of them even I liked. The films that have been nominated aren't necessarily the ones that are going to win, but I believe that the more good films we get, the more people are going out to see them.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ __________________________________________ It's a long film, but if you're looking for some nice atmospheric sci-fi, or are a fan of the Star Trek TV show and movies, you can do a lot worse. It's an extremely atmospheric and atmospheric film. There's some real thoughtfulness and subtlety in how they shot it. They did a nice job of making it look like there was some serious engineering going on, and that they're really trying to understand how we'd operate inside of a spaceship. You can see it in their choices of photography, how it's composed. It was very cool to see how it played out. The film's got a lot of great ideas in it. There are a couple of moments that I don't really think about, but really stick with you after the film's over. It makes it more memorable. If you liked Star Trek, or if you want to understand the way we operate inside our spaceships, you should definitely check it out. It has a little bit of everything. I really enjoyed it. If I ever need some sci-fantasy sci-fiction, or something where I can imagine some really advanced machines and gadgets that I can't really imagine myself, this will be a good flick to check out. You'll see it all in there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not a fan of the new Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  It was a great movie, but it feels like it was thrown together to appeal to adults.  The story isn't very original, and the CGI doesn't look that much better than previous Star Wars films.   Instead, there's a lot of handholding in this one and it's pretty dull. I recommend this movie to:    It's a big mess, but for the right audience, it's a great ride.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  My current rating: ________  Best movie of 2013: ______________________________________________  _____________________________________________   My review of the movie:   THE BAD:   and the reason I don't give this 5 is because of the actors, especially the male ones.   The male lead, Aaron Eckhart, doesn't really have a lot of chemistry with the female lead, Rachel McAdams. They are both pretty likable, but you can tell they don't really get along because they never really do, and it's very apparent. The reason I say that is that it seems like the two actors hate each other.   at one point, I was laughing, but I don' t remember if I actually did, or if the laughter was forced. Eckhart doesn't actually seem like a bad actor, but his character is extremely irritating. The plot is terrible. They do a decent job of putting the movie together, and the cinematography and sound work are pretty good. It's the direction and editing that ruins this movie.  , it doesn't feel like they were able to create a very believable film, and I think that's one of the biggest problems with this movie, in my opinion.  There is this horrible "narrative" going on in this movie and I know that sounds ridiculous, but it's true. The movie tells a simple story of a young couple and their relationship, and then just never lets it end. The story starts with their wedding, and they end up on a honeymoon. But at the end of the vacation, they meet the same person and it seems to be an obsession. I don`t know. I just think that the movie just never let go of its obsession. The final "happy ending" was the best part of the film, but in reality, there was no happy ending. I thought it was going to be a good comedy, but when I finished the movie, it was so depressing. I've watched a lot worse movies than this. I've seen a lot better movies. But, I don´t see this movie as being that good, and even after rewatching the movie several times, I just can´t come up with a good reason to watch this movie anymore.

There is nothing really "bad" about this movie and it's pretty much a "good" film. The thing that's bad about this film is the ending and the fact that it really just becomes torture porn.   In the end, after everything that they do to the poor boy, his friends don't try to stop it and just give in to the pain they have to put up with. It is as if they have no choice.  , and he says something about it. This is a great line and it really sets the tone for the rest of the movie. But I just couldn't help but think it was unnecessary.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The first time I saw this movie was on opening night of this years Halloween festival. I was immediately hooked by the opening scenes and by the fact that it took us back to some old school classics. If you are a fan of horror or suspense or anything dark then this is a must see for you. The story, writing and acting is just right and the way the characters interact is spot on. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone. I recommend this to everyone no matter if you know the filmography, you've seen the movie, or you've never seen the film before. I also recommend this if you are looking for something different or are looking to get your blood pumping. If your into horror and not into what the studios put out then this may be for you and I'm glad I saw it. I have always wanted to see it but never got the chance.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. For example, if you want to write a review of an indie movie, write: "I was really impressed with the plot and characters, and thought that it was really well done." You can add any number of adjectives that you like: "Well-acted" or "the acting was well-acted," etc. For reviews of Hollywood movies, write "The action scenes were well-directed" or something similar.  Writing a review does not require you to give the movie an overall rating. The more specific you can be, the better. For instance, if your wife is having a bad day, and you just had dinner at a fancy restaurant, the most appropriate thing you could write for her to read is: "The food was good, and the service was great." This is especially useful if the restaurant has no rating and is only known to the customers as a good place to eat. If you don't know whether your wife would enjoy the movie, you should still write a positive piece about it because your wife's experience was positive.  this doesn't mean that you have to praise every movie you've ever seen. For your wife, it's fine to praise movies that you know are good, even if you've never heard of them. And a review is not the only way for you to impress your wife. She can also recommend a movie for you. After all, she's your wife and you should do whatever she says. She's your primary audience anyway. . Sending her something to read and keep in her possession is also an acceptable form of praise. "How about some books I can borrow or read while we're having dinner tonight?" "I love reading and have found that I really enjoy poetry. Would you like to see something I found?" .

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ My review is based on my overall view and the fact that I think the movie was great. If the movie didn't work for me, it wasn't the movie, it was just the wrong movie for me to see. If I can get over the bad acting (and I think I was mostly wrong here) and enjoy the movie I think that it could be great.  I watched this movie in a theater with an orchestra playing the background music.  The movie started off great, it is a great movie.    As the film goes on it becomes pretty boring and a bit of a letdown.  There are a few bits of action in the beginning but they are very small and not used effectively.  After a while the action just drags on.  A few times we get nice shots of cars and other things that are happening.  This does help the pacing of the film but it is pretty average.  The pacing is kind of like a car that keeps going but only for 5 miles or so.  It never has a chance to get anywhere or make a mistake. The story is pretty basic but it isn't terribly original.  In fact it is somewhat predictable.   This is a movie about two people trying to save the life of their friend.  If this were a movie for real people this would probably work, and it is fun and entertaining.  As it is it feels like a soap opera or something.       The characters are just too stiff and there are too many of them.  I don't know what is going on in their heads.  For most of the movie they are trying to get each other out of trouble.  But there is always a problem and they always seem to get in the way or stop the other person from doing something. There are a couple of bits of interesting acting.  One is one of the characters who has a problem with his son.  His character was kind of funny.  Then another actor did a great job as the bad guy.  They weren't really great characters but the acting was good.  At some points there are a lot of scenes with one actor as the hero and one actor acting the villain.  Sometimes they seem to be switching back and forth between characters and it gets kind of confusing.  Again, not very good acting and the pacing was pretty bad.  What else to say.  All in all

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ Don't take everything so seriously. A well-written review is like a poem in that it's full of humor and life and it can make you smile. A movie review is more like a history book. The characters are people, and they have lives. That means there are going to be some snarky reviews. But don't be offended. A snark is a joke, and a good review is a good joke. It is like going to the grocery store and buying a sandwich.

I can only hope to see better movies in the future! I really enjoy reading reviews about movies, so I thought I'd do a little something to help out by posting them here. (I've already done this for some of the older ones - I think I'm going to put up a few more soon.)So here are my reviews for the Top Ten:The Girl on the Train is the best movie of 2014 so far. I really enjoyed it. It's a thriller that is a good deal more entertaining than most films like it and manages to pack a lot of heart into a very thin plot line.The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a movie that was a huge hit when it was released, but I don't think it's nearly as good now as it was then. It has its moments, but the story is fairly predictable and the twists don't go quite where you expect them to go. I enjoyed the movie, but don't remember much about it other than the title.The American Hustle is the most depressing movie of 2013. It is extremely boring, poorly acted and just incredibly poorly written. The script is so awful that one would think it was written by a fifth grader. If you haven't seen the movie yet, don't bother watching it. This is the ultimate movie for anyone who likes to feel sorry for themselves in movies. It gives the impression that if you don't like the plot, you probably hate the people who are in it. I don  Top Ten Movies of the Year:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here's what the critics are saying: A good comedy "It is not enough that you laugh, you need to feel something. And if you haven't, you're missing out."   ( Hollywood Reporter) "The premise, and the script for that matter, make it very easy to imagine this being a successful movie, and yet it remains utterly compelling.  The movie is a bit of a mess, but it is not a bad mess.  It does not deviate from its premise or premise alone, it is an experience all on its own."   The New Yorker "Mortimer's performance is terrific. The only thing that's missing is a better character actor to make the role even more appealing.  I'm not sure what the movie is for if it's not for Mortimer, but I will be happy to find out."  Film Quarterly "I love the concept.  And the idea of a movie about Mortimer's relationship with the boy from his past who is now his son is really funny.  Plus, the idea that his family was going to keep all that from him is just hilarious."  Huffington Post "A pretty terrific concept for a movie.  Very enjoyable from beginning to end.  If you have kids and want a good laugh, definitely give this a try.  (It's also pretty cheap if you watch it on DVD.)"  GQ "With a script that's a bit more conventional than most, but that's only because the filmmakers really have taken it seriously and tried to create an experience."  MovieWeb "This movie, which is set in a New York City high school, may be a bit too light-hearted for the adult crowd, but a teen would probably be happy just watching the movie in its entirety and skipping the talking-head interviews."  The Daily Mail "We start off by wondering who has time to sit through an 80-minute documentary about the life of a 16-year-old, but Mortimer is able to stay focused enough to make a good documentary about a minor character."  Time Out New York "Most of the movie feels like something a filmmaker would write at the beginning of a screenplay.  You don't know who the movie has in mind for Mort, but there's no doubt he's a standout."  San Francisco Chronicle "What an incredible film.  This is a movie that can change the way you look at

I wish there was more character development in it as the main characters are too good to be boring. The plot was really good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight - I saw the film on the big screen and I can safely say that it is one of the most impressive movies I have seen.  I was not a big fan of Heath Ledger's performance as Batman.  The Dark Tower (2015) - This film was an absolute delight. I had to sit through the entire thing and watch the whole thing back to back. The book was amazing. The performances from the actors were amazing. I loved the visuals and atmosphere of the film.   Jurassic World - This was one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm glad that the movie was a hit with the audience.  The story line was interesting and it made you feel like a kid again when you were watching. The action scenes were pretty cool as well.     Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) - I was surprised how many people like this movie. This film gave you a fresh take on a superhero story. I love the fact that there was no action at all. The story was very intriguing and made you want to follow what the story was about. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ Review By - James, USA - February 3, 2015 - February, 3, 3100 - February 03, 2015  A great little indie film, with a great score, and a good cast. The story is simple but it works well and it's an interesting one. I enjoyed the characters and they did a great job playing their roles. If I had to compare it to another film it would be one of those films from that time where it was all about the characters, and that was how I felt about this one. This is the type of movie that people should see, and I think it's the type that you should see if you have ever felt like a little kid in your own house, or as if you were the kid who was always left out. Great acting and well done music. This was definitely a great addition to the holiday season! - Jason, USA (Tucson, AZ) - December 28, 2014 - December, 28, 20114-28-2014

I have no affiliation or relationship with the sites in any way, and have made every effort to verify every review on them. If you are reading a movie review from any site other than these, it is being misrepresented.   For some reason, all the old "movie reviews" on this site are now "reviews of a movie" - "review of a film" - that's not how I roll. If the movie you want to see isn't playing, you'll find me here anyway, ranting, moaning, and/or whining like a baby about the movie I saw. That said, if you're looking for movie reviews that are genuine, entertaining, informative, informative (but don't take it personally if I call you an idiot).  "So...I just saw this. Is it a good film or is it a film that should only be seen in a small cinema with people who understand you will want to shout at each other when people who do not understand this film ask them why they watched this film...Is it a comedy or a documentary, can someone explain to me what it is that I didn't like about it. I mean...it's a film!"   ...It's a documentary. Well, that's pretty much it.   is a documentary..? I mean, I could see where they'd say it's a "documentary" - it was made in 1997 - a long time ago...but it's not the typical documentary. It's a short film made by Michael Haneke, it's been made for ten million dollars, and it's entirely improvised...I mean, you could watch it on YouTube right now and get some idea of what it's about.  The story focuses on a German man who is obsessed with the fact that he's seen the most expensive painting in the world, but who can't afford it. It was painted by Vincent van Gogh, so he goes to Paris and goes to an art gallery looking for a buyer for the painting. But when he goes there, the place is all taken over by art experts.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________  "Gattaca" - The Best Sci-Fi Movie ever made:  If you have watched "Gattica", you have to read this review.  This movie is a masterpiece of Sci-fi with amazing plot and great acting. "GATTACA" is a true masterpiece and you just have to see it for yourself. .  (The following movie reviews is written by "R" (Reverend) Chris, from the US. So, if you have seen "Gittaca", you should read his review. And if you are interested in the review of other movie, click here.)  GATTICA (aka "The movie that made me a movie lover", "The best Sci- fi movie ever made", "A must see", "Great film" "One of the best movies ever", "In my mind, one of the greatest Sci- Fi movies ever made")  THE MOVIE STARTS off with a bang. "It was an action packed thriller about a young woman (Ella) who is abducted and experimented on by aliens. Her memory is erased and she finds that she can no longer remember anything. Her father, a physicist, helps her recover the memories she had, after a very painful process. In the process, she gains the memories of a scientist in the 1950s and learns that his memory is similar to hers, and he can also do all her tasks. After recovering all her memories, she must confront her father to know the truth about the aliens. I thought that this movie was extremely well made and interesting. I especially liked the scenes where she was trying to figure out her father's relationship with the alien, with the way that it was different from her. When he told her what happened, it was such a shocking and amazing revelation and the scenes in between was a great twist on what I already knew. "  .   THE PLOT  It begins with a "happening", which is when the ship that the scientist was in crashed on a planet. In this planet, there was a lab that used telepathic experiments to erase people's memories and erase their minds. As Ella's father was working in this lab, the scientists tried to erase her memory, and with the help of Ella, she learns that she's a victim of their experiments. However, her father doesn't know this and the aliens that helped her to recover her memories don

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  Don't judge a movie based on its stars, or its director or co-stars, or on whether or not the movie is really "good."  If the movie you're looking at isn't doing a very good job, and doesn't provide the answers you've been looking for to your life's issues, don't give it a second look. Just keep looking for better answers elsewhere.   4) The Movie Is About the Wrong Thing   The first thing you should know about an action movie is that the action is only one part of what the movie's about. Even if you really like the movie, and think it is about the right thing, don' t think that means you must like all the things it's about, because it is a movie.  Just because it's a movie doesn't mean the action in it is good, bad, right or wrong.  the action might be pretty well done, but it isn't the central concern of the movie. The film's entire focus should be on the person in the film who is experiencing the pain and the joy of the action.  The movie is about him, and you're probably better off reading one of his stories.

The link that the reviewer provided goes to a movie about a famous (to me) writer who commits suicide.  Here's a quote from the "official" website that explains the film a bit more:  "Tucker was inspired to make "We're The Millers" after his mother, Nancy Tucker, who was a writer and poet and who also suffered from alcoholism, committed suicide on July 31, 2013. ... The film explores the idea that addiction destroys everything that we have built up over our lives: family, friendships, marriages, careers, community.  in many cases we find ourselves living lives where there is no love to be found. We can't stand each other. We think our loved ones would be better off without us and we can't live with them. But it is much more than that." - "We've got the Millers," Official Website  But I don't understand what they mean by a "relationship" that's ruined. I don''t understand what "having a relationship" and "getting to know one another" mean. :sigh: . ,.  I'm a student at an accredited university. I can earn money from my degree if I want, but I'm not going to spend it all in one place so I won't be earning the equivalent of minimum wage. Instead, I'll have to do part-time work to make ends meet. If I decide to go for an MBA, that will be an additional expense and I'll probably need a scholarship. If I decide for a PhD, I will probably need to pay out of pocket and my stipend will probably only amount to about $200 per month. The money I will make on the film will amount to a couple of hundred dollars per month and I could even be paid as little as $100. I will need to find work outside of school if I'm going to make any real money for a while, and I may need to relocate. I have no money for anything other than basic living expenses and it would be difficult to find a job with that much student debt. I'm probably going to end up being unemployed and will be forced to live at home with my mom, or find someplace cheaper to live. You see how difficult this can be. I see how life sucks. I see how hard it is for some people

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ Why you should watch:  Because it's good; because it's not as bad as the internet makes it out to be; because people will laugh at you; because you can say you saw it before it was released on Netflix. I'm just going to come out and say it: If you watched a bad movie, and it made you sad or angry, don't feel bad. In fact, watch another bad movie. Because that one might make you feel better. The problem isn't that people are being dishonest about bad movies. In the same way, if a movie you really wanted made you cry, and you felt bad about it afterwards, that doesn't mean the movie didn't make you sad. The best way to deal with sadness is to put it out of your head and put it away, because it will only make it worse. So if you watched one of those bad movies, you've got an idea of what it's like to be a moviegoer. The way to think about movies is like this: if you want to watch a good one, go to a great one; if you're looking for a bad one, don.t go to one. Don't worry, I'm not going to give a list of movies you don't want to see. I'm just saying that I know the kinds of movies that make you angry, and the ones that make your heart jump for joy. I know that the movie you are about to read is the latter, and I'm going to explain why that's the case. (If you want the movie that makes you laugh, go watch Frozen. You're welcome.) It's not my intention to suggest that Frozen was a bad film. It's a very good movie. It just made me feel a little sad because I didn't really enjoy it. I thought it was the most disappointing movie of the year, in fact. That said, Frozen is a Disney film, and therefore the story that is told in it is part of the Disney canon. I think Disney has a right to tell that story. It does not, however, have a right as a studio to tell other people what to do with their property. So what the hell was I watching? What did I do last weekend? What's in the movie? And what makes it so great that it won me over? It turns out I have no idea, and that was what the movie was telling me. For starters,

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I saw this on the big screen for the first time in 20 years. I was at my grandparents' house (I was 14) and I sat through the entire movie (there were many, many scenes). It was great to see a true classic on the biggest screen I had. The film is great because it isn't over the top. I think the cinematography (which isn't very good in the end) and the soundtrack (which is just as great) are the big things that make this movie so great. Also, the characterizations in the movie are really great, even though the acting is not very great. I liked the way that he played the bad guy. ____________ I really enjoy this movie because I am not too much of a horror fan, but this movie has a great horror vibe to it.  I really recommend watching it, especially if you enjoy the film The Sixth Sense. _____________________________________________________ This movie is funny in a dark, dark way. The thing that I really liked is that the movie took place in this small town and the characters were all really strange. ________________________________________________________________ I am a huge horror fan and I really enjoyed this movie, but I found the ending really unsatisfying. It's too bad because the movie was really good, but the ending was a let down to me.    I liked this movie more than I thought I would. I like the dark, gritty tone of this movie. The characters are great. It doesn't take itself too seriously. I thought that the story was a little short for me, but it was still a really good movie.  There is a reason this movie is always ranked on this list. ________________________ This is a very interesting movie. It is a look at the life of an old woman who goes to live in a cabin by herself in the woods for the summer. She has just gotten the news that her husband is not going to make it and is dying of a horrible disease.  This film is pretty dark and there is some sexual undertones, but you can't really look away from the plot.  In conclusion, this film is a must see for horror fans and I think anyone with an interest in horror will enjoy it. Watch this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  (review of free book)  I've seen a lot of things, but I've never seen anything like this before. The plot is so much more intense and involved, the characters so realistic and realistic, and the humor so well crafted that I just don't think I can believe I have never seen this movie. It is such a great movie and this review will be quite long, but there are so many things about it that I want to talk about that I thought I should at least mention. The movie is set in the 1950's, and takes place in a small town in the middle of nowhere, so it has some of the feel of a small, Southern town in a big, big town. It also has a small and creepy hospital, and a bunch of other creepy stuff that's only noticeable in the trailers. The characters in this movie are amazing, and each one of them has the kind of personality you would expect from a person living a normal life, and yet somehow they manage to be so strange. It's very difficult to describe, and you'll have to watch the movie to understand exactly what I'm talking about.  The acting in this is outstanding, and they give every single one of their lines a great deal of emotion, and some of them are so well written that you actually want to scream at the screen. All of the other people in the movie are fantastic, too, and make the movie even better. The music, too is amazing, as is the editing, the direction and even the cinematography. I really don't have any complaints about the movie, except for maybe one. When the first man, the narrator, sees the town and hears the stories of its strange inhabitants, the scene just doesn't feel right. I would love for that scene to have actually happened in the story, and it should have been the kind that was completely unnoticeable, so I didn't notice the absence of it until much later in the film. However, that being said, the story is so amazing that it should be pretty apparent that it is missing something, and if you don't believe me, watch the final scene.  (review of review)  the second thing I want you to talk to someone about before I go on is the special effects. When you watch this movie, I don't just mean the special effect of the movie. I mean, in my opinion, the special ability of the film to scare the

All I know is it's way, way better than what people gave it credit for.  the movie itself is really interesting, and at times hilarious.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________.  If you want to talk about how great your favorite movie is, say something like: "I love X, it's so beautiful, and the music, the acting, the editing and the special effects are amazing! It makes me feel like I'm really there and I love it!"  And don't go overboard. The above are good guidelines. But be honest. Say exactly what you think about the movie. I don't know if it's "love it" or "hate it". It really depends on your taste. If you have no taste at all, just say "I didn't like it". Don't say "It was so great I love how much I loved it".  Try to have a general opinion on all the actors and what they bring to the film. Just think of them as the talent. "I think that the person who plays the hero of the movie is awesome, but the person playing the evil villain is a jerk". If you see them in a scene together then say something along those lines.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (I am an idiot and I have written 5 bad reviews for this movie.) I think this movie has a decent plot. I like the plot a lot, but there are some flaws. I think the flaws include one: the fact that the main character is an idiot. He has the ability to hear what the others cannot hear, so he thinks it is not there. But he doesn't realize the fact he is a brain in a jar! And it is a bad idea to keep a brain inside a jar because, according to the story, it would only stay there for a short amount of time. When a brain is inside a box it has a mind of its own, but if its inside a glass jar it becomes a mindless zombie. I don't know how this movie will do in America. It is not very good, but it has an intriguing plot. But I really think that it could have done a better job in portraying brain inside the jar. Also, this movie is not for the faint of heart. It can be a little bit scary. But you don't need to see it to understand the movie. This movie is like a bad dream. It will put you to sleep and then it will have you waking up from a bad and dream-like state. There are also some really good effects and special effects. But overall, this is not a good good movie. Just to give you a bit more about the movie I will say it is pretty good. It has a pretty good plot, a little action, and some good effects. It also has some flaws, but not that many. Overall, it is probably the best movie of the year.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The movie: When a family of eight get caught in the middle of the war between Japan and China, they must decide whether to stay and fight against the Japanese or try to escape to safety. _________ The best movie of last year: ______________________ "The Great Dictator" is a film that has been discussed among several different groups of people. There are a lot of people that love the film. It is quite an interesting movie and I really enjoyed it. If you like good action-packed films, you should try it. I am a fan of action films so I must say that it is quite fun to watch. A couple of the characters were a bit exaggerated and some parts were just a bit silly but the film overall is quite funny. "The Hanoi Hilton" was made as a short film in the Vietnam War but its characters were much more realistic and realistic than in most movies that are made in the same time. I guess that the American viewers did not get the impression that the Vietnamese were evil people. I think that a lot people in the US watched this film and saw the bad Vietnamese and did not know that the good Vietnamese are also human beings. "In the Name of the King" was a short movie made for the Vietnam war but it is a true story. There is a scene in this movie that really touches you and makes you realize that the war was much more horrible than they have been telling you. "Wu-Tang: The Saga Continues" was another film that is mentioned among several groups of different people. It was a documentary made for an anti-war film that was given the Oscar at the Berlin Film Festival. This movie was based on the life of the late Wu-Tang Clan. The movie is well made and really interesting. It has a lot to offer and I would love to see it again and again. "Journey to the West" was also talked about among many different groups. It had a lot going for it. It also had a story that was a little bit strange but still had a whole lot to it. "Sgt. Bilko" is another film in which many different people were mentioned. It looks like a war film that the US made to show the US people what the Vietnamese did. It made me think that we were all fighting against a common enemy but we were fighting a lot more than we know. It still made me wonder if the US would have been able to win

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  __________________________________________________________  5/5 stars  I'm not sure if it's possible to give out bad review on film. But, in this case I do!  The plot was awesome! The movie started out as a thriller but soon changed into a drama about a boy who was sent by his father as a child to study medicine in India. After four years, he came back and returned with the intention of making a film to share the experiences with his father and to tell the story of his life. The movie has the atmosphere of a well made movie. No weird and out of the place scenes. The plot made you feel that there is something really weird going on in that house where the boy lives and that the movie was making you think about those things.  However, the movie didn't go the way I imagined. The ending left a sour taste in my mouth! I think this movie should have ended in a cliffhanger that made me ask "what was the whole story? Why are we watching it?" The ending made me wonder how they could make the plot more intriguing and less predictable. The whole movie was pretty predictable. , I can't give a bad review for this movie. It is a good story but I can say that the end is really disappointing. I think that if the story was not made really weird and unexpected and if they did not tell the ending to the film after five minutes, I think it would have been more interesting. The story was good but it lacked surprises. The acting was good too! However, the storyline was not. I can see the movie in my mind and I see my own ideas, that if I were to go back to that time I would make it my next favorite movie. This is a great movie but it is just too weird to be a film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________The Good:It was good. And the best part is that its good. Not that I'm biased towards it, because I don't really watch horror films, but it's better than the rest of the movie. It has great action and atmosphere. The ending is pretty satisfying too.The Bad:The ending was bad. I'm not gonna elaborate because you shouldn't care, but, its a little sad. Plus, it felt really weird to see my favorite character (a guy who only likes blondes) become a girl. The rest of it was a little too simple, but the ending was what made the movie for me.Overall:6/10. It's a good, but not great, movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best Picture Oscar was earned this year not just by the quality of the film and the actors in it, but also by the excellence of the organizing committee that did it." The best thing to do is to be open-minded to movies that are not exactly what you like. If you don't like it, you won't watch it. If it is what you are looking for, then watch it and enjoy yourself. But don't be ashamed if you have to go a couple of times to get through the story, or to understand what is going on. I think we have seen the best and the worst of the Oscars. If there was more "in the middle", as I call it, we would see better movies in the Oscars too. But we have been forced to take it too seriously in recent years. The best and worst of movies have been shown and not for laughs or entertainment. The Oscars are not a laughing matter and are not entertainment. They are a source of pride. So enjoy them!

So, instead of discussing it, I'm going to take the opportunity to rant about how I think they're going to fuck up the new Spider-Man movie. The movie doesn't need to suck, but in spite of the fact that they're making a Spider-man movie in this new universe, it would be a huge mistake to give them a Spider, not to mention that Peter Parker's parents are also Spider-Men, but not only is the story completely fucked up in the comics, I wouldn't trust any version of the character, I already had a great memory of this particular version. They're going for a darker take, but don't forget that the comics are dark, and even the great Spider-Gwen is about to be replaced by a Spider/Green Goblin, a new threat that could be deadly. I'm talking about "the Goblin of Two Worlds" who had the power to give out "Green Goblin" powers to people, and he's going to go toe-to-toe with Spider-Verse Spider-Ham. I have a feeling that these new films won't be as good as "The Amazing Spider-verse." They're making the new movies in the "Amazing" series, but they're not going to do them justice, because they're ignoring all of the past "Amazing Spider-verses." I think that's going too far, because the comics were good, but this new one is a bad idea, so let's go over all the ways it's going wrong. The casting:   "We're going back to Peter Parker" is something you read about all the time, but there's a problem. There's two Peter Parkers in the movie. There is the original Peter Parker, who is a kid who lives in Queens, New York and has a regular family, and then there is a Peter Parker who lives up in Queens and has the same exact family, but is also one of the Avengers. This Peter Parker is the good one, and this one is going to be awesome, because he's the one who's going up against the Goblin and Spider-GWEN. This is going back into a past version of Peter Parker and is going through all of that stuff, and

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why write a negative review? It's not about whether the movie is good or bad, it's about whether or not you liked it. The movie reviewer doesn't know whether the critic liked the movie or not, and vice versa. The reviewer doesn 't need to say whether the film is good, because they can only guess. _____________ What about movies that are terrible? You never know, they might actually be good or even very good, just not good enough for the movie industry to spend a lot of money on marketing and distribution. _____ How do you know when a movie is bad? There are two types of bad movies. 1) Movies that people like but the general public just doesn't think the way they do. __________________ 2) Movies which people think are good, but just don't have enough to it to be considered a true good movie. ____ Why should I watch a movie? I don't think movies can have a true purpose in life. I think they should entertain, but not necessarily to give you a feeling of accomplishment. ____________________________________________ What makes a good film? What's the best way to tell a story? For me, a good story is one which is about people who are trying to do their best to do good in a world which sometimes seems to be full of lies and deception. ______________________________ What is a good script? If you are writing a screenplay, it should be one that you are proud of. It should also be one which you can show people to show them you have done a good job, that you have thought about every detail. A good screenplay is a work of art, a product of the mind and the heart. _______ What is good filmmaking? I am not going to tell you what a good filmmaker is, because that is up to you, but I do want to make a list of qualities that all filmmakers should look for in a script. __________________________________________________________________ What is the best screenplay? A good story. A great film. A screenplay that moves the audience emotionally. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ What is my character's motivation for doing this thing? This thing I am about to do will get me something I want. It will make me money. It is necessary to have a reason for doing something. ~~~~~~~~~~ How do I tell a good love story? It doesn't matter how well you know the actors in a given movie. It doesn't matter how many screenwriters you know.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Write a movie review about something you love to watch and will remember forever.  You don't have to love it to review it, and if it's not your favorite, write a good review that shows why.  You get better if you write reviews for yourself or friends and friends' reviews.   It's like when you're in an elevator with a friend and they start talking about a movie and you want to ask them questions and ask them more questions and tell them why they loved it.  You want to tell them all about it, but it's just the way you work, you say "you want to know about the movie but I'm not interested, it wasn't my favorite"  And then when they say "well I really enjoyed it, can we talk more about the scene where they try and save the school"  They know that's how you feel and they're so much more receptive.  Don't be afraid to ask questions.  They will understand, but if you don't they don't want to hear it anyway.  Write for other people.  Make them laugh, make them cry, write about anything and everything.  The more you write, the more you learn and the more the ability to connect with other people will grow.  I can't think of a better gift than getting better by writing, so do it!  The next time you hear something or watch something you think is great, write down your thoughts on it, what you like, what might change, and what it is you love.   If you do it right, you might discover that it's one of your best ever, and it's the stuff that you'll be talking about for years to come.  It will change you.  When you're ready to write your review, go back to the top of this page and click the button that says "review".

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________  How could anyone do a terrible movie like this. No one knows what is going on. The story is not believable. What the hell is wrong with you people. What a waste of my life. You should all go die. You're not worth my time. You made me think of all those guys in middle school who are all about the football team, but you made me hate all your stupid movie. If anyone could give a good story, please, please give a story to a real movie. And then maybe it won't hurt so much. If only it was like that. ________________________________________  So far the only thing that doesn't work is the acting. The only character that seems to come from the mind of an average person is the bad guy, but he doesn't come off as bad. In fact the movie doesn't even work if you don't take that into account. So we start at the beginning. We don't get to see much of the characters. The rest is all flashbacks. The whole movie feels like someone took one random moment, and just started recreating it. And now we have to sit through this movie while the only people in it are the actors. So it's kind of like a real bad movie. This movie is not good. _________________________  I didn't even finish this movie. I was afraid of being spoiled, and this has gotten worse. The entire time I was watching it, it was so uncomfortable. I have never been more uncomfortable watching a movie. ___________  This movie was a total failure. Why would you waste your time with a movie like that, this is terrible! This is awful! There are so many things that just don't add up about this movie and it makes me uncomfortable every time I watch it. It's just so stupid! ______________  There are so far a number of things that are missing and I can't figure out how this movie could have been made. I didn't watch this movie because I was just watching it to see the performance of the actor who plays the bad guys. The way the director handled the story made it really uncomfortable for me. So the actors did not do much in this movie! The director obviously made it so the movie just kept getting worse and worse. Just really really bad. ___________________________________________________________________  the movie is terrible. the acting is terrible, i mean really bad the movie looks like a terrible remake of

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you've seen it, a positive message is worth more than a negative review.  You're not going to get a lot of great comments for a bad movie, so don't waste your time.  I've watched some bad movies (not bad in the "silly" sense), and I've seen a number of great movies, and I don't think any of them could be characterized as a "great" movie.  It may be true that every once in a while, you get a gem like Citizen Kane or The Godfather, but that's rare, and most of the time they just get you to sit through them.   So, instead of wasting your time on a bad film, you should write a positive review about a good one.  And, again, don't write a negative one, even if it was one of the best films of its time. I have the same rule for my children when they play with their toys.  They shouldn't play with toys that have sharp bits and sharp edges, and they shouldn't try to "tune out" noise, or the voices in their heads.  That's not a good thing for kids.  If you are reading this, I would encourage you to write a review of a great movie for me to read.  What do you think? I'd like to thank the readers for a great year, and for a special thanks to readers for sending in a large number of nominations!  The list of nominees for the  2015 National Awards for Screenwriting  are up, and it is impressive !   I think you are going to see a lot more nominated works next year.   In addition to some films that were nominated from this year, some of the nominees are also from previous years, which is a sign that people really care about this great field.  For example, a lot of the films we've covered this year were nominated this year.  But if you look at last year's list of finalists, you'll see that the "Big 6" (the big studios) are much more competitive than they were last year. That's not always a bad thing.  Sometimes a good film gets ignored or put into the category of "unoriginal."  There were a few movies this year that came out late this year and didn't get nominated for one of those categories.   I'm not saying they were bad, but

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Why? What is the best movie that you've ever seen? Why?  I will never forget that the scene in Gladiator where the gladiator falls off his horse and then he crashes into a lake and a large fish is swimming up to him. I don't remember what kind of fish he was eating, but that was my favorite scene in that movie. I knew right then that I would love this movie, and I still remember that scene every time I watch it. I've seen lots of movies but never one like this. I have always been a sucker for a good epic tale. I'm sure that this movie is going to be as epic as Gladiator was, but there is something about this story that I find to be even better. I can't really put my finger on it, but the plot was so intriguing and I just couldn't put it down. I think that Gladiator really opened my eyes to all of this epic movie stuff that we can all get so excited about. I could watch this movie all day long. I like this movie because it has action, drama, romance, and intrigue. My favorite character was Caesar, and if you haven't already, then you have to watch this film right now.  See what people are saying about this movie on our movie forum!  More about Gladiator:  IMDb Rating: 7.6/10 from 22,569 votes Release: 2005 / Gladiator Genre: Action | Thriller Director: Russell Crowe Stars: Russell Wachowski, Tom Hardy, Liv Tyler  Synopsis: Gladiator is the story of the legendary Roman general and former gladiator, Cassius Dio. As a gladiator in the arena, Dio was responsible for the deaths of his fellow fighters and was banished to a remote prison. When Cassius finds a chance to escape his confinement, he must defeat two deadly assassins who have also escaped.

In fact, I am almost afraid to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ 1.5/5  I don't know where to begin with this one. First off, this movie does a terrible job of telling you how good the movie is. From the opening minutes you are greeted by the familiar "cinematic" theme, then you see an old guy running through the woods with the deer in his arms, then we cut to a little boy getting his first bike at the age of four. This theme is followed with an action scene, which shows us how the heroes train and fight. We finally get to see our main character, James, grow up, and that's where the movie begins to unravel. We know James will become the best rider in the world, but we don't find out what that will look like until the last few minutes. Instead we get a boring montage of random events. One scene is a horse riding video game, another is a movie where James tries to impress his girlfriend, and so on. There is a brief scene of a horse trainer, then an angry father yelling at the young man, and then we see him hit a car and go flying through the air, which isn't a very interesting scene for a movie with no impact. And we are only halfway through the movie, and already we are seeing that "action" is just an excuse for the main character's mom to be in the movie and scream at the screen every couple of minutes. The movie just starts getting bad pretty quickly, and it is obvious that there is a long way to go.  2/5 (bad movie)  1.5 out of 5  Advertisements

This film is good! - August 10, 2005Best movie of the year  Reviewer: pixomofo - favorite favorite favorite - February 11, 2005  Subject: My review I will not make this a general review but as a reviewer who has seen a lot of movies this is my favorite movie so far. I think the acting is great, the acting in this movie was more intense and believable than other movies I've seen, but then I think some people were watching it with the knowledge that they are going to see a war film or a thriller. Also the story is more complex, a lot more than it seems at first glance.  The music and special effects are great, but it is not the best music ever, but I was surprised with how well it works in the movie, but there were a few times that I was wondering what the director was up to. The action scenes are very well filmed, you can see the camera moves and things are very realistic. , but the acting was pretty bad, there were many characters with the same face, and you could see they were the same person from a certain angle. If you can take your mind of that you will enjoy this movie, if not then just skip it and go see something else. The story was told in the first person, the first time I saw this I couldn't understand it, but now I understand it much better.  I think that this is a very good film, the action scenes were well done, the writing was good, and the acting, while a little weak, was believable. - February 18, 2005My review  Rating: 5 out of 5 stars

It's not "Fiction" by any means but it's also not fiction, even though it's about a book. This is also the first book in the trilogy, so if you're looking for the second book in that trilogy, this isn't it. But, there's something very good going on here with this first novel. I really like this book and have recommended it to several people. I'm giving it a starred review and it has been a huge hit with my friend as well as our family and friends. I can't wait for the next book in this trilogy. I give it a five-star review.   This book is a short but fun read and I think it would be great to give as a gift. I had a great time reading it and can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like it. I think if you like fantasy books with a strong theme that can be explored by all types of people, this would be an enjoyable read. It might not be a book for everyone but I think everyone will enjoy it. The main character, Sam, is interesting, but I wish I could have gotten more of his relationship with the other women in his life.   of note: I really think that there is a lot more to the story in this one and if you get into it, I think you'll enjoy it!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. I'm not really sure why, but movies are often rated by the critics, and by that standard, Guardians of the Galaxy was a solid 4 out of 10. But, like any movie that's really good, there's room for improvement.  So here's some positive feedback about Guardians of The Galaxy: The Telltale Series:  I'm glad I watched Guardians of #theTellTaleWorlds.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________  A woman is a victim of a car accident and she is in need of a kidney transplant. She is married, but it doesn't seem to have worked out so well, since she is divorced. She lives in an apartment, and her husband has not come to help out. She has not been to church in a long time and she thinks about a new career. She goes to the bank and gets a job as a cashier in a grocery store. She does her job very well. One day she is called over to a man to help him out, he is her next door neighbor and has been her employer for a long period. She gets to know him quite well and she even finds out his name. After several weeks, she finds out he is married. She knows she has to do something about him because she doesn't want him to hurt her. One night she goes to his house and he is already asleep. She decides she is going to make him a good meal. She puts in a special spice in her dish and she starts to eat it. The next morning she comes back and sees the spice on the floor. He is sitting on his bed, not wearing any clothes and there are pieces of what looks like chicken bones everywhere. He tells her, "I ate the food you put on the table." She asks what happened and he says, "You were very nice and nice to me." Then she realizes what has happened. He has been raping her! She runs out of the apartment and calls the police. It turns out she was not the only one who was raped. He also has some of his other neighbors and a few people in his apartment watching him the whole time, but none of them have any information. She writes a letter to the police about what happened, hoping it might make him pay for what he has done. Her letter includes photos and details of the attack. The detective does some investigating and goes to a hotel where he is staying and she shows him her letter. The detectives interrogate him, and it turns out that he is not the rapist. She had done it all herself. She tells the detective that she will do everything she can to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I like it: ____________________ Let me recommend it to others: ___________________________________________________ My verdict: ______________________________ Is this a good film? No. The pacing is just wrong. And it isn't really interesting in the way that other movies with great stories are. However, I still really liked it and I thought it had some very nice ideas. It was a film about the life of a man who grew up in a small town in the middle of nowhere. This is a character who was kind of like a superhero, but a lot of us know that supermen aren't all that real and sometimes, they get a little too close to what people want them to be. This man, played by Jason Miller, does exactly what he's supposed to do. He fights injustice, fights for the little guy, and gives a damn about what is right and what is wrong. This film is very good because it's about a man's life, it's a film where you care for the characters, and it's got great characters who are all believable and you have a lot to root for and admire. Plus, it has a very well-written script that does its best to convey what it is about, and makes us care for all the main characters, even though they are all quite similar to one another in some ways. If you haven't seen it yet, definitely check this one out!

I was totally blown away and I am definitely going to see this again soon. The cinematography and acting was absolutely stunning and the story line was very believable! I love it!" — Jennifer L.  8. The Circle  Year: 2014  Director: Sean Baker  Set in a remote town where everyone has psychic abilities, The Circle is a meditation on the power of connection and the bonds between people. The film is based on the novella by Daniel Polansky, about a community divided between those with psychic powers and those who don't. The novelette centers around a group of people in need, who become "the circle." As the film opens, some of these "circle" members (a woman, a man and a woman and man) are separated after an accident where they fall down a well. The two halves reunite at the edge of town, with one side wanting to help rebuild while the other side wants to remain away, and they decide to work together. The movie tells the story of two main characters: a man called James who is a member of the "circle," and the psychic woman, "Luna." James is a scientist, trying to save her life. After the accident, James decides he needs to use his powers and has to leave her behind. Luna, meanwhile, wants to continue helping James but is scared he might just abandon her. With James gone, the "diamonds" (the other people with psychic abilities) decide to form their own group. This turns out to be a deadly game of "telepathy" that could threaten everyone. The movie has a great story, interesting characters and the visuals are incredible.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The following are all true... A bad movie is one with no good parts... A good movie is like a beautiful girl, when she is not beautiful, her beauty is so pure that it can't be described. It's a secret that you're afraid to tell even if you're happy with her. A mediocre movie is something that, like a woman, has lots of good sides, but none of them are enough to make her worth knowing. ____________________________________________ "You've seen it all in life: you've done it all... You've seen the world and seen a million shows. But a man can never get bored. If you do a million things wrong, you'll be bored with life. So what's life? An endless series of failures!" ____________________________________ "One of the reasons that men have always had such a difficult time with women is that they are afraid to be in the presence of a beautiful woman because they fear that she will judge them. In some ways, they are right... It's like a man with an ugly, fat wife: he fears that she'll say, "Look at this worthless piece of shit." But if he can just ignore his wife and look at the beautiful woman, he will discover that he is indeed beautiful in his own way. " [1] The reason that men are scared to be seen by beautiful women is the same reason that a woman will judge you. The moment you are seen by a beautiful person, your value is reduced. [2] It is because women value beauty so much. A beautiful woman with a beautiful heart is worth infinitely more than an ugly woman with an empty chest. A man's value is based on what he does with his life. A woman's value depends entirely on what other women think of him. _________________________________________________________________ 1. In an interview with the author, I said that men will never be successful with women if they aren't in the company of beautiful women. The reason for that is simple. A human being's physical appearance is the most important factor in determining whether a person is a winner or loser. Even the most unsuccessful person will be happier if he has a wife, a lover, and a good job, than if he is completely without any of those things. 2. I've used the term "man" and "woman" in quotes to indicate that the people in these quotes are of the same species. If there are women of that species that have nothing to say about

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________  A very good movie, with the best performance ever for Bruce Willis.  I really liked this movie. It is about a small town police department and how their lives change when a new sheriff is appointed. He is a tough cop and is the only one in the town who is a cop. He does the best he can with the little help he can get and still maintains his family and his personal life. He has a little trouble keeping his own house in order, but manages to do it. I have to give an extra star for the terrific performance by Bruce Willis, he has an amazingly deep and real voice.  (Posted by The_Duck)  The Best Movie About Cop's that I Have Seen  Wow, I've been a big fan of the police and the "Cop's" of this world since my school days. This is by far the best movie about the police I've seen. It has a very unique and interesting style, and it really is the first film that I will tell my family about when I tell them about my experiences growing up in the 1980's. It certainly is well worth the viewing time. The score by Raul Garcia is superb and really gives the movie a great feel. The cinematography is done very well, and the special effects are great. You will find yourself thinking "Where did this come from?". This film will make your day, and is a must see for all ages! (Posted on 20/07/2013)  a must-see, for anyone who has seen one!  My son loves this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ If you think a movie has a good script and a good director, it will generally get a positive rating (i.e. "good"). If not, the movie will get a negative rating (e.g. "bad"). This is a good way of finding out whether a movie is worth watching. It also helps to get an idea of how much you are actually paying for the movie. Here is an example of how you can go about finding a movie: If I watched one movie from a director whose filmography includes the following, and I don't remember the director's name, I can tell you that the movie has good script, good director (I am not talking about "good" by any means), good cast, and maybe a good story. It does not have anything special about it that makes it worth watching, however. However, if I watched it, it would be a 2/5 in my book, based on that director's entire body of work, which means that I am going to give it a 1/5 on the film scoring scale. I would say to my friend, "I watched 'Good Burger', by Jim Jarmusch." Here are a few common movie scripts: 1) A guy comes to his friend who has a very long list of great ideas on what to do with his life, but one of his ideas is to write a movie about an old dude who works on a farm and has to learn how to ride a horse. The idea is interesting enough, but not the best. He finally decides to write it. The story is good, but it feels like a movie that doesn't belong with the other great ideas in his brain.  2) A young man who has just graduated from a great college, but now wants to go out on his own. He wants to travel to his favorite city. His girlfriend won't let him because of their young age and their distance from her parents. He decides to go, but he is nervous because he has never been to that city. He has decided to write the movie about how he navigates through all of this on his quest to discover and understand a place he has always wanted to visit. The movie starts out great, but as he tells his story, it starts to come apart.  3) A boy who has never played a video game but finds himself at a friend's house who has two Playstation 2 games.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________, you should be able to find it.   The last thing I can do is go on about how bad this movie is.  ....   This film is very well done. It has some great acting and the best characters ever created by a movie director. The actors are so good that they could be the best that have ever done it. However, what it's missing is one of the greatest parts of any movie, the ending. The end just falls flat and doesn't bring it all together in the best way. This has to be one of those movie endings that you never, ever, see the same way again.

I think "Empire" was a bit too overrated.   But it is probably not going to make anyone into a real fan.   is that true? I think it's not.   the fact that they are making a big deal about this movie is an indication that they know they are going to get some kind of reaction out of it.  , the only one of these that I had actually seen, the only movie I ever saw. I just happened to catch the first part of it, the first one of it that the theaters put on atleast that it. I went out to see the "movies" I saw for a reason. It was an eye opener for me to learn about the world of the actors who portrayed those characters. There was some pretty impressive acting and there was some solid direction. I don't know about you guys, but for those who are into historical fiction, this was not the movie for you. The setting of this movie was fantastic and I had a blast with it. The cinematography was beautiful and there were some great special effects. I liked the direction and I liked how it wasn't just going through the motions. It did not feel like an action movie in the sense that you know you are going through all the motions of a typical action movie. I think the story and the way the action was handled was very strong and in my opinion the characters were very interesting and well portrayed. I would have liked to see more of the "nostalgic" part of the movie, which was how they all got along together in the end. There was a pretty big difference between all the characters and I didn't really care who did what. There wasn't really a point to it all. There were some funny scenes between the characters but it wasn a pretty dry affair. The music wasn't the best of the day and there weren't any great special fx either. The story itself was alright but I just thought the ending was a little too rushed and it just didn't seem all that fulfilling in the long run. It was fun for awhile but just not something I was expecting to see for the amount of hype that it got. The stars did not align for me

The Internet can save you a lot of time and make you want to go back and watch the movie again. But, it can also hurt you in the long run. Here are six things to remember before clicking "Play." The Internet is a place for both comedy and tragedy. Here's how to pick the right one. Video of the Day  1. Don't just watch the trailer. Read the movie's tagline first. If a movie has a title that makes you cringe, skip it entirely. You can tell if a movie is trying too hard to be funny by what it's not saying. A funny movie can still be a horrible movie.  2. Find your audience. A lot of people like comedies. But if you're trying to get people to laugh at a movie you're going to need to appeal to their darker side. Go for a movie that has some kind of message. You could also check out the film's IMDb page. If it's on that list, it's a movie to watch.

I really, REALLY hope so, but the fact that I would make that assumption says a lot about me. I have no idea what the film is about. I do know it's a great, smart, action-packed, and funny movie. I'm not sure where they got the idea for the premise, but I think it works, and it's clever and funny, and I'm just so happy I saw it.  The film opens with a woman being pulled out of a car by three masked men in black suits. They take her out of the car, and then they start throwing guns at her. Her friend is shot and killed. Then they take off running. The woman doesn't get up.  "This is my family." She's crying and confused, just waiting for someone to tell her what's going on. "I'm in a car with three men in masks, and they're throwing guns. I don't know how long I'll be able to stay conscious."  the third man, he looks like this:  But when I saw him I just had to say something. I wanted to scream, but instead I just looked at him. I just took in his eyes, his nose. He looks like an innocent young man, just out on a night out. But it didn't matter to me. If they're trying to kill her, it's not her fault. It's their fault. They're evil people. The only thing the woman could do right now is hope the men would kill each other.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ I was able to watch this film due to its recommendation on a website (a bit like how I watched that movie of the year thing last year). I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I was so impressed by the story and visuals that I kept watching, and as it went on, the film went from good to excellent (I should say this with full acknowledgement of the movie's flaws). The script is very well thought-out and I really liked the fact that it kept making me laugh and chuckle, which I don't often get the chance to do, and when I was done, I was in tears (as in crying on the inside, rather than just crying on my hands). My only problem with the movie is that I felt that the cinematography was not quite up to the same level as that of the previous two movies I've seen from The Conjuring and The Conjurer 2. If they had just gotten rid of the camera as a main character, and had a much smaller budget, I think this movie would have been a masterpiece. A lot of the shots were quite detailed, but in the last third, when we see the real house, they just all seemed to be of the same quality. As much as I loved the film, the ending really left me wanting more. ______________________________________________________________________ I watched this movie on my birthday and I'm very pleased I did! It's not the movie of this year but it's a very solid film, and I've enjoyed it much more than I've previously, but the ending left me in a bit of a dark mood, so I'm not sure if I will be returning to the movie or not. This isn't the most enjoyable movie of 2014 by any means, but this wasn't a bad movie, and it did make me smile while I watched it. The Conjure 2 is a better movie overall (although not in the same fashion as this movie). I'm sure it is a very good film to watch in its entirety on the big screen, but if you are a fan of the first film (in which you will definitely see a good amount of spoilers), this movie will probably be disappointing for you. If you can get past the first couple of minutes of the film because of how it will make you feel about the film you're going to watch, you will have a much better time. _____________________________________ A little about me and my interests: ___________________________________________ I enjoy

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. I will be delighted if you share it.  I was lucky enough to be invited to a screening of the new comedy, The Girlfriend Experience, directed by Jason Bateman. I can't recommend it highly enough for people who are looking for some laughs and a nice little time. A little girl is taken from her parents at an early age (I'm guessing to be kept from the abuse she suffers at the hands of her abusive father) to live with an elderly woman. As I mentioned in my previous review of the movie, the film is an old-school kind of comedy. It's got a lot of great gags and, as I said, the script is just great. And there's one particular scene that sticks in my mind. In one scene, the girl, played by a lovely young actress in a red leather minidress, is trying on a dress in a dressing room. At one point, she comes to a stop on her chair while the director is putting her in her clothes. She looks up and looks at the director, who just smiles and says "Good luck". She then gets up and goes off and does her thing. The director is right. Good luck is what she is going to get.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ What I love about good movies is that they're different each time you watch them. This movie isn't that. This isn't an exact copy of any other movie I've seen. This is its own movie. So far, so good. But it's definitely not a movie that I can say I'm going to come back to every time I want to see something a little different. In fact, I'll probably give this movie three stars and go away disappointed, because it seems like it would be a great movie to watch in a small theater on a quiet night and with friends, but it's too slow-moving and too slow to be good. You need to leave early and have a drink with a friend. It's a good thing I've been out of the house for the last year or two; otherwise, I'd be out looking for something different.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________  If you have been paying attention to the movie industry, you'll notice something. The movies that make it to the big screen are almost always the same, over and over, and most are basically the same. I am going to tell you, however, why I think that the most important thing we have to think about when we go to the movies is how we will feel afterwards. So, let's get started.  How Do You Write A Movie Review?  Well, if you're going to be reviewing movies, you may as well get something done right. Here are some general guidelines:  Write about the film in its entirety. You've probably heard me say this, but this is the most useful thing to tell your viewers about a movie. They're going through the movie expecting a review, but if you give them everything you know about the movie so far, they'll be ready for a little more. If you start with the big picture, they're in for a treat.  a lot of movie reviews are pretty boring; I think it is important to keep your audience engaged, so don't skimp on this.  (and just for kicks, here's an excerpt from one of my previous movie reviews.)  The Best Movie Reviews  My first film review was in 1999 when I reviewed the John Carpenter flick "It". I had seen it three times that year; two of those I saw in theater, one in a VHS and the other on video, which I watched in my car. By this point, it was clear that the movie had something unique about it; it had all the trappings of the classic sci-fi/horror movies I loved, but at the same time, it had more of a dark, violent edge. And when I found out that John Carpenter was a fan of science fiction, I was curious as to why he would choose to make such an original film. ...And here it is, the movie I'd always wanted to see. (It's no coincidence that this review is written in the second person, since I wrote it over four years ago.)  the ending, for the second time in the movie. When the movie was announced in 1999, it would be directed by Rob Bottin, who also had a hand in such films as "The Beast of Hollow Mountain" and "The Thing from Another World." The movie had been in production for a year already

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I watched this movie for the first time last night and I have never been so happy and so relieved that a movie even exists."  -Bobby "My kids and I went to see it last night, and it was great! The kids enjoyed it! Great kids movie!"  —Dale "We enjoyed the film and wanted to show it to our grandkids. They enjoyed it too. We think it's a great movie and that it will be on their lists for years to come." _____________________ "The movie was great, very funny, good storyline and interesting characters." _________ "Great movies have the power to make you laugh so hard you feel like you have to tell everyone!" _______________ I think the best movies are ones that are true to themselves.  If you've ever read a book and found yourself with the urge to rewrite it and make it your own, then this film does that in spades.  The characters are so relatable.  When people get caught up in a movie, they lose sight of their own lives and just follow what the heroes do.   If the movie is not for you, then you can also find a movie that you can relate to.  What movie did you see that really made you laugh?  How many people did you talk to who had a similar reaction to that movie?  To get to the bottom of what makes a good or bad movie, let's talk a little about a little movie. One of the most popular "movie" series in the United States is The Twilight Zone.  It's like a combination of Star Trek, Monty Python, and Indiana Jones.  Created by Rod Serling, the show was originally set in the early 1950s, and focused on the adventures of a small team of astronauts on a mission to find an ancient star.  The crew had to overcome a variety of strange situations, including alien encounters, time travel, and a nuclear war.  Many of the episodes feature memorable characters, from "Space Mutiny", to "Time Enough at Last", and "Eggers, I'm Home!". This movie is similar, with a team of characters who get trapped in a world full of evil forces, from the bad guys to the corrupt leaders, all to achieve a mysterious objective that leads to the ultimate victory. But instead of time travel and space aliens, this movie is about the problems that come from

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  I'd like to write a positive article about _____________. I'd like you to help me out by answering the following questions:  Does the movie have a strong story, strong characters, and good dialogue?  What are the main themes of the movie and how they relate to the ending?  "The Great Escape" is the perfect example of this: it's about a man's obsession with a woman he can't have, who won't leave him, and who's too scared to leave him. "Life is for the living" is a good summary of the ending of the film as well.  Is the film well directed?  The movie is very well made and has a great script, but I can't say I've seen a better film.  is the movie well directed? The movie has a strong plot and very good direction, but to be honest I haven't seen a more well-directed movie. The movie's style of storytelling is very interesting, and the cinematography and editing are outstanding.  with a good story and an excellent director, it is easy to see why this is a very well-regarded film. If you like good dramatic movies or you think you might enjoy one, I'd recommend "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou".  The film has a very good plot, but it's so well written that it's hard to describe. It's so difficult to express what the story is about without spoilers, but this is about a guy named Sam (Hugh Jackman) who finds himself stuck on a beach, on an island that has no land in it. On this island, there's a woman named Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), who is an alcoholic, and is hiding from the police. When she does get arrested, Sam helps her escape to England, where she lives with her boyfriend. She lives there with the idea that Sam will come and rescue her in the morning. When Sam shows up in England, he finds out that Lucy has become a drug addict, has a child who is addicted to heroin, and her baby's life is in danger because the drug dealers are stealing from her. The story of this movie is actually quite complex, so I won't try to describe it in detail. If this movie were a book, I think the reader would really be able to describe the story, and I believe it's a story about a family coming together. It is

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "the actors are all good, the story is good." "I enjoyed this movie very much." "If you like action films and want to see someone get hurt, this is the movie for you." "The only thing I would like to have changed is to have had someone shoot the bad guy first. This movie makes me want to be a bad guy." 6. I didn't like it: "I'm a little disappointed by the fact that there was no fight or violence in this movie. I know it was a big hit but it was missing that." "It didn't leave a big impression on me. There were a few things I thought could be improved on but they were all minor. It was ok. I'd give it four stars." "Didn't have a lot of impact on me." "This was a very forgettable action film." "Too slow, too slow, I couldn't believe it." "Not much fight, not much impact, not enough blood." "In the end, not a memorable film." 5. I liked it:  "There are some really cool set pieces in this film, and it really had a sense of spectacle and action which you don't see enough these days in this genre." "There's a lot going on. There's a scene where someone is killed and they pull a gun out and start firing. The body falls on the ground and a little girl gets up and starts running. She goes in a very dangerous area and the bad guys start chasing her. It really did have a sense that they were in the movie and the actors were really having fun." "A nice touch is when a guy says that the bad person killed the girl is now going to pay for what she did to that poor boy. You can almost see the audience go 'wow' and 'oh my God.'" "It's a very interesting story and they really did a nice job." "Wow, this movie was good."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________  "Cannibal Holocaust" is not an overly violent film. It has a good mixture of violence and horror, and even a few tender moments. However, it is not a great movie. It is just decent. It can be a fun watch, but there are no standout parts in the film.  The story centers on an evil doctor who uses his patients as hosts for his monsters. His victims come back to life, often mutilated or covered in strange scars. It also features a woman who tries to help these unfortunate souls, as she tries to understand what happened to them in their past lives. . "The Witch"  .   "Witch" is a horror movie with a story, but it is more of an origin story for the main character. It centers around a couple that was cursed when their baby was born with an ability to see into the future. The movie is pretty scary and has a few scenes of blood. The ending scene is really creepy as it shows a demon with one of the kids in its mouth. Overall, this movie is not too great but it has some great moments.  at the end, the characters have a lot of trouble dealing with their ability to read the future, as they go through several other problems in life that they never experienced before. It will not be for everyone, but if you are looking for a horror/sci-fi movie, "The Witch"(2004) is definitely worth checking out.  the movie is rated PG-13  This is a great horror movie, and it will not scare you too much. The acting is great, and the cinematography is superb.  in this movie, they show how the witch, or the witch's baby, is born with a magical power. In the beginning of the movie, we see that this ability seems to be in her genes. It could be related to a strange disease, but they don't know how it got into her. When she goes to visit her friends for the first time, a curse is cast on her. After that, she is doomed to a life of constant misery. I really like how they made this movie. They make it seem realistic and real, even if it is really weird. There are some weird creatures in the movie that I really enjoyed seeing. Also, this is the first movie where I actually got scared. Even though the movie has a very similar plot, the special effects

Write a positive critique of a good film: _______. Write bad critique of an average film: __. If you have a specific rating to assign a movie, give it a number. The rating is arbitrary and can be anything from 1 to 5. The ratings that are assigned to movies are very important. You cannot rate a film unless you know something about it, and the rating is the key to a movie's success or failure. I don't know how to rate movies; I just know that the rating system is useful. I have the rating I used when I first watched "An American Tail," in the late 1950's: I liked it, but not much. I rate the films in a sequence that goes from 1 (the worst) to 5 (the best). I also use my rating for other kinds of ratings, such as whether a movie is interesting. A rating is like a stamp that a person can stick on something. If I wanted to buy something, I could put my stamp on it. The stamp doesn't mean that I like it as much as the person who made the stamp; the stamp just says that I wanted it. I can give the stamp to somebody, but I can also destroy it. This is how I judge the quality of a film. A "4" is good. A movie that is "4," as it is usually written, is a film with very few good points and a lot of bad points. Most movies get a rating of 1-2. If a movie has more than 2 good points, then it is an average. For example, the worst movie I have seen recently was "Killer Joe," but it was also a 2. It had a lot bad points, and most of them were in the third act. I never liked that third act of any film, because it tends to drag. If there is a scene where an interesting character is talking about his past, and you could not understand it, then that scene is not exciting enough. If all your points are negative, then you are making a bad film. When a movie does not have a good third act, it is not a good picture. If the movie has a good first act and a bad third act (as "Killing Them Softly" does), then it probably does not deserve to be called a film at all. I

Bishop and Gilmours band, was the most influential in the history of the blues. Gilmourns' is very closely associated with the "Dark Stars".   One of the most important players to have come out of the psychedelic movement was Jack DeJohnette. He was the first person to come up with a chord progression that used the 7th of the chord. It is a very simple, but powerful chord. This chord progression was so important in the development of rock and roll that you will find it in many of the songs we play today.  "I was never interested in learning theory and I didn't play any songs in any major key," he said in an interview in 1970. "I never thought I was going to learn the theory. I just wanted to play music and it happened that way."  Jack also studied some of the music of his idol, the early Beatles. He studied with George Harrison on the Beatles' song, "I Saw Her Standing There".   the same chords used for The Beatles "A Hard Day's Night"  and "I Am the Walrus"   of the chords used in "The Dark Star"

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. You're going to have to read these by the hundreds and read them out loud. That said, just because I want to write one, doesn't mean I have to. If it has an opening line, I will write a sentence, and if it's a short story, I'll write a paragraph. If I can't think of an opening, a line, or a sentence by the time I'm done, I'm outta here. It's just as good for me to look at a movie and say "I wish it had a better ending." If it doesn't have a good ending, I can still be a good writer. In fact, my ending of "The Room" has nothing to do with the ending of The Room. That's just the way it went down. If you don't want to listen to the thousands of other people out there say "Aha, I knew it!" I can say "Look, I went to the theater, I paid my money, and I've just sat through two hours of a movie that sucked."  I'll get you fired: _____. Just kidding. You probably won't get fired.  How to write a novel: _______. If writing a novel is so hard, maybe you should take your time and wait until you've written one before you do it. I don't have to write more than one novel before I can write a second. I just have to start with a novel idea and write one scene and then move onto the next scene until I've written all of the first novel's pages. Then I write the rest of the novel.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I wrote a negative review about " The Secret of Kells," but I read your other review ( " The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey ") and I believe it to be the only good review for this movie and I think that it explains everything so well. I also thought about writing my own review but decided to wait and see what the film's fans would write instead, and to my surprise, the people who are already familiar with Tolkien and this movie were very positive. I was very surprised, too, to find out that almost all the critics who were negative wrote from an emotional or religious perspective, which is quite different from me. And they said that this movie was better than the book! I have to say that I thought that this would happen but when I was reading the reviews I did not expect the opposite. And then I saw the movie, and I was quite surprised by its quality, too. It's an interesting movie, a really good adaptation of "The Lord of the Rings." I thought it would be something that would be more like a big-screen movie but it is not. It is a wonderful movie that is a great departure from the book. It has a very beautiful soundtrack. It really is a movie of such quality. It would have been a pity to keep it at the price of $22 million, but it should be seen at the cinema. If you want to know what the movie is about, you can see it on the big screen. If I am not mistaken, this movie is also the most expensive film of this century. I don't know how much more I can write about it, so I'll stop here. - Mark Olsen (U.K.)   Last edited by Mark Olsen on Tue Oct 08, 2006 11:37 pm; edited 1 time in total

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight is the best movie I've ever seen, in any genre. I am still getting used to the new Nolan movies. I have not seen them yet. They are not quite as good as the previous ones but still very good. You can't really compare them to previous movies that you've seen like The Dark Knight, but they do keep up the great quality and are worth the money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  the less you like a movie, the more likely you are to like it if you read about it online. If you are a writer and have read my blog, I bet you know that I always try to be critical of my own work, but if I was going to judge a movie before it was released, it would be the one with a lot of negative reviews.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I used to write reviews on this site. But as the site went from being a site for sharing films to a place for sharing movies, the reviews have gotten less and less positive. And I don't just mean the reviews for movies that have bad reviews; the reviews I'm referring to is the reviews of movies that are universally regarded as bad. And it's because of this negative perception that there are still a lot of people who have no idea that movies aren't as good as they're given credit for, so I'm here to try to dispel some of that misinformation. So to start, I'm going to go ahead and give you a disclaimer: This isn't a review of the movies in question, or of any particular director, actor or star. It's just me sharing my opinion on what some movies are like, and how that might reflect on other people. Why do people hate bad movies so much? I'm not sure, but I have a few theories. The first thing that comes to mind is that it seems like people just want to go somewhere they think will be safe, without having to think too much. The only safe place for them is on their couch watching something that doesn't have to worry about them. And since the majority of people in the U.S. watch movies on their TVs, there's really no safe place in the United States for a film to be screened. There are, however, still a few movie theaters that have some sort of special screening for certain films. And sometimes those theaters are more than happy to host a movie for their general public, especially if it's one that is critically acclaimed. That's a little bit like going to a party, you know, and someone is hosting a huge house party and inviting everyone to come down and watch a giant firework show; you know that there's going to be a bunch of people there. So, the party's been called out, and you want to see something different. The same thing goes for movie theaters. The more people who show up, the more money the theater will make. People have found a way to make the money back, they're just going to do it in different ways. But for some people, that's just not enough. There's the idea that bad movies don't belong in a theater, period. They're a distraction, and no good movie can be enjoyed by someone who has a bad movie hanging over their head. But that's

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ If you think this review is useful to others, please donate to help me make my first feature film: _________________  The "Hair" was a short film, that I shot in three days in 2011 while in a very dark state of mind and with an extremely small budget. The film, which had a cast of six, is a meditation on life, death and rebirth.  I've always had a fascination with this film, both in the form it came from and the work of it's creator, John Waters. The movie, which was directed by myself, was shot on 16mm, as I am a big fan of the format, but was finished on 35mm. The picture looks great, but if I had to describe the feeling of this short film it would be an "intermediate" one, like a cross between a dream and an art film.    After a couple of days of shooting, I had my "first feature", with a little bit of editing, but only enough time to shoot the title sequence, the "Horse", the "Fruit" and "Shoe".  In that first couple of hours, I was in a state of shock, as the mood I was trying to convey was one of chaos, confusion and insanity.  the film starts by introducing a character named "Dylan," (played by my friend, Richard) who, being a former member of the Army, has been discharged. He travels to New York, to visit his brother, who is married to a wealthy woman, the so-called "Aunt."  We then follow Dylan and his brother in their day-to-day lives, as they go to work, shop, visit friends and family, travel, drink wine, and occasionally smoke a joint. On one particularly busy day, the brother and Dylan go to see a friend of theirs, a "Bond girl", who has been cast by a film producer for a part in a TV movie.  in the meantime, we follow the main character of the film, "Fiona," (who plays a girl named "A" in the short film) who goes about her daily routine, as she is trying to get "a job", and tries to escape the boredom and anger that has been brewing in her.  of course, the main focus of the short is not on "F" or her daily life, but on the character "F", who

He starts his life from the bottom, his father is a truck driver and is unable to give him anything, the family doesn't have anything, no money, no education... He starts the day and starts going down the street. He goes to his first job, at a diner... he meets a girl there, they fall in love and it seems like things are starting to look up. Then he meets some more girls and the whole world starts changing around him. He tries to escape to the city, but it's a nightmare trying to find a place where he can start anew. He runs into a stranger, who is also lost, in the streets. That was a couple of days ago. In the last few days, all his memory came back, he had no idea who he was, his name, or even his own name... He had lost everything. He was alone. Everything. It took him days to find another job, to find his place, to look for food, to even find a way to survive, to make some money to start a life that he can't remember.  The first thing to understand about this movie is that, it is not about a man's life. I think that the best way to get this across is to show you what a terrible life it is, so you can better understand how hard a man has to live. The movie starts with the man trying to save money to buy food, just to survive. The girl in his life was just a memory and he didn't even know if she was even real. And the man would try to escape the city just to find somewhere to start again. The best part of the movie is when the woman is raped and murdered. The film also shows how the world around him is changing, from the very beginning. The first sign that the world is going downhill is the murder

It was always on the top of my list for a horror movie that would make my parents watch it. It wasn't until I found some old VHS tapes that I finally saw the film in it's entirety. It's one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. The pacing was just perfect, the violence was realistic and the characters just made you want to cry when they were killed. If you are looking for a fun, gore-filled Halloween flick, then this is definitely worth checking out.   (Note: The clip I posted of the end of the film was from a different source. I've included a link to the clip I've posted.)   _________________   The "Goblin" is an American horror film directed by Stephen King, based on the novel by H.P. Lovecraft. It is a remake of the 1930 film titled The Haunting In Connecticut, written by Oscar Hammerstein II. The plot of the original film was based on a short story by Lovecraft called "The Horror At Red Hook". The film opens with a black and white picture (possibly taken during the early 1900s) of a man in a black suit walking towards a house. The man is carrying a gun and talking to a man and a woman in the foreground.The two figures in the house are tied up and the woman is screaming. He walks into the house and we see that it is a small home and a man is bound in the basement. The masked figure then kills the man with a knife and walks into a bedroom. As he enters the bedroom he takes the woman with him and she is bleeding from her head. He proceeds to rape the woman, cutting her throat and mutilating her. The black and White picture was probably taken in Brooklyn sometime in the late 19th century. He then comes into the main living room where we see the woman lying on the couch. She is dead.The man then picks up the woman's hand and walks outside where we can see several cars and a truck in the yard.The following day the woman and her mother leave town on their motorcycle. The mother falls from the bike and the mother's friend is killed by the man. They have a hard time of
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do not write about bad movies, or negative things, or anything that you feel you can't stand. It will be taken down and that can ruin the movie for you. If it's your first time reviewing a movie, make sure you're watching from the beginning and that you're not re-watching anything that has already been reviewed. If you really like a movie that you've reviewed, send the link back. If the review is about a movie you liked, or one you really hate, give it a thumbs-up, but it's not necessary. _____________ If you find yourself writing an article about a bad movie, stop right now. _____  If you find a good review, go back to that review and update it. It doesn't have to be the best review you've ever written, or the one with the most words, it just has to be a good one. ____  A great movie is not only an entertaining film, but a fun movie. The movie is good because it is enjoyable, but more than that, it is memorable. The more well-known a movie is, the more memorable it is. In my opinion, the best way to make sure a movie has a great movie-going experience is to go to the theater with a group. If there are lots of other people in the theater watching the movie, and you're sitting by yourself, the movie may not be that memorable. When the movie is sitting with you, it's more memorable because it has the ability to connect with your mind. The longer you watch the movie with others, the better. _____________________ I want to try and remember a movie I watched last night.

Not to mention, they're all sequels to some of the better movies of the last 30 years. They always had great actors, a solid story and an original premise, yet the films just never struck my interest. The new one, though, has a great cast, the plot is interesting, and the cinematography is fantastic, so I'm definitely looking forward to seeing this one when it's released!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ If you see it in a theater, write a review for a theater that played the movie. If you are a reviewer for a newspaper, write to your editor and say something about it that you liked. The best way to know if people like your review is to give them a chance to read it, then do a follow-up review. But don't worry too much about the follow-ups because they won't make much difference. The one way to make a difference is to write a better review than everyone else's.  3. Write a review that is a complete reversal of your original opinion. If your review contains a lot of your previous opinion about the movie, make it a full reversal. If it's a review of a movie that people know very little about, write about the film in some detail about the important things about it. Do the reverse of the review in the beginning of your new review, then continue reversing it the rest of the way. ,  4. Do not use your own words to praise the movie's producer, director, or actors. Write about someone else who has a better relationship with the people behind the movie than you. If a writer has their own movie to review, but has no connection with the director or the producers, then write about someone who has that connection, such as a fan, an actor, a critic, or a member of the production crew. .  "A good movie is like a good meal. It tastes great once you've had it. This review is just a taste of my meal, so enjoy it while it lasts. "   . This quote is from a reviewer who had a good relationship with producer. The quote is very helpful to write about if you want to praise a producer. The writer, David Gerrold, writes, "A great film is like the sound of water falling on your tongue. You know, the taste of your favorite food, the feeling of satisfaction that comes with eating a delicious meal, the bliss you feel after a great day at work or school. The taste of a great film may be a thousand times better than the taste that hits you when you take the first bite of food. It is an indescribable feeling, like a wave in a calm ocean." The writer is talking about his review of the film, but you can use the same principles to praise an actor or director. "A great actor or a great director makes

A young explorer and his faithful dog, Buddy, find themselves on a mysterious island populated by mysterious beings, where they stumble across an ancient treasure with the ability to re-shape the landscape.

The Devil Will Return Again…and again, and again  With this film, it seems as if Scott Derrickon is going to keep the "Buddy" theme that he has used in The Devil with a Blood Red Rose movie. There were a few similarities in the plot between the films, with a "Baker family" that was being controlled by a group of vampires, but Derricksone seems to have done a good job on this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ My rating: ***** Out of four stars, one was for the director, one for the film, one just because I thought it was a really good movie, and one was because I found the ending to be a bit rushed. ____________________________________________________________________ The plot: After being a high school boy for a little while, we get to see Michael Keaton in a rather unique way for a man of his age. He plays a very normal, average looking guy and does what any teenage boy would do: he gets into girls' pants. Of course, his efforts aren't to be successful so easily. ______________________________ Plot: (8/10) The plot is very good, if you can ignore the ridiculous character development, which is just for the sake of character development and for the sole purpose of getting Michael Keatinge's character into a few girls. There was some decent jokes, but not many that were funny. The comedy did get better as it progressed. The story was very well done and very original. A nice touch of humor is found throughout. ____________________ Story: (10/10, good for the most part, some funny bits of the plot that may be lost on viewers) The story is quite good as it focuses on one group of friends: a group of high school kids in a group home. Michael Keato is the main character, and is the one who is put in the group home to get him out of the streets. Michael has been acting really weird in public lately, and his strange behaviour seems to be getting a bit worse, but he doesn't know what's making him act the way he does. He's also in the care of his father (Don Keaton, whom is played by one of the actors from the film). When Michael's father starts being a bit creepy about Michael's whereabouts, his friends and family have to take things into their own hands. The only problem is that the group of people who are responsible for taking care of the group house isn't what they seem at first sight, and they have plans for Michael that could very well put him in grave danger. The plot of the film is very simple, but it really adds to the movie. It's really interesting to see how Michael reacts to what's happening and just how far his friends go in protecting him. The film does have a little bit of a slow pace in certain scenes, but I still found it very entertaining. ______________________________________ Visuals:
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not my job to say, "That was good! Good for the genre!" and then say that they should have done a bad movie. That's why my job isn't just to write good reviews, it's also to write funny reviews. So, I was glad to have gotten a chance to talk with John Powers, the writer of 'The Martian.' We met at the Chicago Film Festival, which is one of my favorite events of the year. I met many of my best friends there. We also got to discuss the movie with Michael Schaefer of Movieweb and Ben Affleck. Now, John Powers isn't someone you're going to see in the "good" box office, if you are looking for that, the last four or five years he has only gotten one feature film out of six that he's worked on, 'The Last Days of Disco.' That movie grossed less than $1 million worldwide. 'The Muppets' was another one of his films, which also didn't do well. So I figured we'd hit a good time. John Powers, did you have any advice for me for reviewing this movie? No, not really. I was just like you, not that I didn't want to give you advice. I would say though, it would be good to get some advice. It doesn't help the review, but I think it is good to do it, it could make you think. You don't like the movie? 'The End of Evangelion' was the best thing I've ever seen. I didn't think it was as good as 'The Farthest.' That's the one that's the highest budget, it is made by one of the big Hollywood studios, and they made 'The Alien' too. So that is a good film, it has some nice action and it isn't a'monster movie,' it isn?t one of those'monster movies.' 'The Space Monster' is more in that camp. 'The Martian' is a very different story, it wasn't made by the big studios. The people who made the movie, like the director Ridley Scott, are very much involved in the making of the film, they are the film people, the movie people, and Ridley is one who understands that. I don't think that they made it just to make some money, or because they have a big budget to make it, they really care about

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ How would you rate this film?: ____________ How would have I made it better?: _________________ What didn't work/Why didn't it work?: _________________________________________________ Are there any other movie reviews here:  There are a couple of movies on IMDb with a title which contains a word that's common in the English language. The word is spelled out. For example, in "Fault", the movie is called "Foolproof". It means "completely foolproof". "Falling Down" is titled "Fell Down", because the movie took place on a road with an "F". "Rotten" is the title of the movie, because the producers didn't want to put "R" in front of "Ridiculous", so the title "Ran" was used instead. For this reason, many of the movies with this title on IMDB don't have any movie information. I guess that they want the title to remain a mystery, like how many times a year the word "Ruthless" appears in the title (usually in reference to a character who has ruthlessly killed a person). The IMDb doesn't show the full title of these movies on their front page, but they do have a link at the bottom which allows you to see the full movie title, along with the director, the writer, and the actors that were in the movie.   If you search for movies with "Rant" in their title, you'll get a lot of links to films that are about the movie you searched for. The IMDB does this so that you can easily find movies that you don't know much about, which may give you a better idea of how the movie was made.     The first movie on IMDb with a subtitle containing the word RANT was "S.F.S.P." This movie is not an official sequel to "The Terminator" (in the same year), so that's why it's not listed as an official movie. The movie "Serenity" (from the year 1999) is a good example of a movie that is a sequel, but it also isn't an official film. In this movie, Firefly (from 2006), the crew of the Serenity (from 2009) fight the aliens that attacked them during the first movie, "Flesh and Bone" (the first film). The movie in this list has the full subtitle for "S
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1958) The Good:  There's an old saying, "The film isn't a reflection of what's on the screen, it's the screen itself." Well, this is a great example of this. The Good is a well-crafted movie with terrific acting, a beautiful story, and an overall sense of good vs. evil.  The main character has to deal with his wife's suicide and the people who surround him (including his old friend) who want him to turn his back on the world and turn his guns on the people responsible for his wife killing herself.    This film isn.t a simple "good vs. bad" movie, it is more of a "good" vs. "evil" movie.  In this film we see the "good side" and the "bad side" of the characters.  The Bad:  We see a movie about suicide, a movie that tells the story of a man who is going through some very difficult times, and a movie where the lead character is a very sympathetic character.  We also see a scene of a gun being pointed at a person's head while he's in the shower (I'm sure this has nothing to do with any of the movie's plot), and we also see two characters in the movie who have a hard time relating to one another.  The Bad is a movie with an "us vs. them" theme.  It is also the most violent movie of all time and possibly the most sexist movie. The Ugly:   There is no denying that The Ugly is a beautiful movie and the visual effects are spectacular.  There is also some very intense violence throughout the film, including some scenes of torture.  To me, The Uglies is just too "dirty" and "dirty to be good."   The Ugliest is not a good film, but it is definitely a beautiful film.  Also, a few scenes of graphic violence have been used in the movies to create suspense.  What do you think about this film?

The first scene was a woman taking care of her daughter in a bathtub. When the mother got out of the tub, there were 3 other women in the same room. The mother was in her underwear. The three other women looked at her, and smiled at her. It was a funny scene, because it was a mother talking to her three other daughters in a strange bed. But it made me sick. What a disgusting world we live in."  4. "If you are not going to be bothered with a movie, then the next best thing is to take a nap."  and...

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________ It's not easy being a movie star. You have to have a lot of friends, and not all of them have to be big-name stars. And your agent and the studio, which is the producer, want you to get out in front, and that's hard on your schedule and your relationships with your friends. But after all, if you're going to be a star, you might as well get it right the first time, right? You can't be a good actor if you can't act.

No doubt about it. The film does a great job of focusing on the characters themselves and all the incredible scenes that we get to see. It's also a very well made film. It has some good acting, and some very great acting. And then of course there's the cinematography. I think if you've never seen a film that has this amount of care put into the visuals, and really goes to the depths that this film does, then you really need to see it. If you watch this and you haven't seen any of the other films in the series before, you should check that out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  -4.9% of ratings The reviews are in and all of the "hits" are positive.  The bad reviews?  They're not positive at all. Â The top two movies are rated +4.3%, and the bottom two are +3.2%.  It looks like there are a lot of "hundreds" of positive reviews to choose from.   I have to wonder if the rating systems in China do a very good job of capturing the true "quality" of movies, or if it's all just a bunch of people who like to write down reviews.  We'll do a bit of a comparison, and look at some of the movies that are getting a lot more reviews. -3.3% of reviews for Star Trek Into Darkness are positive, and that number will increase over time.  They're going to have to improve at this. +3.0% of the reviews for Iron Man 3 are positive +2.6% of The Martian is positive -2.5% of Zootopia is positive and that's an amazing number for a movie about an anthropomorphic animal. 3.5 % of reviews (2,200 of 2,200) for The Martian are positive and it will only get better in the coming weeks.  And with that said, the negative reviews will drop off like a rock.  With these movies, you have to be really, really, REALLY into it to be interested in the negative ones.  As always, please remember that the reviews are only for the most recent movie and do not necessarily reflect the overall opinion of the movie going audience.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ _______  A couple weeks ago my wife and I watched the new movie "The Purge". We have seen a lot of movies with some good parts and some horrible ones but this was a very good movie, a new take on the Purge subculture, and very fun to watch. I thought it was funny as I was on the right side of the law but I think it had some serious points. The movie dealt with the aftermath of a group of criminals in LA attempting to rob a Purge event, but the criminals fail because the event was a fake. The criminals do escape, and after that they don't know who to turn to. They take it upon themselves to purge all the people they didn't know they should have saved. I found this movie very funny and I like the idea of the purge. I think the characters in the movie were not as over the top as I expected. I do have some criticism however, because they used a little too much gore, and at times I was uncomfortable. I don't see any good way to deal with the characters being purged, because it is a bad thing to do. They would need to find a way to keep their sanity through a good dose of reality show, and a bit of horror. Maybe if it is like a reality show with real blood, and they don�t look at themselves as evil. But I don�ft see how that would make them a lot less insane. There was also a little bit too much swearing in the dialog, so I found myself wishing they cut that out. I was also disappointed that they did not play a few songs, but I am not sure if that is because of the movie or the movie wanting to play the songs they did play. Overall this was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was not great either. Maybe this is my own personal opinion.

The "Battle" in this case is not the actual battle on the White House grounds, but the battle for the Pentagon itself. The game was developed by Infinity Ward, who also developed "Call of Duty: Black Ops" and "Black Ops II". The game features a 3D version of the Pentagon, and you can walk around the buildings, see the aircraft carrier, and the White house from different angles. The graphics are excellent for this video game, but some glitches remain in the game when moving through the Pentagon.   The Pentagon is a fictional area located in Arlington, Virginia, USA. In the movie, the Pentagon is shown to have a main entrance, a small guard tower, and a large number of guard posts, several buildings, and some roads. The area, which is about 3 miles (5 km) by 2 miles (3 km) in size, is guarded by a large security presence, and is the official location for all international and U.S. military missions.  The fictional building itself is a tall structure consisting of a white spire on top, and two arches, the one at the top is also white in color. The building has a main office, a reception area, and numerous offices inside. The central pillar is located at the north end of the building, which holds a secret elevator shaft. The White House is depicted to be a large structure, which was erected on the south side of the National Mall. The White House, which contains a large lawn, was designed by Norman Rockwell. The lawn

The Matrix is a series of visual and auditory illusions that were created by American author and artist Neo in the year 1999 in his attempt to gain access to an alternate reality where the rules of the world were different. In the movie, the main character, Morpheus, is imprisoned in a computer network by the evil machine that was developed to monitor him. He manages to break free and escapes into the Matrix where he meets other computerized characters such as Zion, Trinity, Morpheme and others. The main goal of the main characters is to find the way out of the machine and return to Earth. One of the most common visual illusions in The Matrix movie is the double. A double is an imaginary representation of one or more objects placed in front of the viewer's vision. In general, the doubles created by the human eye contain two of the same objects (the left and right eye each see a single image) which are perceived by the brain as separate entities, despite their close proximity to each other. The double that is being watched in the movie is one of the characters called Trinity who can be seen as a small blue humanoid figure, a human with green hair and a red-haired human female. The Matrix films was also one of two times where two different artists of different countries used the same image in a single movie. Two

The cinematography is also very good. Overall the film has some good aspects, however the direction is mediocre and it has the makings of a bad movie. The story is weak and I think this is because it is too long. If it had just been 30 minutes, the film could have been much better."   "I think if this is a movie, it should be done on film...the sound is great too, and all in all this is very good!

It's all too short. It would have been good for a lot of reasons if it had been longer, but it is also a story with a lot to it and there was enough time to develop the characters and get to know them in the short time they're on screen.  The music is not great, but I would expect nothing less from the folks who directed it. , I think it is much more than a short film, but is unfortunately a pretty dull film that lacks that final burst of energy to make it worth watching. I thought that the acting was pretty good. There were some moments when the characters seemed to connect on a deeper level. The ending was pretty sad, but maybe I just saw it the wrong way. It was kind of a tearjerker, which I know doesn't fit a film about a zombie apocalypse, but that's what it felt like to me. - I didn't find anything wrong with this film.

I'm so glad to see that people enjoy the movie and the director got such a good response to the movie. I think he should give the movie another chance to get a much better result, to hopefully get a more wide release. I really loved the movie, not only as a fan of the franchise, but as a big fan of science fiction and horror movies as well.   Well done Mr. Hennig on your new movie, there's a whole new wave of bad guys in this movie for fans of the universe as well as new fans of these characters, and it's so enjoyable to see them, with so much going on in the storyline, from the bad guys to the science and the emotions to the overall characters and plot. It really is a good one, I'm a fanboy, and I loved every bit of it. Well done Mr Hennrigon your new release is so enjoyable, I cant wait to see the new DVD with this movie on it, if it comes out. Well, it is a great film, but with so many new things to consider in the new movie it's almost as if it's not part of the saga, just a prequel of sorts, and a lot more about the evil empire that is spreading.Well doneMr. HENNIGon yournew release is ashappensto it's part of, I love the movie as a whole, but I wish there was a bit more in it for the new fans who are coming on board. I just hope that you do the story justice, and you really want it to be a big success in the future.I love it for what it is, a well paced and well thought out film, there are alot of different ideas and plots that work to form the whole story, and although it isn't part of Star Wars as such it's just really awesome to see these guys on the big screen again, in this version of the story they are now the main bad guys.Well, you'll be seeing a lot of the cast all over in the next few years, as more films are in production with these guys, in the coming years,

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   _________________   HERE ARE A BUNCH OF REVIEWS...  A review of this film by the great George S. Kaufman.  The reviews were written by David Duchovny.  it's about a group of people who discover the secret of immortality.   A book review written by George S Kaufman.   the book is called "Unnatural Causes" and it has a nice description of the movie...I was very curious to see this film but my life is a bit weird...so I had a couple of days to kill, and I wanted to see what this was all about!  It was about the most normal thing you can imagine - but what you didn't expect was that the guys at the bar who have been there a long time...they all think the same way and they have all been dying...and this is the first time someone tries to convince them to give up their natural ability.  :)   And so...there are two of them - one is a young man who can't really do anything, but he is good at getting into situations...and one is an old man who has a lot of power, but can't actually do anything to anyone - he's a bad person.   and I loved these two...they were totally believable.   a really great movie, I recommend it to everyone!   :D   the movie is about people that have been dying and...their bodies start to decay, and they start to lose their abilities to live for a while, but in order to stop that they have to find this thing called immortality...and they end up traveling to the other side...and it is there that they meet people who actually do have the power to live forever and that is what they are trying to find out.     I can't say that I really liked the book...I'm not a big fan of sci-fi and I wasn't really able to really get involved with the book, but the book has its ups and downs, and it could probably be a good read for someone who loves science fiction. , but I loved the movie!  , my favorite movie of all time, is another story about a man who discovers something that can make him forever alive...it's really great!  . a really well done film. It's really scary and very well written. I loved all the actors, especially the ones who played the main characters

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I think the best thing about movies, particularly animated films, is the sheer inventiveness of their design. I'll give you an example: in the movie "Aladdin" (1992) there is a sequence at the end of the film where Princess Jasmine goes on a magic carpet ride that takes her to the top of a very tall building. What you're watching is a very expensive special effects scene which takes place in a very large building and in which you could be forgiven for thinking that we are in the inside of the building. However, what you're seeing is just a projection of what you are watching: the projectionist is playing with the film in a room that is not a part of the actual building. The building is invisible! (Yes, there are all these great effects that are used to enhance the image. The problem is that they are so obvious that they can be mistaken for ordinary, everyday images.) ____________________________________ It is very easy to get caught up in the magic of special effects. But special effects are not what make a good picture. Good picture is when you have an interesting story and characters, and the story is compelling, not just because it is "magic". (Although it is very hard to make magic look real. If you try to do that you'll probably fail. Also, the magic tends to be more visible in cartoons than in films.) If the film is too cheap to tell a good story then it is going to fail in my opinion. It is usually not a good idea to shoot on a cheap camera. Sometimes an expensive camera is just an expensive way of making things look more beautiful. (The same can be said of any cheap camera, or any very expensive camera, but not always so.) In my opinion there is really nothing wrong with the way many Disney movies look. I can tell the difference between a good animation and a bad animation pretty easily. You could compare it to comparing a good painting to a mediocre painting. A good painting is beautiful because it draws you into the scene and makes you forget everything you are used in, and everything is seen in a new way. I guess it is a good way to be aware of what makes a good film. When I read about "Alas, Poor Yorick", one of the best Disney films I ever saw, the most disappointing thing about it was the fact that it was made on a very small budget. I was also disappointed because it didn't really show what Disney

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  _________________________________________________  "I went to see a movie recently that was amazing and I came away with a new appreciation for the things I was brought up to believe in. In that movie were three children that, for the most part, were able to overcome their challenges with a little help from their parents. Their love for each other, their willingness to work together to accomplish a common goal, and their ability to overcome the obstacles of everyday life and do something extraordinary were admirable. I didn't feel the need to thank the people that brought me into the world. But when it came to the actors themselves I felt that I owed them my gratitude. It was the same in my previous visit to the local movie theater. They were all so talented that I was overwhelmed by the depth and quality of their work. I am looking forward to going back. In fact, I already have a couple of shows I have booked for this upcoming weekend. I plan on going to the movies twice more this year."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   If you are at all like me, you've had that one movie that you've thought was really great and yet you feel kind of unfulfilled. That's ok! It's alright! I think the reason that you don't feel like you've gotten the most out of your time watching the movie is because you're not really experiencing it, you're just sitting through it because you've already seen it a thousand times. I'm not going to lie to you; movies can be hard to watch. When you're waiting to see a movie, you just kind of feel the same way I feel when I'm waiting for a train (which is, in fact, why I enjoy waiting for trains so much!). Watching a movie feels like it's taking up more time than it needs to and as a result you get kind of frustrated with the movie you're watching, feeling that the movie's a waste of your life's time. However, this isn't a movie review and you haven't gotten your hopes up for this movie.   So what is a movie anyway? A movie is a play, a piece of work or even the expression of a person's opinion. All of these can be great films but when you're talking about a great movie, it has to be good because it tells a story. It makes you think. And you're more likely to like it if it has a story, even if it's just a bunch of words. The film that you're seeing right now has a great story to tell, it is entertaining and it has characters and themes that make it worth experiencing. So here are my thoughts on movies in a nutshell.   and in order of my own experience with the movies I watch   I don't recommend any of the following movies, at all, but they are still great:   The Godfather Part II  The Dark Knight Rises  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  Lolita  Barry Lyndon  Saving Private Ryan   Now that you know the three types of movies, you can read about them here.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  (3) If you can't remember what they were, it can be just about anything. Maybe it's a line from an old movie, a cameo, a joke, something just off the top of your head. Whatever.  _______________________  Cory's Notes:  * "I will always be a 'good girl."  ** "I love you, I love you."  a.m. 's notes:  the "good girl" line is not a joke. I just thought of it, and it fits the theme of the film. If you think of it for a second, it makes perfect sense. The girl doesn't know he's gay, and they just find out and he's like "I have to marry you" or "I'm gonna be your wife." There's a lot of romance in this movie, and this line is like, "The girl in me is saying yes. She's saying yes to me, and that's great!" (I'm not trying to make you think that it's all just a ruse or anything, but a big part of the movie is romance and the girl is like "It's OK to love me. I love the way you make me feel!")  b.m.'s notes: also, this song was on "Shake Ya Ass", the song on the album "The Greatest" which Cory liked more than "I've Got You Under My Skin".  c.m's notes (and the song is awesome too, but I think the girl's line is more relevant to the plot of this film):  I am so sorry I had to go  If I couldn't be with you today  Now I'm gonna live for your memory  The girl, she doesn't care if you were just a boy  She's a girl and she's still a girl  she's so much fun to be with  Even now, when you're gone  Oh, you should've been here  You should've stayed with me  and then we'd be alone  It's all good and right  'Cause now I'm down in this hole  And this is all I can do  A girl I used to know  Can't stand me, can't stand how I act  But she don't care, she don' t care  That I
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ Rating: 7.9/10 From this review: "I do have to say that my husband and I enjoyed this movie quite a lot, and we both agreed that it was one of the best films in the Star Wars series, for both reasons. We have been very disappointed, however, by a certain piece of fan fiction written about this movie. It was a long review, so I'll try to cut it short here: The story has been around for decades, and it is simply untrue. We all know the truth and will not be fooled by these "fan" writers. I am writing this review because this film has been widely misunderstood and its reputation has been tarnished, and the truth must be spoken. This is what I know: In the first draft of the script, there were scenes between Luke and his father, where Luke's father, Ben Kenobi, talks about what a good father he was to his son. When it was decided to reshoot the scenes, Luke had no idea that he was his father's son. We were never meant to be able to see this. The last scene in the film where Luke tells his father of the location of Yavin, is exactly the same one he gives to Obi Wan Kenobi. In the final scene, Han Solo and Chewbacca talk about how Luke is always looking to the past when the question of what the future would be is never addressed. Luke's final words to his father in the final battle were the same ones he gave his uncle before he died in a fire. Finally, I think it is important to mention, that when Luke has that last meeting with Obi Wan in his apartment, Obi Wan's face is completely blacked out! The script was changed and rewrote for every film except Return of the Jedi, and Obi Wan was never meant ever to be the Master of the Knights of Ren. All of the scenes were shot with lightsabers. The light sabers in this film were very different from the light saber that Luke uses in the first film. It has a different look, different size, a different shape, and a new symbol on the hilt. This was a very expensive decision. The only lightsabes that were made for Star Wars were made specifically for the first six movies. These were the special black ones which were used when there was special special effects in the films. The script for Star wars 2 was written by Alan Dean Foster. It is his interpretation of the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A good movie is hard to come by these days, and if you don't have a good recommendation, no one is likely to watch it anyway." 4. It's an excellent example of "The Old Style" This "Old Style" movie, based on a novel by a very obscure author, is one of my favorites. The story of the protagonist is very compelling and you will quickly forget all about your life and enjoy the show. The setting is set in a world where we have a few humans in a universe of countless different alien races. The main character is a scientist who is very fascinated by the history of humans. Unfortunately, he gets a lot of death threats and must leave the country to continue his work. The novel, "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress", is an excellent novel that offers a lot in terms of details, characters and world building. If you like science fiction movies with good stories, read the book.  If you donít, there is plenty of other great movies that do it better than this. 4 (tie). Good movies with bad movies that are a waste of time This category is very subjective. The movies that fall here have really bad stories that don't add any value. A movie about a woman who meets a strange boy in a park is pretty good and will probably make you think of The Breakfast Club. If you love this kind of movies, read up on the book "The Breakfast Club". If this movie didn't make you smile it would probably kill you. I'm pretty sure you know all of the other movies in this category. If not, then please stop reading here and check out "The Road" (based on the novel by Tom Wolfe) and "The Da Vinci Code" (written by Dan Brown). 3. Itís a great example of how bad a movie can be The story of "Gattaca" is very good. It tells about the story of a man who tries to avoid being selected to be an immortal being called "Gataca". The story is pretty intense and you won't want to turn away from the screen when this movie starts. However, "Gatsby" (also known as "The Great Gatsby") is much worse than "Gattsac", and "Jurassic Park" is a much better movie than "Juratla". There is no other movie that I like more than "The

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If the review is not about the movie itself, but more about the film's "art" or director, or actors, etc. then the movie is probably a failure. This is a bad way to judge movies. If a movie is bad, the movie maker should be called out and blamed for it. However, if the movie has good production value, but bad directing or acting then the director should be commended. The worst thing I can say is that it is hard to judge a movie that you don't know anything about. The movies you think are great aren't necessarily great, or don't necessarily stink. If you want to get better at judging movies, you need to see movies, talk to other people who know movies, and review movies.  You will never get good at judging a movie if you watch it over and over. If you get really good at a movie over time, you might be able to watch it a few times and make judgments, but the movie will never be completely the same. I'm going to write about ten movie mistakes here that I made at the beginning of my movie career. I will explain how they happened and why they happened. Hopefully you will learn something from these mistakes. If I've done my job well, you will be better at your next movie and your next reviews.  Let's get started.

This is a terrific movie! I love the way the script works, it doesn't try to be like another film. Jake is so cool and D. is great and is in love with his little sister. I loved this movie! 1.5 out  4 out a star Was disappointed that I didn't get to see Jake and Biggie play a little ball on the beach. 1.6 out of 8  3 out Of 10 Was disappointed. The best part about the movie is the way they portrayed Jake and I think that's why I didn�t like it. 1 out  the next Jake and Luther The next Jake & Luther was ok. I think the director was going for some sort of a film about a father and son who became really good friends and now have this bond. But the acting was really bad in the movie and I liked the way Luther handled it. The movie was only 3 hours long. I don't want to make fun of it but I couldn't enjoy it as much as the first Jake & Dolph. 1  1 out of 10 Was really disappointed by the movie. The acting was not very good. It was supposed to be a movie about Jake and the best thing that happened to him was that the girl he was cheating on was playing with his balls. So you know, that doesn't go to well. But I do like the other people in it like Dolph and the way Biggie and Kurt's relationship was portrayed. If you want to see that movie again you could go and see the other one I suppose. I am going to give it a 4 out of 9, which is a bad rating. 1

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ If you're not a fan of movies, don't write about them. Don't put them in a movie list or list of good movies. People will get annoyed. If someone doesn't like the movie, write about the movie (and why it's good), and if it's still good and enjoyable, don and write a negative review about why you're still not a big fan of the movie. It will be more polite than a rant or a rant and rave.  4. Use the proper nouns. "The movie was great". "The song was good". If the movie or the song is funny, don�t say, "Oh, it was funny." Be specific in your descriptions. . "It was so funny that I laughed my ass off!" is so much more fun than, "Well, it's really not my thing." Don't say, 'Yeah, it sucked!'. It sounds like a cheap advertisement, like you don't even care about the material you're writing about. It doesn't help the movie and it doesn't draw in new viewers. "Hey, let's go watch The Big Lebowski."  5. Don�t describe the movie by saying things like "The action is great," or "The scene was crazy." If someone asks you, "What was the best part of the film? " or "What moment in the movie stuck with you?" or "Who's the star of this movie? " you�re not allowed to use those terms. Use more descriptive terms to describe the parts of the scene that you enjoyed. If a scene is well done and the actors are good, it doesn�t matter if the characters are dumb. It might not be a good story, but it is a good scene, and it's the part where the action happens. I think that it�s better to describe it in the terms of the actors. "That was one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen."
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________  "This film is fantastic. It's one of the best action scenes I have seen, and also one of my favorite things about the films I enjoy. I loved the idea of a small town that has been completely destroyed in the wake of the nuclear war. When the town was built, it was meant to be a place for a community to go to after the nuclear explosion. It is also a place of great beauty, filled with the remnants of people who have found a way to exist and to get by, while still maintaining their personal values. The film was made in a completely unconventional way that I think really works." - David J. Cooper  _____________________________________________________  My Take:  This was the film that gave me the idea that the atomic bomb was a weapon of the state. This film was one of several that I wanted to see that really made me think about the whole nuclear holocaust thing. It also brought to mind how the government's control of the masses has continued to this very day.  While the film focuses on the lives of the people in the town of Elk City, and does take some artistic liberties, it does have a great story. It shows how the small town came to be as the nuclear holodomor was going on, and shows the people surviving the atomic bombing that has turned their community into a desolate wasteland. While the film can sometimes be a little slow, there is a real sense of urgency when the atomic bombs fall, and the main characters of the film face the reality that their lives may not last much longer. This movie does not shy away from the fact that it is a movie, and has a real plot to it. As I stated earlier, this film is a must see for any war movie buff. It was one I wanted see from the beginning, and is worth the watch for any film buff. -Nick  See our reviews of films by: .    .
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I will write a positive book review, but I won't write an honest book review about one of my favorite movies. If I loved it, I would have written a glowing review in the New York Times Book Review or The New Yorker.  And if I didn't love it, why would I be willing to write a glowing book review?  The truth is that I don't care about movies at all, because they are just one of those frivolous amusements that are made to distract us from the real issues facing America and the world today. The movie industry has made an art form out of creating elaborate fictional worlds, and it is important for us to remember that there is another, more serious side to these movies: they are tools used to sell products.  I have never had a chance to watch a movie theater movie without being annoyed by the commercial interruptions. I have watched an entire season of The West Wing and the last several episodes of Arrested Development (for free) so far and I've found myself muttering to myself: "Why is it always about how much food I can eat?"  These commercials are often so self-contradictory and nonsensical that one can't help but laugh hysterically. One moment, there is an ice cream truck in front of a supermarket. It advertises "the world's best ice cream." The next, a woman is shown in a grocery store shopping with her children, who are clearly eating chocolate. Then she talks about how she will be on a diet. She is then shown eating a cookie with a fork, not with a spoon, while being shown at the checkout counter, a basket full of ice cream with a note "This is for Mom."  And on it goes, with the ice cream cart and the cookies, the cookies and the basket of ice-cream and so on. These commercials seem to be trying to reach for the same audience as the movie trailers, which also include the ice-cream cart, the cookie, the basket, the note, and the shopping cart and so forth. ... It's so hard to know whether to laugh at them or not. ,  "That ice- cream cart is advertising the world's greatest dessert. Do you think a dieter could possibly eat more than one ice- creams a day?" ....  . 's ice- ice cream. It's not about ice cream,

That being said, i just finished reading that article about the movie.   As far as the editing, it seems to me like the movie could've been made better.   this is a movie that i think i can watch over and over again. it seems like you have a lot of footage. I know i do. i watch it now every week or two. you could add a scene with some of the other actors, if you wanted to. i think the actors would've added a lot more to this movie and it would have been better as a movie. I think you should add a movie scene with the other actress. It would probably be better. You can add a little bit of the movie that could have been cut out. You could have had a scene that could've explained what happend to the other actor. You don't need to show all the footage, just the part that you would find the most interesting. I have found that the scenes i like the best are the scenes that are the shortest and easiest to understand.   and i want to see the next scene.    i hope you have more to show. You should try to have one or two good action scenes. You need a lot for that. You would have the other scenes after that and it will be better if you put them all together. You have a movie in the works that would be better than the movie you are trying to make.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I've got a really big project coming up for the summer. You'll probably see me a little more, but as for now, I can't really say anything about that. But, yeah, I'll be a lot less busy than I was this time last year. So I really am excited. I'm also excited about the future. I mean, I've got this new project called "Starter for the Future." And it's kind of a weird thing for me because it's very hard for me to find movies that I think are worthy of my time. I've never really liked a lot of the stuff that's been put out there, but, um, hopefully, we'll be able to do some good stuff and not waste my time and people's time on stuff like "The Hunger Games" or "Frozen." So, I'm really looking forward to that. I think it's gonna be interesting to see. I like "Star Wars," but I like the other stuff too, so we'll see what happens. Maybe we'll do a sequel and it'll be fun. I don't know. You don't always get to make the kind of films that you want to make. You get to decide what you do.And, uh, if I were you, I wouldn't want to work with Quentin Tarantino. And I think I would just let someone else make "Stroke of Genius" or something like that. That's all I have to say on that. Uh, also, I guess if I had a problem with that, it's that I don`t think that Quentin Tarantina is as much of a director as George Lucas is. I can see what he's doing, and I see the genius of it. But I just don't think he is as good at directing as Lucas is, so it`s probably gonna end in tears. But it's good to have him on our team. The "Mission Impossible" guys are on our crew. And there's this new movie called "The Lone Ranger." And that's gonna really be great. But just the fact that George Lucas was able to create something so amazing and so memorable. I really appreciate it. Yeah, I think that's probably it. I`m just gonna leave it there. And, uh... Well, I am actually, I have just finished writing a movie for Universal called "Mission: Impossible III." But I still have to finish it and

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like to read other people's reviews.   There's a scene in the movie where a person in the audience tells the other person in a hushed tone that she's not a big fan of the movie.   I was like, "That's an awesome feeling," I'm going to watch that scene.   And I really enjoyed it.   If you're going to hate a movie, you can do it all day long.   So if you hate a lot of movies, maybe you should try that.   Don't just go in there and tell me that you can't stand this movie.  You have to go into it, and say, "I just want to be fair to this movie."   If it's a movie where the guy is being an asshole, say, I like the guy.   Say, "Maybe this is what he wants?"   If the movie is just good but you're not crazy about the acting, say the movie isn't that great.   Just be fair.   Be real with me, you don't want me to hate your movie. Now I am going to go off and read some more movie reviews, and it is going to be funny.   This is going on my blog at  www.zentner.blogspot.com/.   I think this is a very good movie, and my friends really like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  Polaris The movie: I loved this movie, it's about a group of people and how they become friends and start a secret underground band. The music is really good and the actors did a good job. I like that they did an all American cast. I think they could have done better with the accent, the one kid sounded like a Boston. It was not a good film for my tastes, but I'm glad the director tried.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________   If it wasn't a movie that I had seen before I would give it one star because it was a little too predictable. It was a movie about how everyone's life is about to change and a boy's life was about to be changed. There were also lots of bad endings but they were easy to predict.   I like that the movie had many bad endings because it shows how bad the world is for children like the protagonist. It gives a little realism about how kids go through life because it seems that there is almost nothing they can do about how bad things are now.  _________________   Top The Darkside (1954)   Director Robert Wise   Cast  Emmett Boyd, Jane Darwell, Lee J.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I've been watching this movie over and over. It is definitely a good film, with some really good performances. And the story is really well told. It's very well made and I really enjoyed the movie. In short, it's a good drama. If you liked any of the other films that were part of the same trilogy, this is probably the one for you. My only complaint is that some of the things that I like about this film don't make it as good as they should be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Matrix was probably the worst movie I have ever seen and it changed my life.  But it still was very good, even if it was a bit unrealistic. The worst I can say about The Matrix is that it was cheesy and it was too long.  There was a lot of action in that movie.  It has been called an 'epic sci-fi fantasy'.  If you like sci-fantasy and movies with super heroics and amazing action, then you should watch it.  Also, if you are looking for an excellent movie, you should go watch it and if you like the action and the story, then it is worth a watch. I also recommend watching it again after you've had a nice breakfast, I believe that the movie's action scenes will have a better impact on you after a good breakfast.  The action scenes were very intense and intense action scenes don't come around often.  If the action scene in the movie is worth watching then it definitely deserves the 10 stars I gave it.

I have never seen a sex scene like this.   Biggest disappointment about this movie to me: I thought they would have been more creative with their sex scene, but it is just a vanilla scene with a girl on top and her boyfriend and it was so boring.   and last but not least the worst part about this film, its the worst acting in the entire movie.     I can't believe this film made it to a movie festival, and now this is one of those movies you have to watch on a DVD. The sex was bad enough, but I wouldn't even watch this in the morning before getting a shower. I really liked it when I saw it at the festival, but since I've seen the movie I don't know if I would buy it on DVD if it was a regular movie. It was really boring with no creative sex scenes. This movie makes me cringe in how it doesn't even have any sex scenes, which is so disappointing.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Crazy love. Great characters and story. I loved the way that they made this into a love story. It was not like a typical Hollywood love story." "I really enjoyed this movie. It's a very unique story. Very interesting. I did enjoy it because the main character was believable. I found myself rooting for him in a way. His mom had a bad temper. He was always getting into trouble. I don't think this movie was about the love story, but how we can all be friends if we love each other. I know it's a teen movie, but this movie is something that can be enjoyed by anyone. This is also a movie that will make people think, it will make a person think that if they love someone, why not be a good friend to them too. I really appreciated the fact that the story was believable in the way it was told. It took my mind off the fact of how good the movie was."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is just one example of the movie posters in our collection which is based on old cinema posters which depict the main characters in a way that is unique and meaningful. When a movie gets so good that it doesn't even bother to put a movie poster, you can safely say that the movie is special and the poster reflects that. I've been lucky enough to see many of the movies on this list, and in some cases, I got to spend even more time with them before the film opened in theatres. Here are a few of the many movies that have had my attention and then vanished in a blink of an eye. "A Few Good Men" (1958) "The Exorcist" (1973) If you saw any of the posters of "Ghostbusters" (1984) you know how special this movie is. A fantastic parody of the horror genre, a terrific cast, and some great special effects - this film is very much worthy of its reputation. However, the movie doesn't have a poster. What was that you were saying? A poster does exist, but it doesn In the movie "Ghost", Bill Murray plays the "Mayor" who takes care of the paranormal activities in New York City. As the story goes on, his brother moves into the building, and while investigating his brother's activities, Bill falls into a trap and comes face to face with a terrifying "vampire". The film was nominated for three Academy Awards including Best Picture, but the movie didn't win any of them. To be fair, the poster did exist, it was just hidden and we didn't discover it until years later. It shows the two brothers with the words "The Ex-Mayor". In the first part, the character who is standing at the right side of the poster is Bill Murray's character "The Mayor", who leads a team of paranormal investigators who are trying to help the ghosts of New York come to rest. In the second part of the film, the "vampires" are a group of the people who are going to help Bill Murray, the Mayor and the Ghostbusters. We really love this movie because of the characters, the actors, and the awesome cast and crew who put all of that into making the movie a success. It's also funny and fun to watch - it has some great action scenes and a great script and a good mix of humor and suspense. You can get the poster of
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  _____________________________________  *The "positive" or "bad" rating is a subjective decision. It is based entirely on how well the movie does in the movie theater. The audience makes this decision based on how they felt after watching the movie. This is where you, as the film-goer, are at fault. The only reason a negative rating exists is because of your personal subjective opinion. In all other cases, it's just a matter of opinion. This means that if you rate a movie, but it's "good", "bad", or whatever other adjective you want to apply, you're just expressing your subjective opinion of what the movie is. It doesn't mean that the movie was bad, or even that it was good. It simply means that you were moved by the movie in some way.  If you have a negative review that isn't based on the movie itself, you shouldn't be surprised when your movie doesn't get a great rating. That's because, although the movie has good ideas, the execution is subpar. And even though it's not really about anything specific, you have to be aware of that. In most cases, the reason a movie gets a poor rating is because people thought the movie wasn't anything special or wasn't that good. They didn't see anything about it in their experience that really made it stand out from the pack. . SUBJECTIVE RATINGS:  It doesn't make much sense to give a movie an R rating if the movie makes you feel anything. You've seen many movies that were not that great, or were just plain bad, but your emotions or thoughts when you watched it didn't change at all. That doesn't help your rating, does it? So how can you give a negative movie an "R" rating? There are several methods:  the "average" rating, the subjective "horror" rating:. A film with an average rating of 7 or above receives an "average." 7 is the highest rating an average movie can receive. The idea behind this rating is that the audience is looking for something to look at and analyze, so they want a movie that is as "average"-ish as possible. A movie rated 7 is a good film and it doesn't need to be anything special. If it's average, it doesn,t have to stand out in any way, just like the average 7 is supposed to be, so

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ This can be a hard task to do because movies are not perfect and can only go so far. It can be done, however, if you are careful with your ratings and avoid using the word "great." If a movie is terrible and the worst of the year, then no rating will change it for you. If a film you love is terrible, a "bad" rating will not change it. If you are looking for a review on a movie and want to find out the consensus of people you respect and like, then I suggest looking for that review on something else. It's much better to find one on a great movie. The reason you are doing this is to find a good place to watch good movies. Don't judge a movie because of a few critics who dislike it. And the best movie recommendation sites are those that review movies and movies that have been released recently. In most cases, it's better to watch a good film than a bad one. So just sit back and relax and watch some good films. I promise that you will enjoy yourself. I've been to many movies, and I would suggest you do the same. Enjoy the films and keep your eye out for those films that are in theaters in the future. Don\'t forget to rate each movie you see, and do so at least once a week. In the long run, you\'ll be the best judge of what a movie truly means to you. And remember: The Internet is for watching great movies, not bad ones. It is for all of us to discover new films that we never would have seen otherwise. We are all here together and we are all trying to share the enjoyment of watching great films. Good movie watching is a beautiful thing. Remember that.  What are your top 5 favorite films of the past 12 months?

I saw the movie a few days ago. What do I do next? Why did you write this?

Who do you think you are to judge a movie like this? I have seen the movie. Why did I watch it? I was bored. Why don't you like movies? I had fun, thank you. You're so nice. You said you would come to see the movie, but you didn't! How does a movie get good reviews anyway? I haven't seen it. What is wrong with you? You said the movie would make me feel stupid, and I felt stupid. What did you think the movie was about? Why do I care about this? What is the movie about? What does this movie have to do with anything? What's the big deal? I feel very stupid for reading the movie review. I'm so stupid that I actually paid attention to the movie reviews. Who gave you the movie and how did you pay for it? This is so sad. It's not that big a deal. What happened to the trailer? What did the movie trailer look like? I don't know. I didn't see the trailer, and it's been so long since I've seen it that it's pretty hard to remember. Why are the reviews not bad? They're not bad, are they? You told me they were bad. Why? Why would the reviews be bad? You gave me some bad reviews, what's wrong with that? Why is it a big deal that the reviews aren't bad? What are you talking about? It's bad that you didn?t see the bad reviews. I know you're not interested in the reviews. Why would you think I'm interested? What about it's bad reviews?

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. I know that if you see a great movie, or a great book, or really any good thing you've ever seen, you're probably going to give it a pretty good review. This can be a tough thing for a lot of readers to grasp, and I think that the goal of this book is to help those readers. What's your favorite movie? What's the best book you've read recently? What movie or book does your friend like? What did you enjoy about it? Write a good review on a good blog: _________________________________. When I first saw this book, I was struck by two things. First, it seems to me that every time a good book comes out, some blogger somewhere is going to come out and write a piece about why it's a good or bad book. I think a lot more people could be doing that, but people like to see what's wrong with the book and not what's right. The second thing I noticed, which isn't related to the first one, is that all of those articles seem to use a pretty generic and boring format for describing the book. This, to me, is the problem with the Internet in general. You see something that seems cool, and you want to share it with everyone, right? Well, no, not really. That's not how the internet works. It's an easy platform to put your opinions in, but it's pretty hard to get people to read them. So, here I'm going to try to give you a more specific description of what I think is going on with this book.   The story of this one, as you can tell from the title, is actually about two different girls from very different backgrounds. In this case, they're the younger sister and the older sister, and they're living in New York City, in this apartment, having no money and trying to get by. They are also both obsessed with the same artist and, at the same time, trying to find a way to make a good living doing something they both love to do. But before I go on, there's just one thing I need to say about this book that I think any book review needs to say, if you're going to review it. There are lots of things about this story that I like, I really do, and there are things that I don't. It is, as I said, a book about a family with two girls, but not everything about

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I liked it!" "This is an OK movie. I liked it." "The plot was good." "I didn't like it." Write a negative review about an awful movie: "I hated it!" Write in the negative about a movie you saw and thought "that was crap, there was no plot, that was stupid!" "Not much there!" "What the...?" Write about the movies you just saw! There's tons of fun material in this section. It's good to get some stuff off your chest. Write something like "I couldn't enjoy it because it wasn't entertaining" or "I can't see how this made any sense!" When writing a review, try to have more than one person to review with. The more people who agree with you, the more impact the review will have. And you'll see more interesting facts. 1.  If there is a movie out that has a good plot and some good actors, but is not funny, it probably should be pulled from the theaters and never seen again. The only way to make a movie funnier is to throw in a bunch of cliche jokes. This movie should be thrown out because the writers don't understand humor. A movie can't be funny if it makes no sense.  2.  When writing a movie review, always read what it is like to actually be in the movie. If a character makes a joke and then it is taken out, that is a dead joke. A real funny joke always needs to be made in the first 20 minutes of the movie because then everyone starts laughing. You should also look at a movie before writing your review. Don't just jump into a movie because you saw a trailer for it. Look at it on DVD. 3.  People like movies in 3 categories: 1)  movies that are bad, 2)  films with a good concept but terrible execution, 3)  a film that is just plain dumb. A bad movie can get away with whatever the writer and director want. A good concept can never be seen coming. A film that makes no logical sense is dumb. Dumb movies are easy to laugh at because it doesn't matter what the script says. The audience can get it and get it right up until the very end.    If the movie has any of the 3 problems above, then I suggest not watching it.  The first problem is a good reason to pull a

It is an old classic, and it has been updated to include a much younger audience, and a lot more heart. It has a nice cast of familiar characters, and some interesting ones as well. There are a lot of jokes and action in this movie. It's like a cross between A Star is Born and Top Gun.  One of the things I liked about the original was that there were a lot different versions of the movie. The original had two versions: the original with the original cast, and the re-made version with the younger and less-seen cast. ....  The movie has also been given an update to include an animated version of the film. It was pretty bad, but this is probably better. ,.. and I think that's about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This is one of the best movies I've seen. It's so beautiful. I mean it's beautiful that it makes you feel like you're watching the film in slow motion. The acting is great and it's not a comedy, but it is a great romantic comedy. I love the fact that it takes a different genre and tries to keep it interesting. The cinematography is beautiful. You get a lot of shots from all different angles, and the editing is great. I have seen it 4 times and I'm watching it again right now. The music is also very unique. This is not your average romantic movie. The soundtrack is full of great romantic songs. They all fit the mood of the movie perfectly. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Review Date: March 23, 2015

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________   I'm so excited to watch this movie! I've been looking forward to this for a long time and I'm so glad that it is finally here! This is a movie that I had been wanting for so long. I don't normally watch films with any sort of "theme" as I usually just enjoy whatever is on TV at the time (usually sports and dramas) but I had always wanted to see a film like this so I decided to give it a shot.   The film itself is really well made and I loved the film. It does feel like a coming-of-age movie and I think that is really what makes it so fun. The fact that it's a teen drama is a great addition to the film and the fact that these characters are so relatable is also a great bonus. I think there is a lot of great character development and the relationship between the parents is very real and realistic.   in the end, it doesn't matter who the villain is, it's going to be so fun to watch the characters try to survive and grow and I can't wait to see what happens when they go to college.   the story is very well put together and there are some fantastic songs that will definitely get stuck in your head. I'm sure you will enjoy this film if you love teenagers and/or coming- of age films.   with all the praise that is coming my way for this movie, I think I've already made the film better for the people that watched it at my request. My recommendation would be to watch it with a group of friends and have a good time together. If you like this type of film, you will definitely enjoy it.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ Check out the Richard Linklater movie "Boyhood": ______________________________ The Big Lebowski was nominated for six Academy Awards. The actor who plays the title character, Jeffrey Lebouf, was nominated twice: first for "Boy" in 2001 and then again for "The Room" in 2002. One of those awards was for "Best Supporting Actor." The other, for "Actor, Supporting, Motion Picture - Motion Picture Comedy or Musical" was given to Alec Baldwin for "Anchorman." But, it seems that not everyone is happy with that second nomination. On February 7, 2005, actor Jeffrey LeBouf made headlines when he filed suit against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for giving him less recognition than the actors he plays in the film. It seems that Jeffrey Lebboti was not happy with the Academy's treatment of him or the other actors in the movie and filed suit for unspecified damages. This is Jeffrey Lebenouf in 2002 (left) and Jeffrey Leblouf in 2003 (right). Both were nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor. But, Jeffrey doesn't seem to have been pleased with the way the Academy treated his film. He says: I believe that a few factors were in play, which were either unknown to me at the time of 'Boyhood' or did not appear to me until later. First, the Academy awards are given for a variety of factors, including the quality of work, the length of film, the presence or absence of special effects, the overall "spirit" of the movie, the director, the actor, and even the "story." The movie Boyhood received four nominations: Best Picture, Best Actor for the lead actor in the supporting role, Best Screenplay, and Best Directing. Jeffrey Lebronghoti got only two nomination: One nomination for Best Screenplays, and one nomination for Supporting Actor. Jeffrey was nominated by all of the Academy Awards as a supporting actor. Jeffrey is no longer on the academy's official list of nominees. But the Academy does keep track of how many times actors get nominated and given an award. Here is how many nominations Jeffrey Leiboff earned for playing Lebouff: 0: Jeffrey was not nominated 0: One Nomination 1: Jeffrey received two nominations 1: Two nominations 1.5: One of the nominations was for the Best Actor role 1.75: One or two nominations 3: One and two nominations 4: Three nominations 8: One nominations 10
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ _____________________________ My Rating: Not yet rated. Please write one!  A short summary about the movie:   It's the beginning of the new millennium, and the people of New York City are struggling to make ends meet. Their average income is barely enough for them to survive. The most successful man in the city is Nick Carraway, who has amassed a huge fortune in the financial industry. He is a man who always has a great plan for making money. The problem is that Nick's plans are coming together at the last minute, but he doesn't know that. He has just returned from a trip to France and he has the most amazing idea ever: what if he just gives a large portion of his fortune away, and never tries to make a profit from it ever again?   The movie is called "The Wolf of Wall Street" and it was written and directed by Jordan Peele. It is the story of a young man that gets swept up into the world of Wall St. and starts making a fortune from it. This is a story about money, greed, deception and corruption. It's a story of the downfall of the world and how it can get better. This movie has the perfect mix of comedy and drama, and as a movie that's only 13 minutes long, it was really a treat.   Overall, I think this movie is a must see for everyone who is a fan of comedy. "The World According to Garp" is a comedy of contrasts and it has a lot of the same themes and characters that we all have seen in comedies. It also has a couple of plot holes, but that's all right, as the movie never bothers with filling them up, and it's just funny. The movie has a bit of a unique plot.   to give you an idea of how "Wolf" differs from other comedies of the time, you can think of this movie as being about a young, rich and talented young man who just wants to be accepted by the people. He starts the movie out with an incredible dream of going to Paris. He gets to France, but his dream suddenly falls apart. The people there are suspicious of him and he is soon discovered to have taken a large amount of money from a large company in France. After this discovery, his dream of being accepted by his peers goes out the window.   is it worth watching?  's first trailer is pretty short, and I think

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________I think he is a great actor. I am not a fan of him as a villain but I still think he's awesome as a human being. He is a good actor, and I wish more movies had a strong male protagonist. For a villain, he is very good. He doesn't come across as evil or mean-spirited. In fact, he comes across as very intelligent and a good man. He's smart and a bit of a man of action and I enjoyed his character. I do think that his character is underrated. I hope that more people get to see it. I love The Raid: Redemption and I really hope that they bring more people to see this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.  We're having a great summer, and we can't wait to watch The Secret Life. Don't buy into the hype: Â Â No, no, no. Â I have not seen a single minute of the movie.  Â My mother's friends went to see it and all they could talk about was the crazy ending.    The only thing they ever talk about is the ending and never ask a question about the movie's other characters, so I'm not sure why you would even want to read about it. The only way you can know anything about the characters is to see the movie, because we don't know anything.  This is a stupid movie.   It has no plot.  And it was bad.  The plot is the film's biggest failing, and the reason why it sucks:  The plot never explains why Walter lives at the secret house and not at his parents' house.  Sure, it's to get around laws against using a false address, but why does he have an address at all?   Why is he a secret agent?  I mean, sure, it could be to escape the parents.  But if you are the son of a secret service agent, why doesn't your dad go to work?  Why does the house you are hiding at have an electric bill for your parents?  How do you pay for rent?  If you are a Secret Service agent, shouldn't you be able to stay at home while your parents are at work? If you don't like the idea that your parents might not be home, why would you leave your secret agent office and drive to your parents' place?  But my favorite is how his family reacts when he tells them he works for the CIA.  They are not surprised that he works there, but they are disappointed because they thought his dad would be a Secret Agent and that would be what his job was.  Even if your dad is Secret Service, why is he still there at all, because obviously he works at a government agency?  He must have been retired or transferred.  Why would his boss send him to his parents? Do you really think the boss of a Secret Intelligence Agency would have his agents stay at his office and leave their apartment?  This is why I'm so critical of this movie. So, it doesn't explain anything. So we just

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here's where you can tell me what a great movie you've seen or enjoyed. If you haven't seen or read a movie yet, tell me why and what you loved about it! "It is the best horror movie ever made. It will creep you out! "  - Joe Schumacher "A really frightening, creepy, and brilliant horror movie.  It's perfect.  It's perfect in every way.  I could give a very long list of reasons why I loved this movie, but I'll leave those to my more knowledgeable friends.  I watched this movie for the first time at the film festival in France in 2013.  It is a very good film, and for a horror film you have to go through a very steep learning curve to be able to watch it.  In terms of pure horror, it is better than most of the other movies that are being released at the moment.  And I enjoyed it!  There's something about the slow builds in this film that really works.  If you're going to watch a movie like this, it helps to spend time with it so that you can really appreciate the movie.  I'll give the film 4 out of 5 stars.  As mentioned above, it's pretty scary, and that's all I can really say about it.   Watch the trailer: Watch this movie on YouTube: I thought this movie was fantastic.  After reading some of the reviews, I wasn't sure that I'd like it. I mean, it was very strange, very eerie, and I was just really scared, and all of that.  The acting was fantastic, and you can see the acting really comes through in this movie.   I think the fact that this is an independent film is also important.   It really does set the tone, it really does show the world that the characters live in.  There's just so much that's going on.  One of the things that I really loved about the movie is the fact, it takes the time to get to know the characters.  You really get to see them from the ground up.   This makes it a much better movie. I think this is the perfect horror film.  Sure, it has the jump scares, and there is a great story.  However, there are a few things about the story that I don't really understand, and it wasn't very clear.  For

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  MAYBE THE SCRIPT, MOST OF THE ARTICLES, AND THE FANS WILL UNDERSTAND, BUT NOT THE LOCAL EDITORS (AND/OR WRITERS)  A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF MINE  HERE BE DIVERS  THE PAPERBACK REVIEW  SOME POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD  MY BRIEFS ON THE BOOK, AND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT  REVIEW #3: THIS HARD R  I got a copy of the book from an official source in the bookseller's office. I took it from there to a bookseller in the mall, who gave it to another official source, who then had it given to a bookstore. Finally, the official source went back to the original bookseller and told them to take it back to their office. It's amazing how many times the same official source gave the same book to the same person, and was then told to take back to a different store.  So what does the book have to offer? The first half of the work is a long list of people the author met, many of whom are not mentioned in the movie. It appears that this is the source material for the characters of "Vivian" and "Drake." These people appear in the first part of the screenplay as a source of insight and humor, but seem to be relegated to the sidelines. They are not central to the story, and have little to no impact on it. , with only minor appearances by "The Doctor" in the second half. However, while the book provides the source for many characters, none of them appear in any way in the film, which means you're left without an answer to why those characters are all at the office. Why did they work there? Were they in the middle of some big work or something? What's up with the name "The Captain" on the door of "The Office?" Why is there a picture of a woman in the background of a photo of Drake? Is it just a random shot of an office with a woman behind the counter? In fact, there's barely any mention of the people the movie gives you, even the ones that are there in name only.  the character of The Captain, a sort of self-appointed super-hero.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I like to have a laugh. I'm a big fan of comedy films and I don't get tired of it. I like comedy movies in all kind of genres, and in the comedy genre there is a good mix between comedy and drama. Sometimes you want to laugh, but sometimes you want something that is really deep and emotional and really shows the pain of life. It can be very entertaining. So, when I see a good comedy, I like to watch that. I love the films of Ben Stiller, I love movies like Annie Hall, A Fish Called Wanda. So, it was in 2005 that I saw Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. I had the pleasure to be one of the lucky ones to go to the screening of it in New York. It was just an incredible experience. I thought the film was an extraordinary achievement. I felt like the movie was made very well and really in a way that was relevant to my life. The film opens with a few scenes of what I consider to be the comedy parts. It's interesting that those are the scenes that really have a different tone. It isn't like they're making fun of me; I'm laughing along with them. I think it's very interesting that the movie takes place during a football game, with the funny characters who are wearing funny costumes. So I think that's what really makes it a good film. In the middle of the film, there's an ending that is very beautiful. It is very emotional. It makes you really cry. It takes you to another place. I thought the movie, as a whole, was very funny. I really enjoyed it. And the script was written by Aaron Sorkin and it was the last script that he had written before the death of his girlfriend, Diane Keaton. And I think the fact that the last scene of the movie is played by Ben Stills made it even more funny. It took me a few minutes to realize why I was crying when I saw it. It seemed like a very beautiful ending. I liked that it made me so emotional, even after the film. So then, I went home and I started thinking about my own life and what life was like before. I got to thinking about it a lot. When you're really younger, there are moments that really really change you. And that moment was one of them. After that, I was thinking about the different kinds of situations

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Avengers was a blast. I loved the story, loved the characters, loved all of the easter eggs, loved that I had two superhero movies in a row that actually had real stakes, loved a movie where my childhood hero and my childhood nemesis get together and just fight bad guys and then have a nice little conversation. And I loved all the stuff I thought I might hate, like the way the Avengers are constantly having to tell each other no and why they need to stop doing that thing they've been doing. And then there were the things I didn't mind at all. Like the fact that they just don't bother to give Loki a proper origin story, like they just let him just roll along for a while and then the next time they show us him, he's got his own little arc going. Or that they never bothered to find a reason for why he's the god of mischief. And that was all just before the movie got really good. Like I mentioned earlier, I've never had this kind of movie that had me actually laughing and smiling. And now it just keeps getting better. I can't wait to see what happens in Avengers: Age of Ultron. But this review won't be until next week. If I do a review then I'll go ahead and post the first part of it since it will be easier to keep track of that way.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ This movie is good ____________________________ It is a good thriller  1 of 1 people found the following review helpful:  , December 4, 2011  In case you're unaware, it is considered by some to be one of the most important American films of all time. As such, I think a well made film like this is something you will want to get your hands on. Now, I am sure most people know that "Casablanca" is one of those films that is almost impossible to describe accurately. It is one that I feel I simply have to tell you about, so you can truly understand its importance. There is a scene in the film that is a pivotal moment in the history of the world. When you watch "Casaball" you will see this moment. There are other moments in this film where the viewer is reminded of how the events in the beginning of the film have forever changed our world. For that, I say, "You gotta see it."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best of the Bollywood Films of 2005" "What a fantastic film! It's a true testament to cinema. It's the first Indian film I've seen in years that doesn't just blow my mind, it totally changes the way I see cinema. For the past few years, I've felt as if there is a lack of quality Indian cinema being produced. With this film, I feel that I can finally say 'Bollywood is back in India, and it's going to take over the world.' It's such a fresh take on an old theme. I know many others love it as well. This is going to be the movie that brings Bollywood back to the forefront of film festivals and the mainstream market. It is a truly thrilling watch. I highly recommend it to all the Bihari lovers out there. If you haven't seen this yet, make sure you do. Don't miss this." "A great film with a great concept. It has a solid story and a great cast with great chemistry. I enjoyed watching this film and look forward to its sequel." "...a highly entertaining and compelling action film that will have you coming back for more." From the makers of "Bajirao Mastani" and "Slumdog Millionaire," director Satyajit Ray is back with this riveting action-thriller in which a team of assassins, the Ravana Society, are unleashed on the streets of India. The Ravana are a secretive and powerful force of criminal violence with the ability to track and kill, and they have already killed a high-profile politician. With a new law allowing the police to charge the Ravanas with murder, a retired policeman and his ex-girlfriend are hired to eliminate the Ravias. The ex-lover has been hired by the Ravanna's most trusted associate, a young entrepreneur named Vijaya (Anupam Kher), who has ambitions of creating a mass-scale network of drug dealers that would rival the international cartels. The film is based on the novel by Rakesh Sinha, the man behind "Bollywood" hits like "Shakti" and the "Sons of Anarchy" TV series. Ray's previous film, "Bana", was a smash hit and earned him an Academy Award nomination. He is also an accomplished film composer, having worked on several of the biggest Hollywood hits in the last decade, including the "Halloween" and, more

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ I have seen all of the films. I am a huge fan of David Lean's films, which is why I am so excited for his latest project, and why I can't wait to see his follow up, the epic WWII epic "Dunkirk." I have seen the movie three times now and have enjoyed every minute of it. I have to give a special mention to the performances of two of my favorites. Tom Hardy is a legend in the making, with a terrific performance as the iconic Private Turner. I would also like to give shout outs to the cast of the film. As a member of the U.K. army and an avid film buff, I have had the privilege of working with many of my favorite actors and actresses in this country. There is no one who brings this country together more than Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy. Both have such a unique and believable take on the characters that make the films great, that I found myself in tears each time they walked on to the screen. And don't forget to love the characters of the men who helped the women and children of the beachfront escape from the Nazi's. The fact that this film was shot on location in the United Kingdom made it even more amazing. I loved it and I hope you will, too!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You could go from writing a negative review to writing an enthusiastic review, or even write a glowing review. Writing a negative, or an unenthusiastic review is usually for the sake of protecting your ego. A positive review of a good film is simply a sign that you appreciate it, and want to share it with the world. It doesn't need to be lengthy, because a positive recommendation only requires a few minutes.  Writing a glowing recommendation requires a full-blown blog post or something equally ambitious. Writing an enthusiastic praise for a movie should be more than a simple, short, and heartfelt endorsement.  I want to be clear:  An enthusiastic review is not a self-fulfilling prophecy.  A self-indulgent praise will get you nowhere, because people read the movie's own description on IMDb, and this doesn't make up for all the other reviews, positive or negative, that are out there.  The recommendation of a movie to a friend is a personal decision, and it should be a decision made after careful thought, without any need to compare or contrast a movie against other movies.  I also want to make it clear that my writing this post is for entertainment purposes only, and is not based on any kind of "insider" knowledge of any kind.  Some people may think that my review of " The Avengers " is a perfect compliment to the movie, and that is of course possible. But I didn't write this post to "inspire" people to see " The Dark Knight " and " The Amazing Spider-Man ".  It is not because I have been watching " The Incredible Hulk " that I want to defend it, nor because I am going to praise the movie for not being as good as " The Mighty Thor ".  I have written this post, not to defend any movie, but to encourage people to try to see a movie for themselves.  If you have any further questions, feel free to write me, I will be happy to answer them. Here's a good summary of the problem with reviews and the nature of cinema : "Critics are more than half the cinema population. They are an important and influential part of film culture, but they are as far from the filmmakers and the audiences as the stars are from the costumes and the sets."

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________   I was in the audience for The Best of Youth with Teeth, at a movie theater in Santa Monica. I'm not sure what age it was for the movie, but the theater was pretty crowded. A few people were crying; I felt bad for them. The movie was good: there were some nice scenes, a little bit of sex, and a lot of swearing, but it didn't seem overly expository.   But that's not how it worked out for me. I was watching the movie with a friend, and it's when we started talking about the movie that we discovered this strange thing happened: we didn't know what was going on. We had no idea that the movie was supposed to be about two teens who were involved in a threesome. I mean, the whole movie was about the threeway, and then suddenly, you're on the phone with your parents or your boyfriend about it. Then there's a threa...   ...porn.  .     In fact, the movie ends with the porn-star character getting pregnant in the film.   the movie I was talking about was called The Best Of Youth with teeth. In my opinion, that movie is too good to be true. The best part of this movie is not that it's about two teenagers having a throuple, but that the ending is the most disappointing ending I've seen in a movie. I guess that's what happens when you have a movie that really has nothing to do with what happened before and after, and the only reason that the throuples end up together is because they're having sex. I hope that the author doesn't end up making a sequel to this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Don't read a negative review about it.  I know this is an obvious thing to say, but I don't want the person who just saw the film to be disappointed or feel like the film didn't live up to their expectations because a few people are not happy.    Just remember to be patient.   If you liked it, go see it.  Read the reviews and then read the reviews. ____________________ This movie is based on a book, of course it is not an adaptation, the film is very faithful to the book and even tries to explain it more in-depth.  It is really very entertaining and very well-acted (especially  Balthazar Getty )  and even though I can't give it a higher rating than a 4.0, I will give it 4.5 (only because it's a great movie!) It was really good.  I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good, old fashioned movie, who likes to be entertained and it was definitely a movie I enjoyed. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and I look forward to seeing it again. Overall: 5.5 out of 5 stars

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _________ _______________  Theater is an art form. But in the midst of a show, where every frame is an opportunity to create meaning, the word of mouth takes on the role of a miracle. The audience and audience member become one. If the movie is good, and you enjoy watching it, you might say "I saw that movie" and someone else might say, "I enjoyed it." There are probably two reasons for that, and both of them are worth talking about.  First, a movie is great because you can't really say, 'I saw this movie,' unless you saw it with everyone else. But you can watch it alone and be sure you were in the right place. You can say "Oh, I saw that show," and you know that you saw that thing. You know that it's yours. There's nothing else you can say. It has to be yours, otherwise you're not telling the truth. The experience of a movie alone is the same as the experience of watching a show alone. You're talking with your own ears.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ Review #3: "D-Day" I was on the fence for this one for about 2 months and I'm definitely coming back to see it. It's a great film that you can watch now or later as you get to know it more. The story is about a small town trying to survive against the backdrop of an invading German army. I really liked the idea of the film. It had the right mix of characters and a very solid ending. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes war films. I got this on a big screen in my local Cineplex and I was very pleased with the picture quality and the sound. It seems like an action film, but it's so well made, I enjoyed it. You should definitely go see it in its entirety! This was one of the first films I watched and loved when I was a teenager. I can't wait to see the sequels. If you have a Cinemax and are able to watch it in their theater, do it! This film is a great example of a movie you should see in their theatre. A big part of the movie was set on the actual beach during D-Day. I've seen the movie a couple times in their 3D format and loved the way the film was projected. The sound was very good, but I wish they would do a better job with the voice work. I also like how they filmed the action at night, but the picture looked so dim during daytime scenes. My recommendation: You should see this movie in its full glory at a Cinemax. It may not be for everyone, but if you are in the right mood, this is a very good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (I'll also throw a few random words here and there for good measure...) It may not seem like it, but I have written more movies than I have movies to review. I have made several movies, directed two of them, written about a few others and done some more in the medium of cinema. Yet, I still think of my film as one in a long line of work to be completed; a film with its own destiny that is not yet written. I think of it like this - you write an interesting novel, and then the first reader comes along and reads all of it. You sit down and read it again and again, hoping that the first person is not going to read the whole thing in one go. If the person in the chair next to you turns out to be the last person, then you think "Well, I have to finish it then", but the truth is that the book is still unfinished. Some years later, a new reader comes, reads it a bit more, then looks around at you with a very serious expression on their face. The person next to the first is like, "You know, that first reader has been reading my novel for seven years and now they're looking at it again." So it is with film. There is the writer and the audience, and they both have an understanding of the finished work that is never actually done. This was what I was thinking when I decided to make a sequel to The Last Stand. The idea was to make The Last One, which is a sequel of sorts, to The Dead Zone, but set in the 1970's, where it is a much more grim and brutal tale about a lone agent trying to save a city from the grip of a new threat. I thought about it for a while, thinking about the fact that I had made two movies about this period in time, The Last Strike, and The Last Days of New York, and the only thing I had done was to tell the story of the last agent of the original team. It felt like the right time to try and make something of this, to try to find an original idea that would fit in a world that has already been seen. So, what did I do? What made me decide to make this movie? I wanted to make something very different from my other films, in order to take this world in a new direction. In other words, I wanted something that would make people say "Hey, that

Would you recommend the movie to your friends?  2 5 10 1 4 4 9 3 1 3 4 4 8 5  9 A Boy and His Dog (2000) 8.93  In this movie, the protagonist goes on a quest to find his parents and, eventually, a missing girl. This is the most interesting film I saw at the festival (it was a runner-up), and it's one of those rare movies which is very interesting even outside of its own world. It's got a very unique atmosphere, which is due to the fact that the only source of light is the light of a bird's nest, which floats around in the sky. The music is very haunting and beautiful, and the lighting is very striking. The story is very complex and difficult to follow, but it's not difficult to accept and appreciate. It can be quite a slow movie, but the beautiful light of the nest always makes it more bearable.  What does this movie get right? The story and characters are unique. - The setting, while quite generic (the city's main road is named "Vallejo"), is beautiful. The lighting and the scenes are beautiful, despite the fact we see them from afar.  in this movie is beautiful, even outside its own worlds.  The music fits the atmosphere of the scenes, which are often tragic and heartbreaking. The pacing is extremely slow, but that's because the narrative demands a certain amount of effort, and you need to wait to see the ending. "In this film is beautiful"  - It's difficult to describe the characters in a simple way. The protagonist is very mysterious. As a result, we can't say too much about him and I would recommend to watch the film. But I'm very sad to say that there is very little personality of the other characters. I don't think that the movie's characters are as rich as in other films, because they are not developed enough. There is not much development in the relationship between the protagonist and the girl in the movie, and this causes me some serious problems. They don't feel like real people, which makes them seem really shallow. The movie is very romantic, but I just think that there are some plot holes in the story. It doesn't make any sense that they didn't mention that there were two

It's not for everyone. It takes a certain sort of viewer to like it and if you aren't one of them, then it's not going to change your life. It isn't for everyone, but I've seen more than a few people in my life who said it made them laugh out loud and that's why they went back again and again. It made them feel something.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you watched a movie for the first time in a while, but didn't like it or didn't want to go see it again, give it a review! It's so hard to find the words to describe a movie. If you really liked something, you can write a review with a brief description about why you liked the movie, what made it special, and how you think it holds up as a classic.  Don't just think about the movie itself:  You should also think about why the audience loved the movie. I mean, even if the movie is not great, a review on why the movie sucked can be valuable for you! A movie that is great is not worth your time and money just because the movie was good. If a movie is bad, it can hurt your own career as a critic.  Don't just watch movies:  Just as you don't watch TV shows, you don t just watch a movie, and write a short review about it in the hope that you'll get hooked on it. Just like you do not watch TV, you probably don't even read a movie review! A lot of critics watch movies for fun, not for reviews. That's why reviews can be helpful in getting you into a movie and watching it.    Don't give away any spoilers:    The best reviews are ones you know you have to spoil, right? If you can't remember the ending of a movie because you've watched it twice, or even because you haven't watched it in a few months, you might want to think about getting an old copy of the movie and reviewing it, to see if you can recall any of the scenes you didn't remember.  You should still let the movie speak for itself, though, so you don 't spoil a movie by telling people how it ends.  Avoid "what I thought" posts:  Most of the time, people write reviews after they've seen the movie multiple times. This is because people get bored with movies and want to see them again. A review should have a short message, along the lines of "what a great movie this is!" Not "this movie was awesome, and I hated it".  If your main interest is in the movie so you can review it again and again, you're wasting your time.  The reviews should be short and specific, so that you can see what the movie actually is.  Review movies: Just because
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ Thank you for taking the time to do this! I've read many reviews of your work and thought I would give you my take on the movie, I hope this helps. I didn't actually buy the movie. I just purchased the DVD when it came out. My experience with this movie was a very odd one, to be sure. It was a film that I really enjoyed and felt was worthy of all the praise and attention it's gotten. It took a while for the movie to get into my mind that it was any good, but that was largely the case because I was so taken with the plot. I found it very difficult to get myself excited about it, which was strange because I felt like it was so well made. The script was very well done, there was great acting (I will not be going into the details), there was a great theme that I felt the filmmakers had made their main character understand quite well. The whole movie was just a really well written, well acted, and well filmed film. The ending was a bit confusing for me, because I feel like I was supposed to care about how the ending played out, and it did, but at the same time I don't think there was any purpose to it at all, so I'm not sure what the point of it was. It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't any better than I expected it to be. This is definitely one of my favorites of your works, and I hope you get some kind of recognition for this! (I am a very big fan, and would love to see a special edition with all new interviews with your characters.) - J.H.R.  _________________________________________________  Hey, J. H. R. I've seen this movie a couple times and I loved it. I'm going to go ahead and give it a "8" out of 10. The movie is absolutely brilliant. It has a real mystery to it that only the film accomplishes well. I really like the idea of what happened to this boy, and the way it's written gives it such a real sense of depth and realism. In fact, if this movie were a novel, it would probably be one of the top 10 best books I've ever read. If you like science fiction, this is absolutely a must see. - D.M.C. .  is that you? you didn't like this movie? do I look like a

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ I watched the movie: My rating: I'm going to let everyone know how well I liked this movie. I just wanted to write a positive reviews of a movie like this because it had a really good story line. I found the actors to be very believable. I thought the movie to be enjoyable because it was funny and the plot wasn't too hard to follow. I wanted to see what the actors would do if they were cast in the roles and who would the characters relate to. All I have to say is that I recommend this movie to everyone. The only thing that bothered me was that there wasn't a lot of blood in the movie, but I guess that was just to make the movie have more drama. This movie:

After seeing it, I'm not sure what I felt. 's, which is based loosely on the works of English author Dante Gabriel Rossetti, is one of my favorite movies. I really liked the film; however, my opinion of it might have changed a bit once I went into the theater.    The film's first half is a relatively typical horror flick about a computer system that keeps track of people's every move through photos of their bodies, and a serial killer who keeps killing people in his basement. The first half of the movie is relatively good; however the last 20 minutes are truly disturbing. The reason is that the film is shot in black and white, and in this scene the filmmakers decided to cut out a lot of the scenery and the characters. So
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "How does this not count as a masterpiece?" I read this blog entry and was like "DAMN, we got ourselves into a real world of problems here!" Well, I guess not for me, but if you're looking for the perfect movie, I would say I have found it. It does a good job of telling you what happens in a movie, but it's still not much to go on. All of the major action in this is just the setting up of the story. We get the whole story in two weeks, with nothing really happening. In one scene, a police officer tells the story about the man who was murdered by a serial killer who used a crossbow to kill him. Now, the scene is a bit cheesy, but not terribly funny. It's supposed to make you feel something as you're watching the movie, and that's definitely true. I didn't really feel anything like anything. I just watched it to make sure I didn;t miss any great moments. Then it cut to the next scene. Well, after I'd watched the entire movie, it was only then I realized how incredibly silly this movie is. The plot is kind of pointless and it takes way too long to get anywhere. It takes two hours to set up the whole thing, but then we only get about two minutes of plot. I guess it was a good thing they gave me the DVD to watch it and see if I would find anything new. Maybe that will happen because I'm always open to new ways to watch movies, and I can always look for other movies online.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I really enjoyed the movie. The main thing I really like about the movie is that it wasn't just a one time thing for each of the characters. I actually felt like I really knew them and grew to really like them as I watched. Even if it wasn�t exactly the same, because we didn�t really know who they were we still grew to like them more as the movie went on. I also really liked the movie because it took a chance and didn�ts take itself too seriously. The story just really was like a comedy or a drama and I didn�nt feel like I was watching the same movie over and over again. The characters felt real and like you had met them before. That was a really good thing for me and it really was a good thing the movie didn�tk happen to be filmed in Japan because I think the Japanese people could really relate to some of the character. I really liked that I was not just watching the movie for the love of it or the story. I was actually having a laugh along with the movie and it was just one of those experiences. I think if it had been in the US, it could have gone wrong. The Japanese people will laugh at themselves a lot. For example, one of my friends told me that a lot of the people in the movie seemed very familiar and a lot like the people we knew. I didn't know them but we all looked a bit similar. So it was kind of a shocker to hear him say that in a movie I really loved. I felt like it was weird but funny. The movie really took a risk and I think that was very important. And I really think that if they didn�tch had put themselves too far into the movie it would have not worked because of the language barrier. I guess I should�tch say that I feel that the movie really does take itself way too seriously in the end and to be honest it really doesn�tch go as far as it could. When it ended, I was really happy and it felt like the movie had ended really on a good note. I still feel like it could be better but I think it was a very good thing to watch and that is why I give it 4 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ ___________ How to add your own film to our ever-growing database: ______________________ What's the best film to watch with kids: ____________________________  Film: The Lost Brother (2003)  Director: Jim Jarmusch  Movie rating: PG  Review: For a film that's half comedy, half romance, The Lost Brothers offers one of the most original takes on the classic genre. Director Jim J.armuschin (his directorial debut was the cult hit A Wild Sheep Chase), follows an ex-cop who's forced to team up with a woman, a woman who looks exactly like his sister-in-law, and a woman with whom he was never particularly close. Jarmuselin sets a darkly comedic tone by following this bizarre, dysfunctional family of misfits in their daily lives as they slowly fall out of step with one another. Despite all the twists and turns, The Last Time I Saw Paris and The Last Day in the Woods provide a very engaging look at the ups and downs that are found in any family unit. —Giorgio Amadei  The Lost Brothers is a film about the struggles of two brothers. Their family is going through a difficult time, and that's the first obstacle for Alex and Sam (Ben Chaplin and Tim Blake Nelson). It's also the last, because, in the end, their family is united and happy. The final scene reveals that both brothers have been living in a small cabin that they built for themselves, and it's there that they have their final moment together: they are embracing each other, the last thing they've had to do. They say goodbye to one another, and then they both fall asleep.  This scene is also where The Lost Boys gets its name: after they had to break up, they came up with the idea to create a "lost brother," the one who had become lost. This is how Jarmuschen's film begins: Sam and Alex are back in college, trying to start a family, and one day, they run into Sam's sister (Amanda Seyfried) at the party. She's been living with her boyfriend (James Franco) and, in their words, "trying to forget about his stupid life." This seems like a nice, warm family for Sam and his girlfriend to visit.  the last night i saw this i felt like it was very sad as the characters had such
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  *Don't be afraid to ask questions about this review; I'm always happy to address questions and help clarify things I might've misunderstood. * Don't be ashamed to ask about sequels: They happen. If you're a fan of the movie and want to see what happens to the characters after, I'd love to write a sequel. If it's a great movie, I'll certainly write a follow-up. * If you love this movie, go see it again. It's one of the best in this genre. * I recommend buying the DVD or Blu-ray: It's definitely worth it, especially if you want to watch it at home, even if the movie is in a high definition version.  Signature: We've all been there. You think that your favorite movie is just too good to be true, and you're willing to suspend disbelief to enjoy it. You're also not too much of a perfectionist, but maybe you want a bit of everything. That's where this movie comes in. It contains a little bit of every single genre imaginable in a very simple but very effective way: It delivers on its promise, even as the plot moves through the various sub-genres with speed, intensity, and unexpectedness. If this movie could be as good as it looks, I'm pretty sure it would be the only movie you would ever want to enjoy again. This movie takes advantage of every ounce of potential, and has no qualms about using that potential as leverage. That is the essence of what I have to say about it: This movie delivers. It is simply one of those rare occasions where all the elements that make a great story work in combination are so finely aligned that the whole thing just clicks. So I'm giving it a four out of five stars. Now let's take a closer look at the plot. Plot: The plot starts out a bit convoluted, with several people involved who are clearly in on something. What follows is an intricate plot with multiple layers, some of which may make more sense as the movie progresses. The plot doesn't make much sense at first, but the story does. What I like is that there is a sense that something big is going to happen eventually, that it may involve a lot of people. But the movie doesn't waste time on unnecessary twists or character introductions. The characters don't seem shoehorned in like you'd expect from a movie that is so

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________   I'm getting into the spirit of the film's tagline this week by mentioning that "there are no easy answers" in "There is Only Love". The tagline was written in 1969, when the film was being made, and, as you'll see in the review below, it doesn't necessarily reflect the film as we now see it. It does, however, capture the film perfectly, as it perfectly captures the feelings of a lover's heart, a life, a place, a home, the love of a child, and so much more. And if you feel like you've seen this film, you haven't seen it: The main character is a young girl named Auri, played with a childlike innocence and wonder by an incredibly talented young actress named Naomi Watts. I won't give away too much about her backstory, since it's just too good.  The story begins in 1970, in New York City. Auri's parents, an Indian immigrant and a woman who is very much an artist (and is apparently very skilled at making watercolors and drawing), are living in a loft that she rents from an artist named David (Ethan Hawke). Auri is living with her aunt in this loft (you'll soon learn that she had a very happy childhood in India, having been taken in by her aunt's family). In 1970, Auri and David are lovers, though David is not technically Auri. He's more of a friend, and he has a sister who is living in New Jersey. David has his own apartment with his girlfriend, and she is his only sister. She lives in another city, and her family has no idea that he and Auri are lovers.  is more of an "in-your-face" film with a very straightforward message: Don't be afraid to love and be loved. There are no answers, no "good" or "bad" guys, no good or bad endings, just love. It is, of course, a very difficult subject matter, because it is so much about who we are and what we have to go through to get there. Aoi is a strong girl, and Naomi Watts' Auri has a very complex and complex life, and even if you don't like this movie you will learn something about yourself and love in the process.  (And let's just say that if you like Aoi's life and what she goes through, it is

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Let it be the movie that you see with the highest rating on IMDb.com.  This is so important, because every movie will get a different review.  Let's talk about the difference between positive reviews and critical reviews.   When a movie gets a positive rating on average from critics, this is a great thing!   Critics can give the movie high scores and say it's great.  It can make it even more accessible to new movie-goers.  When a movie makes it to the silver screen with a rating of Rotten Tomatoes of 80%, it can be the worst movie ever made.  And while some are shocked to see this rating, it doesn't mean it's bad.  These are just general averages from the critics that have reviewed the movie.  This means that there are many, many bad movies on IMDB.com that receive positive ratings from critics.  I've seen a lot of movies that got a rating from critics that are in the top 10 on RottenTomatoes.com, so the rating doesn't guarantee it's a good film.   What do you know?  There is nothing wrong with a movie that has great ratings.  The only thing wrong with this is if you have seen the movie and think the rating is inaccurate.  For example, I don't think the movie The Hangover  was good, so I would never give it a positive Rotten Tomato rating.  However, because of the success of The Hang Over, I do believe this was a good flick.  Rotten tomatoes ratings are only one part of a movie's popularity.  If you were to look at the IMDB ratings and the movie's box office, you would have to look closely at the ratings to find the true greatness of the movie!  So what's the solution?  Stop using IMDB as the first place you look for a movie, and stop using the Rotten TOMatoes as a secondary tool.  Now that I've made some changes to the way I use IMDB, I've noticed that people seem to have less of a problem when movies get a high rating on the website.  But that is only because a few people are getting too caught up in ratings and not enough on the movies.  So just know that IMDB will only give a thumbs up if you actually watch the movie, not whether or not you agree with the ratings. And let me tell

B:    "I don`t care about this film at all." It all boils down to what works for you. This was a movie for me because it was a low key, fun movie. You just go and get the popcorn and don't worry about anything else. I saw it a week later on my birthday and it didn't seem like that bad of a movie to me. There was a lot of action and a lot going on, but the thing that stood out to me most about it was the story. A great movie can't make you look up how to make the best popcorn. It needs to make you smile. That is the most important part. It could also be a great movie if it had better characters. I know that this film has a great story, but there was one character in it that really irritated me. The only character in this movie that made me think 'Oh no!', was the evil genius Dr. Zaius.  What annoyed me the most was when the audience was looking at the villain, which is a little silly, but that is a whole other story. He was also the only character that could have been a little more developed. I just think that his character was a little out of place and a little ridiculous, but overall, this was a fun movie to watch. This movie wasn't anything outstanding, but it was decent.  Rating: B-

Member   Posts: 12  New release (2015): The Hunger (TV) Quote Select Post  Select Post Deselect Post  in Post    Deselect post Link to Post  of 1 New Release (2015) The Hunger TV  Watch Now (VOD)   A group of high school girls, led by their school's popular cheerleader, find themselves at a crossroads when their best friend disappears under mysterious circumstances. What begins as a series of grisly murders escalates into a battle between two generations, one that threatens to destroy the lives of the people closest to them and the girl who might save them all...   An older and wiser character, an older woman, plays a more pivotal role in the film. With a very different story line, the characters seem to move along at a steady pace, and the overall story seems to follow the old school school formula, albeit without a lot of the camp.  - A lot of characters are introduced, and it's very easy to become attached to them, as they all seem to have something special about them. I'm a sucker for relationships, and these characters were all very sweet to watch develop.  .   of 1 (of 4) New Release  Posts : 519  Reputation : 0  Join date : 2014-07-02  Age : 28  Location : USA  Woody  6192014-072Jul 201428USA  Subject: Re: The Hunger review/plot thread Sat Aug 21, 2015 7:38 pm Subject: Re:[The Hunger review] The Hunger plot thread (Spoiler Free) Sat Aug21, 20157:38 am I'm actually not sure if I should even put up spoilers for this movie, because you can read the plot threads online, and I really don't want to spoil the ending. I'll just say this: it's not bad, it's good, and if it didn't happen on this planet, there's a good chance it would happen some other. I like how the plot seems to develop and branch off in a way that it won't happen again.   the beginning of the movie seems pretty straightforward, but

What does it mean to be able to be satisfied with a good film? _________________... [insert any question that may appear in this text box] What is wrong with a film that makes you angry? _________________________________. The film will end on a positive note The ending is not as important as the journey and this may mean it's the movie you have already seen a million times, but it's something you will remember. And it can make a difference to you and your friends if it's not as bad as you imagined it to be.  The first half of the movie is boring, but once it starts it becomes fun, and you will enjoy the whole movie and its characters. But at the last minute the movie gets really interesting and you can see how it's like it was all a dream!  I'll give a short example, if you have not seen it yet, you should give it a try to find out what it's about:  I don't know what's the difference between a vampire and a werewolf, it's one in the movie, and that's it. But if you've seen it, you know that in the final part of the film, the werewolf transforms into a vampire (but we don't see that). This is when it all comes together and the movie turns into a masterpiece.  I also have the impression that you are watching something that hasn't been shown before, a new vampire movie or werewolf movie.   This is a reason to give this movie a chance.  And if you're like me, and think it's too much for this small budget, you can just skip it and leave it as it is.    And the ending is so well done, I had no desire to find the next part to watch.                                                       - And that's all, the short review I've written here for you. It might look like a lot of words, but for the time I've spent reading the words on the screen, this movie was nothing but good. It has some problems like the "spoiler" (to me this is a spoiler), but as it was made for people who haven't seen it before, I'm really not upset about this, because they should find something they want to see in this

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________   I love this movie. The acting is great. The cinematography is just perfect for this movie, you know the look of a Hollywood movie. I think a lot of people will go in and out of this movie without really thinking about what is happening. But if you think about the movie, and the characters in it, there is a lot going on here. There is a good story with an interesting cast and great writing. The ending was fantastic. It was an emotional goodbye that I don't think I have heard in a movie yet. There was an action scene after the good thing and a great scene to end the movie with.   This movie is a movie I would like to see again, and I recommend it to anyone.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   Here's one:  "I think they are very talented, they seem very comfortable with themselves and with each other. They are a perfect pair. They have that chemistry that you have seen in a million Hollywood romances."   But some people are too picky and critical and only care about the plot or some other minor detail.  So I'll give you my personal experience and this is not the right movie for you.  is a good film. It's funny, it's romantic, it has heart, it touches on life, it will probably take you out of your comfort zone.But some (very few) people are very picky, and even though it's a good romantic comedy it's very hard to watch it with them.Some people hate the movie. Some people hate everything about it. It may be the film's most difficult aspect to some, it may not be.I've read some of the negative reviews and read some really good ones. And I can confirm they're all true. Some reviewers were so negative about the movie that even though they loved it, they couldn't watch it.And then there are those who thought it was too complicated, the characters didn't work for them and were difficult to like. But you will watch it, you may dislike the movie, but you'll watch it and maybe like it. You can never be sure.But here's my opinion.is an average comedy. It has some good moments. It was a great idea for a movie, an excellent cast, wonderful story and script. But some people didn't like it because they were overly critical of the movie and thought it lacked heart or didn't connect to them emotionally. But I didn't know it. I didn to like it, and I do. I liked the idea of a love story, and that's a rare thing these days.It's a very romantic film, but it doesn't follow that genre template that we've become used to. It isn't a romantic comedy at all. It does have romance, but that's not the driving plot. It doesn't feel that way in the beginning. You get a feel for the characters very quickly and you start to care about them. I loved the romance. I just wish it wasn't so hard to like, because I think it could be very interesting to watch with some people. And in spite of its romantic aspect, I just didn't find it a very funny

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  "This was my first time watching any movie that had a female protagonist so I wasn't sure what to expect. I think I went in kind of expecting a bit of a romance movie, which is something that I love. What I got instead was an epic fantasy that was amazing. I was impressed with the characters and the world they lived in, and I was shocked at how well acted. Even though I didn't see the sequel, I have watched the first one three times. I highly recommend it and highly recommend watching it again! You won't be disappointed! - S."
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ And don't use "not" in the title, because we all know where that gets you. The film:   Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan  (aka. A New Hope )   The writer:  William Shatner The director:  the-first-star-in-his-class-William-Shatner (aka. James Blish ) The stars:   Leonard Nimoy, Jr., William Shatners, DeForest Kelley, George Takei, Leonard Nimoys, Jr. This movie is one of the best of the modern era. It is a film with many stories, both in regards to characters and plot. The story follows a new captain (Kelley) and his first officer (Takei) as they lead a group of ships and people on a mission to save Earth from certain destruction.  As the film goes on, the captain is forced to accept some very personal knowledge about himself (such as his father's role in saving the ship) and begins to realize just how much he really does not know about what is happening.  The sound:  A wonderful soundtrack for a film such as this.   As the first Star Trek movie, it is important to have a strong score for the film.   A lot of the music in this movie is very simple and effective.  But the sound effects in the film have some of the most effective, impressive sound effects ever recorded.  An example of this is the sound of the shuttlecraft taking off from a planet.  This shot is played over and over throughout the film and is just an amazing sound.  The only thing I wish they had done a little better was to play the sound over and again when Spock is talking to Kirk (that's really what it's all about) but that's about it.  As stated above, this film is also one of, if not THE best of all time in terms of writing and acting.  William Shatsner is, in my opinion, the best actor that ever lived.  His performances have been compared to the best films of the 1970s.   I am so glad I was able to watch this movie when I was a little kid because it changed my life.  So, if you are looking for something to pass time on a Saturday night (or during the middle of the night on Sunday), look no further.  It will change

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great comedy, I loved the humor, and the cast made me laugh.  The pacing and plot is great.  Read a negative review about something bad:  I love horror movies but I usually hate them (like The Ring or the old Dracula).  The more you talk about this, the more it is going to get me!   I had to do a google search because I didn't know what I was talking about.  I got this video and was really surprised that people who said it was crap would actually rate it.   You don't have to tell me about this or anything, I can do it. What you did not know about this is that this was a remake of an old film called, The Thing.  When I saw the trailer I thought it was so bad, it looked like the movie was made by the same team that made the first one and that they took the movie and gave it to this new cast.  This was so far from the truth.  The original cast, and this new team took the script and made some changes.  These new actors did a great job.  You would not believe how good the acting was in this remake.  There are even better parts of this film that you would not expect.  If you love horror and have a bad day then give this a chance.  And if you haven't seen it, I would highly suggest you get it, it is worth your time.  What did I think?  I loved it.   I do not think it is my favorite remake of a movie, but it is certainly my favorite horror movie of all time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the best movie i have seen so far in 2017 In summary:   This is a really great movie with a wonderful story and wonderful characters.   The movie tells us a story that is filled with drama, emotions, sadness, and heart breaking.   It is a story of people with something to prove.   And it shows the true beauty of what it means to be a person.   But the movie is not perfect as the pacing and the story itself is really bad and rushed.   I am looking forward to the next movie to see how it is going to end.   If the movie makes it to the 2018-2019 season I will give it a 9.   Rating:    7 out of 10

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________  A good movie might have a bad rating because it is bad. You can't know what will happen in a movie until you see it, and the negative reviews have an effect on the box office, so the studios try to make movies that people will go see. But a good film has a bad review and the boxoffice will go up because people are going to see it.  An example of a good or bad movie is the one above. In the movie the people make a movie about a girl who loves her parents. The first bad review, is for a little kid who is in the movie. The kids' parents and a movie producer have a falling out, and she decides to leave home. The kid decides to go and play in the woods and gets a dog. But he never gets his dog back. So in the second bad review she runs off to find a dog, but they never found her dog. /End rant. .  the boxofficemojo.com review :  The most interesting and enjoyable movie of this summer so far, "Tulip Fever" has been getting better each day since I watched it last week. In fact, there is little that is good or interesting about this film. The film has everything the directors were looking for, which were a good story, a good storyline, and a good cast. The director of the film is John G. Minton. Mention Minton's name and the first thing that comes to mind is the name John Wayne. Well, the director of this film is also a fan of the old western movies and he decided to make a western. A lot of people say that this film was influenced by "Stagecoach" (which was also written by Minton) and this movie is pretty much based on the story and some dialogues in "Stage Coach". But this film isn't really about "StageCoach" or "Stage Fever". This movie is a story about a man who was born and raised in the Wild West and he never grew up, and he has all the attributes that make a man a good hunter, a man of action, a gun expert and a real character. This movie doesn't really have any dialogues about how good the people in the West were. Instead, there are some dialogs that are about some action scenes (which are very much about the hunting). It has an interesting plot that is based on real

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" isn't just a good action film but also a smart, thoughtful sci-fi flick that's filled with clever nods to the past and present. I won't ruin the surprises for you since spoilers are obviously very important to me. I'll just tell you that "The Last Jedi," in its own way, is the best sequel to any movie ever. It's so good I can't take it out of the theater. So here's to "The Force Awakens."  The film centers on the return of Han Solo and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) to the galaxy they once called home. After a series of unfortunate events, they find themselves stranded on a remote world where the ancient culture is living in harmony with nature. This new civilization is led by Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and his band of rebel soldiers. But when their ship is attacked by the First Order and all hope of escape is lost, the heroes must find a way to bring the Resistance's fleet back to the Resistance base and face the formidable Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).  In many ways, "TheLast Jedi" is a bit of a sequel. "The First Order" was released in 2015. I'm sure that there were other ways to tell this story but Abrams seems to have thought of them all. I also think the ending of the film is very different from that of "The Empire Strikes Back" and the new movies.  I could go on but the rest is up to you and "The Dark Knight" trilogy and "Memento." . I was so excited to see the new movie. "Star Wars" is my favorite film series and I've read the novels as well as the comics. I've never seen the films and I'm now more excited than I have been for a long time. And Abrams' direction and performances are incredible.  the movie looks beautiful and I love how it combines modern special effects with the old effects that were so good. It is the perfect blend of old with new and I know there are many fans who will enjoy this. I hope that people enjoy this as much as I did. The film is rated PG-13.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ ( ) * * * I enjoyed my time at the 2015 TIFF. I did not go to my usual haunts (the Roxy Theatre, Scotiabank Theatre) but I did have the opportunity to attend the Fantasia International Film Festival which had a great lineup. I highly recommend attending the Fantasica International Film Fest as they have a great collection of films which range from the current and upcoming to classics. It is a good event that goes up and down so check it out if you plan on going. I enjoyed watching the films they screened, they do not disappoint. However I do not usually go to the FantaFest as I am not familiar with the films and I found myself feeling bored and a bit bored with the schedule. The movies are quite similar and it is hard to go from one to the next. If there is one thing that I would recommend is to keep an eye on the list of films so you know what is on the schedule as you will not know what to expect. I will try to attend next year but if this year was any indication I do plan on checking out the FantastiCulture Festival so if you want to check it you will have to wait until then. Overall I would highly recommend going to a film festival such as the TIFF because they are not just great films, but great films that you may have never seen or have seen before. I hope this review was helpful and if you have any questions please do not hesitate to comment below! I have always enjoyed writing reviews and I hope that you enjoyed my review as well!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________   For my first year in the US, I was a student in a foreign country, studying in a strange country. In order to survive, I had to learn a new language and adapt to a completely different way of life, and in order to do that I needed to have someone to keep me company.   I didn't have any friends back then, and if I had, I would have been miserable. I just had my books, my music and a notebook, and at the end of the day I knew I could rely on the kindness of those around me to help me survive.  .  I was so grateful for the friendship that my first friend, a beautiful girl from Italy, showed me during my first week in America. , she has been my best friend from that time on. After that first week, she became my first and only true friend. I always looked forward to seeing her and her beautiful smile.  "Dear, I can't believe I'm going to be in your country for the first time in the life of me!" she would always say, as I left her apartment in Florence for my first day in the States.   I was so nervous and didn't even know what to say.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________  5/5 stars  Cathy Taggart (the film's co-director and co-writer)  I have a confession. I didn't realize this movie had any reviews until I got home and started watching it.  It is definitely worth watching. I had seen it on television before, but I was skeptical that people actually like it so much. I wanted to write a good review, but there was something wrong. .  on my shelf right now, so it will be my first review since I've been watching films for about a year.  and I'm not the only one that has noticed that.    My husband and I just discovered this documentary this week and we started the viewing. I love the fact that it's a good, good movie. I like the fact there are so many different stories. I really enjoyed watching the movie.   As a documentary it has some issues, but they aren't huge issues. There's not a lot of "jaw dropping" moments, but it does the job of showing just how the world of filmmaking works and how much has been learned over the last 100 years.   to start, there are some great documentaries on Netflix that are just the most recent ones made, but the one that stood out to us was "Gone Girl". It's such a gripping and well-made piece of storytelling and I would not be surprised if it got nominated for some awards. So, I watched "GONE GIRL". I know not a whole lot about it. I don't know if people were impressed by it or not. However, the film is a great one, so we watched it.   for the first time, I realized how much the people in Hollywood do have influence on the film industry.   "GONGLY" is the documentary that got me hooked on film. When I first started, it was just a documentary about the early days of the films. But it quickly became a love letter to film. I've watched "HAPPY" at least a dozen times. I just love how the filmmakers talk about film and how they have such deep knowledge. The cinematography of the film reminds me of "GODFATHER". I'm just going to be honest and say "GORE". I love how they make a connection to our current climate and why it's so important to understand how the environment impacts us. It makes you

I'm glad you liked it.  The only problem with "Bourne Identity" was that it got too confusing. The action scenes seemed to move in fast-forward, and at times it felt like there wasn't enough info being communicated.   The movie had plenty of action, but the character development didn't seem as developed. I also didn't feel that the story was well-developed. It felt like a fast-paced action flick rather than a story about a man searching for answers.   and the plot is like "The Bourne Identity".   Also, a huge plus for this movie is that there were so many great actors in it. I would love to see more movies made like this, as I really like the casting choices for the actors in this movie. Thanks for watching.   Thanks,John. I'm glad you loved it.The only problems with " Bourgeen Identity " was that they got too distracting. The plot was convoluted and had too many twists and turns. Also, the character developed were not as well developed as I felt they deserved.Also, at times, it felt that there wasn 't enough info to be communicated. The movie had lots of action scenes, but none of them felt that thrilling.Also the plot was like " The Bourne identity ".Also, I don't like movies that are made like that. Also there were no interesting characters. And lastly, I didn't like the ending. The finale was a complete let-down, and it did not make me feel any better.And a HUGE plus for the movie was that there was so many cast members. Also most of the movies these days use the same actors in the same roles. I guess that's what happens when you cast so many people. Also all the main characters had such a great chemistry, that they made the movie all the more exciting. Also the actors were amazing, but again, it was too much information being communicated at times.I also didn 't feel that there weren't enough answers being revealed. And finally, at the end, I still did not feel that this movie was worth the price.

Quote: *************I would like to share my opinion about the new "Shrek 2." It is a very well done remake with many original ideas. For instance, in the "Shark Tale," there are no CGI monsters, only live animals and other creatures. In this film, however, we get all the big CGI beasts and many animated characters. That's one of the things that I like. Also, the idea of the "bunny" and the "baby" that you can see in some pictures, is very nice and I like it. There are some people who say that this remake of the movie was the weakest of the franchise and that it is really not even a good remake. And I agree with them, but it's a remake that doesn't take the same place in your heart, so to speak. *********   I thought that this movie was very well acted. I thought that the music is really good. I can really see how they got the characters to look that way. I really enjoyed the original "Shrunken Head" and "Shankar," and I thought this new version was going to be something very similar. The plot and characters were very well thought out and it was very funny. I liked all the characters, including Fiona and Jason. The story has a lot of laughs and it is a good parody of all the other Disney movies. I like the characters and the storyline. I loved that the director used an original score. I also liked that this film took place in New Orleans. I am a little disappointed that the new director didn't use the original character of Fiona. She looked much more like Fiona in the original film than in this film.   This remake of "Shower With..." is a must see!  __________________ 08-23-2016, 03:09 AM #3 R.I was here Originally Posted by I thought the new head designer for the remake of Shrek was awesome!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The last great frontier of cinema  -Maurice Chevalier   'A beautiful planet with beautiful people, that's why they're in trouble.' -Jodie Foster   My Review: I have always loved sci-fi movies, and have always enjoyed watching them, so for me, this was a no brainer.   It's not easy, but I think the film succeeds in giving an original experience and keeping it simple. We get introduced to our lead characters through brief flashes of the world around them, but what really makes a movie is how you are connected to them. And what connects the audience to the story is their own imagination. It's up to the director to ensure that what is presented to us in the first 15 minutes is enough to get us hooked.  's story starts out promisingly. After seeing an advertisement for a new experimental medical treatment, they are immediately approached by the Director of their local hospital. The director brings some interesting information that he has discovered about the life of one of the patients, who has recently died of an incurable and terminal disease. The Director of the hospital also brings with him a young woman who looks to be very close to the patient. I will say right off the bat that I'm a fan of this, so it seems that's the focus of the film. The doctor also introduces them to a young girl and her father who were just recently diagnosed with cancer. The father, a young man, has an idea about how to cure his daughter, and the two are able to work together to achieve it. Unfortunately for the father, the medicine that he developed turns out to be highly dangerous and not so effective on the mother and daughter. But in the end, all is not lost.  -The young woman's life is saved by the new medical treatment and after a short period of recovery, she is back at school. The story then shifts from the doctors perspective to that of the young woman and her family. It does not seem like they are the only ones in trouble and she is also very worried about her father. The film doesn't let us know much more about the mother of the child, or where exactly the story goes from here. The family has a new house and it's just now that the young girl is getting used to the new family. All seems well for the family and their lives are fine. Except one thing: the father of the patient has somehow fallen asleep
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I would love to hear from you. What's your favorite movie? I love action movies like The Fast and the Furious, The Bourne Identity, Transformers, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Fast Five, The Avengers, Superman and the other Marvel Movies. I love dramas like Titanic, The Dark Knight, The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit. My least favorite movie are the crappy 80s Movies. It's all the "I can't believe this movie is being made" "This movie is really bad, I just don't like it" movies. I hate movies about celebrities (like The Wedding Singer), I hate all musicals, I hate most of the comedies and the movies about people who are not famous. I will watch a good old fashioned family movie if I can find one, if I see a decent one, I will skip the other ones. I like movies about animals (mostly cats and dogs) I also like movies where a boy and a girl fall in love. Movies about women (like Pretty Woman, Thelma and Louise, Mean Girls, Clueless) are boring to me. I also don't care for sports movies, I like sports dramas, even though they are pretty bad. I do like bad movies, they are just boring to watch, but I don't mind if there's a good joke in it. I'm a total action junkie and I love it when there are explosions, so don't get me wrong if you say I like bad, but most of them I don,t like it that much. Movies that are about bad guys, like The Departed, The Usual Suspects, Goodfellas, The Da Vinci Code, and The Town where the bad guys are the good guys, but the story is about the good guy, and they make it bad. All the best movies are also movies that are not in the genre of action, but more about human interaction. Movies like Annie Hall, The Lion King, The Incredibles, and A League of Their Own. Movies with themes are always great to watch: Love stories, family, good vs evil, love, death, and so on. Movies I haven't watched so far, but that I want to. Movies where I can only guess, are also pretty interesting. I don`t really have any favorites, and I don `t really care what people think. I just like to watch movies, and if there is something I don

It's easily the most entertaining film in the Disney canon. The story is simple, the humor is sharp, and the acting is great. In addition, the animation is absolutely brilliant, and it's truly impressive how it matches the song and the sound. What's more, the musical numbers, while they aren't the best of the entire film, are still hilarious. This movie will certainly be on everyone's "must see" list. __________________________________________________________________________ ______________________  __________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  Nathan  Lambent of Spirit   Posted - 2009.10.16 22:05:00 - [16]  I have just played the new version of this game (and a few others) and it does make some interesting changes to the game that I like.   One is the fact that in this version they are going for a more "realistic" approach and the game's difficulty settings are now in the game (they are there in previous versions too but not always in a way that you can see).   Another thing I found to be very fun is how you can use your shield as a weapon when shooting and that you have no time to aim or shoot if you think your enemy is going to use an EMP attack.   with the shield in hand, I find I can shoot out my shield and I just blast them before they can use that attack. I really like that aspect of this new game.  , as they use the same models as the old version of the game but have improved controls and UI.I have not tried this version on PC, but I have heard good things about it. The new version makes some changes that really enhance the feel of the ship/station as the shields no longer act as an annoyance but now serve as a great defensive tool that gives you an advantage when firing on a turret or when using your guns to shoot the enemy. It also brings in a new "Empire" that you fight during the game, that is not a faction like in the old game but one that represents the federation that is also involved with the Alliance and this Empire will fight to destroy you if you have a fleet of stations, fighters and capital ships that are on the attack.You fight the Federation with fighters, you fight the Alliance with capital ships and capital turrets and you fight a mysterious Empire called the "Klingon" which is not really present in the original but is more or less the same as the ones you fought in the previous game and there are two types of ships in this one: frigates and fighters, and they each have different abilities.You get to build one station for each mission, and you will also get to choose a different design to your ship. The station design also gives you different stats for each type of ship. They are not as easy to customize as the design in the earlier version, but they make some great choices, especially if you like some of the other models in

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Play Video   "Warm Bodies" Trailer - Will Smith stars in the film, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival this week. (Courtesy of Universal Pictures) More  There are many reasons why this film is not a big success, but at the most basic level, the script is so bad. Smith is a man who's spent his entire life building and maintaining a vast fortune from his role as the star of some of the biggest movies ever made, and when you get to the heart of the story, all that he does is build a giant wall and hire a bunch of guys to kick him and his friends out. The idea that a wealthy black man in Los Angeles is going to be able to keep a large chunk of his money is mind-boggling — particularly when you consider that Smith has been in this town his whole life, and the only black people he's ever interacted with are cops, who are constantly harassing him. When Smith and the guys he's hired kick in the doors, the scene is filled with the kind of tension that you don't see in a typical Hollywood action movie. But it's so un-mature and cringeworthy that, with its bad script, the movie just makes you want to scream. It's really just an embarrassment.  I'm sure that "Grown Ups 2" will have many fans, and that it will gross well enough for Universal to make $250 million domestically. Smith will probably be able bring a movie like this to the big screen — he's already got two huge franchises under his belt — but it's hard to believe that he'll have much impact on the American film industry.  of the last quarter of the 1980s.  a movie in which Smith stars and co-writes (and directed)  Here's what we know about "Grew Ups 2."  • It's written by Will Ferrell.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ If you're going to review this post please do it here: [This review is copyrighted to the author, All Rights Reserved.] I have a confession: I didn't love "Star Wars: The Last Jedi". In fact, I have a very hard time believing that I would even want to see this "Star War" installment. This is a movie about a group of rebels who are not at war with the empire, a group whose aim is just to stay alive. If you look at it that way, it doesn't really add up. It doesn't make sense. That's why I'm writing this review. "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" was a bad movie. It's bad enough to be banned in a few states. I'm talking about the good "Star Treks", the ones where the captain never says "It's a trap" and the best actors ever play their part. I also know that I can't talk about "StarTrek: The Movie" without mentioning "StarWars: The Empire Strikes Back", a movie that had more than enough flaws but made up for them by delivering one of the most memorable, emotionally draining, and emotionally satisfying action sequences of all time. As much as I have loved every movie of George Lucas and his cast, "The Last Jedi" is far and away the worst movie of the trilogy, and it's clear from watching it that the people behind the movie were not happy with the story they were telling. I really hate to say this, but this movie's biggest flaw is that it was the least fun I have ever had watching a film. The plot is the movie's most important factor. Even when you're bored and can't care about anything, it's better to watch "The Force Awakens" than this "TheLast Jedi". When I'm not bored, the best part of a film is the characters and their interactions. Here, they were terrible. I couldn't care less about any of the characters. I felt no connection to any of them, and I never will. I wish I was joking. When we're talking about bad "Star-Wars" movies, I am referring to the ones that are more about the plot than the characters: "The Phantom Menace", "Attack of the Clones", "Revenge of the Sith", "The Empire Strikes Out", "A New Hope", "Saving Private Ryan", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "Ind
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  It doesn't have to be that way.  If you're the type of person who just reads movie reviews and doesn't even watch them, and doesn ist like to have opinions, this article is for you. If you are one of these people and really do love film, then go read these reviews on The Daily Beast, The Atlantic, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, or go read the comments section of most articles about movies, you will find a wide array of great opinions on movies. , and are just as valid. If all those people all think the same, then what makes you think you're any better than them? Don't you think? You have to make up your own mind, don't you? That's what a movie is. If there's a bunch of people who like the same thing but they have different opinions on it, there has to be something wrong with those opinions. So if you really believe that "this movie is so bad that it's good," then you should watch it. If I thought there was some special meaning in that movie, I would not watch it myself, right? Right? What does it say about you if you don't like that movie? If the movie was so bad, I'd be glad I didn't see it. That's the best answer you can give me to that question. The only difference between "bad" movies and "badly made" movies is the audience. So now you understand how you should view movies. Go out and see the movie and read the reviews. Then tell me what you think. How about if I give you some tips on how to see a movie for free? Well, for one, go out and find a theater and buy a ticket. If it's too expensive, go see it at a mall. If the theater is too far from your house, go watch it at your house. You don't need to rent or pay for a movie; you don a movie a movie, as long as you are there and paying for it. I'm not saying that you should go to an old theater or rent from your friends and watch that movie for no reason. Go, do something! Just go. Go to see the film, because if you go and watch the film and then leave after five minutes, your view will not be improved. You have only seen a tiny fraction of the film. It's better if you see

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ It's not that I don't believe in the concept of a movie with a happy ending (I still do) or a movie that is a perfect representation of its genre (I know they exist). It's that I'm not looking for it. I have my favorites, and I love to see their flaws, and then I go back and watch them again. I'm a fan of films with dark themes or a great cast. I know that I can only really get to know a great film from the second or third viewing. I've spent a lot of time complaining about films that I think aren't good, and watching them again the next day makes me regret that decision. A good film will leave you with something to think about. If it leaves you feeling like you had fun, then you did good. If you leave you feeling empty and feeling like something you didn't like, then it's a poor film. If a film leaves you with nothing, I consider it a failure. That's what I get for watching a bunch of crap films every year. There's just not that many good ones. I feel like that's where the problem lies, is when there's just too much shit on screen and not enough good stuff to go around.  _________________________________________  What's next for you?   As for movies, I'm pretty into the new indie horror film The Invitation, and there's a new anthology horror film I'm working on called It Will Be Blood. I also have a new feature film called The Sink. My next project is a horror movie called "The Invitation" that I wrote with Mike Vogel and Dan Caffrey and my friend Jason Eisener. I will be writing and directing it as well, and we will be producing and doing the editing. I shot it for just over $1,500 and am now getting it ready for digital release. My producer, Mike Vogelman, and my director, Dan Caffein, are also involved and will be working on it on the production end as well. I just did the soundtrack for a short film I produced with my friend Justin Chon and Mike Vogler called "Hanging Tree". It's an adaptation of a short story I wrote called "Sink". I wrote it because I liked the concept, but I also knew I wanted to do it myself. I don the story with my co-writer and director Justin Chonsky, who

What's the point? It's great to be able to attend a major film event, but I think that if you do that only to be part of a big party, you're missing the point. I went to this event because it was a good event, and I think we should be looking at all of the different films and documentaries that were presented. I loved the variety of genres, I loved how each festival had a different atmosphere, and it all made for a very fun experience. For me, this was my chance to learn about more independent film as well as some of the "big name" releases that many people may not be familiar with. The diversity of films was the biggest reason I chose to attend.

I think the one time she had to take me to the doctor for the first time, she brought the tissues and wiped my tears off on them. My first day in school I cried so hard. My grandma told me not to cry. So I cried, and I cried some more. My brother told me I should stay away from the doctor, but I had to go. I had no one to stay with and I went with my parents and we had to get my brother in bed. When my mom saw me crying she screamed at me "Stop crying or I will call the doctor!" And I knew she was right, she would have called the doctor.

My parents bought me this old VHS and I would just watch it over and over and it was such a dream. So, when I was a teenager, my mom was in the car and I was looking at all the movies and it had some Star Wars and Star Trek and all that, so she just told me that I should see those.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  (2) If there is a film you want to see but you aren't sure whether or not you want it, but you do want to enjoy a film or TV show you watch, and there are a couple of options you could see it, the first is to go to a movie theater to see a "closed" movie or "locked" TV show, and to tell the theater you are a fan of it and have seen it before, and if you like it you would like to see it again. (3) Or, if you have the time and are willing to sit through a movie or TV series several times to see different takes on a plot and different points in time, you can go to Netflix and choose to watch the first episode or two, and in a few days (if you're willing to wait) you will be able to find a new way to see that film.  Here are some other interesting facts about Netflix and movie fans:  One out of every four US Netflix users is a "Netflix-only" customer. - The most popular films (from films released in the last seven years) and TV series in the US are: , the blockbuster that came out in 2011; (4) The most watched movies on Netflix are: (1) The Dark Knight Rises, (2) The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, (3 ) The DarkKnight, (4 ) Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, (5) the sequel to The Dark Knights Rises (2006); (6) The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, (7) The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, (8) The Hangover Part 3 ; (9) the third installment to the Pirates of the Caribbean series; and (10) the first installment to The Hangovers.

It wasn't written for the film industry  Even if the movie wasn't aimed at the film and television industry, it would have been a waste of time. The director of the film was an unprofessional and a complete fuck up who couldn't get any support from anyone.  2. It's basically a horror/thriller  The movie has only two horror/torture scenes and one torture scene. Even with that, it still wouldn't qualify as horror/horror. It would be better to describe it as torture porn. , even after the film has already been finished. The only scenes that is disturbing are the ones between the characters.The plot is quite simple, yet it has more twists and turns than you would expect from a "movie". The reason for the plot is the relationship between the two lead characters. For the love interest, the film doesn't follow a romance because she isn't in love with him. The movie was supposed to show him to the audience the true nature of his character. There is also a good villain and he is portrayed very well. The reason I give it a 7/10 is the fact that the movie has several scenes that just have no relation to the story.The film starts with the love-interest in the middle of a bad date. She is walking to the subway and gets some good news, when she gets on a train, she starts to notice people getting off the train. While she is walking down the train, someone is shooting a pistol in front of her. She jumps out of the car and starts chasing the gunman. He is wearing a white hoodie. She runs into the subway car and he jumps in, she doesn't catch him because she is already in his way. The film is based on a novel called. There are two more scenes in this movie where the love and the villain are separated, however, neither is very memorable. The main theme in the movie is how the two characters fall in love, it's a very depressing thing to see.The second half of the movie starts after the loveinterest is in the hospital. The protagonist gets angry and starts a car chase. He crashes into a school bus, but a policeman saved him. He gets out of his car and tries to escape the school. The school bus is full of children

My name is Taryn, and I want to introduce myself as a critic who is willing to review ANYTHING. I have never reviewed a movie before, and therefore I would like to create this new blog where we can review all movies. My blog will cover movies, television, music, and other things that I feel are important to review. I will do my best to give each movie a fair review. So, let's get started. ____________________________ | Hello! My name's Taryn. I just saw "The Lego Movie". I was so impressed with the story, the characters, and the music. I loved it! The story was also really funny, and was a great way to end the first half of the movie! The animation was also top notch, and made me feel like I was watching an animated film. The characters were also fun to watch. _________________________________________________________________ | So, I was just like everyone else when I first saw the movie, "The LEGO Movie". You know how people talk about movies in the beginning like "I know there's only one song, but I'm excited to watch it!" Yeah, I know. But, "Lego" is not really a song that I like when I watch movies. In fact, I usually hate songs like that. The story is amazing though, and is one of the reasons I loved the movie so much. The animation is also great, and that is the thing I enjoyed the most. ____________________ | I know that this is going to be a bit long, but just imagine watching a movie that you like, and then having someone else review the movie for you. For instance, you watch "Divergent" and you enjoy the story. Now, you go into the movie expecting something different, but then you watch the movie and realize that the story is actually amazing. But now you want someone to review it and tell you why you should watch it even if you hate the story or if the music is awful. You can tell someone that you watched "DuckTales" and that you enjoyed

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  This is a movie that I have seen, but I can't say I'm a huge fan. It does have good action scenes and a great storyline, and I think it is one of the better movies based on the Batman series. However, I feel that there is a very small and obvious "bad vibe" to this movie. I understand that there are many fans of the Dark Knight, and you really need to see the movie in order to enjoy it, but the movie didn't really have a lot to offer me. The acting was really good, but there was something missing. I think this is due to the fact that they didn't give the Joker enough to do, and the movie seemed to be built around the relationship between Bane and Batman. This is, to me, where the movie was weakest. You can't really relate to either of these characters. This might have been the main problem with the movie. If you have watched any of the previous Dark Knight movies, you'll know how the Joker works. He will come in and have a short conversation with someone and then just go on his merry way. If he doesn't have any dialog, he just disappears, and it can get really boring. This was just a bit too repetitive for me. On the other hand, the action scenes were pretty good. The action scenes in this movie are definitely good, and if you aren't watching Batman vs. Superman, you should check this out.  7/10  Advertisements
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. If you like this movie, why not write a negative review about it? It's hard for someone who has seen this movie to know what the movie was like and why it's good, without being told. It's important to let people know how you feel. Also, people like to compare movies. Make a movie about a bad movie, and then watch it with people who have never seen it. That's how they find out what a bad film really is. People like to point out bad films to other people. Letting people see the film in the theater is an important part of the experience. This movie was not a bad experience, but it did have one very minor issue. It is a common problem for movies to have some issues with continuity. Sometimes, the director/screenwriter doesn't do their job right. Sometimes actors and actresses have to be replaced, sometimes entire scenes are cut out or changed, and sometimes the movie even has some actors/actresses do some scenes in another movie. If there are any problems in this movie for this reason, they were very minor and were not something you should really think about. You should still watch this movie. It has some great actors/ actresses and is very well made. I highly recommend you watch this film because I don't think I will ever be able to watch another movie quite like it again. This film has everything a movie should have and then some. It was a real film and not a TV special or a comic book. It didn't need to be an hour long movie to be a real movie. I think the ending is very satisfying and the film does end on a high note. You will probably go to bed happy after watching this film, so you have nothing to worry about. This is a real gem of a movie that you should watch and enjoy. If anything is wrong with this movie (and I've heard of at least one problem), don't worry. Just watch the whole thing and then tell me what it is that's wrong. There are a lot of good movies out there that aren't very good. There is no shame in having to see something that isn't very great, just don't go out of your way to complain about it. Read what other people have to say about the film and figure out if you like it. When you feel that you've found the film you like, you are ready to enjoy it again (maybe not for the entire time, just until the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ This movie really has it all. It is dark, scary, gory and heart breaking. It also has the best script ever written in horror and suspense. It was a very good start to the series of movies. I love the characters and love how all of them feel. My favorite character is Jason. He was the only one who I really cared about during the whole movie. The other characters don't get the screen time and the story gets lost in the story of the killer. It's very interesting that Jason's mom is killed and he must go look for her. It makes me wonder what would have happened if she was still alive? I can only imagine. The main reason for watching this movie was the script. The plot wasn't very complex but it was very well told. There were no jump scares, no action, and a good plot. This movie is very good but I think the ending is kind of a letdown. It should have been much longer. It didn't really give us closure but I guess we will never know. I have watched all of the movies in the series so far and I still don't know if I will watch the fifth one. There is always something new in the movies and I don't want to miss out on the next one. I think this movie has a good ending but it's a let down. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I will tell my friends about it and get them to watch it too. I highly recommend watching this awesome movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Loading... About This Movie  Animated films are always popular at the local theater and this one was no exception. The movie's main protagonist, Bob the bobcat, was a real cat and the rest of the crew was made up of real furball, the other creatures in the film. Bob the cat is in charge of his own life, but when he becomes aware that he is not going to be allowed to continue living with his loving owner, Bob's life will be turned upside down.  The main characters are very well written and made you want to help them in whatever way you can. Some of the things that you see happen are pretty strange, but that's why it was good to see them done so well. The ending was the best part and was perfect for that ending. The best part of the whole movie is when they bring back the cat that was dead. They were great at making this movie and it was the highlight of the movie. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone should see this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Would you recommend this movie to a friend? ___________ Would you like to see more of this movie? _________________   "I feel like I want to have a conversation with her, like she wants to talk to me," the boy said in the film's opening moments. But that conversation didn't go anywhere, and there was no way to make it go anywhere. So instead of trying to change the world, he turned the world against himself.   In this movie, it's the young boy's attempt to prove himself that ultimately fails, and in the process, he's revealed to be a pathetic, pathetic failure.   and, if you have never seen it, then here's the synopsis. So, let's dive in...   The movie starts out on a somewhat optimistic note. This is because our protagonist, the hero (played by Jaden Smith), is still young enough to still be in school, and because the boy who turns out to be his teacher is an amazingly charismatic woman. I was completely sucked in to Jaden's character, and to the fact that she was so likable.   of course she's a great teacher, but I also loved how she was able to relate to Jad's struggles, because she knew he had no one but himself to blame for the things that have been happening to him. She's even willing to let him have a moment of doubt, and come up with a plan to change. This just seemed like a real character arc, and it made me want to see where they went from there.  .But then, everything starts to fall apart.   The movie has a lot of good dialogue, and some good visual elements as well. This makes sense, because the story takes place at school.    But the dialogue, at least in the beginning, isn't exactly what I've come to expect from a story like this. Instead of having a lot going on, it was mostly the hero's internal dialogue that was important, because he would never talk out loud. The teacher, on the other hand, always talks about how the world "isn't what it used to be" and how the future is bleak. It really seemed as if they had forgotten to set up any backstory for the hero. He just wasn't developed enough to really make the connection that he had been in a tough situation for a long time. This wasn't exactly a bad thing, since it allowed us to see

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Write a bad review about the worst movie you've ever seen: _________________ This article is brought to you by the  Book of Mormon  (KJV). If you would like to buy a hard copy, you can find it  here. Book of mormon (KJV) is a wonderful book written by a devout Christian. It is my hope that this article will inspire you to read the book.   I believe there are several reasons why many people avoid reading the book of mormont. Most likely, they think it's just too long, too complicated, too hard to understand, or too scary. This article will show you that there is no reason to think that this book is too long. It's not hard to follow and it's certainly not complex. As you can see in the following picture, the Book of Moroni covers nearly 12 hours in one volume. If you divide the total length of the Book into smaller parts, you find that the text covers about three hours. Also, I found that the book was not as scary as it seems. I would like you to ponder what I found during my first few days of reading the Book. I found the book very interesting and I can't say that I didn't fear a few things at the start. The following is a list of things I didn�t know when I first read the Book:  I didn't know that Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior:   I knew that He is the Savior of the world and of all who follow His teachings. I knew that there are good people, including members of the Church, who have chosen to follow Christ and live a holy life and who are at a disadvantage compared to the rest of mankind because of their belief in Him. I didnít know that:        Jesus is the only way to heaven:  This is the second surprise that I found. I learned that Jesus is my Redeemer and Savior. He is my only hope and my only help in this world. He will save me. I will never have to worry about having a job, about money, or having someone to love me. Because of Jesus, I have faith in Him, I can pray to Him, and I have an eternal family. I also learned that I should fear death, because I will die and go to the Great White Throne. I don't know how I survived as long as I did. I believe that I am now
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ ____________ __________. _____________ _________.  How many times have you heard someone say, "There's no way I could've made that movie without him or her"? No one can believe this, of course. There must have been some sort of special connection, a "connection" that has to be made if there is going to be a movie. So, the guy or girl who worked on your movie? They're going to have a special connection with you? If so, don't be so sure! When you see these people at your film's premiere, you'll see what I mean. They're really, really excited. You'll know it. But then the director, who really did a good job on the movie? Don't be sure! I've met them all. They will do a fine job. They'll work their hearts out. You could give them a hundred million dollars. That would be an awful waste of money, because you know what's going to happen? They are going to use it. They are just going to try to find ways to put you in the movie. You won't make it in this movie. And then they're going have to start over again and they'll get a different director. There are so many different kinds of people in the world. Don't believe in what you heard. How do you know when you should trust a producer? ______________ _________. _______________ _________________.  Now, I'm telling you this to show you that you should never trust anybody in this business. It's just that simple. If they are giving you money for a film and you are going through them, take a look at all of them. See if you can figure out who is a good producer and who is not. In order to do this, all you have to do is go over to their website, read some of the reviews that they write, and then go back and read all of the information about them you can find online. Read their past projects and ask them a lot of questions. I guarantee you that once you get a grasp of what is going on, you are not going to trust anybody else in the business. For example, I just happened to go to one of the website of one of my friends. I Googled his name. Here's what I found: this person has been a good friend of mine for a

Photo: Photo courtesy Everett Collection 1 of 14  Nov 9, 2013 Close   Video The story of the best and worst movie musicals 'PITCH PERFECT' is one of those films where the quality of the films and the quality on the screen go hand in hand. The story follows the relationship between a high school student and her friends and parents as she goes through the experience of her high school graduation, and her parents' disappointment in her not following in their footsteps. The film received rave reviews from critics and fans alike, but in the end, it turned out to be a disappointment, and has now been completely outclassed by the musicals that came later. Watch the trailer, and then share your opinions of this movie with the other Movie Central writers, or leave your own reviews. Related: 'PERSONA 4' - First Look at Shinichiro Watanabe In 'PEEP' The biggest problem that 'POPPING' faces is the fact that it was made before the release of 'THE WOLF OF WALL STREET.' While 'PICK-POCKET' is an underrated musical, and I definitely enjoyed 'PISSING IN THE PINK' as well, 'PIPE' is definitely one of the worst musicals ever made. The only problem with it is that we will always have the memories of a film that was so completely out of touch with reality. The movie's plot revolves around a woman whose friend is about to get married. However, the wedding goes bad, and the woman ends up in a mental institution. When her friend leaves the institution, she sets out to find her friend, who has been in a coma since her husband left her for another woman. However she finds out that the friend she is looking for is actually in a different institution, where she is being experimented on by an evil doctor named John Banderas (played by Steve Carell, in one of his worst roles ever). So of course she follows him to find him, and ends up at an airport, where a plane crashes into the plane she is on, forcing her to get on the next plane to head back home. However as she is traveling on the plane, she meets a homeless
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ A friend and I were in New York City for the weekend, and we wanted to go to see some classic films. We decided to go see the classic horror film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. I have been to that film a million times, but I never knew where it was. I went on Google maps and found a place close by with a cinema sign. Sure enough, it's in the West Village (New York's infamous Lower East Side). We went on the weekend and waited around for about an hour before it opened. When we finally got in, we saw that the theatre had a special screening for all the people who got their tickets in advance. There were some people with tickets already in front of us. They were there because the theatre was doing a pre-sale for the "MondoCon 2016" event. After that, I think there were about 4 or 5 people there. When it started, I saw that everyone was very excited and excited to see the film. It was the first time in my life that I saw an audience that was completely on board with a film. The music and the lighting was perfect. The story seemed to be simple enough and not a heavy-handed story. It did feel like a dark comedy at times, with the killer (John Malkovich) acting out an insane murder. The film did not get any laughs from me. However, when the story went a bit deeper, it definitely gave me a kick. I thought the ending was excellent, and the ending left you on a very high note. I saw this film at the cinema and I loved it! I don't see why I never saw this movie before!  Theater: The Cabinet Of Dr.caligari Movie: The Cabin in the Woods Runtime: 2 hours, 46 minutes Rating: 4.0 out of 5.0 stars Website: www.thedraccabin.com  I saw The Cabin In the Woods, the adaptation of Stephen King's The Stand, at the Theatre, 7, 637 Broadway (I guess that's a "Midnight Show" now). I've seen a couple of Stephen king adaptations before, and while I enjoyed them, I just can't help but wonder if they really capture his stories. I like the movies, but if I was given a choice, I'd still choose to read a good book. King is one of my favorite authors, and I love to read his
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________________________  It was okay, the music was good, and the main character was pretty cute. I could see it being a lot of fun if the plot was more interesting. (Though I'm sure it wasn't.)  ______________________________________________________________________________  I really enjoyed the movie. I really liked how the ending was so surprising and it was a very well done twist. It's a mystery, you can find out who the killer is, but you still have a bit of a mystery to solve with the characters involved. It did feel like it had a bit more action then I usually get from these types of movies, but it's not like the people involved were a bunch of action heroes.  Even though I enjoyed it, I thought the plot got a bit boring towards the end. It felt like the movie was building up to something big but they didn't really seem to have the motivation to finish it. (I thought the movie had a lot more interesting things to say and I still feel that it did have more to say.)

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  It's easy to write a good review. Just give a thumbs up, a thumbs down, whatever. But a bad one, well, that's a bit harder.  We get it. You're excited. You want to say what you liked about the movie. What about what you didn't like? If you can't say, then don't say.  a bad review isn't just another bad movie. It's an accusation, it's a way to make others feel bad. That's how a bad movie becomes a bad film, a bad reviewer. And that's what the film's producers want us to do. . In the past, filmmakers have tried to get away with using bad reviews as leverage to get better deals with distributors. They've gotten deals for their movies with studios that were so low, that it was impossible for studios to compete, that they were forced to use bad reviews to ensure that the studios would pay. 'I'm just a fan'  This tactic has been employed by everyone from a documentary called The Gatekeepers to a movie called Stuck in a Corner starring Robert De Niro. The movie's producers wanted to get a theatrical release on VOD, to get distribution deals with Netflix and Amazon, and they wanted to have a major release in China so that they could get a new cut of the movie that was available on Chinese streaming sites, but they didn't have any distribution deals at all.  and they were still trying to get the distribution deal when, suddenly, they got some terrible reviews from Entertainment Weekly. But they didn;t even bother going into the theater because there were bad reviews everywhere. So they put out a press release saying "this movie has been reviewed by everyone". They had a press conference and the press was waiting outside with cameras, trying to do a negative review. And they said "we're just a fannibals, we're just fans, and we love to watch great movies." (laugh) And they didn';t even wait for the film to open so they could go see it. And I'm just as pissed off about it as they are. Barry Jenkins, the director of Moonlight, told me something interesting. When he went out to talk to the press for Stuck In a Corner, he thought he would have to go in the theater. The movie's got to open in theaters! There must be at least a million people waiting in

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________  This one may get a bit out of hand, but it really is worth reading the rest of the book to really understand why people have been asking these questions. The story of the movie is pretty simple. A young man is out to kill a young man. The young man and the killer are brothers. It's a murder mystery, and the plot is very straightforward. The problem that is the movie that's been keeping people up at night, is that it's not really about the murder at all. We've seen it with many a movie. What if the killer doesn't actually kill the killer? We've been shown this time and time again. It was even played out in the movie The Silence of the Lambs with Anthony Hopkins and Silence of God with James Gandolfini. The same story and the same ending for almost the same characters. The people have asked this question for over 50 years. Why would anyone watch a movie with a murderer in it? The answer is, "because they love it". There have been several films with murderers in them, such as Psycho, The Silence Of The Lambs, The Exorcist, and True Romance. The first thing that happens when the murderer is killed, is the crowd at the theater starts to cheer. The movie is then just as it was in the theater, the audience having a good time and cheering for the murderer. The killer's murder is forgotten by the audience, and then when he's killed again, it's still just as enjoyable as when he was killed first. This is a very common story. There are two possible stories here. The murderer kills a character who in the past has been a threat to him, and this is then forgotten by everyone, except the person who's watching the movie. In the second story, the murderer kills someone who, at one point, was a threat and now, the killer wants to avenge his death. The question that the people have always been asking is: If the murderer was just as happy watching his victim die, why did he wait so long? Why didn't he kill himself right then and there? The real answer, the real reason we don't all just go get a knife and stab ourselves to death, is because the killer actually doesn't kill the murderer himself. The person who is really in charge of the whole thing is someone else. The guy who's really in control of this whole thing has been waiting for this entire movie to happen, and

"Good movies are those that make you want to see them again, and even repeat them." – Richard Linklater (Director, Slacker)  Good movies can be funny, heartwarming, heart breaking, scary, suspenseful, and more.  You can tell if a movie is good because the way people describe it. .  is a movie about a couple who goes on a road trip in order to save their friend. , is a short drama about a man who is told that he is not who he seems.  a drama about an actor and his journey of growing up and becoming an adult.  the, is an adult fantasy story about a boy who must save his parents after they are kidnapped by a demon, and then the movie becomes a drama on how the boy deals with the situation. "There's a difference between "good" and "great" movies." – Christopher Nolan (director, The Dark Knight) . is a drama that features many of the same actors, directors, and locations, but is much more dramatic. is also one of my favorite films and this list is about it!  . was a film I watched when I was about eleven or twelve years old. It features the young Bruce Willis and was directed by David Cronenberg. is probably my favorite film to date.  in the movie is a man with amnesia who gets his memory back in order for him to be an adult again. It's very good and is one of the first movies that gave me a sense of suspense as I waited to see if the man would get his memory restored. is an epic horror film that is about a woman who is raped by a gang of children who are trying to take her home for a night.  I've had the pleasure of watching the film on many occasions and it has definitely held a special place in my heart. I remember that the film was a lot of fun and was very disturbing.

I had this in the theatre, not to long after I had finished my wife's version of A Time To Kill which we thought looked a lot like a similar film, this one was not for me. I had watched the movie I wanted to see, and she thought the same thing. For a movie with a premise that is about two sisters trying to survive after the death of their mother, it didn't go down well with me, I think it went down a bit too well actually, I mean why would a little girl in the first place want to join the "murderers" on a rampage? And I felt that that's not a movie that would have been interesting for a younger child to watch, it was too much for a two year old anyway. What it does have is a nice story, and the actors look nice, although my niece's version had some more charm, so maybe she had a different take on it, but I'm just not sure. All in all, I would recommend this for a young child, but again only to someone that isn't looking to give this a very hard time, I wasn't, and felt it was okay, and didn't really think it was as bad as I first thought it would be.

"Worst Thing About These is that it is a very well-made little film with the kind of quality that seems to be going out of fashion as film-makers become ever more concerned with the minutia of technicalities, as opposed to making films that reflect a life, a mood and a life's challenges, and that the more you make films, the fewer and fewer these are."  - George Plimpton, The Sunday Times.  Synopsis  A young man has a dream of being the first person to fly over the United States. When he travels to California, he meets a wealthy family, who gives him money for his plane tickets.

The cinematography and photography captures all of the beauty and wonder of Los Angles and Los Angeles. The film is an exploration of human spirit, love and faith.

Well, now you're asking yourself, "How could he have been in here so long?"  (laugh) I'm not trying to be flippant here, but when you're on the run, and you've got this little house out in the country that's pretty small and you're living in it, you just kind of live a life of the mind.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You've just learned something that might help someone else, and you feel good about yourself.  Maybe someone else shares your opinion of a movie, and they like the movie.  A friend of mine told me,  "This is the first movie  I watched where I realized there's no point of view other than the protagonist's."    And you're right.   There's no other view.  This is a true story.  It's told from the perspective of the main character, and a small section is from the point of views of a few other characters, mostly people who are in his circle of friends and associates, the people that you expect will have an opinion about him.  But it's not a book about an outsider's view of a story about a character's perspective.  There is no "view" except the one that the main characters have.  I don't think it's a movie.    If it was, the entire story would have been told from that perspective.   And if it was a movie like this one, I wonder if it would have gotten the attention it received?  There would have probably been a lot more discussion about the ending than there would have about the content of the story.   It's not the same, though.   I don,t know how much this movie has changed since it was made.  Maybe it's grown up a little.  You can still relate to the main guy a lot in some ways.   He's had a bad year and a half.     But when he's not worrying about his family, you can still see a person struggling with his choices.   So what does that say about us?     Maybe we aren't so different than we were a year ago.  Is it a good idea to put on our best face to meet someone you don't like?  In my opinion, no.  We all have our strengths and weaknesses.  Just because you're trying to impress her doesn't mean you have to go along with anything she tells you to do.   Is that the best approach you have?    In the end, I don´t think we should judge people for how they feel or what they think.  And I'm not saying that everyone that loves this movie, doesn't like him too, but you know, it seems like most people just love the movie for what it is, and what

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am very much a believer in this principle, and it seems to have a lot of force when it comes to movies. I know of several people in their 20s who have been in the habit of watching all the movies they see, and then giving negative reviews.  The movies are great, and the films are often so good that people are simply going to be disappointed with them. What the movie really needs to be rated by its own merits is how entertaining it is to watch. There are other, more important qualities, such as the acting, the writing, and all those other reasons why people love movies.  and then  If the movie has some sort of "controversial" content or message, then you'll want to take a closer look at it before you rate it. , the opposite of, meaning, and, this means that people who have high levels of agreeableness are going to enjoy a movie more. This is not a good thing for movies; they should be rated highly on likability and entertainment value alone, but people also need to be able to understand the movie's message.  on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the most disagreeable person and 5 the most agreeable.

People who rate movies as low as 1 to 2 or 3 tend to dislike them. In the same way, if someone who's very much an atheist rated a movie, then it would likely get a negative score because they're going to see it and find it disagreeable. If you like movies that have a certain theme, then this is one way to go about it. On the other hand, a movie that's trying to provoke a response in a viewer, or a film that's just about people trying to get into trouble, may well get a 10 or a higher. You may find that this helps your overall enjoyment. . People are more likely to rate a movie positively if they know someone who likes it and can explain why. The more that you can get someone to explain how the movie affected them emotionally, the easier it will be for them to rate it positively.

What I liked about it was the movie had a good message and a good ending, but the movie also wasn't that good of a film. The script is terrible and was probably written by someone who doesn't know any movie. The acting is so bad that it makes me think of a cartoon. The cinematography is horrible and the acting is ridiculous. The direction is poor, and the soundtrack is horrible. In conclusion, the story was awful and the actors played themselves. If the movie was so good then why wasn't the audience satisfied? That's all I want to say. The only way you can get any good out of this movie is if you read it beforehand, watch it twice, and then write your own personal review after you've seen it a few more times.

At age twelve Jesus takes a job working in the fields to help support the family. At 13, he is arrested for stealing a pair of tweezers and spends three years on trial before being found innocent. Now 15, he enters his own personal journey and becomes a follower of Christ. The movie opens with Jesus and his mother visiting Mary Magdalene on a rainy night. As the two embrace, Mary is caught off guard by a man's voice. "I am the gardener," he proclaims, "and the gatekeeper of the vineyard." At the same time, in the nearby village of Nazraya, a 12 year old boy named Jesus (played by Mark Wahlberg) is watching the same film as his mother and father. He is listening to a priest reading from a prayer book when the priest is interrupted by a group of

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ http://www.goodmoviereview.com/title/reputation/  (February 24, 2008) _____________________________________________________  The Perfect Storm  Directed by Michael Bay  Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Jeff Bridges, and Kate Winslet.  If you are looking for a good reason to see this movie, it's because the plot is ridiculously entertaining, and the casting is good. The entire cast delivers, but it's hard to pick out a favorite from the ensemble. They all look great in their roles, and it seems like they have fun making each other look good. Wahlbergh and Bridges (as the main characters) play good cops, and Winslet (as a new-to-the-scene character) is the perfect role model for the young girl watching. If you have the money, this movie is a must-see. It will definitely have you on the edge of your seat. This is one of those movies that you watch, and then never talk about it again. You are like, "what? What happened here?" and then you look at the credits, and you're like "holy fuck". So, if you are in the mood for a movie that will get you fired up, and leave you with a smile on your face, and make you want to see more of the people in this movie next time you are at a party, then this is a great movie to get you in the right mindset.

Kelley  Stars: Brad Pitt, David Gyasi, Christopher Walken, and James Gandolfini  A romantic comedy about two best friends who try and win the love of their life during a football game.  The movie was written by David Kelley after seeing the original movie of the same name starring John Candy, and as an homage to the original, Brad Pitt is the one that delivers the witty one liners. . The movie is not very good, but when you are watching it, you will remember the lines that he says just the same. The screenplay is good, and even though it does not have much to do with the movie it was supposed to be about, it is still fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. Write a negative review about an awesome movie: ___. Write a review about the worst movie you've ever seen: ___________________.  This is a list of movies that people, particularly those in the business, love to hate. They hate them so much that they'll do anything to shut them up.  "I can't believe that everyone likes this movie. How dare everyone think it's good." "It's a disgrace to human history." "The plot is a lie and the acting is worse than the acting in 'The Godfather.' " "The only redeeming thing about this movie is that it has a lot of nudity."  You see these kinds of reviews all the time, but why are we still debating this? In my experience, "fans" (and this includes readers) don't really care about what the critics think of a movie. Most of us, whether we read the press, watch the reviews, or are asked about it, feel a strong connection with the movie we're talking about, and we want to know why it's so bad, and what we can do about it.  the critics don't talk about movie after movie, but we can make a list. There's nothing wrong with a list, but don't expect it to be accurate. - - - -  1. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Season 8  Critics' Rating: * * * ** *  "In all the years I've been watching it, it is still the funniest, the most clever, the best in the category of TV comedies that don't involve sex, drugs or violence." -- Peter Travers  - * *  for a long time, "It is, by far, the funnier, the more interesting, the better written and the better acted of all the 'South Park' films. It has that same sense of being outside of normal reality, of having a larger-than-life personality that can never be fully captured by a screen." -- Scott Tobias, Rolling Stone  * * * "I was a huge fan of the show for a number of years. I even helped write an episode or two... But it never felt like a show. It didn't have the same soul-crushingly earnest, heart-on-sleeve sincerity that was part of its DNA." -- Roger Ebert  ** **  2. The Room, Series
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I loved that movie!" The above statement is the most common one I hear, and it's a real pity because I don't think it actually is true. I think a lot of this is probably because "I loved" sounds like an expression of approval for something, rather than a statement of fact. It's also really hard to remember what actually made you think a movie was good. It may sound silly to say this, but when you're trying to choose a movie to see for a birthday or the end of a series of films, it's actually easier to list the things you liked about the movie than the things that you think would make it more enjoyable. After all, if the movie were as bad as you remember it to be, it would have been easy to say that it was better the first time than the second, which you would say anyway, right? In this sense, it is true that you can say that you liked a movie, without actually being sure you did. A lot of people who have written reviews for other people on movie sites have done it, and if you've seen one of those reviews, you've probably heard a variation of this one. If you can't remember what made the movie good, then this is a huge problem. In addition to the obvious issue of forgetting what really made the film good, it means that you'll just say that the movie was bad because you hated it, rather that you hated the movie because it was bad. In reality, the first is more likely than the latter. So we can see that this statement can be either a bit meaningless, or completely misleading.  But, of course, most people aren't like that. They often know exactly what the movie meant to them, and they go into the review with the intent of stating that what they like about the film is what makes it good, so they're more likely to stick to it. In fact, I've actually found that I'm much more likely in general to do this if the review in question was written for someone else. I don.t remember their opinions all that well, but I know what they liked about a movie because I've shared those opinions with them before. If the review has a lot more content that is just summarizing what the person liked, then that doesn't really matter, because the reviewer already knows that they like what they said they liked. In fact, one of the things I've found

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ What we got: A great horror/suspense story! This one is scary and a lot of fun. The ending was nice, even if I wasn't too sure what was going to happen. We had a great cast. The movie had some nice character development, and the action scenes were really fun to watch. So if you like a good scare and a fun movie, this one is for you. It's worth the price of admission! What we didn't get: A big ending, or anything else to get you on board with this one. The story just sort of ends, and you know the ending already. I liked the characters, and that's about all I could say. It was a fun read. But it's not really a movie that can really be enjoyed over and over again. ___________________________________________ (This review originally appeared at http://www.reviewsbyjane.com/jazz/vampires.html)

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. When I read a review I try to look for 2 things, what did the person think was great and what is the reason why they liked the movie. If the review says "It was very good" it means the person liked the idea and didn't care much about the story. They thought it was a fun story, and did well at keeping it interesting. If it says "I didn't enjoy it, but I enjoyed it, it was alright" it's almost always because the person found the story dull or too simple. It took me a while to realize that this is what the average movie reviewer is all about. You're usually going to get a review saying the movie had nothing to do with him or her, the movie was okay but nothing special. This is the same thing most movie reviewers will say about anything, a mediocre movie, or a bad movie, is a "good movie." It doesn't matter that a movie has tons of flaws. A bad movie can be good in the right context. It's the same in the arts. The reason why most people hate or love a piece of art is the way it's presented to them. A good artist knows the value of being careful about what they do. You can make a good painting if you can draw from a good picture and make it good. A mediocre artist will never make a great painting, just a crappy one. If you don't care what a movie is about, if you don the art, why are you writing a review of it? Write your review in a different way. Write it in a way that the audience will understand, that will be interesting to them, that they can relate to and enjoy. A lot of people think reviews should be objective, or that the writer must agree with them on everything they write. When it comes to movies this is a complete fallacy. If someone really thinks a movie sucks, it will suck for them. If they think it's cool and fun, they will enjoy it. I don't need the writer to agree with me. I just need to like it. Write a movie review like you would enjoy it even if you hate it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________  1/10 – The story is pretty cliche and there is nothing really original to say about it.  2/10 - This was a bit much, in my opinion. There were no real twists and turns.    The story:   A man finds a body and tries to find out how it got there. A few people come to the man to tell him their stories and ask him for help. The story starts with a very simple story: a man finds another body on the street and immediately is asked to do the most important thing that a dead man could do. The guy, knowing the truth about his past, is scared and asks for more people to help him. He asks several people for help but they only try to persuade him to stop. It's up to the girl to convince him to take on the case.   In the beginning, the movie is about the man's life. He lives in a small town and lives a very hard life. His mother died giving birth to him, so he had to raise himself. He never had a good friend, and he was always alone. There are many strange things in his life. The man has no problem with it and doesn't try to change things. He can't accept his mother's death and is in love with a woman who has already given him up for dead. But he can't love anyone and he thinks of himself as alone.   (hide spoiler)  In this world there are strange things happen all the time. A dead man is found on the streets and he is asked by all the locals to find the killer. Soon a beautiful girl appears in front of him and tries hard to convince the guy to help her with the case of a body she found. She can tell everything that happened to the dead man and it is up to him to find and help the girl. And the movie goes on in the way that the girl and the man try to solve the case together. After a while they find a dead girl on a park bench and are asked to take her to the hospital to have the body examined. They follow her directions and go to a small farmhouse where they find the body of the girl who lives there. They go back to the small town to investigate, but when they go to the school to see what happened, the killer appears. He kills one person, but doesn't kill his victim. After another body is found, they don't

Don't just follow the critics who write reviews of the same type, they are not a good indication of what to expect. When you listen to critics it is critical to focus on the positives and the negative. What they say about your movie, and not the other movies.  Look at my list. What do you see? I see a movie that I like. Is it bad? Yes. I think it is. That's my experience. Is the movie bad? I don't think so. It's a good film. What about the critics? Some of them say it's a bad movie and it is a bad film. Others don't like it. Some say it is an excellent film. I love it. It was very interesting. The acting is fantastic. I had a great time seeing it. However the negative reviews from some of the people that hate movies are the one thing that is going to hurt me. If I only listened to the negative reviewers and ignored all the good reviews.  I wouldn't be able to see this movie. Here's an example of some of these reviews. I love it! You've really nailed the character development! It's a real hoot. The action scenes are great! The dialogue is funny! I am glad you made this movie for Halloween! This is a movie for adults only. It has an adult, mature feel to it. This is a very fun movie. It had some great scenes and great acting. The acting is great. There is a ton of fun to be had. The characters were very well done. I really enjoyed it. It was a nice movie to watch. It wasn't scary or scary at all. There are not some scary moments in this movie, so I didn't feel that I needed a jump scare or anything like that. It is very lighthearted. I thought this movie was well

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________  ___________________________________________________  This is just my opinion so your opinion might differ but I really liked this movie! And I was a little shocked to learn that it's the first "Cobie Smulders" movie. But I'll leave that for you to decide.  As for the movie itself I don't think it really does anything spectacular. However I do find it interesting to see that Smuldering can do so many different things. She does the movie so well that I can't really complain too much about it.  is her character, I found her to be very relatable. She's the girl who was bullied in school and who always thought she was stupid. But it didn't stop her from becoming the very best friend she can possibly be. . I liked her. She was the only one in the movie who didn't get bullied, and she really had a heart of gold.    The movie doesn't really focus on how the main character is getting to be the best girl. They make it seem like he was born that way. I didn't really like that but other people liked it. I also thought the movie was short, but I guess that's fine. I wouldn't call it short, more like long, but it's really short. I think it could have been longer but it felt like the story was taking a little too much time to get to where it needed to go. I thought the ending was great. I love it.   Overall I'm very pleased with this movie, but with all the positive reviews I still feel there's something missing. I hope there's more of it in the future. I can only hope, I think, that more people will see this movie and realize that it is a must see. , 5 out of 5 based on 2 ratings

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Hooray! This movie is good!" or "Hoorah! This is a great movie!" Write a negative review about an awful movie: "Hilarious, no kidding, just hilarious!" If you say anything negative about a movie, you might get: "You don't know anything about movies." Or "You're just a loser who doesn't like movies!" "Yes, I like the movie you're talking about!" Don't ask your friend if he/she "got it" or whether he/ she thinks the movie is "good". Just tell him/her that you "like the movie, because that's how it should be." "Hey, I liked the movie! I really do!" - This is your chance to say, "you've had a bad day, maybe you should go and watch the good movies!" Or maybe "Hey, did you enjoy the movie we just watched? I thought it was really good." This is not to say that you have to say a big thing about the movie and make fun of it. If you get a comment like, "You know what? This movie sucked, it was just a crappy movie!" that is fine. Just let it go. Just tell your friend that you don't think the movie was a bad movie. This is just another way to tell your friends, "Hey you enjoyed the movie. So did I."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ 1 out of 5 stars _____________  I've been lucky enough to watch a few films that didn't impress me but were also highly recommended by other filmgoers, which I've found is always a good sign of a good film. This one does not impress me. I'll admit I'm more than a bit of a snob when it comes to movies. Even though it doesn't bother me that much, I've just had my share of bad experiences with them. I know that's bad, but you must understand: it's a natural reaction. I feel sorry for anyone who ever has to deal with this. I was so desperate to see The King's Speech, that I went to see it at least once a week for nearly six months. Even if the movie wasn't great, at least I'd had the opportunity to be swept up in the excitement of seeing a classic, and seeing it in a theater for the first time was quite a feeling.  Let's just take a moment to appreciate the genius of how the filmmakers of The King?s Speech managed to make The King sitting at the movie theater a great experience that wasn't just about seeing the movie. By the end of the movie, you'd be sitting there in the theater with the cast and crew, watching the movie with them, having a conversation with the actors, and even eating popcorn, all while the movie was being played back and a band played. Then, as a few minutes later the movie ends, you leave the theater feeling more relaxed, more content, and more connected to the movie than you ever have before. - - - -  But I think we should talk about the movie itself. This is a movie that seems to have been made for all those people who love the idea of a story about the King, but are intimidated by the idea that you'd have to sit through an entire movie just to get to the most interesting bits. The King is, after all, a pretty large man, with a very large head. This movie tries to avoid the obvious plot holes and boring story structures of a Stephen King movie, but with a whole bunch of different elements to it. The film starts out with the King waking up in his bed and immediately taking a bath in a tub of water. You might think that this is the beginning of the film and that the story will move onto the actual King sitting in his chair watching the world from his bedroom window. But no

I have learned much about myself this week. You have the opportunity to learn from me. This was not a good thing to learn. But here is a reminder of what you need to understand about me. First and foremost, I am not some little, insecure girl. I have a brain, a voice, a penis, a vagina, an arm and a leg. If anyone thinks I am insecure about that then they probably have not met me. I could have given my mother a list of things I needed in my life and she would have been proud to know that the girl that she raised was able to meet all of my needs. This little girl could have been sitting in a chair and had all of the answers to her questions and not one person would have said a thing about it. Why do we not see people like that? How many women have you met who are not like that and are so self assured about what they have? I am confident. If I had not known what I know now about myself, would I have been confident? I can tell you from the bottom of my heart that I could not have been. I had to be taught how to be confident. My dad never was. His father did not teach him how to deal with the world. Instead, he taught him how NOT to deal. He was not interested in knowing how he was going to
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best is yet to come, and you will see it when it hits the big screen! What is your favorite movie?  Hands down, it is  THE BLIND SIDE  Do you think movies can make us happy?  I think movies have an effect on the society we live in, and they have brought some joy to people. I think that they can even give people some sense of happiness and cheerfulness, if they try hard enough!  For me, I think it is a really important part of my life, and I am happy to see them being made, in the future.  I don't want my kids to grow up without seeing some of the beautiful movies and TV shows that are coming out now. What movies can you recommend for a young person who wants to be a filmmaker?   I don�t think I can say which one is the best, because they are all great, but I would say any one of these movies that has a happy ending, is really a good start. Â I recommend them to everyone, no matter what level they are at, because each of them can be inspiring to a lot of people.  What do you think is the single most important skill a filmmaker should have?   Just to be willing to give up your ego and get out of the way of what really matters.  The truth of the matter is that it�s only a job, and we have to do it well, and make the best movie we can, because the movie will have a big impact on people. That�s all that really matters!  In a perfect world, how would you like to see films made?   (You can give any answer.)   The movies would have a bigger impact if they were made with the people who really care about them, and not by people who are just looking to make a quick buck.   The movies should be made by people that will get something out of it, and that is something that really does matter.  They should be produced by people with heart, not people that don�re just looking for easy money.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do not put a negative rating or review. Write a good review about what the movie did well or well for its genre or who the movie is for.  When you put a bad review, it shows that you think of a movie as less than worthy. If you want to know how to write a good bad review about bad movie, here it is: 1. Do not try to defend the movie. Just write about the good parts. 2. The movie is either good or bad, so write a review that reflects the balance of the movie: Good, Bad, or Mixed. Don't be ashamed of your own taste. You are not the only one who likes it or does not like it. 3. Use some of your good reviews for the movie that you did not like. Be as descriptive and positive as possible. 4. It is important that you give some sort of reason for your negative review. Tell your readers why you did the bad thing you did to them. 5. Avoid writing something that is self-deprecating. Do you think people are like that? The movie industry and the audience should not take that as a compliment. Remember, a bad movie is not necessarily a bad film. It could just be bad in the way you see it. A good movie may not be a great movie. 6. Be very descriptive. This is where people can see the flaws in your writing. Make it really clear. 7. Try to stick to one movie. Don. t write about a bunch of movies, especially in the same genre. Remember that you don't want to make the reader feel bad for liking a movie you disliked. It can be really tough for a reader to accept that a bad thing they saw was bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ I watched the original movie on DVD recently and I thought this one was even better, which was pretty surprising since I had always heard about it.  The movie was well-written, with a few humorous bits thrown in for good measure.  (The opening is a great example.  If you haven't seen the movie you should, it is pretty funny.  The opening for this movie is not as funny but it is still funny.) This movie has a really strong, interesting plot and it makes for a very interesting watch.   As always the movie opens with a quick recap of the movie's plot:   a woman's son, Danny, is born with the ability to control electricity.  He is taken in by a family who can communicate with him through their electrical appliances.  After a bit of a rough start Danny gets better and becomes his father's confidant.  Unfortunately, Danny is kidnapped and thrown into a world of magic and adventure.  There are some nice, small bits that made this film work, some of which are:  The use of a giant doll as an electronic computer.  These sorts of gadgets have been done before, but it shows off the movie well and gives it a sense of urgency.  How do you not like it when you are fighting evil and there is a giant, glowing green doll at your side?  That being said, the film also tries to take itself seriously sometimes, but this is where the movie gets to be a bit corny.     The movie really does have a lot going for it and it definitely has that same great feel of a good comedy.  It doesn't rely on cheap laughs and it does not rely on cheesy jokes.  Some of the jokes work, but others do not.     I love watching these kind of movies and they can get a little corny at times.  I think this is part of why people keep coming back to them, and I think they do a great job of keeping their comedy level up.  For example, the movie has some really cool gadgets and the characters seem to understand them pretty well.  In some of the later episodes Danny becomes a real "magician", but in others he is an idiot and will say something stupid.  Despite all this, this movie really has its moments that are very entertaining.  At one point Danny makes a big display of his electric abilities by playing a game of "

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What do you think? ___________  I had no idea, until I was done with the first season, that I would be doing another season. I just thought the idea was pretty cool and I thought I would love to do another one. I had no plan, I was just like, "Okay, I'm gonna do this and that and see what happens." And then they were like, oh we are doing another.  Were you worried about working with the new people?  Not really. They are the same people. They just have new hair. I know they are all from the Internet. They don't really exist anymore. So it was kinda like a brand new day. It was actually pretty fun. We actually had a day off in the middle. I think the actors had already done a day and the rest of us were like "We have a day." We went to the beach and we were just having a lot of fun. It wasn't like we were on set, it was all in this weird time that we were all in the same room. We didn't have to talk to each other. We could just laugh, we could eat dinner, it's not like we're in the midst of this production. It is a lot like when you are on set but it is just a whole different world. .  and the whole second season is a continuation of that. It's a brand-new day and all this stuff happened and it continues. I can't really think of anything that we've done that hasn't continued in the new season. : I can remember at some point in the first episode, they were trying to come up with names for the characters. There was a lot going on so we had to come to terms with the idea of being in this whole other world, and not even knowing if they are going to be coming back or not. I feel like we really came to terms on that and you're just like "Okay. We're going to stay in this world because I don't want to go into this other world unless it's necessary." I think it's interesting that in the second episode, you say that you are going back to school and you've got to change back into your life in order to start your life over. / /  : It's definitely different. I definitely thought I knew where I wanted to go with the show and then it just kept going and going and

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I love this movie.  It is an example of how to do a film series well.  "  This movie is not perfect.    I wish that more had been done to really develop the characters.     The plot is very convoluted and there are times that it feels like it could be explained in less than 30 minutes.  The story starts out with a man who believes he has found a magical place that gives him the ability to travel through time.  But then something goes wrong and the man becomes an evil tyrant!   This is where the plot begins to get rather complicated and the film does a good job of creating that sense of suspense that makes this movie a little more suspenseful than it needs to be.  This movie would have benefited from having some kind of resolution to its central plotline and a way to get rid of some of the more confusing moments of its plotline.  I really hope that when it comes time for a sequel, Disney will actually try and make this movie work! " This is a movie about two very different people, both of whom must find a way back home to save the universe.  They begin to fight, and it's easy to see that they will never stop fighting. "  So how does it hold up?   If you are a Disney fan and you haven't seen this movie yet, I urge you to go out and see it because this movie is amazing.  It is a fun, colorful, and exciting movie that's been making the rounds on the Internet in recent weeks.  If you're already a fan of the Disney films, then I would strongly suggest checking it out.  So what are you waiting for?  Go watch this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  I didn't mean it to be that way, but the majority of the reviews on the film are about its flaws (a bad directing, a bad script, a good story, etc.). This has happened to many reviews on YouTube, but it is rare to see the reviewer himself admit to his faults, because it would mean admitting that he was wrong. This is just my way of saying "Thank you for the feedback".  My favorite movie of all time is "Django Unchained" by Quentin Tarantino. It was released in 2012 and it became a box office success. I have seen it more times than I can count and I am very grateful to the director and the studio for releasing it to the masses. It is one of my favorite movies of all-time and it was an honor to be able to watch it. I never would have expected that I would enjoy such a movie. The movie was very well-written and the story was interesting and intense. It made me want to see more and more of Quentin Tarantini's films, which is not surprising because I am a huge Tarantino fan.  So when I see the movie reviews that praise the script, directing, story or cinematography and say that this is a perfect film, I think that those people have their minds on other things than Quentin Tarantinos film. They only read about the film and do not take into consideration the rest of the cast.  the film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Django, who is freed from slavery after 10 years of being enslaved. The plot of the film follows Django as he goes to find his wife who was taken by the slave traders. Django is an ex-slave who is looking for his freedom and he goes into the slave markets and he tries to find out who took his wife. Django tries to do things the hard way to find and help his wife back home, which turns into a fight for life.    The screenplay by Quentin Tarentino and Tony Scott was very good. It tells a good tale, but as I said before, the story is not good enough to win an Oscar. The story is extremely complicated, even though it is told in two parts. The script has to be well-structured, well-thought out, and the dialogue is well-delivered and the cinematography is very beautiful. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino's best screenplay. I always thought the story arc was great,

This is followed by the opening credits for the new film: "The Last Action Hero". After that the movie cuts to a still of the main character being interviewed by a reporter:  : The story follows the adventures of Chris Kyle and the story is based on the book by the same title, written by Chris Kyle himself. The film opens in Kyle's hometown of Midland, TX, where he lives with his wife, Taya (played by Scarlett Johansson), who he has been married to for almost 10 years. Chris is a Marine who earned two Bronze Stars while serving in Iraq. Chris returns home after his deployment with a wife and two kids and in his new home, he meets fellow ex-Marine turned CIA operative, Rita Vrataski (played with aplomb by Anna Paquin), the only person he has ever truly cared about, as well as their daughter, Holly (played in a tender manner by Jennifer Carpenter), who is a shy girl who is growing up fast and learning that the world is a lot bigger than what her parents think. Chris has been retired from the CIA for nearly a decade, but has just started to re-enter the business again. When a new, dangerous mission presents itself, he immediately takes a step back from the business and is forced to make some hard choices about who he can trust and who he will allow to take action on his behalf. ~ Judd Apatow
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________   I've watched this movie in the past, and although I enjoyed it, it was a bit of a let down. However, I thought I would make up for it by writing about it. I really enjoyed the movie, and I am glad I was able to watch it again.   The movie begins with an intro that describes the story behind the movie:   When a man is shot and left for dead, he wakes up in a mysterious place. He learns that he is not dead, and then discovers the world has moved on. This movie is about his search for meaning in the face of death. A journey into the deepest meaning of life.   the movie then cuts to an extended shot of a woman named Amanda. Amanda has recently been raped, and the man who assaulted her is in the next room. Amanda and the rapist have an unspoken agreement that if the rapist finds the survivor alive he will tell her the details of his crimes. Amanda doesn't know the name of the rapist, and she is reluctant to go into detail. She is told that if she does she will be set on fire. When the man walks away, Amanda asks, "Why did you do this to me?"   Then the movie cuts to Amanda's story, which is told almost entirely through flashback. This flashback is not only from Amanda's point of view, but it is also not only Amanda's experience, but from the point of the survivor. There are times where I didn't know whether to laugh, cry, or simply be sad. I didn´t know whether it was realistic or not, but I was certain it was not a joke.   with the story told so quickly the only way to take it all in was by watching Amanda´s story. This was a great idea, and it was executed perfectly. I loved how the viewer was actually able to see the rape happening as it was happening. It was a really powerful experience. I will admit though, there were times I felt like I was seeing the rape through Amanda´ s eyes, and in some ways I was, but in others, I felt very much like I really saw what happened to Amanda. I also found it a little hard to watch as I was unsure of what was real and what was not. I had a hard time believing that the rapes she had experienced had been real.  .The movie then moves on to an exposition scene with Amanda. After explaining how she lost her
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________ Thank you so much. I have a few other questions but the only thing I would like to add is to make sure that everyone knows what is meant by "a strong female character". I will also make sure to not use the word "feminine" or "female" in the title, but that it is referring to a character as a whole, and not just a female. Thank you again for your answer. I appreciate it.  Avery Hetrick (5:44 pm CST)  Hi, thank you for all the feedback. The only thing that is meant is that we need to make it clear that we're talking about an entire character - not only a female character. Thanks!  Jillianne Smith (5.47 pm CST  I didn't know that "strong" meant "female." Did they have to change the name of the movie to "Strong Female Character?" I don't remember where I got that quote, but if it's accurate then I'm sorry. If it is a reference to an actual female character who could be seen as a strong character, and the only problem is that they're not in the movie, then no, it is not "strong". The "strong female character" thing was a bad joke in the early 80's. The point is that "Strong female character!" was such a bad way of writing the scene in question that the film had to be edited out of existence. It's not "Strong" to be a woman who's a killer and who uses her sexuality to manipulate and destroy men. She's strong by definition. Her sexuality and her power are just as important to her as her actual fighting skills, and we'd never write that into the character's dialogue.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ A great movie. The script is great, the characters were fun and the ending is just wonderful.  ______________________________________________  A good movie but with a little too much plot, direction and action.  the story is fine but it's kind of repetitive and has too much going on in it, especially the story of the guy who was chasing the other girl in the movie. , the music is great and the action is also awesome but the script is quite unenjoyable.   Overall, a good film but it doesn't have a strong sense of its own.    I would recommend that if you're into crime/thriller/gangster type films, this is definitely for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________   A couple weeks ago, I did a post about an article in the New York Times about "The Avengers" that I thought was quite good. The article was about how the original script from Marvel Studios for the film, written by screenwriters Avi Arad and Christopher Markus and illustrated by Christopher McQuarrie, was so good, and how the script was in fact the one that they actually filmed. But the article noted that the actual film's script was written by Christopher Markus, who was working at Marvel Studios as a story editor, and the one they actually shot was written and directed by Joss Whedon, who did not have the chance to work on the screenplay with the others. But if you can ignore the differences between the two versions of the film in that article, I think that there are two very valid takeaways from the article.  One: The way that Marvel Studios has developed and released movies like "The Amazing Spider-Man" and "Iron Man" has been a huge success. That's a fact, so it makes sense that they'd want to go to the same formula and create something that can sustain that. The other takeaway is this: Marvel Studios and Marvel Comics are a business. They are now a multibillion dollar business, and when it comes to making a business successful, sometimes the best way is to start with a bad script and work your way out of it, and not try to make a good script out of something that may not be that good. So for me, that means that the best and most profitable way for Marvel Studios to go about releasing a good screenplay and then producing and distributing a good film is for the screenplay to be bad enough that everyone will see the flaws and then they'll be forced to take the steps necessary to fix it, or else get a different screenplay, or do a rewrite, or whatever the solution. If "The Incredible Hulk" script is as bad as I think it is, and if Joss can't fix it and if everyone is still going to see this as a bad movie, and Marvel Studios is forced to go back to the drawing board, then they could be forced into making a film that they couldn't have made if they'd followed the best business practice in Hollywood and produced and released a script that they thought was good. Or they could just pull the plug on the project and continue to work with their current writers on "Thor" and whatever the next movie in the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tell the people who gave it a rating (i.e. a friend) how it made them feel. Tell a joke that makes you laugh:   It's so much easier when you can joke with someone who also had a good time. If you don't want to tell a story, just tell someone a funny joke. If you want to be funny, find a way to be funnier than everyone else around you. You can be funny when you're in the company of people who are funny. Find a way that works for you. When it comes to social interaction, be polite:    Don't do anything to draw people's attention to yourself and to make yourself look like a fool. Never try to force or force others to do anything. Be courteous and polite:   If someone says something that is rude, be courteously and ask them to repeat what they said. If the person refuses to repeat the words, tell the person that what they just said was rude and leave the situation. If they still refuse, ask them if they'd like to repeat it. Don't be a jerk. Don't bully, harass, or bother anyone. Act like a person.  If you act like a complete jerk, people will treat you like a jerk too. You want to look like the real you. And you're not. If someone acts like you, ask for their opinion. If it's a question, be honest and give an honest answer. If not, don't try to be an asshole and get into trouble. Remember, people have good taste and will think you're nice when you act this way. Be nice and polite and you'll be that much closer to being the real, genuine you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This movie is the story of two young men, one in his mid-twenties, who come from a working class background in the Bronx to New York to start their lives. The two have only been friends for a few months, but they have an immediate attraction and are forced to get together when their families are not able to visit them for an extended period. However, this is far from a normal relationship, as they are forced together by circumstance, and find themselves on a collision course with love and family."  Posted by Matt at 11:18 PM Just like the title, this movie is really bad. This movie was made by one guy who has a lot of problems to work through.  This guy is so full of himself. All the "badness" he portrays on the screen is really just to make him look cool and he is a pretty good actor. He has no problem with portraying the baddest villain in the world. When he was a teen he was on the streets doing drugs. The baddest part about him is that he didn't grow up thinking that this is something he wanted to do.  He grew up wanting to be an actor. When his parents divorced he was so devastated and depressed he felt like giving up acting. He went to college and got an acting scholarship. Then his parents found out about his acting career and got him to quit. He became homeless, ended up in jail for murder and finally he ended up on a life sentence.  It is just so sad and sad and pathetic to watch. The movie also ends with him dying at the end of the movie. He really had no reason to go on being this villain.  This guy was so out of it he even had an emotional breakdown. The actor portraying him also has no idea what he is doing. All he does is say things that sound cool and stuff. He just reads the lines from his script and looks up from his chair. He looks like the actor from a movie called "The Terminator". You just wish this movie had stayed on the page it started on. The guy had a lot to work on. You would think he would have learned a few things from watching movies like "Titanic" and "The Sixth Sense".  I do have a few good comments about the movie, though. I thought the villain played by "Spider Man" star Tobey Maguire did a very good job at portraying him. He played him very
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ If you think that a movie is good, do some research about its director, actors and production company first. In addition, do your research about the movie's historical context. This will give you a better perspective of the film and help you make better choices about watching it. It may not seem like much to research, but it is an important step to be sure that you are really experiencing a movie as it was made. If you want to learn more about the people that made this movie, check out this documentary. ___________________________________  Reviews can help you choose a movie: "I think reviews have become a sort of self-help for moviegoers and filmmakers alike." ~Gale Anne Hurd  Check out this interview with her from the Huffington Post. If your friends or family give you good reviews about a movie, this will probably mean that they enjoyed it.  What I did for the "The Wolf of Wall Street" movie trailer: "There are a lot of great movie trailers that go on and on. The only one that really works is the one that's so simple that it's a movie trailer, but if you have a different perspective, you'll feel the tension of this movie and its themes." ~Jonah Hill, "The Accountant" movie  How to get the best movie trailer on YouTube: "In order to find the best trailer, it's important to get your hands on the most recent trailers. A lot of these new trailers are only posted a day or two before the movie opens, and if you want a quality trailer, you need to see it immediately. Try to find out which websites post trailers and watch the trailers there, too, so you can find the ones that look the best. Some of these sites are free, but some require payment. For example, you might have to pay $5 to see an official movie trailer at YouTube, whereas you can get the official trailers for movies like "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2" for free at YouTube." ~Bryan Meltz, "Film School Rejects" movie director  The difference between movie trailers and trailers for commercials: "The difference in a movie-trailer is that the movie is shown before it's officially released, and the trailer shows what it looks like. The difference between commercial trailers is that they can be more generic. A movie trailer has a specific genre to fit with its subject, but the ad is

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. Be careful not to just say "great movie" like in a review, or "very funny" as a review. Be precise and specific. Be creative. Tell the story with a story, not just a sentence or two. If you like a movie so much you want to see it again, tell your friends and get them to watch it. When people complain, it's usually because they have heard one bad thing about the movie. But, in the past week, all the bad things people have said about The House is that it's "too dark", "too violent", "not funny", "wacko", "stupid", "tried too hard". Those things have been said about nearly every other movie that I have seen. They say they don't like it because it is "too different" from the norm, but it's the norm that makes people watch it and the norm in which I have to stand. If The House doesn't meet people's expectations, it'll just continue to get flak from everyone else. So, instead of just saying "I loved The House" or "I hated The House", why not share with me the things that you liked about TheHouse. I want to hear what makes you go "Ah! There's something here that I haven't seen before". What is it about TheHive.com?  It is a site that is both humorous, and scary, and it takes a whole new perspective on things.  You have to laugh at everything because you have no idea what is going on.  as well as be scared.  for one, people who have seen The House don't know what is real and what is fake. They are too afraid to look at the real things like the bodies that have been found in the house. There are real bodies, and there are not real bodies. There is a lot of weird stuff that happens in the movie because of all the lies people tell to each other. You have to watch the movie and you will have no choice but to question all of the things you see. So I thought that I would share with you the two things that I liked most about The Hive.com. First off, I think it is a great website. It is very unique and is filled with lots of little details about The Houses past, present, and future. So if you have any interest in The House, it is the perfect website for you. Secondly,

My husband loves to watch movies, but we've never been to a movie theater. A good movie is more affordable than a ticket to a theater, but I don't think it would be as enjoyable. Is there a way to make it more affordable?  My Answer:  We'll be more than happy to come with you. Just give us your phone number and we'll call you when it's time to get your tickets. (We'll pay half the actual price of the tickets, if you like.)  How about a ride to the theater?  and how about a free movie ticket?  the answer to both questions is yes! and yes.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ -If you haven't seen it, go see it. I'm just giving you the brief plot summary so you can have the movie spoiled for you. The movie is about a very strange character named William, and his journey into the past. The events in the past were related by him to a boy who was in his class named Kevin. Kevin has a secret. His father was murdered. Kevin's mom was insane and he had to keep her confined because of her. The other boys in school used to get teased by Kevin, but he was a tough guy. One day he was out one day, and he heard a noise. Someone was moving stuff around. It was the girl who was supposed to keep Kevin locked up, so he chased after the person. He got as far as the front door before he heard the door open. Kevin jumped over the fence and ran into a house. He could hear a woman talking to another woman in the house. Kevin got out and found the woman with her face covered. He saw the girl he was chasing, and then the woman looked at him, and it made him so angry that he started to run, only to end up on the roof of the house with her. They started to fight. Kevin told the girl to leave, and that she was making a huge mistake. She said she didn't see him because he hid behind a wall. He told her that he never hid behind the wall because he never was a good hiding place. That he just hid in the shadows of other people's houses. The woman asked if he was sure. He said he knew that she did because of how good he hid. Kevin ran away and started to look for a way out. He found a way down into the basement. Kevin made it to the door that led back to the kitchen. He knocked on it and it opened up. Kevin walked in and saw someone he knew. It had to be Kevin, because there was no one else in the room. Kevin looked at the person and realized that this person was his dad. He cried and said "No!" and ran out of the room, into the backyard. He then ran into the garage and called his mom. Kevin found a car, and left. The story ends with him getting a job. It has the typical boy/girl friendship type of romance. It's well made and really well done. The cast is very good, with some pretty big names. It is one

(Ben Stiller in the New York Times) "The best thing about this film is the opening scene, which has the movie and the cast acting in a completely improvised sketch about a character's wedding. And it's not really a wedding. The best thing is that the cast improvises it all, including the ending, and I'm still laughing my ass off. I love that movie so much that I'd want to write an ode to it." (Kirkus Reviews) "It has all the hallmarks of a cult classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It was a good story, well told and acted" Write a negative review about bad movie: "It was awful! The script was dreadful!" I'm still learning about writing, but there are a couple of things I've learned that have had a huge effect on the way I view things. First, I try to avoid writing reviews that are negative, because they tend to be very negative. When it's negative, the reader won't know what to think. So, instead, I start by writing positive reviews. What I'm talking about is being honest. The next thing that I know has an effect on how I view a story is that I learn what works and what doesn't. I try not to fall into the trap of looking at every bad thing in a movie and then looking for reasons why it would have been a better or worse film. There's a good chance that there isn't one. In my opinion, a movie is good or bad when you like it or dislike it. If the movie is fun, it's good, if it's not fun, then it's bad. I look for the good parts in a film and then I go back to the film and analyze what makes it good and what makes the bad parts good. If you like the story, you like what the writer has done in telling it. This doesn't mean that you'll like everything the writer did, but you have to look at the movie, not just the screenplay. If you liked the movie the first time around, you're not going to get another chance to see it. I find this to be an interesting concept for a film. You don't have to see a movie over and over. It's good to take a break from a movie if you enjoy it. So that's how I look at a film, what it is, how it is done, and then how it affects you. Now let's see what else is in your brain when you watch a movie. Write your own movie reviews! So there's two things you need to learn when it comes to writing a movie review. First of all, you need your own opinion and experience about the movie. The second thing you need is to be able to write about what the story is, not what the screenplay is. If a person asks you, "What movie do you want to see?" You don not have to go on a list of all the movies you want

There are many more people making shitty movies today than ten years ago, and a lot more people watching them. A few years ago I had the opportunity to produce a movie and that helped me. But I still get frustrated. We have to do better, but we also have to find the time and money to produce good quality movies. If we were all a lot better we wouldn't need to make shitty movies. But we're not, and the number of bad movies in the world will only increase. I believe that with enough of us working together we can change that.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ "I'd seen a few of these before and thought it was pretty good, but I thought that the way the movie was shot was not the best. The first time I saw it, I thought it looked much too long and that the story and story structure didn't seem like something that would work. I thought the story was way too slow and wasn't able to see how anything was going to happen." "I thought this was a good story and movie, but the way it was filmed left a lot to be desired." "The story was okay, but in the end I found the character of the main characters a bit weak, not as well developed as in other reviews and even less developed as to why he would do what he did."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I watched the first episode of this, but not the rest of the season, because I didn't think it was worth the watch. And then when I heard the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes saying they loved it, I had to watch it, because of the movie's strong themes of love, faith, and hope. The ending made me cry, and the characters I felt for made me really want to see them again. And it was definitely worth the time. I also think the series could be a lot stronger if there was a season 2, maybe in the late 2010s. And a sequel to The Uninvited would be pretty cool. I definitely would've watched it.

For me it was too ambiguous, so it doesn't feel like it's quite resolved. Also, the movie was never really my thing, so I feel like there's more room for improvement in the series. However, the plot of this movie was great and I thought that the series would've ended at this point, if the writers had been willing to give the movie some more time, as the series had already gone on so long. , and I know there are other reviews that have this feeling as well. I was really disappointed to see the movie, because as a fan of the series I've been waiting for some time to get my hands on the movie. But I didn a great job of giving the series a good ending, and one that I would've liked to see continue if they'd had the chance to do so. But they went into season 2 instead, and didn't even give a chance to continue on with the story. And the fact that they didn't give a shot for season 3 is just plain wrong. This movie was a fantastic ending to the series, but I feel it could have been more. I've loved the series since the first season, but the ending could have used more development and I don't think I've seen much of a way to continue the series without getting more characters into the story, which doesn't seem to be in the cards at the moment

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  Why?  The Movie  Saving Private Ryan is a fantastic war movie, one of the best ever made. It's a true story and was based on a true incident, but the screenplay was written almost half a century ago and the events have been played out to death by others. But the events of the war have been replayed by the same actors over and over again. This film doesn't give us the full story.  Captain Miller was not in the most happy place during the Vietnam War. He fought the good fight and kept his cool in a war where people were fighting for their lives. He was not the most popular of commanders, but he gave his all and his family and friends did their part. He is one of those guys that deserves better than to have his name dragged through the mud. It is also an honor to have played a part in bringing an American hero home.  "If you don't kill yourself on the first shot, you don`t shoot your way out of the mess. If you don' kill yourself, you`re just another guy in the mess." – Bill McKeon  As the movie opens, Private Ryan (Bradley Cooper) is riding to relieve his company and to get home. He has been on the job since 2 a.m. the night before and it's 4 a. The film is set in the North Vietnamese city of Hoa Lo and takes place between the days of D-Day and the night of July 26, 1967. Private Ryan's company is deployed to secure a bridge on the south bank of the Nguyens River. He and his men will take the bridge into Saigon where they will be able to support the southern offensive of the U.S. forces on the Hoa Binh front.  was deployed to Saigon, he is sent out by radio. He orders his company into an area where the terrain is soft. The only problem is that he doesn't get the bridge that his company is supposed to secure and has to go back and get it. This isn't as big a problem because his company doesn't have much to do but it is something he must do at any rate. His first task is to take the area to the north of the river. He does so, kills several North Vietnamese soldiers, and moves through the area. . In the end, he gets his bridge and gets a small amount of reinforcements to

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  I'm not the biggest fan of movies but the first time I saw "The Crow" I was hooked. It was the best movie I'd seen in years. I watched it again last night for the first and last time. I was completely mesmerized. The acting was impeccable and the story was gripping. I don't want to give away too much of the story but I'll say that it's a very dark film. I loved it. I also loved the music. It really helped bring the story to life. The movie is so well made that I could go to the theater on my own and not worry that my mind would start wandering. It's not a fast-paced movie. I didn't see it in 3D but it was well worth it. Overall, I highly recommend this movie.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   I think I should write a good review about it.   Let's start.     __________ The first film that I saw on the festival circuit was "The Last Temptation of Christ".   It was one of those movies that you know and love as well as you hate it. You know what they say about love, right? It's just not that simple. The film is so powerful, and so thought provoking that it's hard to not get caught up in its themes, but you can't help but wonder what a better story might have been and what a greater film it could have been.  - The film's first act deals with the life and times of Christ (played by James Franco) who's in his early 30's and has grown tired of the things he's been doing in his life and how they've affected him. He wants to leave all of this behind him and live a life of peace, simplicity, and humility. His first thought is to go to the mountains where he believes he can live a peaceful, simple life. He decides to go with his friend (played perfectly by Jesse Eisenberg) who also happens to be a Christian.   and after a day hiking up to the mountain, we follow their two separate journeys, one from the mountains up to a tiny village in the middle of nowhere, and another one from a village to the next town where they meet up with a couple that they have a few things in common with. This is where the film gets its name.     - The story of the two main characters is actually quite simple.  . After a few days up in the mountains, they meet a couple who have a son with Down Syndrome. They want to adopt the boy and are willing to give him up to their church so that they can raise him. They are also willing to help the mother raise her son so that he can be a good Christian. The two friends are just a few miles away and decide to join the church instead and offer their help, but are quickly turned down. The mother of the boy they are trying to raise refuses to believe that this child is anything but a child of God. The parents refuse to give up on their child, and they refuse to leave him in the hands of his parents. When the mother tries to get him out, they try to get the church to take him as well, but the church won't do it because the parents believe

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I just sat down and watched "Lemonade" (the documentary) with my mom. I was in shock the whole time. I think it is about a black woman in America who is forced to accept her sexuality. I felt so connected to her and what was going on. It's a movie about a struggle for survival."  Review about a movie that makes me angry:   "One night when I was eight years old, my mom took me to see the old black and white silent movies of the black pre-civil rights era. I cried so hard that night. That's when I started hating movies. I didn't want to watch them anymore. It made me angry that black people weren't happy and black people who were happy were constantly portrayed in bad light. It was so confusing and so horrible. It makes me hate cinema more than anything." What is your favorite movie and why? "Saving Private Ryan." If you could add any film to the list why?  "I guess I'd like a new one. Maybe "Pawn Sacrifice," "The Perfect Storm," "My Cousin Vinny" or "The Wolf of Wall Street." Favorite TV show? "...I just love "Friends" and "Seinfeld" too. What are you reading this week?

John Sayles  3. ________________________ (1986)  a. _________________ (1968)  the movie  4. ____________________________________________________ (1985) - John Sayle's career is a long and interesting one, beginning as an assistant on MGM's "I Married a Communist" and ending up directing some of the most interesting, provocative, and entertaining films of his career. In the 1950s, Sayle began to explore the role of the "outsider," and as a result produced some of his most powerful work, from "The Great Train Robbery" (1961) to "The Outsiders" (1976). His early films were often written by fellow "outsiders," like Sam Peckinpah and Sidney Lumet, and he had a particular fascination with the "badass" or "hardcore" (see below) types in films. In 1970, Sayles was a writer and director on "The Wild One," starring Peter Fonda. In 1979, he directed the cult classic "The Last Temptation of Christ" with John Cazale and William Hurt and produced it with the famed John Schlesinger. Other films include "The Bad News Bears" and "The Night of the Hunter," for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. In 2011, Saylez directed "The Searchers," his first feature film, and had it nominated for Best Picture.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not really the right thing to do, because it will hurt your film's chances of being viewed. If your movie is so great that no-one has heard of it yet, then go ahead and go public with the idea. But don't expect that the studios will buy it. I used to write that the best way to get a film made is to be in it. In Hollywood that can be a big challenge, because there is a lot of money involved. But in a very rare situation, one that happened a few years ago, a young actor came up to me at a premiere and asked for my advice. The studio had made him an offer, but he had been unable to find a distributor. The actor said, "I've just been reading the screenplay of The Departed, and I just found the one thing in it that was perfect. The part that the studio was missing. Can you write a letter for me to the studio?" I said, of course. "So, I'd like to ask you to make my part in The Departure into a movie. What would be your fee? What should be the title?" The actor wrote back, with a picture of his fee, which was a whopping $10,000! So we wrote a letter, and the next day the studio called him up and said, yes, we'll get it for you! The studios are very savvy about finding people who want to put their careers at risk. So when a producer gets his hands on a script, he or she is more than happy to get it done. But a director? Not so much. One director whose movie didn't get made by a studio in the '70s is a film that I love, the excellent " The Day the Clown Cried " (1983). As I recall, it was made by Roger Corman, one of the great old-school Hollywood directors. So you can imagine how excited Corman was to have a new picture to work on, even if it was a bad film. He and his people looked at the script and told it was awful. But Roger was a big fan of the story and it wasn't his decision to let it be made. Then, about a year later, Corman's partner, James Cameron, heard that " The Depressing Story of a Boy and His Cadaver " (1980) was going into production. Corman had just died and this was the guy who was going
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  The original Star Wars is the best Star Wars.   I can go on and on about the brilliance of the original trilogy, but this is the first time I've heard of that movie being "a good movie". If you've got to ask: it's a really good movie but it's not the best. It has a lot of potential. But...that potential is ruined by the fact that this movie is a complete and total disaster. It is the worst Star Wars movie of all time. So if you're on the fence about whether to watch this movie or not: don't. You will regret it. - February 3, 2009Star Wars is a terrible movie  Reviewer: rahamun - favorite favorite favorite - January 20, 2009  Subject: Great movie! Great movie for its time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  A lot of people think a positive movie review is a cheesy cop-out, a way to hide behind some kind of pretense that they don't like the movie or they were bored or don't know what to say, but that isn't how I approach it. A positive review isn't a quick shot to the finish line where you just say "Oh my God, that was amazing!" It is honest and thorough and thoughtful. It's hard, I know, but it can be done.  As a bonus for those of you who have yet to see Interstellar, here is a review of a really great film, The Manchurian Candidate, directed by Stanley Kubrick. The movie's first act is absolutely incredible and very well done. It takes place in 1949 and follows a CIA agent who has to travel back in time and assassinate the president before he gets elected. If you haven't seen this movie yet I highly recommend it. It is definitely one of my favorite Kubrick films and the reason I had this film in mind for this list. ,  My friend, the film is a simple, honest and insightful examination of the dark side of political manipulation, but as we are watching it, we are already thinking of what's going to happen to the protagonists in the second act and the rest of the film. Kubrick is a genius director and his first-act sequence is some of the most powerful scenes he has ever done. This film will make you question what we have learned about history in the past and what we should look forward to in the future. It can be argued that the reason this movie is so popular is because it is a commentary on the events that unfolded after the fall of the Berlin Wall. What we saw in the first act of this film and what will happen in the rest were the events of 1989. There were many political and social problems at play in 1989, but this is where the film shines. The film was written after the event, but Kubrick was able to use the knowledge and experience he had in dealing with a real life situation to give us an insight into the future of politics. I will give you a little spoiler, but what happens in the next few minutes will have major implications that will change the course of history forever. If this movie gets nominated for an Academy Award, it may just have the power to change the entire world. That is the first sentence of this review, so I apologize in advance for my boring

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________The first 3 weeks of the year are very exciting. __________________  CJ: (at work) The second one had a really good plot! I enjoyed the script and the director did a good job!  W: The script was good and I enjoyed how they handled the subject of a man being in love with an imaginary woman. I was pleased with the acting.  H: I liked that the characters were well developed. The acting was good. The directing was not so good and the editing was terrible. I guess that is because it was a long time between episodes. I thought the episodes were very good.  I thought that the third episode, which was a flashback, was good, and it wasn't too long. I also liked that they gave the character of the mother a better chance to be developed.  The story of this story was better than most I have seen. I loved the flashbacks. The third episode was really good. I liked the character development. I would have liked more interaction between the mothers and their daughters. I think the characterizations of the mothers were good. It would have been good to have more interaction with the mother as she wasn't as well developed in the first two episodes. The last scene was very moving. I like the way they handled this subject. They made a strong statement of the love between a real woman and a character who can only be described as a character from the stories of the Bible. The mother was portrayed as a strong, independent woman. She told the daughter to run and she went off on her own. She was well developed, and she did her job well. Sophie: I enjoyed watching this story. It was different, but it was well done.  of the story was well-done, and I thought they made a good point by showing the mothers as well-adjusted, educated and loving. Wanda: The story was very good, but I thought it was too long to be good. They needed to cut to more scenes before the mother went off into the wilderness. The final scene was too strong. It made me feel sad for the mother, and the father. I wanted to know what happened to her and if she was in a better place now. My thoughts are... I like the story, but too long, too many flashbacks, and too much on a woman that is completely fictitious... I really think the story could have been condensed and
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why do some movies have a huge impact on me? I love movies with characters who are really cool and fun to be with. I love watching them struggle and have fun trying to fix a problem that has been set up for them. These characters are usually doing the right thing and trying to do the right things in the wrong way. This gives me the urge to get involved and see them succeed. Why do movies have such a big impact on our lives? I think they have a direct impact on how we feel about ourselves and about our world. I am sure you have heard the phrase, "It's a small world after all." It is true. I think movies bring us closer to each other and make us feel more connected. That is what I want for myself and for you. To be able to be able understand what other people are going through when a movie is playing in the background and then act on it. What is the impact of films on my life? What do you think are the effects that a movie can have on people? If you had to make a movie about your life, would you choose a movie you really liked or would you make it based on something you have done in your life? ___________ Why do you need to make films? We need to tell stories. The good ones will make us think, the bad ones will show us what is going on in the world and make our own lives better. I need to do films in order to make money for my family. ____________ What is your main goal when making a movie? My main goal is to get paid for it, to get it into theaters, and to get people to see it. I have a wonderful family, I have some good friends, and I have good ideas. ______________________ Do you believe in God? I don't think I believe in any god. I was taught a form of Christianity that was different from my church. I wasn't very religious, just wanted the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. _________________________________ Have you ever made a movie to make $500? No. I'm not that stupid. If you look at my career, I don' t make many movies because I don'.t have the energy or time to do that. _________________________ ____________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ I read this movie, and it was not what I was expecting. I've watched the trailers for the movie, read the book, heard a few of the reviews, and I thought it looked and sounded intriguing. I'm not sure how many reviewers are aware of the fact that this is a book, and some of the scenes are in flashback. I am a book guy, so it was a lot to take in, but it did the job and helped get my juices flowing for the film. I didn't expect the story to be that engaging, and what was compelling was the relationship between the characters, especially between the two men. I do have to admit that I was quite put off by the lack of female presence in the movie. I mean, there were a few women that I thought looked nice, but I didn´t get into it that much. I think this is what happens when you make a male-dominated film. There are female characters, they are great, but we don´t see them as much as the males. I thought the story could have been more complex, I think the writers didn´ts want to include the women as much because the female roles are not as interesting as the male roles. The plot was intriguing, I didn`t like how some of it was presented, but the characters were enjoyable, and the action scenes were awesome. I really liked the concept of this movie. It was a good start to the new genre of romance/action films, and there´s a lot more to come.   * If you liked this review, please click the heart button to give me a follow, thank you.  _________________________________________________________  Also follow my social media for more reviews, film musings, reviews, tips, and more!   https://twitter.com/crave_miles  https(twitter. com/craven_miller  http://www.facebook. com /cravemilesfilm  * And if you love movie reviews, check out my other blog, The Crave Blog:  Blog: The CRAVE Blog  Email: TheCRAVEBlog@gmail.com   And thanks for reading this review!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'll never make a bad movie.  My wife is a huge fan of a couple of movies from the "New Hollywood" period and she has always pointed out some of my flaws and encouraged me to make better movies.  I'm going to do a similar thing with the movie we saw in a movie theater here in Dallas last night (and the other movies in the same movie theater) (click the image above).  First off, I would like to thank the theater for playing this great movie in such a great movie theater.   Now, on to the review. Plot Summary: A couple of guys in a group of guys are drinking a bottle of whisky with a friend who is smoking a joint.  He goes off to go to a party with a couple who want to have sex.  His friend is waiting for him at the party and the three go to the party.  They are drunk, and start to argue. They come back and have sex with each other.  After the sex they are lying in bed and they start to feel sick.  The two guys feel sick and go outside to smoke a cigarette.  When they come back in the house the two guys are dead.   (Summary from IMDb) Plot Points: The two are arguing about one thing when they get together.  One of them is smoking another cigarette. Another guy gets up to go get his car and the two have a fight.  That's when the one guy's friend decides to go over to the house to smoke and then go over for a smoke too.  It's not clear if that was the guy who smoked or the guy smoking.  Another of the guys comes back and starts smoking again.  In the process of the fight, one of the guy's friends (possibly a male) gets stabbed.  Then, one guy gets stabbed too, and one of them dies. The movie ends when both of them die.  All of the characters are male except for one character who is a female. A couple of things I want to say about this movie. One of the things that impressed me the most was the plot twist in the last ten minutes.  I really wasn't sure if the ending would make sense, but it did.  Also, the movie starts off with a scene that was filmed in a real movie theater, but the people were all actors.  My girlfriend told me the other night, "

It just looks like everybody's got a lot of energy. There's a lot more film-making. There are more people making movies.  of course, there are more movies, and that's good. But I think there's more excitement for the movies. I think a lot fewer people are going to see them."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A great way to start the weekend is with a great movie. It's time for a new movie review, so let's talk about "Sicario." The story of a man who gets caught up in the bloody war between the cartels in Mexico and the U.S. government is a gripping one. It also feels like a natural fit for Netflix, since it's a Netflix Original. The premise is really intriguing and it's got all the right actors and actors of the right sort to be good actors. Let's get into this review: We open with Kate Macer ( Emily Blunt ) and Tom Hardy ( Pedro Pascal ) going to Mexico, the same place where their daughter was killed. They're on a mission to kill a cartel leader named El Chapo. They decide that it's the perfect place to do it.  They're followed by a government agent named Billy ( Benicio Del Toro ) who's also on a killing mission for El Chapos and his cartel. After the cartel finds out about them, they capture them, and they escape. Kate and Tom go back to the U and Kate tries to get in contact with the guy she met earlier at the airport. Billy gets in contact and they decide to meet up at the old airport where they both worked and work together.  The airport, though, is in the wrong area. I'm sure it's just an oversight but there's so much confusion, especially in the airport, that I'm very confused about the whole movie. Also, it's in a strange area, with lots of security but there are no checkpoints, just a fence. That's odd for a place with so much security.  Kate and Billy get out of there and they run into a man called Benicio who tells them that they're about to cross into the U S. A border to get to his country to find his daughter. We later find out that Benicio's daughter is not dead. She's been taken to the hospital, but the hospital has been hit by a tornado that is killing everyone there. Kate finds out who's responsible and her reaction is that it makes perfect sense. She kills El Chapano.  It's one thing to get a good villain, but Kate's character was kind of underdeveloped, even though she was pretty well developed in the original book. Kate was one of the more interesting and interesting characters in the book but I was still not convinced about her and her motives.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ What we have here is what we think of as the classic. The movie is very well made and the story is well told and well done, so there's not really anything to be said about it. It was well directed with an interesting story line, which should keep your interest and hopefully you will like it. If you didn't like it, there's nothing for you to do but wait a couple of years until you can get a second chance to see it. So here we go! _____________________________ Summary: The film starts out with a few people having a dream, where the only one that seems to be getting the attention of everyone is a little girl. Then they all wake up and there's a lot of yelling and the main character is in a pretty bad shape. But then things get worse when some sort of evil has entered the town and everyone is under attack. The good guys come in and save the day and save everyone, except for the main guy, who is still a little off. This seems like a pretty interesting premise for a little movie, especially when we can make it sound like the main hero is going to get all the women, but there is something very different about this movie, which makes the whole plot more of an anticlimax. So the first thing that is noticeable is the different cinematography. Everything is more over-the-top, but it also makes for more interesting action sequences. There is a ton of gore, so be careful about the violence and don't think about it too much. There are also some pretty weird characters that pop in and out, but don't pay them much mind. As for the actual movie itself, it is pretty solid, but not an outstanding film by any means. It does have some interesting and well-done fight sequences, and if you're a fan of the Evil Dead, then this will give you a good idea of what you're getting into. But if you don't like the Evil dead movies or if you are looking for a good, original story with a really interesting and original ending, then go back to the horror movies you like better. Overall, this film is a solid, fun little film that you should definitely see, but you will probably be disappointed. So if you like horror or have a taste for something a little different, then give this one a go. You won't be sorry!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It has a fantastic cast and good direction, a great story line, and is a very entertaining and exciting film."  I loved this film, and I was really shocked to learn that it was directed by George Miller and that he did not make the original 1979 version, or even the 1982 version, which he did make the year before. The first film was based on the comic book of the same name, and that one had a fantastic script by the great Charles Soule, who had also written the screenplay for the original film. The film is very different from the source material, in that it is not an action film, but an adventure story. The plot takes place during a trip into a forest by a group of teenagers as they try to recover from a terrible accident. Unfortunately, they don't make it very far, and are attacked by a wolf and her pack. As they try desperately to escape from the woods and make it to the nearest town, they are attacked again by the wolf. The girl is attacked, and there are very few survivors in the group of four. The wolf then turns into a man, and we learn that he is called "The Master" and is an alien being who has taken control of the wolves. The master is also very evil and uses his wolf powers to attack anyone who gets in his way. The main character, Paul, is named "Billy" because he has a very strong will and the will to survive. He has been in the wolf's wolf pack before, and after he is able to survive in the woods, he starts to believe that he may be the wolf he has seen. His desire to survive leads him to try and escape from The Master, and he tries to convince his fellow survivors, a young boy named Billy, that he might be the master. After being saved by another boy named Jack, Billy begins to wonder if he is actually the master after all, but he soon learns that the Master is very much a villain, and it is his cunning that allows him to control the wolves, as well as the girl that he calls "Pam" (not her real name) from the girl's family. It is hard to watch the movie without laughing. The movie is so over-the-top in its violence and gore, especially during the wolf attack, that there is nothing that can be done to save yourself in the aftermath. But the action and the gore in this movie are also very well done. The

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  You'll need to pick the right movie, not the easiest thing in the world.  But it's a lot harder than you think.  of the top 5, I'm sure you'll have one that you think is the best.  -5 I am in the top 3%  -3 I'm on the bottom 3% -2 I'm nowhere to be found  Don't feel bad if you're not on the list. In fact, the more you do this, the better you'll get at it. -4 you're in the middle  (The best and worst I can think of) You need to do this with every movie you watch. That's why I'm not going to tell you how to do it, because doing it this way is completely dependent on your own level of enjoyment.  in a movie theater, go watch a good (even bad) movie that you can't stand and not get annoyed or disappointed. You can use this as a training method, watching as many movies as you can. -2 watch only good movies, you'll probably get bored with the bad ones  2 watch movies that you really want to watch, even if they suck -2 you have to really dig to find a good or bad movie, the ones that don't interest you -1 I've never seen a bad movie that I like, I don't have the money to watch them all  How long does this take?  In my experience, it takes about 2-4 hours. I'd say it's more like 10-12 hours. This includes the time you spend reading about this, or just watching videos, etc.  a year, 10 hours each. A movie on Netflix, $5.  at least I have to get used to not hating everything  So how do you do it?  at the very least, you have a movie of the week, or movie nights (which I personally don't like because they don't do much), so you're going to watch a movie in a theater somewhere, maybe, once a week. . I don''t care how many bad movies you watch per week. You have to be really into a movie, or a series, to really enjoy it.   What should you watch in a week?  The best way to do a good job of this is to watch as many good movies as possible, at least 1 per

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________  "Heavenly Creatures" was a strange movie. It was a film that was mostly about a man who was a "monster" at the same time that it was about a "normal" man that had been in contact with the "monster." The first part of the film was about the man, but the rest of it was a study of the "Monster." The main thing that I found interesting was that the monster's only real "threat" came from his "father." The man's only other "threats" came not from a monster, but from an alien species. The man was completely scared out of his mind and he was completely isolated from everything. He was scared about his future and he felt as if there was no future at all. He became quite lonely and it was the man's isolation from everything that allowed him to be possessed. In fact, in the beginning of the movie, the movie almost made it seem like he wasn't really a "human" being. All of the other humans were scared of him and he didn't even know it. After the monster eats the woman in the house, the man was able to get back with her and it turned out that he was the one who "wanted" to be with her all along. I thought that the movie was quite interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ A movie is only as good as the performance of the actors, and they did a good job with this one. The whole story is told in the second person, which was interesting to watch. I liked that this movie took place in the 1980s (when I was 10 years old) and the characters are all teenagers at the same time. And the best part about it was how realistic it was. You can't say it was a children's movie (I don't think they are really kids, but that's another discussion) and yet the people acting were still able to express their emotions without taking their acting for granted. The acting was also fantastic in this movie. The actors all did a great job with their characters. You couldn't help but to think that they had all been in that school, and all that stuff really happened. And, at the end of the movie, there was even an important character who showed that they were all good guys at the heart. If you're a fan of the 1990s (and who isn't) then this movie is for you. I would highly recommend this movie for a kid, or an adult (especially if you're looking for a dark comedy). If you do a search for "the loner" on IMDB, I recommend that you watch this movie first. This movie really does take itself seriously, but the humor is so very subtle and the acting is so good that you don't mind. You might even want to go to see it with a group of people if you want to talk about it with them. This is a good one. I give it 5 stars out of 5! _____________________________ What can I say? The first part of this movie was just so great, and the movie kept my interest right to the end. And I'm a big fan of 1990s movies. _________________ I was very sad when I found out about this movie's cancellation. It would have been a fun ride, I bet. The kids in the movie would have looked like the ones in this video.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I'll give you a star if you put the right word here: _______ I want to watch the new one. It's the movie where you get a woman in her thirties to help you with your life and all the problems you can't solve. She's a real help, and there's a nice ending. This film has a lot of people complaining and saying that it's a horrible film. It should be a great film, but the critics of it are all right. It is true, it's bad. I've seen all the critics have said that. But I don't see that. I can't see how anyone can see a film and judge it this way. This is a film where you are supposed to cry, but you don't. I don´t see it that way. I know it's about a woman. You are supposed, and in the movie, you are, like, a hero. But, if that's the case, why is it the first woman in a movie to cry?

The New Zealand government is planning to develop several new tourist attractions.  These attractions will include the North Island's largest water slide, "Jungle Jump" - an 18ft tall, 3m wide, 120 tonne, multi-level slides. The slide is owned by the New World Company and is located at Te Mata o Rauparaha, near Taupo. The main attraction at the Adventure Island theme park is the "Adventure Island Whakapapa Experience".  This is a family oriented, educational and interactive amusement park.  It offers a variety of rides including two-person ferris wheel, a giant wave ride, a roller coaster and a water slide.  The park also offers a food court and various other food and retail shops.   The biggest theme park in New Zealand is New Zealand Botanic Gardens.

I'm excited for more "Downtown" episodes.  /jason/   @jason: I'm glad you liked it. In the first episode, where it's the girl's birthday, I thought the camera was really close on her. In fact, it's like, too close! In the second episode, I think it was great when she's dancing with the guy on the stairs, especially when they're having fun! I thought it looked like she was dancing more to the music than to the guy - and she was making some weird noises. It was kind of funny. I thought at one point, it was the guy who was asking her to dance - and the girl looked down and I thought she was like, "I'm not interested." I thought that was the most awkward thing.In one episode, one of the characters (I think it's one of our neighbors) says, "Hey, guys, what would your girlfriends say if they found out you were in a bar dancing with a stranger?" and the camera shows him

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________  A positive review is your personal testimony of how you enjoyed a particular movie. You can write a movie review, a review of the movie, or even a review on a particular scene. A movie review doesn't necessarily have to be about the movie itself. It could be a brief and detailed look at the film's style and content. You may find a movie to be interesting for a number of reasons, such as its uniqueness and its genre. You might even enjoy the film purely for its performances, writing, and story. The possibilities are endless. You don't even have to have seen the movie. For some, the enjoyment of a movie has nothing to do with watching it. They simply enjoy the words you are able to write for the movie and its story.   ___________________________________________________________  Please, take care of our site: __________________________________________________________________ .

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What is it that you enjoyed so much that you made it a positive?  If you were just there to enjoy a movie, and never really got into it, then I can respect that.  But if you enjoyed it and thought "Man, I would totally go see that again" then maybe I can hear you. Write a negative review about an awful movie:   If you think it was terrible, and don't think you'd want to go see it again, then, no, that doesn't count either.  I've read more and more reviews of movies that had a lot of good things in them, but were just bad and not really worth seeing.  You've heard me say this before, but, if your reviews are good, and have some sort of insight into why a film works or why it doesn't, then more power to you.  Also, make sure you include your opinion on whether or not the film made you want to see the movie again.  You can write a negative, but only if the film makes you want see it AGAIN.   If you write a review that mentions a major event that happened in the film, but does not tell the viewer why the event mattered, then you've either missed something in the movie or you've just written a bad review.  If a movie doesn't seem to have any meaningful events in it, there's probably a good reason for that, so don't be too quick to jump to conclusions. Don't just tell me to take your review or what I think, tell me why.   There's plenty of times when reviewers leave out important information.  Don't be one of those people that says "I don't like this movie" because you don't agree with the idea of the film.   Show me the reasons why you like it.  When writing about a film, try to show the audience why you think the film is great.  Try to show that it's good and unique.  There are many films out there that you just don't care for, and sometimes they aren't very good, so be willing to admit that you're wrong and maybe you just like bad movies. Use your imagination!   Try to think of all the great things you could say about a movie and think about why it's great.   You don't have to go out and write a 100+ page "review" for every movie you see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ Review by A-Rod I'm no stranger to Hollywood, but the last thing I expected was to fall into a world of Hollywood horror films, but I did. The film itself was a slow paced, slow paced film. The plot kept me on the edge of my seat as I sat there trying to figure out how this film would end. After the credits roll the film gets a little more exciting, but still keeps me on my toes, and that's not always a good thing. The only downside of the film is that there were a lot of bad jokes, and the film was too long, so there are times when I wished the film would have ended a little earlier, but in the end I was able to finish the film, even though there was a lot that I had to put off until the last ten minutes or so of the movie.  Rating: 5/5 out of 5 stars Review by Tammi I have seen the movie, but am unable to give a rating because I'm so far away from it. But I can give a review of it. It is a movie I have never seen before. It was made by a film maker who had never made a film before. His style is unique and his story is intriguing. He told a true story that was told well. The actors, and they are a very strong cast, did a fine job. I really enjoyed the movie and have to say that I'm very glad I saw this. I have watched a lot if horror movies, but never an independent film. And this one will stand the test of time because of the unique story and the actors, who really made it a special movie. For my money, I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to experience something different.  I would like to give some advice to this writer, who does not know the real story behind this movie, and is not able to see how it has so much relevance to our world. I would not say that everyone should watch this movie because it is not as easy as it might sound. It takes a lot to do a story like this and it takes many talents, including a great director, to do this well. Don't expect the whole movie to be shown and then you will have it all in one sitting. You will have to sit and wait until the end when the story unfolds. I will say that this movie left me at a loss for words. I am really disappointed that so much

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. Read one great review. Show your love for a great movie: Like a great beer, a great film is an acquired taste. A friend who really loves a good beer will often go out of their way to talk about it when they go to a beer tasting. The same is true of movie lovers. They know how good a film is, but they also know that they need to be in the theater in order to truly experience the good, so they can appreciate the finer details.  And as soon as a film's reviews go viral, you'll start seeing lots of movie reviews. You can't go on Facebook or Twitter or the like if you're not talking about your movie.  the review of the movie you're watching now  Now, back to the movie.

I like the movie and I know that I should see it. -  (5) Movie Reviews That Actually Matter  Just because I am in the mood to talk doesn't mean I'm going to be able to write any good movie review. In fact, just as a warning, the people who write and edit movie reviews often don't even watch the movies they review. This isn't a problem, it's just a fact. I also write review after review after movie review for free. I have no reason to give up my free time and put a price on my own movie reviews to get paid. I believe in my movie reviews, so I hope that you do too. In that spirit, here are five movie reviews that are not only worthwhile but that actually matter. I'll get to them in a moment, but first let's take a look at how film critics rate movies. I know this is probably a topic that gets people upset (I think I got a few angry messages when I wrote this post. Here's one of them. And a few others too. I think it's worth it.) But you have to understand the way that movie critics rate films. I'll explain. In The Big Lebowski, Jeff Bridges' character is having a beer at a bar. He talks about the movie on the TV and a couple of his buddies ask him what he thought of it. "I enjoyed it," he

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here is one about  Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens. The best movie of the year:   The Martian by Andy Weir (my review) (The best book of the 2015 so far is  The Fault in Our Stars by John Green, which has made it onto my best list ) The most underrated book of 2015:    The Lives of Tao by David Grann   The film that made me cry:  Kubo and the Two Strings by Hayao Miyazaki  My personal favorite movie of 2015 thus far:  - - - My favorite movie from all the movies I reviewed this year was  Star Trek Into Darkness.  I was surprised at how many people loved the movie and even more surprised to see the number increase after I reviewed the film.  For those who don't know, the Star Trek movies are one of the most beloved franchises in all of film. I don't think there has been a better installment yet.  It's not as visually stunning as some of the other movies I've seen in the series, but the story is just as good.   It might be the best movie I've ever seen in my life.  The music, the acting, the humor, the dialogue, and the story are all perfectly executed. The film does a very good job of introducing the Federation in the first episode and then having the crew start to deal with some alien creatures from the far reaches of the galaxy.  Star Trek will always be a favorite franchise to me.  I hope my fellow reviewers enjoyed my reviews this year and that they might enjoy the movies as well.  Thanks for reading.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________I got hooked on watching science fiction when I was 13 and now I am 43 and I still love it. I would have to say that Aliens, The Thing, and Inception are my favorite science fiction movies.  Dirk_M:   Hi, thank you for making your movies. I liked the first Aliens a lot, and this was one of the movies that got me thinking about the human condition. I think your work on this one was better than you ever had in Alien. I have no idea if any of it is original, but it's better than the Alien films you did.  andrew  The first Aliens is just a great movie that shows a small group of people who have decided to survive in an alien world by any means necessary. , I was at a friend's house yesterday and he showed me the "Aliens" DVD and I must say that I was impressed!  I also watched the Alien vs. Predator Special and I loved that! I will say though that I think there's more to the story of "Alives". The Aliens were very intelligent, but their motivation for destroying Earth was very mysterious. What if there's something else, a different Alien than the one that started the whole Alien vs Predator affair?  Also, why were some of the Engineers wearing suits when they landed on Earth?  for one of my favorite scenes was when the Engineers tried to destroy Earth using the Alien in their control room, but they had to destroy it in time with their own ship. What were they trying to achieve? . I also like the Aliens because they have a unique personality. There's a scene near the end where a group of Engineers from the ship are trying to convince a group that live in a cave (a nice touch) of the idea that humans are the enemy. But the people in the cave are convinced.  the movie really was well made.  to top all this is a great soundtrack by Danny Elfman that is very good and it will keep you going long after you've seen the movie. I'm not a big fan of the aliens, but I think they could have done a better job than what was shown here.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The movie was a huge success, I had great friends and family who got to see it with me and it's only $20, which is a bargain for a movie that's only 8 hours long. I'm always looking for cheap movies to watch with my family, so when I was offered this movie I was really excited. The only thing I can think of is this was a better adaptation of the book. It was definitely more action-y than the book, but it's still a pretty interesting read. I found the story really engaging and I really liked that it wasn't a book that would be too difficult for people to get through. I would definitely recommend this to any Harry Potter fan. The review is for the DVD version, which has the extended runtime of 12 hours.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L4uHfvJh6c&index=21&list=PL3cJ9r2F1FZWKf8pTvYdO9w3nqZgJbw&index2=1&feature=plcp It took me a few tries to figure out how to do this. After that, I got it.  In conclusion, this movie isn't a bad film.  It is one of my favourite things to watch.  If you haven't watched it yet, make a note to watch this.  The film shows two sides of the war.  One, it is all about the Japanese, so it isn't all about Germany.  Another, the Germans are not all bad and have some redeeming features.  And that is one thing I can't stand about the movie.  What is the main thing about the film that I don't like?  The war. This is one part of the film where I have a hard time to recommend the movie and that is because of the fact that the war itself is such a terrible part of our history.  You see, I think that the film could have taken place 20 years earlier, during the time of WWI.  Instead, the film takes place during WWII.  That is a problem.  When you are a young child, you are taught that if you have seen something, you must learn about it.   That's what I learned about the Second World War in school.  "Here, read this article about the Great War".  Well, I can say that I learned quite a bit more about WWI after reading this book and the documentary it is based on.  Also, it isn´t as if the Germans had done a great job at stopping the war at that point.  On the contrary, they did a poor job at it and the war had not ended yet.  Furthermore, the fact is that a large portion of the population of Germany, France and Great Britain didn't know about the war even before the start.  So, what is the point of telling the story of a people that didn't even know about WW1.  This is another thing that bothers me.  Not only this, the whole war was all for the sake of the "Fatherland".  This Fatherland, this Empire.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ http://www.thehollywoodlens.com ________________________________________  I'm not sure about the rest of the world, but in my home the movie "The Hateful Eight" is my "go to" film for the next 8 hours after leaving the theater. The only movies that come to mind are "The Exorcist" and "The Shining" (if you're into the psychological horror genre), and as a lover of the genre I was totally blown away by the cinematography, the costumes, the acting, the music, the overall atmosphere... all the way down to the sound. This movie really is a must-see.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. Your review will be added to the Movie Ratings, and will show up on the list. If you like the movie, and you don't rate it below 5 stars, I won't post it in the list anymore, and no one will get to see it.  I think that everyone reading this is familiar with the concept of movies being rated by movie critics. The idea is that critics rate the movies that they see based on how enjoyable they are, rather than how well a movie actually tells a story. The only problem with this idea is, that a lot of the "top" movies that have been around for a long time tend to get bad reviews, but some "underrated" movies get good reviews. In fact, a lot movie ratings are actually based on movie ratings, with the critics giving the same review in all their reviews. So that's where my movie ratings come from: the critics. If I think that the movie that I see is good, and I rate it above 5 stars (a 5 means that it's "very good"), the movie rating will be good. If the movie is below 5 but I rate the movie as "good", the movie will be rated above 5, and the critics will give the same rating. This is what I think is the most fun about my ratings system, and probably why I do what I do: it lets us all have a common and objective way of rating movies. Instead of being stuck in our own personal preferences, I can rate a movie, knowing that everyone else will know the exact same rating as me. I can also use the ratings to figure out if a movie is getting good reviews, and if the critic is giving us a good or bad review, it will let me know what the right rating is. A simple and easy way to do this is to rate the rating system as a whole, and look at the "Rotten Tomatoes" list of Top Rated Movies. The number next to the number of people that gave a movie a rating of "8.5" is the total number of movies that the critics rated that were rated 8.5 or higher. So for example, if there were 50 critics who rated a movie as 8.3, then the total Rotten Tomatatoes total for all the 8.0+ rated movies would be: 50 * (8.3-1) = 44. In this list, the average rating of movies is an 8.

This is a common misconception.)  There are countless movies out there that I've watched many times and didn't like at all, just because the director was trying too hard to be something he wasn't. If I've had the chance to watch them again with a fresh mind, I can tell you that I find new things to like and dislike. It's not like I watch bad movies every day, or that every movie I see is a waste of time. Some are great, but the more I watch them, the more they become predictable.  Don't make the same mistakes I did. Don't make a movie that is so bad that you think people would never want to watch it. Make a movie you love that others might enjoy as much as you do, but don't let yourself be controlled by the expectation that people will never enjoy it as much again.  a movie so bad it makes you not want to enjoy it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ How do you rate movies? __________ ______________ How would you rate a movie if it's great? __________________________________________________________ Why do you want to be a part of this project? ______________________ __________________  RAW Paste Data  _____________________________________________________________________________________________ WHAT WE'RE DOING: We are trying to raise funds to create a feature length documentary about how to bring a child into the world. How to bring life into the lifeless? We are attempting to create something that will not only show the many great things we can do with our babies, but will also show that these great things are not the be all and end all of parenting. We will be using the funds to pay for some of our travel expenses and for the actual film. We already have some interviews lined up and are planning on shooting in the next 3 to 4 months. Any money over our goal of $15,000 will go into paying our crew to create the documentary. Here is some more information about the project: WHY DO YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS DOCUMENTARY? We think there is a huge need for this type of documentary, especially in the west coast states. While it is extremely beneficial to be able to show the world that it is possible to have a child, we also have a lot of people who would prefer not to have children. While this is not necessarily a bad thing and many of these parents could certainly live a normal life, it can be very difficult for them to find that balance between the two. What we want to show with this documentary is that you don't have to have one child, but that there are ways to have both a great life and be a good parent. How do we do that? We want to give parents that have children a reason to show their friends and family that they are not doing anything wrong. We also want to use this film to show how we can all be happy with our lives and still be parents. Why are we creating this documentary? We've all been there. The only thing that separates us from being a child is the amount of time we spend as a parent. When you start to have kids and you feel like your life is over, it's hard to believe it could be better. Most people are so scared of becoming parents, they don't give it a chance. The people that do take the chance are the ones who end up loving their child. They know the importance of giving everything they have in this life

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ "Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace" is a film you don't want to miss and is one of the best action films of all time. The cast is exceptional, the cinematography is fantastic, and the acting is top notch. It also has great sound design and an awesome opening crawl that sets the tone perfectly. This movie has everything you could want from a Star Wars film and is easily one of my favorite films of the last 15 years. As it happens, I had to wait an extra week to watch this because I had been working on a project that I couldn't let go of (the movie, not the job), and when I finally got to the theater, I felt extremely satisfied. A great movie, great cast, great music, great effects and a great opening crawl! So much to love about this movie and one of your top ten must-see movies of the 21st Century.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie can win an award or an audience's heart. If it doesn't, the audience may never come back to it again. A good movie will inspire you to write a review and keep your word to yourself about it, in your own words. If you want your review to be good enough that you will remember and recommend it to others, you must be able to put your own experiences into words. And that requires writing a review! So, let's get started! 1. What kind of movie are you reviewing? There are a lot of genres of movies. But the most popular ones are action, comedy, drama, thriller, horror, and fantasy. Most of these genres have a great variety of stories, and each has its own merits and faults. So, how can you decide which genre to review? You have to find the story you want to write about, see what kind of stories other people are writing about it in the reviews. There is also a whole genre called "comedy" that has its fair share of good and bad movies. 2. What are your audience's age ranges? The reviews will be written in English, but if you write a movie in another language (such as German or Japanese) you will have to make some adjustments. It may be difficult for non-English speakers to write English reviews in those languages. But, if you find that your audiences are very different from each other, then writing a good review for each age group could be very rewarding. 3. What's your level of ability? First of all, the type of movies you review may help you in deciding if you are able to review. It is good to start out with something easy if you have not done much writing before. Then, get yourself comfortable with writing a detailed and detailed review, with a good grammar and syntax. 4. What do you want the readers to feel in their hearts when they watch the movie? This is one of the best questions to ask yourself in order to determine the type, genre, and story you are going to write. Do you want an action movie or a comedy? How many people are going see your movie and will it make a big impression? Do you have an ending to your movie that the audience will be looking for? There is no one rule that will give the right kind of review. Different writers can find the type they want. 5. What kinds of movies have you
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________.  Write a negative review about your experiences at _________.   Now, go watch the film and see if you don't notice a few things:   1. The way they shot this film is so bad, that it's hard to understand what's happening.  the shots are almost all static. They move and zoom a few times and then they stay the same. They never move around and zoom out. And, the transitions in between scenes are horrible. Even if they zoom in on someone's face for a few seconds, the person is moving or is in the background by the time that the camera pans back to him.   2. The writing is so terrible. You can tell that they just looked for a quick hit at the beginning, then just threw everything into a pot and burned everything. The dialogue is so weird and the dialogue is often hard to read. They sometimes make these really weird grammar mistakes that don't make sense.  .  and, it was just awful! The acting was awful. The character names and the names of the places that we visited were awful. And the people we met just seemed like they didn't even exist. We had heard stories about the place, but we had never really seen it. And we also had been told that the place was really hot. In the film, we had seen a hot spring and hot springs were just something we had heard about, but not seen. We were told that it was a super hot place, where you can be burned to death. Well, no, it wasn't. But the people were burned to Death when they came into contact with the water. They would not die instantly. They died slowly from dehydration and a lack of air. We saw some people die because they had no air and were not able to move.  A lot of the writing in this film seemed like it was improvised, but you can tell they really wanted to be at this place. You would see a man get out of his car at one point and the camera would move right up to him and the other actors would jump in the shot and all of a sudden he is gone. You could tell that this guy did not want to be there. I can't remember who he was, but I know he wasn't a character actor. And when he left the place he was never shown returning.   . When we went to the place where we stayed there were no houses there, just one

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ A little note on the ratings: I don't really understand how I could give a movie a 10 and not 10 stars. Maybe if I was at a convention and got to see the movie first and was told to rate it, I'd do it a little differently. But no, it has to be the box office numbers, I guess. But again, I've never seen any reviews saying the movie is bad so I don't really understand why. A bit of trivia: __________ The reason I did the "movie review" for this film was due to the fact that it is a movie about my favorite band of all time, Kiss. It's about the band coming together when they needed a lead singer, which led to the creation of the one and only, "Kiss." I also really like how the movie doesn't focus on any of the band members. It doesn't have to do with them, just that they were all still around and still in the band when this film took place. I like this, because it allows the movie to just get on with its story without overstepping it's boundaries and going into a lot of plot holes. You won't have this problem with the music scene that follows this. I guess the only reason the movie got me so excited to watch it was the fact I could see the whole band again. There was also a really fun moment where all four band members were in a hallway at the airport and I had to make sure to take photos with them all (hint hint!). The songs from this movie are a little too corny for me but I guess they'll work for other fans. I liked that there was no kiss at the end. It just seemed a little anticlimactic. I was really hoping for a kiss for the final scene, but I suppose that's more of a reflection of my taste in movies than it is of the film's.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ I enjoyed this movie. It was entertaining, and had some great action scenes. I didn't get the gist of the story, or the characters, but I enjoyed the movie, so that is not a bad thing. I also really enjoyed the character interactions. One guy in particular had a lot of great lines, and there are a few more I can't say I liked. The movie does try to go off on a bit of a tangent at some points, but it's nothing that could really derail the movie's flow. Overall, a fun movie, though I felt like the ending was somewhat rushed. It definitely felt a bit rushed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Wow! That was very, very well done. I thought I was getting an art house movie with the soundtrack and the characters were so well acted and the storyline was interesting." I'm also not too much of a horror fan. I don't have a favorite movie, even though I really enjoyed "The Ring". I think I was expecting a more gory film. I did not know that this was a film that was inspired by the TV series "The Twilight Zone". I was a little unsure about how I would feel after watching a horror film. It does have some of the classic aspects of horror, even if they are a little overplayed. I really loved the way it had a sense of humor that was not forced, it just felt natural and at times even funny. The performances were also all great and I loved the cast. They all did a great job. 4.5/5 My rating: 7/10

I'll definitely be watching the sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want to recommend a movie that is good but not great, you're going to have a hard time.  I don't watch too many films that are only good.  The list of movies I've seen recently that I'm enjoying include "The Dark Knight Rises", "Gravity", the recent "The Help" and "The Master."  I can't imagine ever watching a bad movie that I enjoyed.   There are movies that I would like to recommend that I didn't see yet.    For example, "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" (I'm looking at you, "Spider-Man 3").    I know that it's a good film, but I haven't seen it yet.   As far as I'm concerned, I don't recommend movies for the simple reason that I don' t know how they'll turn out.  But I do know that some of my favorites are those that I haven' t seen yet. Don't like to see movies?  Don' t.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ (I also love watching good movies in bad theaters!) __________________________________________ A note on rating I've been reviewing movies since 1982, and I have a strong bias. As such, it's important for me to point out that the movie I'm reviewing today doesn't have a score in my database (at least not yet), and so, on a technical level, it doesn't seem to qualify for a numerical review. However, it is a movie I've been following very closely for a number of years, so my review is meant to give a sense of the movie and its place in the genre.  If you've read the book, you'll notice that my rating of the book is a little higher. I don't have the time or money to rate and review every book every year, so the books that I read tend to have a relatively low impact on my review scores. As of this writing, there are only two books of mine that I've rated, but I plan to update this page with those later this year. My review of "The Dark Tower" is based on my own personal taste in horror, and as such, I can't speak to the quality of the actual movie. However... I think "The Gunslinger"  is a terrific movie.  The plot is really, really, REALLY well-done. I love the idea of Roland returning to his "roots" and trying to fight his way back to the Tower, and it works as the film begins to develop. While I thought the film itself was pretty good, the story it was based on was pretty great, and there's a nice sense of tension to it all, as Roland gets more and more desperate to find the Dark Tower. I'm not going to talk about too much about the special effects in this movie, because I think they're pretty great. The way the actors are brought to life, as well as the great performances by Matthew McConaughey, Idris Elba, and Jessica Chastain all help to make this film. I also love the fact that we get to see what the "Gunslinger" is really like as a person, and the ways he struggles with his own humanity. There's also an important character in this film, as we meet the man who ultimately decides Roland's fate. In the book and movie, this character is not revealed until the end. In this case, this makes the entire film

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________ I read this book and was pleasantly surprised. I have seen it twice and it is definitely a good read! I would say that this is a true novel and has a nice plot line and very well done characters. It did not seem as realistic in the beginning as other people are, but once I got used to it, the author captured the story perfectly and made it really good. I loved it when the author used a different story line every time and gave us new twists on the characters and their journey. I really think this book is not only about the events that took place in the book, but it is really about the relationships of the people around the characters. And this is where the author was very good. Even when the character is going through a big change, she was always so interesting, always thinking about what was happening to them, what were they thinking of. I also liked that they had a lot of humor in this book, both for the characters as well as for the readers. And the ending is quite good, but I must say that I think there are still some things that could have been better. I would love to see a sequel, especially if the author can write another novel as good as this one. I think this is definitely worth a read and a book you can pass on to anyone that you think will enjoy this great story. And if you can't wait to read it, I would recommend getting this book so you can read this one and enjoy all the great characters and the great plot line!Read full review

The film is very fast paced and a blast to watch. There are some moments that might bore you, but they are few and far between. I loved the way that the script and acting was written for this film. The characters all feel very real and you can tell they are really passionate about what they are doing. I'm not sure that I would watch it again if I was a complete newbie to the genre but I will certainly be looking to see it in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  The main reason that people do not like movies is that they are not good enough. Movies that are good are too expensive to make.  As a movie critic, I am a sucker for good movies. I have seen plenty of films that were terrible and many that were excellent. The truth is, I have not seen all the movies on the list. In fact, I don't watch movies all that much, although I do like to read reviews that are positive. I feel like my opinion of a movie is a good barometer of its quality. Some people see the same movies time and again. I find the best movies to be those that surprise me and challenge my perception. I am often surprised at how good films can be. I also like to watch films that take a different approach. Movies like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" challenge the viewer. In other words, movies that are not your average.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ What makes this a good film? I don't know if I can adequately express the importance of this movie to me without giving away a major twist. I will, however, try. The plot itself is relatively simple. A group of scientists are sent on a mission to an unknown planet to collect samples of DNA to study. They are taken to a planet's surface where they meet a very old man who introduces himself as "Father". The man explains that he has lived on that planet for so long that he is used to their ways. The scientists are shocked and confused, and begin questioning the old man about what he knows. The old man explains a number of things about his world and his species. He states that there is only one god, and that he created a world where humans were only useful for reproduction and research. He shows the scientists a piece of equipment which is designed to grow human beings. The new "children" are raised to be docile and to be as intelligent as possible, which seems pretty damn good to me, at least until it becomes apparent that they are being trained to be murderers. This whole sequence was really creepy, and I really hope that it shows up in the sequels. __________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________ Rating: 4/10 ___________________________________________________________________ My rating system is not perfect, but I feel like it gives me something to work with. ________________________________________ Reviewer's Note: "I didn't want to leave."

So when I got to the theater, I looked around and saw all the people in the theater with a Batman poster on their wall. I felt like I had found the perfect movie. I thought, "Oh my God, this is going to be so much fun." And then when I was done, I went home and told my husband, "This is the greatest thing I've ever seen." (Read my review of the movie here.)  And I can tell you what was really fun. Watching the movie. You know, I'm a theatergoer. I can't really sit through a movie unless I can turn on some music and have a nice atmosphere. And the Batman movie has just a really good mood. I think that they captured it so well. I loved the idea of putting it in a comic book. I'm very excited that this movie was made. It has been a long time coming.  But I also got to hear a lot of things from some of the people who work on the movie that were just so amazing. And I've got to tell you, it's not like I was hearing some of these things from my brother, for example, who worked on the first film, so they're not that surprising. But there are a lot that are surprising. For example, in the beginning of the film, there's a scene with Bruce and Selina that you'll find out in the movie when you come to the end of the third act. And Bruce, in a conversation he's having with Selina, he says, "I'm gonna take this job," and she's like, "Yeah, that's good," and he says he's gonna get rid of the cape and the cowl.    I got to say, you know, as I was watching the movie I was just like, OK, that was a very unexpected and fun surprise. I feel like if I told my brother this, he would have been all

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I like this movie because it is a good example of a movie about people who were so desperate that they actually do something very unusual. When we first meet the guy in the park, he is so weak that he is almost unable to move his legs, and he can't even see or speak. But he is also so desperate for a girl that he does the very strange thing, and in his desperation he tries to commit suicide. It is really quite sad and also quite funny. It doesn't go in any direction that is particularly well-written, but it is still a good one, and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves to see really unusual and funny movies about people.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________ This movie is not as good as some of the other "Star Wars" movies that have come out. It is not even as good if you count the 3.0 out of 4 stars rating by the critics. It can be very interesting. But, it is not good at all. I did like the "The Empire Strikes Back" but it is kind of an inferior product. However, it does have a good ending. The acting is not very good. It takes a lot of effort for the actors to deliver the lines. I think the actors were given enough lines that it was easier for them to say what they wanted to say. When Han Solo does not respond when the Rebel Alliance is being attacked, it really shows the actor's skill. A lot of the story lines that are interesting are the same story lines from "The Force" movie (a prequel). Most of the stories are about the "Jedi Knights" fighting the Sith Knights and then in the end they fight Darth Vader. There are a few of the "Imperial Officers" (like the one in this movie) who are a good addition to the story line. However there are only a few who really are interesting. When the bad guys are trying to destroy the Death Star, Han Solo is the first to get hit and he is not happy. The bad guys start to use different weapons and it takes some time for him to react to it. I am not sure if the "Sith" are really evil or if they are just playing bad guys. At one point the "bad guy" is talking about being so powerful that the Empire would not stand a chance. This movie does not go very far and it could have been a lot better than it is. However the story is good and the actors are great. If you like the original "Star WARS" movie then you will love this. If it doesn't make you want to see the whole series then I guess you will want to look elsewhere. You can find this movie in your local library if you want it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ 1) "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1966) - A lot of the good people (especially the white folks) didn't like this movie, but I loved it. The story is the same as "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." The U.S. Army was trying to get an atomic bomb to stop China from getting the bomb, and they were caught in the middle of a war in the Korean peninsula. It was really a mess and this movie shows a lot of what was going on and a lot more of the war than a lot. There are a lot funny parts in this movie (there are funny parts, but most of the movie is serious) and it was pretty much a remake of the great, classic "Blazing Saddles." I can't recommend this movie enough. 2) "Cannonball Run" (1925) - It's a race around the US (in the early days of the automobile) and there are many funny parts. I think it's a better movie than "Catch 22," because "Catching 22" is more realistic, but the "CANNONBALL RUN" is even funnier than the classic movie. 3) "Barry Lyndon" (1975) - I think this movie is one of the best movies ever made, and it's very difficult to find a better adaptation of a book. It's also a great way to introduce the main character, Arthur Miller. There's also an awesome song (by Billie Holiday) in the end, which is amazing. 4) "For Whom the Bell Tolls" (1960) - Another great movie about a war, in this case a World War. "The Bell Toll" is so well made that it's funny the whole time, even though it's serious at the beginning. 5) "Shampoo" (1982) - One of the funniest movies ever. There is a scene in it where a woman is on a train, and she's singing "My Way" by Frank Sinatra and someone tells her to stop. The song is in the background, and we cut to her singing. It reminds me of when my mother would tell me to stop when I was on the bus, and I would stop. It might be my favorite movie. Also, the main characters are very cute (and that's how I like it). 6) "Rocky" (1976) -

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  The movie starts with a slow start, but once things pick up the pace of the plot is really impressive. We meet a group of people trying to make a new life for themselves and they are looking for a job. We watch them try and make the life of the group a better place. I have not heard much about these people before, but they do have a purpose and it is their mission to help others find a new way to survive in a world where they now live. One of them is a former soldier who lost the use of his left arm and leg during his time in combat. He gets a new prosthesis and is working in a lab where he tests his equipment on animals for the sake of his research. He decides to use the test subjects on himself and his new prostheses. We are introduced to two of the test subject characters, one is a man named Frank who has come in to work at the lab, and he is trying to find a good spot to live with his family. This is where we first see that the movie will be pretty slow and quiet, we start the story with Frank trying to figure out where he is going to live. We get a few scenes with Frank and his family in the beginning of the film. We also get to know how he found out about the lab and the job of his life. The only downside of the movie is the ending, but the ending is what we wanted the entire time and it was all worth it!  _______________________________________________________________  Signs is a good, if very slow paced film. There is not a whole lot of action in the movie. The best part of the story is the characters. There are two main characters in this movie and they have different reasons for why they choose to work in the lab. Frank is an ex-soldier who lost his left leg and arm during combat. His left arm is attached to a robotic arm which he uses to work. Frank was trained as a soldier but found out he was a cripple and that he no longer had any use for his limbs. He got a job in the laboratory where he uses his prosthetic to test his equipment. He finds his job very difficult because he has no friends and doesn't have a family. He works with some other people who were recruited by Frank. They come from all over the country to be in the Lab to help Frank. In the beginning, it seems like the film is about

If someone else is watching the same movie as you, why are they talking about the same parts? If it was a movie you want to see again, what should you do? Write a comment about something you enjoyed about the movie, and why it was fun.  Why would you review it?  You have to choose a reason why you would like to review a movie. Some people might want to give it a review because it was the first time they have seen it, or because they heard about it and wanted to share the experience with someone else. These are two very different reasons for writing a review, and are different enough to merit different strategies.  in-depth (the most descriptive) reviews are written with lots of information. This makes it easier to find something you liked about the film, but the downside of this is that you might forget to remember a few things.  the less detailed, the better. You will not be able to find every detail if the film is so detailed that it can be found in a quick Google search. . - How would you rate the movie on a scale from 1 to 10: ___________________  The movie should be rated as a 1 if you have never seen it before, or it is new to you. If the movie was new to your parents, you would probably rate it at the 10 level, or a 9 if it's your first movie. 2 to 5 stars is good. It is still one of the better films of 2016, and it deserves your attention. Movies rated 3 to 4 or 5 stars are usually good and fun, but aren't worth watching if you only want to learn about the characters. If you have a general interest in film, a 2 to 5 star movie may be more up your alley. If the movie is an animated film, or the characters were animated and you can't understand any dialogue, or you didn't care about the story, it is probably worth only 1 to 2 stars. These ratings are just a general guideline, and you may want to review movies with very different audiences and styles. What makes a movie good? What makes it fun? Is it worth it?

If you want to see some of the films mentioned below, please click this link and go to the "Netflix Streaming Films" section of my web site, or scroll down to the bottom of this article for the streaming movies. _________________________________________ I just saw this documentary the other day in which we learn that the United States has lost nearly $500 billion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States was going to have to pay out $200 billion of that $500. The movie, The War Machine, was directed by Mike McCoy and produced by Peter Morgan. It was a really interesting and thought-provoking movie. ___________________  SOUND GAMES: A STORY OF RENAISSANCE   (1957)  A movie about the birth and development of cinema in France from the 1930s to the 1950s. Director Jean Vigo was a pioneer in the development of a cinema made from sound. __________ The most interesting part of the movie is the short clip about the history of sound effects. When Vigo is talking about the development he states "They invented the sound of a bird flying into the screen. When they invented the ear of a woman talking on the telephone, it came in the form of an egg. The camera became like a microscope that could see. The sound is an active factor." In other words, the movie takes you through the early days of sound as well as the early stages of sound and image and filmmaking and tells you why the change in sound was made in that way. _______  L'Amour Fou (1965) .... a modern-day romantic fantasy about a young woman, a lover, and a man who loves her, and tries to convince her that she is the most beautiful woman alive.. _______________ I saw this film in 1967. The film is a contemporary romance that is based on the love story of two women who become lovers in the late 20s. As the title suggests, the film is very romantic and at times a little bit campy. The story is told in a somewhat straightforward way. The two women are all right-brained (they use different parts of the brain) and their differences are a major theme in the story. The woman is an intelligent person who is very

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________  And I did. I enjoyed the movie immensely. The movie has a few flaws, but overall, the movie is a good one. The writing is good, the music is great, the action scenes are excellent, the voice acting is good too. The main actor was excellent as well. I think he got a bad rep for the movie, but he wasn't all that bad in the movie. I thought it was a good script. I was surprised at how many of the characters had some redeeming qualities, and I thought the movie had great pacing. I did enjoy the character's interactions, but the ending was a bit confusing. I liked the ending the most of all. I found it very touching, but it's kind of a drag. I can understand why it didn't happen at first, because of the movie's plot, but after that, I had to re-watch the movie a few times to figure out what happened. I guess that could happen to any movie, I suppose. I just liked the movie and I think that it's a really good movie. It's fun, it's fast-paced, it has a good story, and the acting was good. I recommend this movie. _________________________________________ As a bonus, a little video I made on how to make the music for the opening title sequence: __________________________  What's the deal with the movie? __________________________________ It's called "Sideways." It stars Ryan Reynolds, Chris Pine, and Amy Adams, and it was directed by Rob Reiner, based on a script by Kevin Williamson. It was released on June 13, 2014. I watched it in the theaters, so it's been quite a while since I've watched it. I've only seen it a few months, actually. I wasn't very impressed with the acting, but I liked it. The music, the opening and closing theme are all excellent. I'm sure it wasn't that hard to make that music, but that's the way I like my music, anyway.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The movie: This is a fun movie that has the right amount of laughs, action and suspense that the movie keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. The character development was a little off in the beginning, but it gets better as the story progresses. The ending was pretty cool and suspenseful. The movie has a great cast of supporting characters and their roles in the story add to the plot. This is an entertaining and enjoyable movie that is worth watching. I give the movie 4 out of 5 stars. The review: I loved this movie, it is a movie that I enjoyed watching, I loved the storyline, I really enjoyed the characters. I thought the action was great, and the suspenseful and funny part were very enjoyable. I can see how this movie could be a hit, and why not? It has the good laughs and action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's the most awesome movie I've ever seen." This sentence is my most used compliment for a good story, and I think it's one of the most common compliments you'll hear about a movie. And it's not just a matter of saying it. Everyone agrees that watching movies is great, that watching a good film is one of life's most enjoyable experiences. People who watch movies do this because it has to do with the enjoyment and fun. They're not out to make people laugh or feel happy. They are simply there to get lost in the world of their favorite movies. But that's just my interpretation. So you've decided that you want to go watch a movie and now what? 1. Find the cinema that's playing that night. There are a lot of people who watch a lot more movies than the average person, and some of them will go to multiple theatres. It's up to you to find the cinema with the best reviews. I would suggest doing this using the site filmguide.co.uk, which lists the reviews for every single cinema in the country. I don't recommend the site as a way to find a film to see, but instead use it to find films that have some great reviews. The site has a database of over 7 million reviews and there's a section for every major theatre in the UK. It doesn't matter what the theatre is called, or even what language you speak, you can simply search on a particular language or town and find the theatre with the most reviews. 2. Read the reviews on filmguide Don't just take my word for it. Read what the other moviegoers are saying about the film. 3. Go see the movie. Now that you've done all that, you're ready to go and see the film, right? Well, yes, you are. But this is where the fun begins. It's possible to go to a cinema and have a good time, but what you really want to do is to go see a film that has some good reviews and makes you go crazy. And you can do that at a theatre that's doing really well. The filmguide has a good review for all the theatres in the Netherlands (it's updated each week), and each cinema is given a high enough rating to be listed. So if you go to one theatre that has a high review (it won't be the same one as the one on the

It's used to show that the person you've just learned something from knows you, and that you've become his/her friend. To know means to connect with. to be related. Now I'll try to explain what it means to be the author and/or artist of a particular work of art. The first thing I want to do is say that it's important to think about the relationship you have with the artist. If you don't have that connection, then it doesn't matter if you liked the work of the artist - it won't make any difference in how you're going to feel about it as a book, movie, or whatever. The relationship has to be solid. This is where the importance of not being a passive observer of the work lies. It doesn't have to be a good relationship or even a love-hate relationship. It can be just a friend who you talk to on the internet. Or it can be someone you read an article or something by that was well written and interesting. A book you read as an adult. Or a movie. Or something you were inspired by. It could be anything you read or

We are doing this in three parts, in case you missed any of the previous installments]  This review is from: Star Trek: The Motion Picture  It doesn't feel like Star Trek is supposed to be this good. But, it is. The Motion picture does just about everything it needs to do, in order to create a work of art. The movie really is the first feature that feels like a Star Trek movie, with the exception of the occasional "I hate to do this" moment. The effects are just great, the acting is fantastic, and the story is gripping. Even if you're not a Star Wars and/or Trek fan, you'll enjoy this. There is so much great material in this film, it's just a shame it's so hard to find.  As previously mentioned, it opens with some footage of a bunch of people on a train headed to the future. This train is the Enterprise, which is the most powerful spacecraft in the Federation, and is capable of traveling at high sublight speeds (a lot faster than a passenger can see). This is a nice little way to establish the setting and give us a good idea of the ship's purpose in the film. Then there are some scenes of the main characters (Kirk, Spock and McCoy), while Kirk talks to an old friend in a bar. In the bar, Spock is discussing how Kirk used to always get into arguments with Spock, and in their childhoods, Kirk got annoyed at Spock because he always came to the wrong conclusions.  and, Spock points out that, while his logic may be perfect and logical, his emotional response is not. Spock, who, again, has been very good in previous movies, is really starting to feel bad for Kirk. They're both feeling down because they can't seem to solve a problem they haven't been given. Spock gets a call from Scotty, the ship, and, of course, tells Kirk that he is not coming back from a mission, because he's sick. Kirk is confused, and so are we. : This really is a very good example of how

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________  Do you have a message for someone who hasn't yet seen your movie?  _______________   When someone sends me an IM from a stranger asking for advice about something, I usually respond with something like, "I have a bunch of movies I watch on a regular basis, but the best ones are the ones that are new to me." Or, I'll send an IM to a friend who I like a lot, and ask if they have any recommendations. Or, maybe I'll just send it to the movie I'm most excited for. I try to watch at least one movie a month. That's my plan. I like to think of it as a "movie marathon."  One of my favorite things to read in film criticism is how people react when they find out that they haven't seen a particular movie. "That movie wasn't bad," the critic will say. The reply is always something along the lines of "I'm glad I didn't have to see that one." I can't help but love the sentiment.  A few years ago, I had the pleasure of sitting across the table from the brilliant filmmaker J.J. Abrams at the Tribeca Film Festival. He was just wrapping up Star Trek Into Darkness, and he asked me a bunch questions. My favorite was, "So, what's next?"  I tried to be funny and honest about it, but when I tried to joke, I got all serious and started ramming my fingers into my temples. I told him that I was currently working on an adaptation of a screenplay by an Italian author, but he looked at me and said, "Oh no. This isn't the book. I can imagine what it's like, but it's going to be a very different film."  in the past year or so, I've started watching more films, and there's something really refreshing about watching a movie with new eyes. I feel like I can tell more about what a film means to me than I did when I was 20.  "You know, it's really not a secret that I'm a huge Star Wars fan."  a very old friend recently told me that I had some good writing on my hands and asked what I was working on.  he replied, "It's not a book. It's about a very important period of time in the development of the Star Wars universe." , I was asked to read a letter that a woman

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  Reviewers get to write as many as they like, but there's a limit to how many they can get right and how many other people will care.  the problem with reviews is not that they're biased, it's that they don't say much about what the movie really is. , by Robert J. Koepp, is a documentary that follows the filmmakers who tried to make a serious, emotionally involving film about the last days of the Soviet Union:  The idea of making a "reality" movie was something of a pipe dream. It would be hard enough to create a story about the Soviet system that was believable to a large audience without turning that story into a melodrama. But even after the fall of communism, a handful of independent filmmakers were able to find money for a series of high-profile independent movies about the horrors of the regime, but none of the films was ever made. And they didn't have to be. A film festival, the Soviet Film Festival, was the first place where filmmakers could try out their new ideas, and filmmakers like Iulii Trofimovich and Sergey Fyodorov could find the resources to make films that had the potential to turn into the stuff of legend. A short film called "The Red Room," about a suicide squad that murders a girl's parents to keep her out of the school play, won first prize at the festival. But the Soviets' reputation for censorship prevented any of the filmmakers from trying again, and the rest of the short-film era was dominated by horror movies. There is a long tradition in independent filmmaking of taking the Soviet state at its word: If it's an atrocity, it has to have been done by the government and it has no other explanation. We'll never know why the gulag was built and who was in charge of it, but we do know that the system was cruel, brutal, and crueler still for the prisoners who were caught inside it. If Stalin had let go of the idea that the victims were traitors, we might never have known about the thousands of gulag children and millions of people who died. If the film had depicted a good, compassionate government, a good society, the government that cared for its people, it might have won a second prize. And we wouldn't have been spared all that horrible Soviet propaganda. The truth is, we don't know who built the gulags and who ordered the executions

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Please be as respectful as you can about the movie I am about to review.  I will take this seriously, and I will take it seriously because I want this movie to do well for all the right reasons.   If you don't want to be a dick for the movie (which is totally cool) I will ask that you take as long as you need to give me the time I need.  In this movie we go to an amusement park with a giant castle in it.  It is a very dark, cold and gloomy place that we all should not be allowed to go to.  The first act is a dark, brooding one, where we are introduced to the main character of the movie, his family, and the castle.  We find out that there's something really weird going on in the castle, and that the family is having strange visions of death and bad things happening to them.  In the middle of the second act, they start to have dreams in which they are being chased by ghosts of dead people.  These visions don't seem very interesting in the beginning, and we learn that they were going through a bad period at home that they're just being triggered by what is happening in the movie.  While the first half of the film is just trying to create tension in the audience, the second half is all about the visions, and what the character sees in them. The ending of the first act just creates an atmosphere of uncertainty.  Now let's talk about the cast.   Michael Chiklis is our lead.  He is a wonderful actor, and he is in this movie for all of it's good.  Most of the time he is not seen, but when he does show up, he is awesome.  There is a scene where the kids are in the amusement park and he walks up to one of them and whispers to her.  As he talks to her, she can't really hear him, but he seems to be speaking to her through the darkness.  Then when he turns around and looks at the girls he says "I can see the light."  When she looks at him and smiles, he says, "I see my daughter, and she is beautiful.  That's why I love you, my friend, I love all of you.  I love my daughter with all my heart, I'm proud of you."   So yeah, he just has an amazing performance.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  The movie was good. The director's skill as a filmmaker is clear. The acting was good, the music was good (not bad). The story was well told, and the characters were good. However, there were a lot of mistakes, and one of the more glaring ones was an editing mistake which made it seem as though the actors were talking over each other, even though we could clearly see they were not talking. We then had to look up to the next scene to find out what had happened, which is ridiculous since most movies have an explanation for that, and even when you go to the director's site to see if you can figure out why, there are explanations provided.   In conclusion, I was disappointed. The story is interesting, the acting is good, and it may be fun for a couple hours, but the editing is the culprit and makes it into one of those bad movies you wish you'd seen before you had to see it again. It was better to wait for the DVD to come out. I will not be purchasing it or even watching it again, since the editing error is unforgivable.  : )   I loved the movie! It was one of my all time favorites!  I was disappointed, yes! I was hoping for a very good movie! And then the editing came up.   the acting was fine, it wasn't terrible.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  Write a negative review about an ugly movie:_________.  The most effective thing I learned from this book was to always try and improve. So I went back and started making lists of all the movies I had seen, and decided to write down my opinions about each one, and review them. I was very glad I did, because I have now gotten better at watching movies, and I hope that these little tips helped me along. This list is a bit long and a bit subjective, but as a list of recommendations, it worked out quite well. I have also been asked for recommendations for the movies of the 1980s, so I'll be getting back to that. There was a reason why I went through so many movies in the beginning, and it was just because I was too obsessed with the fact that we were only at the beginning of a new trilogy. This is probably a very good thing that happened. The next step is to watch the rest of the trilogy and review it after all the time has passed. It will be much harder now.

Police said the woman told them she knew what she was watching was not a real sex scene because "she was in a bad mood." She denied knowing it was a film, and said her friend came over and filmed it in the bathroom, according to authorities. , the judge told the woman, "Why don't you try to remember what that movie was about?"

The world building and setting, as well as the fact that they all are real people, gives the film a realistic feel. The story is well told and the ending, while not as satisfying as I would have liked, is still an uplifting one that everyone will recognize. You can't deny that this is one of the best films of the year, and it will go down as one of my favorites as well. This is a film that everyone should check out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Did this review help you? [A] No [N] Yes [I] No Thanks for your feedback. [Vote]  Chasing Rainbows (1989) Share:   Chaining Sally is a comedy that features the famous comedian, Steve Martin, and his hilarious wife, Sally Field. Martin and Field play themselves as two old friends from college who get into a series of absurd mishaps and adventures in their daily lives. The film also stars John Candy and Richard Pryor.   I'm not a big fan of this one. It's fun but I was just sort of bored out of my mind from the get go.  . The acting is solid and the humor is funny. But it's just so darned dull. It seems that the filmmakers were thinking "let's make a pretty silly comedy and see how many people will like it." Well, not one person! The humor is so dead that it's embarrassing.   This is just a silly comedy that is more fun to watch on YouTube or on cable TV than it is to watch in a theatre. It is nothing more than a bunch of jokes that are a bit silly but don't have much of a point, and the characters are just plain boring. A lot of the humor comes from the characters and their interactions but even those interactions just aren't very funny. The movie also has a bit of a "message" with it. If you watch it, be prepared to be entertained but be aware that you're going to be bored pretty quickly.   is a funny but boring "sequel" to a well known comedy series. In this film, Martin and his friend Field have a bit too much fun, too fast, and not even really thinking things through. Martin is supposed to be the intelligent one and Field is the silly one. This movie also features a great cast of comedians but really it's the same old same old. This was a very "easy going" comedy that you could just watch. It really just follows the same plot of a bunch "college friends" who are too irresponsible and want to have too much of fun and don't think things through at all. The characters are all just sorta the same.The movie is a bit dull and just kind of meh. It has pretty good acting and some funny bits that aren't bad but it's also a very flat comedy. This is also a pretty "light-hearted" comedy so you might want to avoid this
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The film itself is nothing special, there are not many really good films from the 80's, I mean the films that are good, but are not very well known. It has to be really great that there are so few films that can be called great. But it is a good film that does not have a very good story, but is still a good story. As for the plot, it is the usual type of film. The story is interesting, and it's not boring, and not a stupid story. The only thing I would say is that the movie does not contain too much dialogue. But I guess that in my opinion, there is enough dialogue in some movies to make it very interesting. The characters are very interesting, the most interesting part of the story is the relationship between Michael and the other characters. All the characters have an importance to Michael's life. The characters are all very interesting and they all have some sort of relevance in Michael's world. Overall this is an interesting story with a great ending. It is a very interesting film, it has many strong points and it has a great story. I enjoyed watching it very much and I think that this movie is a masterpiece.  The Score: 9.0/10 What do you think?

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I don't know about you, but when I find a movie that I actually like, I don't mind if the reviews are bad. The audience members will judge it for themselves, but the critics will still be able to use the movie to provide their own personal opinions. The thing is, for the most part, movie critics are usually just trying to impress their peers, and the audience doesn't care if they think a movie was good or bad. But there are always those special cases, like in this case.  There are lots of different reasons why people find a good or a bad movie. Some have a sense of artistic appreciation, others are just curious, and some are just people who have a tendency to enjoy the same movies over and over. But for the majority, if the movie is terrible, the critic will say that it's the worst movie of all time. And that is just wrong. The worst movie is the one that is not good enough to be remembered, which is why I found this movie so intriguing and the fact that I found it to be one of the best movies ever made.  The movie is called The Exorcist, which is the best movie ever made and it deserves to be in the list of the worst movies ever created. The title of the movie implies the premise that this movie will show you the dark side of humanity. The fact that people are actually killed in this movie is not surprising. The story is based on real events and has elements of religious paranoia.  There is a lot of gore, but it isn't enough to shock people. I think the director of the film could have done more with it, because that is one of his strong points. The characters in the movie are all real people, and none of them are monsters. In the end, there is a certain logic to this movie that gives the film some validity.         When you are a little kid, you see these movies in a theatre. And then, you grow up, and you go to the cinema and watch the same kind of movies, but now, the people in them are actually dead. When you watch a movie like The Ex the last scene of the story makes you think. What if that had been you or your child, and that was why you had to see the movie in the first place? Well, it is a good question.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ My rating: __________ My ranking: _________________ My favorite: ______________________________________  The Last Jedi was a well-written, well-acted, well told Star Wars movie and it got everyone excited about all the possibilities for the future of the franchise. With the hype of Star Wars returning to theaters, this review will be updated as we learn more about the film. There were a number of interesting and fun sequences that made this the best of the Star Wars films.  One of the more interesting sequences was the battle on the Death Star. The last Jedi movie was a little light on action, but it was packed with action and set pieces and was a pretty entertaining movie. The Battle on the Dark Side of the Deathstar was probably one of the most entertaining scenes in the movie and made for a great finale. I really enjoyed the first film and this movie did not disappoint.  and it was a good sequel to The Force Awakens. It was not exactly a bad movie, but there are several scenes that could have been cut or at least edited more. In this film the main villain of the movie, General Hux, is not even mentioned once. Instead, Kylo Ren is given all the credit for stopping the Resistance. While a good plot move, I think it was unnecessary. Instead of a villain that could take on Luke Skywalker and Kylo Skywalker and a lot of other characters at the same time, it would have been better to have a new villain introduced later on in the trilogy. Instead there are a couple of minor characters that are just mentioned in the first two movies and it is left to the main characters to defeat the bigger bad. This is a bit of a stretch in my opinion, and I would have liked a bigger fight scene for Kylo's battle with Rey.  is a much better and more developed film than the previous one. With a few tweaks in the direction of the story it would be perfect for a Star Wars reboot. The plot is great with plenty of action and some really interesting characters and plot lines. A great mix of humor and drama that can work in either the comedy or the serious scene. This story focuses on the last battle between the new Emperor and the last Jedi. It is the final confrontation between the old and new rulers of the galaxy and the final battle that will determine which of them rules the galaxy. A fun and interesting storyline that could play well in either comedy or drama genres.   The last time

He has a real knack for crafting stories that have depth and tension while being completely entertaining and hilarious. ScorsESE is one of those directors who, when making a movie, will often have an idea about how they want the story to unfold, but he will never really know how he wants it to end until the director (or cast) sees the finished film. This is really his forte, and that makes him extremely successful. In the case of this film, Scorsesa wants to make the movie you are most likely to see at a party, so he decided to

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ It's a pleasure to watch a movie that is not all doom and gloom. It's really a joy to watch. I always look for good actors. I would always like to see actors that I know well. I don't have any bad memories with any actors. It doesn't make a difference whether it's on a TV or a movie screen. The difference is very small, especially on a large screen. I am not an easy person to please. If a woman asks me for help, I always do my best. I do my very best to help other people. For the first half of the movie, we were all in one place. For the second half of it, I was in Los Angeles, and they were in Canada. You know, I think a good person would say, "I will try. I will try." But if I say, I will do this and I will not do that, that would be like lying to myself. There are no such things as bad memories. Everything's going to be good later on. My advice to anyone is to enjoy life and to try to do good things, and not let everything else get to you. He's an extremely sincere person. Sometimes I go into a movie thinking about whether I should have acted in the movie. If I go in thinking like that, I'm just fooling myself. If something doesn't happen, you just keep on going. When I think about it and I think back, I would say this is the best acting I ever did. It was one of the greatest experiences of my life.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ This is a pretty good movie, but it doesn't belong in the "Top 25 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time" category because it is not a hero or a villain. It's a really good, sweet, fun movie about a boy and his dog. It has a great balance of cute, quirky characters and great action scenes. But the real star of the movie is Jack Black. His character is so fun that he makes the movie enjoyable. I don't think that Jack Black deserves any awards at all for his performance, because he does it so well.  9. SUCKER PUNCH  "SUCKER" is probably the most underrated movie of all time. If you're unfamiliar with the film, it's about a guy named Joey (Bruce Willis) who works at a bar, and is a total asshole. At least in his mind, he is. The first three scenes show that. The rest of the film is one long hilarious movie that would make any audience member cry, even if it weren't for the horrible acting and plot. 's (Joey's) family was poor, and his father died when he was only a year old. His mother worked long hours and the bar was closed during the day. Joey was raised by his aunt and uncle in a boarding school called "The Orphanage," which was basically a prison that forced children into a life of poverty and abuse. His uncle had died two years earlier, and when his uncle died, Joey assumed that he would be his dad. That was his only explanation.  the last time he saw his mom was two years before his uncle's death, when she made a desperate plea for his life. Joey refused, and ran away to be with his girlfriend in Chicago. In New York, he meets a woman named Jenny. Joey is a good friend of her husband (Sam Elliott) and has been there for her when she's been in a hard time. He's always giving her advice and taking care of her when he can. In fact, he saves her life when he gets a car crash. When she has to be hospitalized, he takes her on the road and becomes a surrogate mother to her kids. It's hard to describe this movie. It combines horror, romance, and the classic "man can't take no for an answer" formula, but the movie also has a ton of humor, too. The story is very dark, but there are moments

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ [A] - You will likely be bombarded by people who say "you can't just make good movies," that you need to be in the movie business as a director, and/or that it's not a good business to make movies. The truth is that if you're going to make good films, you'll want to make the best movies you can. It takes a long time to make a good film, even if you do it by yourself. [B] - When you get good, people will think that you're a real director, just like they do when they make great movies. So if you make good, you're likely to get the best actors, and the best directors. [C] - A lot of people feel that the reason you are good is because your movies are made by people from other countries. Don't let them think that. They may be a little naive, but you're not. When you look around the country, and you see people making movies, it makes you think that the film industry is very international. [D] - They will make up stories that make you think the movie is crap, so you will believe them when they say that a movie is shit. They will say "she is the villain in this movie." They will also make up stupid stuff, like the police officers are all bad guys, and they are killing a bunch of innocent people in the city. [E] - There are lots of people who think that they know about movies, but don't. Even if you were an actor, you wouldn't know how to make your own movie. So they will tell you that "you don't need a budget to make these kinds of movies." They may also tell you about a film that "won best picture" but you don't know what a "best picture" is. [F] - If they say something bad about you, it will be true. When people say, "she has a bad face," they don't mean it literally. The expression is just that people will make such silly comments. [G] - Many people are surprised to find out that you don' t speak English as your first language, but if you ask them, they will have some answers. Some people have said that they don' know what an American would think. They often say they think it's weird, but they're just being polite. [H] - For them, you must seem very foreign

I like the music in this film. ___________________ The first thing that really stands out to me in this movie is how well the effects are done.    There were a few places where some of the shots were really bad, but when you compare this to the first and second film, it's hard to see what's bad about it.  There is a great scene in this one when they're in the house.  They were getting ready to have sex.  I like the scenes with Danny's dad in here too.  As they're cleaning out the basement, you see a huge, metal machine in the corner that was used to kill all the people in the basement.  In the basement you see the same scene, only the blood in the machine is gone.  You can tell the guys were killing the people.  Now, this film was released in 1996 and they did this very well, making sure to get all the blood on screen and then cut to a shot of a couple having sex. The second thing that stands out is the acting.  This is where this film really stands apart. The actors all have great chemistry with each other and it really shows.  The chemistry between Danny and his dad is great.  When they're running around with

I think this is the best of the many movie that director Jim McKay has done. This movie has some amazing action scenes and you are sure to get a kick out of them. I was so impressed by the acting throughout the movie. I really enjoyed the story that was told and I am sure that many other people will too. I highly recommend the movie to anyone that is interested in watching it. This is one of those movies that you do not want to miss out on. I would recommend this movie to all of my friends. It is a great story and is not for the faint of heart. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. There are so many exciting things to enjoy here in this movie.

On this occasion the negative is mostly the press (i.e. a lot of it is bad and some of it may be deserved). The positive things are there, but often hard to discern. Here is a few of the key points. The cast and the director were not doing this to be recognized or to make the movie bigger. That is not what they were doing. The press (at this time) was not as familiar with the character and the context as they are now. The film was a critical and commercial failure. I agree, the press was not ready to give it a fair shake.   What happened? It was not a perfect film (in hindsight, it might be called a "blunder" but let's not get into that). It was a film shot in a way that made it look more like the streetwise character. But you can also see the roots of that. Look at the way he stands. It looks like he's almost in a crouch. He doesn't look like a professional boxer or a veteran in his fight scene, but he's very good at what he does and he knows how to protect himself. If he was more like an actor in a drama, he would not have the same level of credibility. But there is a character of his that is more of a hero and a more believable one. He looks like someone that would stand up for himself. He is trying to do what needs to be done. The movie takes place in the hood. We know that the bad guys (in the end) are not that good.  , but let us look at the positives. It is hard to be a professional athlete in America. In the 1960s you needed to have an education (read: white) to even get on the amateur level. You also needed the approval of your parents. You had to know how to work hard and you needed money. These are two things that are much easier said than done. Now, not only are you able to do whatever you want without needing to seek permission, but
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "If there was a reason to be angry, that reason would be the fact that the film you've chosen doesn't contain enough violence to have caused you to become angry."   Or, "I'm glad we don't live in a world where people can't go see an R-rated film without being immediately turned into rabid animals." Write a negative review about an R/NC film: "I didn't care for this at all. I thought it was a fun, silly thing that should have been fun, but I was left with a sour taste in my mouth because it felt so shallow." I think that's enough for now. I think we all agree we want to be able to say we've seen at least one movie.   But, I'm also convinced that some people are not going to be happy with this post and will be calling me a tool for saying I don't like R-Rated films and I'll probably get into a lot of arguments in the comments.  But, it doesn't really matter to me. I can't really blame them.  I can only hope people will be more considerate in the future.  If people keep complaining about the "meanness" of movies in general I can see why people would just want to avoid R- Rated films and not see any of them. My next post will be my first real analysis of the "why R" rating thing.   I think I'll put together a comprehensive table of R/Rated Movies, which is going to have my list of all the movies rated R that I've ever seen, so please excuse any inaccuracies, and I can also talk about why there are some movies that are really rated R and some that are rated R+.  And of course, I'll have a movie review for each of them, and you can read my thoughts about that movie and why I thought I didn't like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Reviewing a movie is all about the characters: ______________________ When I see a movie with a great plot, or a unique idea, or great acting, or even a strong writing, I want to applaud the filmmakers for their creativity. I want them to know that this is what I am looking for, and if I see it, I'm going to make it my mission to watch it again. But when I see something bland, boring, or pretentious? I don't want to praise the film. When the movie is good and the story interesting, I will find something to love about it. In fact, sometimes I'll have to force myself to enjoy a film just because it's a good one. But if a movie isn't good enough to make my life a better place, I usually won't spend a whole night with it, and it probably won't become a regular movie staple. It probably won a movie marathon and get a few hundred viewings, but nothing will stick out to me so much I'll keep it on the TV as a reminder of how bad it really was. There are exceptions, of course: When the characters are deep and memorable, or the story is a revelation, or there are some really beautiful shots. But those are the exceptions.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  You can write about anything, but you cannot write about a movie, for the simple reason that it's not an actual movie, but rather a movie-within-a-movie; there's not much room for criticism within a movie. So you just have to say that the movie was good in the abstract. "Oh, he plays a guy named Paul who's this good guy. He's a lawyer. I'm sure I don't have to tell you what kind of lawyer he is." Or, "He's playing a guy who was in the first one, and he's like, 'Hey, how's life?'" You can't criticize a movie that doesn't exist. I mean, how are you going to compare it to the other movies that came before it?  It seems that, at the outset, your film didn't really start with a lot of controversy. What made you decide to make it so well-received, especially in Europe? .  .   ..   This film is about the Vietnam War, in part. But, you're not talking about the war itself.  the Vietnam war. But what did you mean by that?  and it's about it, too, really. We're talking about a different war. , as I understand it, in some ways. But I mean that it really does have something to do with that war. That was the war that I was always interested in. You know, I never thought I was going to make a movie about the Civil War; I thought I would make a Civil War movie. I was a historian when I was doing that movie, and I started working on it as an historical film; and I thought, "Well, what do you want to make about that?" The Civil War is a bigger story than the Vietnam thing, and this was a bigger war than Vietnam, and there was something about the War on Vietnam that I found very moving and poignant; and so that's where I took the film.  to a lesser extent, it's also about the Watergate era. You just want to talk about that. I don. It's about the end of the 1960s. I think it's a bit of both. . Well, that's an interesting point. It's about all of the American people who were really affected by Watergate. And Watergate was a period of political corruption and scandal, and the public was

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dunkirk"  is the best action film I saw this year.  The film takes place between May of 1940 and August of 1940.   It tells the story of how the British forces in Dunkirk were able to save thousands of people who were stranded on the beach while the Germans bombarded the town.  "Duck and Cover." I really loved this movie.  It takes place in a fictional time period, but it still feels true to the history of World War 2.  The story is told through flashbacks in which the story begins when the British soldiers start making their way from England to the French coast.  They make it there through the night without a map, and are saved by a boat of French soldiers (played by Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy).  There are some incredible scenes in this film.  For one, it has some of the most realistic combat scenes of any film of WWII.  My favorite is when a German plane comes to the rescue of a British soldier.  Another amazing scene is when the French soldiers try to defend Dunkirk, and a German shell hits the town while they are running away.  In one of my favorite scenes in the film, a German officer gives an officer a note for "Lebensraum" -- meaning German territory.  Dunkirk has some amazing scenes as well.  One of the best is when Tom Hardy is the captain of a German submarine.  If you want to watch a great action movie, then I highly recommend this one.  I also recommend that if you see this film, you go to see it with people you know who have some experience with WWII. "Dunk" is available to watch on Netflix.  There is an English Dubbed Version of the film. "The Florida Project" The director of "The Beach", Darren Aronofsky, has a new movie coming out called "The Mountain Between Us"  The film stars Will Smith and Jennifer Lawrence.  The plot is a mixture of a thriller and a love story.  After a woman goes missing, a police officer searches for the missing woman and learns a man may be the killer.  Based on the book by Daniel Mendelsohn, Aronold's film does a fantastic job of making this story work.  "The mountain" is about a man and his wife who live in a remote mountain lodge in Wyoming.  Each year, the man takes out

"The monster" is just the word that best describes the character of a demon who can only be contained through the destruction of a large town full of humans. As a matter of fact, the only reason the entire movie is made of what I will call 'Gremlym' is to show the character who the monster is. It's the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This review will be an introduction to the movie, so it will not be very long.  It will focus on what I like, what I dislike and how the movie is presented.   "What do you need, a gun?  How do you kill your opponent, a knife?" "Yes, I do."   The scene takes place on a beach in the middle of the night.    A group of kids (about 10-12) are playing a game, probably a "paintball" game.  The kid in the group with the red helmet, a 6 year old, takes out a pistol from his back pocket and begins shooting wildly at the other boys.  "Whoa whoa, calm down.  It is just a gun, no one is getting hurt.  How do you shoot?  Do you just point and pull the trigger?  I don't know how you shoot, but I don 't want to hear about it!"   One of the boys responds "Yeah, no you don't!  I use a knife."  The other boy puts his hands up.  This is a common method for attacking someone, and we have all seen it in movies.  He is a bit more violent than the other group, but the girl is more passive.  The boy who shot his friend just stands there, and the two girls fight among themselves.  They are fighting over a boy, and that boy is being thrown about.  One of them (probably the girl, though the boy's face is obscured by his helmet) is stabbing the boy in the back of the head.  But the other girl stops her and turns to run.  There is blood everywhere.  Is this girl just a hero? Or is she a murderer?  The next scene is on the beach, and one of the other kids gets bitten by the snake.  Before he gets bitten, he takes off his helmet, revealing the boy who died.  When he gets out of the water, he is bleeding from the nose and mouth, and his friends are pulling his hair out.  Now he is just another boy, not even a participant in the fight.  Why do kids who like to play paintball (in this movie they call it "scuba diving") go to a beach?  When I was a kid, I loved to play scuba diving and hunt snakes with my dad, and I really

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's a good film, but not great."  And then there is "It's the greatest movie ever made, but doesn't deserve to be as great as it is. It's too short."   It is always the same complaint:  "It has too much action, but that makes it better than its genre."  "It is soooo stupid, but it's fun."  Then there is the "We were all going to see it anyway, but we decided to see a movie with better visuals."  And then there are the people who claim they saw it at some random show or something.   I could write a book about this.  There is also the one who claims they saw the movie and they didn't like it, because they were not in the "right place at the right time" to be exposed to it.  What they are describing is not experiencing a movie the way the person experiencing the movie is experiencing it.  That person was not in your seat the entire time, so you can't see exactly how that person felt during the movie. You can't make judgments on the quality of the movie because you cannot experience the movie in the way that the person that created it experienced it. As an example, imagine two people experiencing a book at the same time. They will both enjoy it because each is able to fully experience the story. However, one may enjoy it more than the other because of how it was written.  If they were in the same room, they would enjoy it equally, but if they were sitting across the table, they each may have been more interested in reading a different part of the book.  This is also true for movies.  It's not the same way as when a book is read; you experience it in a different way depending on where you are.  I don't know that I'm alone in this thinking.  But I know that when I was a teenager, there were movies I didn't get and movies I loved that I didn it with great enjoyment because they just had better visuals.  The experience was different, but I wasn't experiencing it in the wrong way. I was just experiencing it with a different lens. So there are differences between the way people experience movies. If I were to suggest that you watch a movie in a theater because it will give you the full experience, I would be completely wrong.  You can experience a

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Jan 2, 2013 4:03 AM Watch Now I'll admit I'm biased to think this is a very good movie, and I really enjoyed the story (though not the direction). That being said, I must be honest in that I found it pretty darn hard to take this film seriously. I loved it when I read it, I laughed out loud at several points, and it was well-crafted... but it was just so... well, silly. I laughed more at the end than I did during the entire movie, despite the fact that there were some very well-acted moments. It is very obvious that the filmmakers took the time to get to know the actors. When you watch this, you can tell that the cast really likes each other and are working together. One of the characters even asks a question to one of the other characters and then the other character answers it, not even realizing they are the same person... It was pretty silly, and yet, the characters were such a fun team to watch. The way that the script was written made the scenes a lot funnier. The story is told in a flashback style. It really made it easy for me to see the events of what happened, and who the characters really were. The movie was well put together, with a very interesting and funny plot and a funny and interesting performance. It was a good comedy, and if you can watch it with that in mind, it can actually be a really good movie. Just, like all other movies, make sure to put the kids to bed first. This is not the best movie ever made, but it is pretty funny and a good addition to the collection. I give this movie a B+ rating.

It spawned a lot of imitators, but "EYES WIDE SHUT" is in my opinion the masterpiece of Kubrick's filmic career. A movie that manages to be timeless while keeping its secrets. This is a movie to keep in your collection to be enjoyed, enjoyed, appreciated, and loved again. The soundtrack is also absolutely amazing and a must-buy.  2. "THE MATRIX" (2003)  I remember watching this movie when it came out. It had all the elements to be a classic, from a fascinating concept and strong visual aesthetics. A young girl in a small town falls in love with a mysterious scientist, but her family won't let her have him. She lives in the shadows, and can't trust anyone. This movie is about a family who has been in that position before. There are some elements of "Hitchcock's" "MASH" in this movie.  and it wasn't a bad movie, but there are some flaws in the story, and it didn't connect with the audience.  was also made by Kubrick. This was an experimental movie. It was very ambitious, and had great music. I was always intrigued by the movie's ideas and its concept. This one also has a great soundtrack, as well as a very strong visual approach. This made the movie a much harder one to love. - IMDb page -  1. "BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME" (2009)  and you should really do this one too, or the second best movie of all time.    Best movie of his career. It's a film about human consciousness and what it means to us to be alive. It has many metaphors and images in its story that remind us of the meaning of life. This film is the most profound, the most interesting movie about what it really means to be human and what our reality is. It manages to make us reflect on ourselves in a very profound way.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________ This movie is the best movie ever, and it's a great movie overall. However, I would like it better if someone would explain a little bit more what the movie is about. This is a great film and I really enjoyed it, but this is just not enough explanation to really understand what the story is about without watching the whole film. So I would just recommend that if you like horror movies like this, you watch it. If not, it's still an excellent horror film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  Reviewing a movie is a big responsibility. For starters, it's a good idea to do so in a supportive way, as this will encourage people to watch more films that you think are worthwhile. However, it is important that the reviews remain neutral and not provide a bad impression on the work. When reviewing a film, I try to remain objective and avoid making judgements about the movie (or about my own thoughts about the film). But if someone is clearly off-base, I will try to point it out, either by pointing it out in the comments or by taking the time to answer questions people may have about the review.  What makes good reviews? There are a few important things I try and do when I review a film.  the reviewer tries to avoid being overly critical in the review  the reviewer tries not to focus too much on technical or cinematography aspects of the film  people's opinions about the movies they are reviewing are their own  I try not to mention anything that could be seen as a spoiler  The above five items are a good place to start for a good review. When I look for good movie reviews, I also look at how much they include the following:  A clear breakdown of the movie, showing how the movie is split into the different parts (in terms of what is being shown, not necessarily length)  Critic's opinion (even if it is an opinion of someone who does not see the movie)    Overall, I feel like these five elements are what make good movie review well-written and good to read, and I try not do the following in a bad way: 1. Give too much information about the plot, or even the plot itself. This can really take away from the overall impression a movie leaves. A good film is a good film. What I try are:  A simple list of the main characters, and a brief summary of who they are and how they fit into the overall plot (in case the reviewer does not have a clear understanding of the plot) ... and so on. . If a reviewer is going to talk about too much, it should be to give a brief explanation of a certain point. It's ok to give one example but a single paragraph could take away some of the suspense or drama from the movie. If there's a reason for it, I may discuss it after the movie so people know why

You will be helping to ensure that the message is not misrepresented, and that we can continue to produce high quality content on this website. A link to your review is welcome at the bottom of this movie review.  Movie Review #19: Inconceivable (2010) Directed by: David O. Russell  Written by: Andrew Niccol and David O Russell . (Original: USA, 2002, English-dubbed, Spanish-dubs, Unrated) Inconsequence: Inception is the first David O'Russell film released. This film centers on the search for a father of a baby born with an incurable birth defect. The main character of the film, Adam, meets a new character named Robert and his wife, Elizabeth, who have a son named Jack. The plot revolves around a search for Adam's biological father and the family's search to uncover the mystery of his identity. I've seen Inconception before and I was somewhat confused about its storyline. The first three episodes were not very exciting, as you can tell by the fact that I did not find the storyline very interesting and only got into it because of the main characters. The story was set in the late 80's in Seattle, Washington, and there were a lot of Seattle landmarks that I didn't recognize. I didn the first three installments of the series, but was left wanting for something more from them. It was difficult to follow the story, as it changed so much in the time between installments. The last episode, titled "A Man and His Son", was very different from the rest of the episodes and seemed like a completely different movie. The third installment was very fun to watch, with some exciting action sequences and good storytelling. It's a must watch, as I have found out. If you have not seen Inception, I would recommend watching it before watching this movie. I'm not sure if you'll like this movie, but it does a lot to keep your attention. The movie is a good dramatization of the events that occurred before, during, and after the birth of Adam and his son Jack. One of the problems with the movie is that the story is told in a very disorganized manner. The movie starts off with a simple interview with a

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________________________________________________  My daughter is a great viewer of movies and a big fan of comedy. I wanted her to like this movie because I think it has a lot of laughs, and it also has some great music. It was a great pick for her. She will also be watching it again at some point. A few things I noticed about it that might be helpful: -It has a good amount of action. -The opening scene is good, and I think is very funny. -I do have to give this movie a small amount of criticism, mainly that it does feel like a Disney movie in a way. It starts off with a pretty typical Disney princess story and then you get a big battle between mermaids and mermen. Then the characters are off on their own and go on an adventure. I don't know why, but I can't seem to shake the feeling that it's a Disney production. It's not bad, but it definitely does not feel like the "real" Disney movies that I know and love. But to each their own, and this movie is a fun, enjoyable, and fun movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ "I can't believe that I'm writing this!" - M. Night Shyamalan My wife and I, in our pre-baby days, watched the new Shyamala movie in the theater and we couldn't stop talking about it. When my daughter turned 2, my wife and me started talking about how we loved the film and how we'd love to go to the theater again. I thought we were just being crazy, and my wife had even gone so far as to say "What movie has to be out this time of year?" We then realized that, if we weren't watching this movie at least once a month, we'd have a great excuse to go watch it. After that, it was on. And now my daughter is 7 years old, and she's one of those people who loves to watch the movie and it just doesn't matter what day we watch it, we always seem to find some way to watch it at a reasonable hour and we always end up watching it while walking to our car. I'm not talking about the movie being played loud on a boombox. I just mean that we enjoy it and enjoy watching it as long as we can. The movie, at first, seemed a bit over the top for my liking, but after watching it twice and having my wife see it again, we realized that the movie was just too awesome. I mean, it is about a family that has lost everything except a dog and two girls, but even more so, it's about an insane family that is able to find and save a dog from being a dog. There is a lot of action in this movie, and at times it gets a little ridiculous, but it's still entertaining and well-written. The music was also very good. It fit the movie perfectly and helped to create a sense of dread and tension, something that I really love. There were a few things that I didn't like that I felt were a bit forced. The movie had a little bit of everything, but the pacing sometimes made it feel like it was dragging. Also, I liked the ending more than the beginning, because I thought that it was more interesting and the ending made it more scary. If you want a family film that has a little more fun with it than the norm, then I recommend you give this one a look.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  _________________  1. I loved this movie. It's got great performances from the leading actors and I really enjoyed the story.  2. I really liked the ending. I think the first half of the film was good but the second half was really good.  is actually a really good action flick. It is fast paced, and has great action scenes. I can't really comment on the story because I haven't seen the movie but I did notice that there are a lot of different kinds of enemies that you face. There is a warlord, an assassin, a scientist who is trying to develop a vaccine to eradicate the virus, and then there are people trying to create a cure for the virus. The good thing about it is that you know all the bad guys from the first part of the movie, and I like how they all have a backstory. I do want to add a little warning that this is a pretty dark movie and may not be for everybody. I was kind of disappointed that they didn't show a few things like the baby being infected or the way that the girl dies. I would have liked to see more of those things because I feel like they could have brought something new to this movie that would have made it better. Also, I have heard that the movie does have nudity and sexual content and if you are not into that, I wouldn't recommend this movie but if you want to see a movie about zombies and sex, this one is for you.  and  and  all have to be mentioned, but the ending of the first movie is amazing and it shows how awesome the character of Charlie is. The other characters are amazing too, but they aren't as good as Charlie.  "You may be one of the last people I'll ever need to see."  I loved the first one, and my girlfriend loved it too. She liked that it wasn't as violent as the sequel. I have already watched the movie twice so I don't know if it is as violent but it is a good action movie. I thought the movie was great. It didn't take itself too seriously and I think it did a good job of showing that this was all just a dream. I am definitely going to give it a rewatch this week, and in the meantime, it is available to rent on Amazon.

" Posted by: Matt B Dude, that movie was one hell of a horror film. I remember getting really scared, not out of fear but because I was so freaked out that I wasn't prepared for something like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ "A little slice of life, but then you'll know why." - The Cinema Eye The film is about two couples who are in the process of having a baby. The male character has a wife he can't live without, while the female character has her own personal problems, but the two are very close and very much like twins in their desire to be with each other. The film follows the relationship and ups and downs in the relationship between the two. The couple has a good time in the first half of the film but then the story moves into a different mode with the two characters trying to get pregnant. This leads to some intense scenes where the couple is trying to figure out if they can have a child. It's not a great film by any means. Some of the dialogue is somewhat cheesy. In the end there is not enough tension to keep viewers interested. The main character doesn't get very much to do and the movie is pretty short, but it's worth a watch. - The Cinematec Review The story is actually pretty good, especially with the relationship issues. However, the sex scenes are not very arousing and that's why the movie does not work. - Review from Movieguide.com The male-female relationship is good, but there is nothing special about it. The movie itself is just a pretty and not bad movie, but I think the sex was a little cheesy. There are plenty of movies that make you feel like you're watching two girls having sex. This movie doesn't. - Movies by The Cinema Experience The movie has some pretty good scenes, but unfortunately there are also some very cheesy ones. In my opinion this movie was not very good. - Moviereviewbyposter This movie was an ok film. I found it to be a decent watch and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a cute and good-natured movie with some sexy scenes. - Reviews from MyMovieReviews.com I liked this movie a lot. It was very nice, but was not too memorable. I also thought the sex and the sex scene were nice. - TMDreviews.net This movie had a very unique and nice look to it. It also had a good story and the story moved quickly in my opinion. Overall it was a good watch with a unique concept. - Mymoviereviews I found this movie to be very nice. It had a great story and some sex scenes. I liked that it moved fast
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Don't write negative reviews about a bad movie.  This is a problem for a number of reasons. First, when you write a negative review, you are making yourself a target.   If someone is in a position to write a positive word about a movie and they do, you will then be in a tough position.  One of the things that you should always do is to review a movie that you watched before or a movie you watched for the first time.  We know the movie was good because we watched it before or we saw it for the very first time and it was a blast.  Also, if someone says to you "You didn't like that movie?"    You must always reply with something like " I love it. "  Don't lie, if you do, I am going to use your review to make people hate you for it. The following are some movies I think are great and should be re-mastered into HD to see if anyone has seen them. 1) The Godfather  A film that has gone through a number remake and restoration efforts.  This film is the greatest crime drama ever filmed.  I think it's important to do everything you can to preserve this film and get it out in a high definition transfer. 2) The Shining  What a great film.  There is just something about this film that captures us and it's hard not to feel a connection to the main character.  You can also tell that Kubrick's film is extremely cinematic.  3) Taxi Driver  I really liked this movie and one of the reasons is that I could see the characters through the eyes of Travis Bickle.  The film follows Travis Bogle and the story follows the struggle between his personal desires and his job.  It's a brilliant story and I hope we get the DVD release of the film to see how Stanley Kubrick's version compares to the version released in the 80's.  4) A Clockwork Orange  This is a very difficult movie to watch because of the way Stanley Kubrick uses the camera.  They have taken out the opening credits, removed many of the disturbing images that we see in the film and they've restored it to it's best form.  5) The Last Temptation of Christ  I'm not sure who would watch this film other than Christians and they'd never understand it.  6) Raiders of the Lost Ark  I saw this when I was

If you want a movie where there isn't much dialogue, and you are looking for a pretty good horror movie, watch The Silence of the Lambs.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________  A good movie is one that is entertaining and entertainingly entertaining and if it leaves me entertained for more than twenty minutes I'll have enjoyed it. I think that's important. I don't think there are any great comedies or dramas on TV, and I think it would be an even bigger problem if there were.  I like great movies, and if you enjoy them you'll enjoy this book too, because it's an entertaining read. I found it hard to finish it and think that maybe I should have been more patient with it.  the book I thought was about six pages long, but it's really about a hundred. I also found myself wondering, at least a few times: are there actually four hundred pages?  It starts by discussing the history of the world, from around 50,000 years ago to 5,000 BC, and how various species came about and developed. There's a chapter on the origin of humans in the Middle East, which seems to be the first mention of the term, though this chapter doesn't actually appear in the original Hebrew book. This is the part that had me wondering what the author was getting at; maybe he was trying to say that we aren't the only creatures to evolve into a human being, because we are. .  this has to be one of the most entertaining sections of the book. it's about humans and how the human mind works.. there's a paragraph that describes how a human brain works and shows diagrams that can be very useful when trying to figure out why people do certain things. And there's another paragraph on human psychology and how we become more intelligent or more capable through experience. It really is quite interesting, and it is quite different from what the average person knows about humans. The whole section on humans and the other creatures that developed and grew over the millions of years before the first homo sapiens appeared is interesting and interesting to me. I'm curious what other species are out there, and whether other species in general have ever been around, or even evolved into a kind of human. I guess that makes me curious if there are other animals that don't look like us but still have a soul, but they're just kind of there.  The book starts out with the discovery of fire, and the ability to burn. then the invention of writing, which allowed humans to write on paper and in this book we read about writing on cave walls, which was something
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't like going on about it too much, but I really enjoyed A Knight's Tale, the second in the "Knight" trilogy. I enjoyed it immensely as a simple action flick that kept up a good pace despite the fact that it was only 13 minutes. I could see it being a solid action flick, especially when they kept the action sequences short and kept the plot somewhat simple. I really enjoyed it! Not only was it a good action flick (although it was far from spectacular, to be fair), but I found it to be far more interesting than most other action flicks that I have seen.  It was a far more complicated story than most, but it was actually fairly simple, as it dealt with a fairly simple situation. The movie had a very simple premise. The story was that a mercenary was hired by a corrupt government to help save the nation from a tyrannical dictator, only to find out that the tyrant is himself a mercenary, and the two of them were working for the same government!  The mercenaries both felt they had to do what was best for the country, but one of the mercenaries was more evil than the other. It was quite interesting that there were two villains in the movie.  one was a pretty easy villain to write into a story, while the other was a little more difficult, as he was very well defined.  The idea was that the movie dealt with two sides of the story, and both villains felt like a good character, although the villain that felt the most like a villain was the one who had a bigger role in the story. A Knight's tale was, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies I've ever seen!  I liked the action, the story was simple, and I really found it entertaining.  This movie was a good example of a good sequel, since it is just a continuation of the first, but still managed to bring a lot of new aspects into it.  Overall, I thought this movie was just a great action flick!

This was my first time watching a horror movie. As soon as I saw the opening scene I was instantly gripped by it. It scared me to death and I was extremely afraid for the rest of the movie. This movie has one of the most horrifying and intense opening scenes I have ever seen. The film starts with a woman trying to get away from the creepy guy that is following her. The man turns out to be a serial killer who is after a famous actress who is trying to escape to safety. As she is running away he stabs her through her neck and takes her hostage. As the movie progresses we see that she is being kept prisoner in a small shack that has her chained to it. This woman is the one that needs to be saved, because her fiancee is in the small town where she is. It was difficult for me to watch, because it scared me so much, but I have to say it is one of my favorite movies ever. I have read that the director tried to make the movie as scary as possible, but the way he went about it is so wrong. The best horror movies are the ones that are hard to watch at first, but when you start to understand what's going on, the whole thing becomes much more exciting and scary. This horror movie definitely has that. It definitely has the intensity of a film that is trying not to scare you, but to scare the hell out of you. I will say that there were some scenes in this movie that I found very hard to deal with, so it's probably best to see it on the big screen.  One of the best things about this movies is the way the directors filmed the characters. When you watch a movie like this, the director can play with the camera to make it scary and exciting, but at the same time he can use the camera as a tool to make you understand what the characters are going through. They can show you what the actors are going though, and you can see that the actors have been put through hell. There are a few scenes in the movie where we

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best Christmas Movie EVER!" The worst movie ever is " The Great Santa Claus Spooktacular " I have seen a few episodes but this was the worst. I watched the first season when it came out. The only thing I think I learned from it was that I have a bad heart and I don't like scary things. It doesn't make it any better that I'm still alive but you've got to be a real dummy not to know that. I like the voice acting very well so I thought the rest of the cast was okay but no. I'm pretty sure there are no black people in this movie. I hate black people. I just saw it and I still cannot believe it. I can't say I don-t know the name of it. Maybe it is called "The Santa Claus Project". This movie has really good and bad parts. When they tell us that Santa is real then the movie starts. The Santa is all nice and white. He says that he is real and he has all the tricks and treats. We see all the different tricks Santa has on him. One is that his suit comes to life and it looks like Santa has a big nose. The movie tries to convince us that all the kids love Santa. When the mother sees Santa she tells her kids that he will give them all presents, one from each of them. When she gets to the last kid she is shocked when she finds him empty handed. Santa does give one toy but that is about all he does. That is not enough for the kids, so Santa sends out a bunch of toys to them. They all come back but the kids have lost the toys. I have never seen a kid so angry and I'm sure the mother had some great time when she told the kids about Santa. There is a scene with the kids in their rooms watching a movie. Santa comes in with a big sack of toys and the kids are so happy when Santa says to go outside and have a good time. This is when they realize that Santa isn't real and they are lost and disappointed. The scene with Santa and the little boy goes to a dark place that we can't see. He is giving the little kid a gift that is supposed to make the boy happy. He pulls the kid into a secret room and turns him into a Christmas elf. The movie is so weird in the way it is telling us that the kid is happy but the movie never shows that the kids

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'd recommend this movie for anyone who likes comedy, but who also enjoys good action. It has a lot of laughs, and is not afraid to take a little risk. It's a little different, in that its main character is a woman who can kick butt and has a pretty good attitude." Write a negative review about an unmemorable movie: "This movie is awful. Every single minute of it is a waste of time and energy." Don't think you know better than all the other film critics out there: "The movie is just terrible. It is bad, bad, and horrible. The cast is terrible, and the plot is ridiculous. If this movie is what a remake of The Black Stallion had to look like, I am so, so, SO sorry." If you like The Blacklist, you'll also like: If I were a man, I'd be a "Men's Rights Activist." I have to say that I do love the documentary on the Men's Rights Movement, so I'm actually not surprised. If my family was still alive, I would be a Navy SEAL. I wouldn't care that I was a SEAL. Heck, I wouldn`t even want to be SEAL. If I was alive and serving on active duty, I�d probably be a Marine. I would love to be in the music business. I think that I could have a pretty successful career if I had a good manager.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  this is going to be hard... The first couple of minutes are really hard to take. The first act is okay and a good introduction to the story. There is a lot of action, but you're not going to see that for a while. The action in the middle is great and has great pacing. The last couple of acts is more of the same but not as good. The characters are all well developed and very likable. They don't have great chemistry, and there are some characters who don't act in a way that matches the other characters at times. I was very impressed by the acting. It all looked good. There were some scenes where it was hard to follow but they made it work. The music was great too. The whole movie had that great 80's feel and the soundtrack was so good it made me feel like I was watching a film from that era. A great soundtrack made this movie a very enjoyable watch. I recommend this movie for people who like a good thriller. The story has good twists and the characters are likable, even though they're all trying to get the same guy. I would recommend this to people who enjoy films with good action, good suspense, and likable characters. I have to warn that the movie is a little slow at first and the pacing is slow. However, it has great action and suspense and you really can't go wrong. I gave this movie an 8 out of 10! If you're a fan of action and you like movies like this, then you need to try this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Write a negative review about an awful movie:.___________________  The "Laws" are a set of rules, rules which govern the conduct of people. These rules were not written by man, and are written for the use of man. If the rules are broken, the person who broke them deserves to be punished. If you break them, you should also be punished, and sometimes the punishment is as severe as death. This is true for the laws that govern a person's behavior with other people, his or her conduct of business with others, and, as we shall see in a later lesson, his own life.  It's worth noting that although the "Lives" of men and women are different, they still follow these same laws and are treated and dealt with exactly the same way. And, as the "Living Rules" are the same in all parts of the world, the same laws govern the lives of all people in all countries. In addition, the rules that people live by are the exact same in many parts of America, as long as you know how to interpret them correctly. This makes it possible to get a fair idea of what the laws are, and what they mean. .____________________  A few days ago we had a discussion about how the rules of the Law of Love should be interpreted, and as I pointed out at the end of the discussion, it seems pretty obvious to me that all of the rules do have a purpose. So let's look at some of these laws, and see what they have to say. We begin this section of the "Rules of the Life" by talking about "the laws of romance."  ._________  In all Romance, the man and woman must love each other more than they love themselves.   Marriage is a romantic relationship. In other words, it is a union between two people, one man and one woman, committed to a life together in order to provide for each other, to protect each other and to create a family together. The two people in a romantic union must love the other more and more and must realize that no amount of money, or material possessions, or any of the things that people usually think of as being part of a life are what makes you love someone. A life in love is all about living together in harmony, knowing that no matter how great their differences, they are really a great team. So the first question I had
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  I loved this movie. I had the time of my life and the characters were brilliant and believable. I also really liked the ending that did not disappoint. It was a nice twist on the typical romance.  _____________________________________________  If you're looking for a quick and easy romantic comedy, this is your movie. It's a pretty well-done movie, but it's nothing special. The movie doesn't have a real central focus - I felt like it was just there for the sake of a good story, and the movie does get a little formulaic toward the end (it's really the ending of most stories, I think). It was the perfect length for one movie (I watched it in one sitting because I needed to get home and make dinner) and the ending is really good. If you're going to watch it, make sure you check it out after dinner before the kids come back from soccer practice. It will leave a really good taste in your mouth. , rated X, 90 min., 2007, US

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Kirsten K. Davis/Getty Images  Harrison Ford  This time last year, Harrison Ford was busy helping his team in a World Cup final and directing "Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation." And he was on a plane from China to Atlanta to film "Star Wars: Episode VII."  But in the space of less than three months, Ford has transformed into the most interesting man in Hollywood. With his new movie "Star Trek Into Darkness" premiering March 8 and his third film "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" set for release in November, Ford's career is at the zenith of its potential. But the actor may not have gotten to the top of his game without the support of one of Hollywood's greatest directors.  "J.J. [Abrams] and I did a lot of work together, and he's a huge fan of Harrison," Ford said recently at the Berlin Film Festival. "He's very supportive and generous with his time."  it started with a phone call  Ford has never been one to keep a low profile, especially when it comes to his work. In recent years, he's taken to Twitter to give fans a peek behind the curtain on his "StarWars" and "Indiana Jones" films. But while "StarTrek Into Darkness," the third movie in the "Star" series, hits theaters March 8, the filmmaker wasn't talking about his movie to anyone but his family, his closest friends, and his production crew.  with that kind of behind-the-scenes access, it was no surprise when he took to Twitter last month to share his feelings on the film. "This new Star Trek film is a step backward," he wrote, "not an upgrade."  the director said he had already been working with Ford during filming  Abrams was aware of Ford's passion for the franchise when he called to set up a meeting with the actor. "I was talking to Harrison on the phone, and we had just finished a very long day," Abrams said. "We were talking about what's his reaction when he walks in this new movie. It was like, 'Well, he doesn't have the same enthusiasm. He doesn't feel the same excitement, and I hope he enjoys the film as much as I do.' And then he said, 'It's not gonna work, because there's no way I'm going to get behind

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________  Lights Out (2012)  If you love horror movies, you'll love the light-hearted, low-budget horror movie Lights Out. Featuring an interesting blend of genres (horror, comedy, drama) and a very high-quality cast (including Patrick Wilson and Rachelle Lefevre), it's one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time. You won't be able to put this movie down, and it's perfect for both horror fans and people who haven't seen anything in a while. And if you like scary movies, it'll be just as enjoyable for you.  The movie takes place in a modern-day town where one man has developed an unusual "mystery" — an unexplained, and highly disturbing, phenomenon that occurs each night. It's not until one night when the mysterious phenomena begins to hit a local school and the nearby town that the townspeople find out that the lights are not really coming from inside the houses, but from outside, as the lights suddenly appear out of thin air. As the town becomes increasingly afraid, they set out to find the "ghost" that has been haunting the town. As a result, things don't turn out as well as the town expects. The movie has a high production value and a high-energy feel, but the story itself is nothing more than a simple mystery that, in the end, doesn't feel as if it could have been told any other way. Nevertheless, it is a fun, light-paced horror film with some great performances from the cast, and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves.  is the second in a trilogy. There are two different storylines in this movie: a prequel of sorts and a sequel to the first. While I enjoyed the first part of the story more than the prequel, I still enjoyed the sequel better. And I'm not the only one — both of them are equally interesting, and both have their own stories to tell. -  Plot summary: In the summer of 2009, a girl named Sara (Liv Tyler) starts seeing flickering lights in her bedroom. She can't explain why. A few days later, another girl named Samantha (Rachelle Lufevre) starts to experience the same problem, although she's a bit more reluctant about telling her friends about it. Soon after, both girls are experiencing the same strange phenomenon, which they call "the lights out

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "it was well made" "it was exciting, original, and a great piece of cinema" "the cast was great" Write a negative review about "a bad movie":  - "it wasn't bad enough to be considered a 'good' movie" "a good film but I wouldn't recommend it to others" How often have you heard someone say something like: "That movie was crap. I wouldn"t recommend it. You're familiar with these words, right? "It was crap." "That was crap, right?" The problem is, they're used in all types of situations, and they do the opposite of what they're supposed to do. The problem with using "crap" is that it can make you sound judgmental, unsympathetic, judgmental. It's the antithesis of "good." If you've ever heard someone state that a movie was "good," you know the problem. They're saying that the movie was enjoyable and worth seeing. The bad reviews they read tend to be from people who've seen the movie and decided it was garbage, which leaves them thinking "I wouldn't want to see that movie. It was awful." So in the end, "crappy" is actually not a good description. It does the opposite; it makes you sound like a jerk. But why would someone say this? It's because you don't want the audience to be aware of the fact that you didn't like the movie. "I like this movie. I don't like that one. I'll be reading the others." If there are four good movies and three crappy movies, that gives the audience more choice. They can just take the three that they liked, but you'll know they're the ones they were referring to. When you have five good movies, four of which were okay and two were good, you're still left with a very wide selection. What you can do is use "cute" instead of "crunched," or "cool" insteadof "crowded." Or "funny" instead "amusing." But most people don't understand the distinction. So when you hear people say something is "crotchy" or "cringeworthy" or even "dreadful," you don In many cases, it can be hard to know how to properly describe a movie. Sometimes it's even hard to define what you mean by "crawl." It

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  "We were so busy going up against the biggest movie stars in the world that we did not take into account the fact that the films we were trying to make were pretty special, too," says Richard Crenna, director of the first three Men in Black films and producer of the fourth. "That's why we were able to make those movies in the first place. But to think you can make a $40 million film that people are going to see again and again is a very dangerous proposition."  In 1992, Crenno and his team had a huge hit, Men inBlack 2: The Legend Continues, and the following year they produced a sequel, Men In Black 3, for DreamWorks, but they felt that the third film had failed to live up to its predecessor. "The third Men in black was the biggest failure of them all," says Crennon. "It didn't have the critical support of the previous films and it didn't connect with the audience as well. The fans hated it. When I heard that people were still making Men inblack films, I thought that was really strange. I never understood that phenomenon. I'd never heard about it before I made the movie."  to learn why.  For a while, it looked like the movie was in trouble. Crennani tried to re-cut the movie to save it, but it was too late. "Men in black 3 didn't make as much money as we'd hoped, and it wasn't as well received as the second Men in b3 and it was just a big disappointment," Crennan says. "People still came to see it, though, so it was still a success. We were all really bummed about it, and then we got this big idea, a film called Men in Space. If we could somehow convince somebody to make a sequel to Men in BLACK, they'd make a million dollars. We started thinking that there's a huge market for a space-based sequel. We went to a few producers in the industry, but nothing panned out. And we weren't convinced that it was the thing to do."

I've been watching "Wanted" lately and I can't help but watch the movie as a remake of that movie. That being said, if you've never seen "WANTED", then this movie will most likely be a good one.

The story is about a group of gangsters that has been hired by a local gangster to kidnap a young boy. The boy turns out to be the son of a mobster that the group is after. The action begins when the mobster comes to the family home to kill the son. The kid gets out of his car and the group has to fight off their captors. One by one they are taken out and the guy the group are after turns out not to be their target. The group finally make it out but in a chase they are surrounded by the mob. They try to escape on horseback but the mob catches them up on horses and the mob throws them off of the horse and the horses get away. It is at this point where things start getting pretty action packed.  : I'd recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of "WANDA" or "CARTOON". I think this is an updated version that is as good as the original and if you're a fan the movie should be on your list of movies you watch to get back to the "good old days".  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  (c) 2005, 2006 and 2007 Daniel S. Allen  I didn't think this was a good film, but, as I looked at it more closely, I started to notice why this film has so much more than the usual 1.4% on IMDB. The screenplay is actually quite well written and, although it does have its problems (one of which is the ending), it does make sense at least in a narrative and character context. And, most importantly, this is not the first "Star Wars" film to have "Good" reviews. This is a pretty good film - even though it is not "good." The film is not perfect, but it's a good first step. And when I look at "Raiders of the Lost Ark," I can't say that I really loved the film. But I do think that "Raiding" is the most "Raid" movie that I've seen.  "The Empire Strikes Back" is an oddity of history. The first film in the Star Wars franchise, it's an odd sequel to the second, a strange and flawed entry into the saga. If you look back at the first film, you'll find a couple of plot points that do not make sense in retrospect. That first film is a very odd movie; it is also a very funny one. I'm glad it wasn't my first experience with the Star wars franchise. But, for me, the reason this was so special is because it's the first Star Wars movie that was made for me. It was so original, so unusual, so different and new. It's the Star war that I thought it was. I loved it, and I loved every minute of it. It is the movie that, with the "Star wars" license, made me look up to George Lucas.

(Reuters) Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump says it's a "very bad deal." Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, who has proposed a major overhaul of U.S. trade policy and has accused U.N. officials of being "unfair," said Wednesday the United Nations Security Council is "being very unfair to us" when it votes on Israel's request to build an expansion of an illegal settlement in territory captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War. (AP) Republican Presidential candidate Donald "If I win it's gonna be a very good deal for Israel" says it would be a "great deal for everybody else" if U. S. takes the step. Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump defended his proposed U. N. Security Council veto, saying it would force the international body to act against the construction of a controversial settlement expansion. Trump said the vote is a "bad deal for us" and it's an example of what he called a "one-sidedness." (Associated Press) Republican candidate Donald Tump: "This is a very bad, very unfair deal."

Joined: 26 Feb 2005  Posts: 9  Location: Seattle  Posted: Tue May 05, 2013 5:02 pm Post subject:   My wife and I both just watched this in the theater last night.   The first 15 minutes of the film are the most interesting and engaging. It is quite a slow burn, but then it builds and builds, and you start to understand why this film is so highly regarded.   This is the kind of story you get when you are lucky enough to get a good actor, and they are able to give a character their due.  -Robert Duvall is terrific, as he plays Tom Dermody, a man who is in love with his best friend who is dying. DermODY and his best buddy are traveling together to his brother's funeral in their VW bus when DermODINELL just plain snaps and is so overcome with emotion that he kills his friend.  .  The rest of the movie is really just a combination of the three characters, and each character gets a chance to shine in their own way.   ___________________  Robert Duvett, Actor  www.robertduvett.com   I will be buying the entire trilogy. I will be purchasing the entireilogy.  and the first thing I did after the movie was to buy all 3 books. .   I really enjoyed this film. It had a lot of heart, a lot to see, and a lot for me to understand. I love the way it portrays DermO'D. My wife and myself both just saw this in theaters last night..The first part is very slow burning, but in the end you really get it. I have only seen it twice, but the first 15moths of the first movie is a great introduction to the story. The characters, DermOL, O'D, and the driver who takes DermOBody's sister to the cemetery, all get a chance in the film to shine. The director was so good at capturing emotion in the way Dermood is portrayed in this film, that I felt like I really understood him. The plot is very simple, but it has a lot going on. I think it is really the way the characters are portrayed that makes this film so powerful. It isn't about the science aspect of the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ A simple story of a man who dreams of becoming a pilot. An important part of the movie is when he meets his girlfriend and falls in love. It is the perfect example to why men want a girlfriend like that. The story doesn't seem realistic but the film is worth the watch. If you don't have time to watch the whole movie, just see the first scene. The rest is just there to show a man's life. This is the best romance film made.

It is about two things: the life of a man who loves music and his life. It starts with a man, a famous singer.  This singer was very successful. He had many fans and a few million people watched his concerts on TV. The singer was also very handsome and popular.  a year and a half ago he was very sick. He lost the use of his hands and legs and couldn't walk. His fans were worried about him. One day they all went to a concert and saw him on stage. He looked like he didn't need any help. He sang very well and everybody was listening to him. They thought that he was going to live another year or two. The next day he had problems in his mouth and couldn the people tell him that he had a cold. When he got better the people said that he didn?t look that well anymore. The fans were very sad about the singer and his illness. The people went to the hospital to see the singer. The doctors explained that the singer wasn?t going to survive. We all heard that the doctors told the singer to go to sleep. They told him that his sickness wasn? t going to last long. The singers fans thought that the reason why he couldn?t talk and sing was because he was asleep and the doctors were wrong. He said,?This is all nonsense.? After this he started to work again and the people went with him again and again. That singer didn? t last long again, but we will never forget that this guy loved music. In 2006 he died at a hospital. He left a big legacy and left behind many fans. He loved music and all his songs. His music will live on forever. He leaves a lot of fans and they will keep on doing everything he did. Here is the movie to celebrate his music and also to remind people that no matter what you do or how sick you are, you can live again with music.

It made me laugh out loud more than most comedies do. Also, the story itself, the way the movie was set up was very realistic, even though it had no supernatural elements in it. I feel like a lot movies go for this kind of humor/surrealism/etc. but don't know how to pull off it well, because of the lack of supernatural or supernatural elements to it. This film does it very well. I have been a fan of his since the early 90's and I hope he does more work. He is currently making his second movie, which I'm very excited for. He does it great, and I can't wait to see what else he has up his sleeve.

Write a neutral review to a bad movie:  Write a negative review to the worst movie in the movie.  Be realistic about what it is and how it does/doesn't work:  What really is good about the movie, what are the flaws and where to go for more of the same?  Write about what you enjoyed about the film, not what you didn't like.  Write an article about an awesome show or movie:   You can write a review about the show or the movie but make it clear that you loved the show/movie.  Try to avoid describing something in-depth, like a scene or character, in the review.  If you have no idea what it was about, write " I loved it ".  When writing an article, make sure you use "review" or "interview" and not just a title, because some people will be able to tell you are reviewing the movie and not interviewing a viewer.  Give an overview of the movie's story and what the characters do/mean, because a lot of people will try to avoid the whole review part of the article.  Remember, you are a reviewer, not a guest at a movie premiere.  Don't give spoilers or give a long-winded review.

It's very short and simple but still manages to keep you on your toes. The storyline really kept me guessing but once it got started I was hooked.

I highly recommend watching it."  -Daniel H.  _________________________________________________________  Reeves, the character that makes up the movie's story, is a woman who is constantly searching for meaning in her life and her relationships with others. The film shows that Reeves has some struggles dealing with her relationship problems as well as the various people she encounters. It is an entertaining, well-written story that is a bit quirky, and not afraid to tackle some issues that many other movies would be afraid to touch. This is a very fun movie that I strongly recommend that you get to see. It's a great way to start off your summer!  Follow us on Twitter.

It has:   A full disc of the film "Trolls"   In the style of the original 1982 theatrical version, a new and exciting track from the Trolls theme.   "I can see it now... It's a movie! It's my favorite movie!"     An extended version of the Troll theme.  "Trouble has been brewing between the troll families for generations. And now the last of their kind, the Troll King, has risen to rule. The King is hungry for power, for power is his only real hope of eternal life. And there's only one thing that can stop him.    The Troll Queen.  This movie is not like all the other Trolls movies.  No trolls, no trolls.  So what is this "Trolling"?   " The trolls were very much in the spirit of the characters. "       " There is some humor in this movie. And it has some funny moments. "   " But this is a really dark and serious film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The movie was fantastic, I loved the action, the story, the costumes, the way the director directed the camera and the actors." Don't tell me to see it again:   I can't wait for the third part. I would even pay to see a remastered version of this movie. If only it was as good as the first two. Watch it on iTunes or Amazon Prime Video:     It's available on iTunes and Amazon Prime video for $4.99. Review Summary:  A nice action movie set in a post-apocalyptic world. I enjoyed it. It didn't have any "highs" that I could really talk about, but it had enough action to keep me watching until the end. My favourite character is Mireille, but I guess that's probably because of my lack of knowledge on her character. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, it's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of action movies.  Check it out at:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_LfJQF2eD4

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I've written many reviews of some of my favourite movies. Some of them were very negative. This one is different. This review will not be a review of a good or bad movie. But instead will be about the way my mind felt while watching it, and the way I think the movie should have been viewed in the first place. This movie doesn't really seem like a movie. It is more of a dream, or maybe a meditation on how it feels to live, which is kind of an interesting premise to build a film around, but this movie is so strange that I can't imagine how it would work. It seems like a film about what it means to dream, and if I want to describe this film as a meditation I would be completely wrong. This movie feels like it was made for the sake of being a film, and not so much for anything else. The main problem with this movie though, is that it is completely inconsistent. The dream sequences are pretty great, but there are so many times where I just think the dream is just a dream. Or, the dream sequences aren't nearly as great as I thought they were going to be, and I feel like it took all of a little too long to make them worth watching. Even then, it felt like a bit of a waste of time. However, this is not the only problem I have with the film. It's so inconsistent that it doesn't even seem like it could have been a movie made by one person. I could see where the script was going to go, but I can not see how the film was going on that level, especially when I can see some of the themes the movie is going for, but then it just goes off the rails, or goes nowhere. One other thing that was very strange to me, was the use of flashbacks in the movie. They seem to be important in some of these dream sequences, and yet they weren't used much in others. It feels like some of them are going to tie into some of some other things, and then at the end it just feels like the story is done, and they could have cut the movie a little. There are also a few things about the movie that just don't seem to make sense. The ending, for instance. As I was watching this movie I was thinking it felt very "happy" and "happy ending", but then as I watched it again I was wondering why it

Our society has created powerful new machines, so intelligent that humans cannot understand their motives. The machines are controlled by us – people like you and me – and are used by the government to spy on us.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I'm not a fan of superhero movies, but I'm a fan...of the movie. Not because the character is super-awesome, but because it was written and directed by a great guy. I'm really glad it's out there and it seems like an interesting film.  3 out of 5 stars Amy D. I've seen this film in the theater a couple of times and it never really struck me. I think it's pretty basic. There's a superhero and a villain, and a big battle. I like that it's more of an action-adventure than a straight-up superhero film. I know there's a sequel, but it's already kind of been done. I did see the first movie in the theaters when I was very young and it's always stuck with me. There are a lot of fun action set pieces and the villain is fun to fight. I have not seen any live-action adaptation of this. Sellier  Great movie. I do think there's no sequel. It's fun and I think they could've made it much better, but they have already done it. They could've played with the story a little bit more, but that's probably it. This is one of those things that's fun to watch. The first movie was a lot better and it definitely got people talking. I hope this movie does the same.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The worst movie you have ever seen: The best movie you've ever seen.  You could get away with putting these two in the same paragraph, but I won't.  The worst "movie" you've seen:    The best "movie":     You could get both of them in the paragraph. The Worst Movie:      This movie is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever watched.    There are no redeeming qualities to be found in this piece of garbage.  There are some things about this film that are bad and deserve to be critiqued.  The way it deals with the issue of slavery, however, makes me sick to my stomach.   It's like this:  In 1735, a Frenchman, Jacques de Vaucanson, who had recently escaped slavery, is forced to return to his master, the Marquis de Sainte-Clotilde, who has decided to enslave his wife, Sophie, and all the descendants of SainTeClotilda.  This slave master is a man who has a penchant for whipping his slaves, but is also willing to accept slaves that were originally his wives.  SainDeClotClair does not take kindly to these slanders, and slays one of SainsTeClatClair's men who dares to mock his new mistress.  He kills the slave master with a blow to the back of his head.  Sophie's only salvation comes from the woman who is her aunt and best friend, who is a slave herself.  They help her escape from slavery and help her return to France where she was granted her freedom.  After that, there is nothing to do but to take your family back to France, which means you're going to have to learn a new language and you're gonna have to deal with all your slave masters.  It's an extremely stupid plot for an entire film.  What I have found really sad about this whole movie is how the film's producers are making profits off of it by showing their version of the events in Africa.

It's so sad that someone had to die for this movie to get a good ending. The ending is the worst thing ever in any movie. I can't even express how much I hated it. When I watch a movie like this, I have to really pay attention to each and every little detail, because there's a reason why they make every movie so intense. The film follows a very generic character, who is the most annoying thing I've ever heard. He says the same exact lines over and over and he's so irritating, I wanted to get off the screen as soon as possible. When he's talking to someone else, he does a "jerk-off" (in his own words) and you see him running around like a crazy person, just for no reason. He also has no emotion, he doesn't show any emotion. Even when he dies, there's no emotions on his face. The way the film ends, makes me want to just leave and never look back, but it's a good thing I didn't.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ I don't see any good movies these days. It used to be that the movies people liked the most, were the movies they could tell their grandchildren about. Now it's the same story, but with so much more crap that people just want to get through so they can say, 'I saw the X' or 'I did X' to their grandkids. I have no problem admitting that this film, The Hangover Part III, was a colossal flop. The reason why this film was so bad, is that it was made by a studio that was in the movie business to make money. The producers of this film had no idea what they were doing, and the result is a comedy that has absolutely no comedic value. As a result, this film's biggest problem is that the acting is dreadful. The actors who play the comedians don't know how to act. They don't have any idea how to improvise. They're not funny. They are not convincing. The fact that every single actor on this film acts in a way that is completely unconvincing, makes this film even worse than The Hangovers Part II. The only reason I can think of for how this film could be worse is if the film were set in the future, where people actually laughed at movies. It's like they want us to laugh, but they don't understand how. This film is so bad that it made me sick. If you like comedy, then you should watch this film. It will turn your stomach.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________"  The following are examples of good books, movies, and TV shows that could be described as "torture porn," with each title giving a different impression of how it would make people feel.  In all of the examples above, the stories portrayed in these films are meant to make us think of a situation that's likely to happen to many people (a family fight, a kidnapping), but when we watch these stories in a movie theater or on television, we don't have to imagine what that might be like; we can read about it in a book.  is one of the most popular books of all time, and is often quoted in movies and television shows. It is based on the real life story of a woman named João Silva, who was kidnapped and held hostage for 18 months by a man named Luis Guzmán (and also featured in one of The Godfather films). During the entire time, Silva's husband, a doctor, stayed by her side, making sure she had enough food, water, and medicine. When Silva finally escaped, she fled to Canada, where she got married and eventually became a surgeon. , the TV show in which a character named Dr. Phil is a psychologist who conducts an experiment on a man that involves torturing him until he agrees to be his therapist. The story is based off a true story, in which the man was accused of rape and imprisoned in the Philippines for two years, during which time he did not have legal counsel. Eventually, he was found guilty, and his sentence was increased to seven years. I won't post the movie here, because it's not very good, but here is a clip that shows how Dr. Philip (played by Jack Black) treats his prisoner. When you are looking at a story like this, you need to be able to imagine how the characters feel in those situations, even if you have never experienced that situation yourself. For example, if you've seen the movie The Silence of the Lambs, you probably know that Clarice Starling (played in the movie by Meryl Streep) can't help but feel sad and sorry for her boyfriend, Buffalo Bill. She does feel bad about the way he was treated by the police, and the way that his captors kept him locked in a small cell that was constantly filled with spiders and other dangerous creatures. When Buffalo Bill eventually escapes, Starling is so angry that she almost lashes out

"In a very general way, male evolutionary strategy may favor those who exhibit sexual arousal patterns that are more stereotypically feminine," he said.  But this strategy may be very problematic.

The study suggests a woman's sexual response may be more than a random expression of her subconscious sexual desire — a biological drive to reproduce.  The new research also suggests that when a man is highly aroused, he tends to seek out the kind of sexual encounters that are most likely to produce a biological offspring. In the case of women, this may involve engaging in sex with very different types of men. "The fact that women respond differently to the same type of sexual encounter tells us that women are responding to the kind and the context of the interaction — the context in which the sexual interaction occurs," said Michael Ritchie, the author of the new study, in an interview with Science. "And women are probably responding to their own reproductive interests."  D'A covenant and his colleagues conducted a series of experiments in which they gave different kinds of men, men who were highly aroused or those who were not, different kinds and contexts of sexual interactions. In one experiment, the researchers asked men who had previously hooked up with very attractive women to come back to the lab and have sex with another woman who was more attractive than either of them.  and a man's partner, and the more attracted to the more sexually attractive woman.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ If you liked this movie, you might also like this one: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0829641/ http://vintagefilm.blogspot.com...  Review by: David H. on May 12, 2010 :  I watched this movie twice - once at a screening of it at the Museum of Natural History and the other time at the Film Society of Lincoln Center. The only downside I can think of was the poor sound quality - the sound effects were a bit odd to me. But I think that it still is an entertaining movie. There's a lot of tension and action in the plot, which makes it seem more interesting. There is also a very cool twist at the end which was a great surprise.  Thank you!  (review of free book)  Analysis by: J.B. on June 03, 2009 : . I have only just started watching this movie but I feel I can already see where the inspiration for the movie came from. The movie is about two brothers who are traveling together. They go through a desert and end up crossing a huge ravine. This is where the movie is most interesting and the main theme is survival. The brothers manage to get across the ravine but then have to make a decision which is made very important. How far can they get and if they make it they will be able to survive. They have to decide this when the sun goes down and they get out of the raville to find water. They decide to drink from the river but there are some big fish swimming in the water and they kill them to survive... They are hungry and the water is now very dark and very hot, which can kill them... The brothers are very thirsty but have only a little water... As the night comes they manage to find more food. As they are leaving the ravidge and heading for the next ravine they see a man, and he is looking at them with hatred... The film is about their adventure in the ravines of Arizona. The film does not end up on any cliffhanger but a long fight against the evil of greed and evil is the ending of this story. So my score for this movie is 8/10. I love the story, the characters and the action. There were some times when the characters had no motivation but that is the point of a film... It is a great movie to watch once in a while.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ Review by the Reviewer of _______________________________________________________ You should never give negative reviews to movies, but I am going to anyway. It is only fair. This movie is so ridiculous, that it can be called nothing less than a piece of pure silliness. The story is pretty simple. In the present day, a scientist, Dr. P, discovers a way to travel back in time, which is very interesting, but also pretty confusing. For some inexplicable reason, he gets a little help from an old woman. Soon Dr.P learns that a mysterious device called the T-800 is capable of time travel, and that the only problem is to find a means of transporting it. But the most confusing part is that Dr.I don't know anything about the T800, and Dr.II doesn't know what the hell he is talking about either. Dr. III finds a little device which works a lot better than the T1's he used, but Dr.IV does not. What is worse, Dr III's girlfriend does not know what she is talking or how to operate it. Now, all of this is fine, if a bit silly. Then the thing with Dr. IV's girlfriend, that is not silly, and is probably going to get you killed, comes in. When Dr.V goes to the doctor, he asks him what is that thing. The doctor replies that it is a T-850, and goes on to tell him that they should go back in the past and get it working, to which the poor guy responds by saying he has a car and would go back. Dr V looks at the T850 and asks, "Would you rather be killed or be a dog?". Now, we have our first example of the fact that the movie makers have not been paying attention to what has been written by the authors. The fact is that the T7s have a working system, and can't be killed. So Dr. V could have gone back in a time machine, gotten the T750, which he had, and then went back in to save Dr. I. But he just went back and made the same mistake again, and ended up killing Dr. II. If this movie was made by an idiot, it would be funny. However, this is just a total farce. It's like a guy goes to his girlfriend's house and says "would you rather have a cat or be killed?" Then his girlfriend says

The author is ________. You can read the book and watch the movie, and you're probably going to have a lot of fun. Here's why: * This book is so great, it doesn't really need a movie to sell it. This book was written, for example, by a professional who studied law and spent all his time writing and editing, who wrote thousands of pages and then turned it into a book. * This movie makes the characters more human by having them talk about everyday experiences, not a mystery or mystery novel. * I love the way that this movie takes you behind the scenes and lets you see what it is like to edit a book that is already so big. The editing process involves people who do not write books, like the editor who made the movie. * The movie shows that great books have amazing characters. When you're a writer, you think people like to think of the hero as the hero; when you make a movie about a book, the hero is the editor, who is so much more human and not really heroic. * These days, you can make movies about any subject. In fact, the best ones involve the people who write the books. The editors in this movie are really great writers themselves, but the main character is a movie editor and he uses the book as a tool in his editing job. * A movie that tells a great story is not necessarily a good one, but when it is, it is hard to beat. This is one of those movies. * If you like books and movies, you might like this book too. If not, you're not really missing much. I'd give this book three out of five stars.

(Anonymous) "This is a well-crafted film from start to finish. The performances by everyone in the film is phenomenal, particularly, Peter Mullan's portrayal of Michael. As the story progresses, the intensity increases with the characters' interactions. I'm very interested to see where the sequel will take us. " (David A. Wells, Director/Producer) Fantastic, wonderful movie. I highly recommend this to all those that appreciate well-made, suspenseful thriller films.  "I must say that I have seen some really good movies, but not this one. This is a beautiful film, one of the best I have ever seen, a masterpiece. The acting is impeccable, the writing superb. I was mesmerized." (Tanya O'Connor, Actress/Producers) I'm giving it a 9.3 out of 10. A little while ago, I went to see this film and it turned out to be a fantastic experience. I won't give away the plot, but suffice it to say that it is one of those movies that you really can't put down. I am going to give a little synopsis of the plot because I think it is important for people who are interested in this movie to know that it starts out in a very familiar fashion. Michael Keaton and Jessica Chastain play the two leads who are both being pulled into a plot of a high-stakes kidnapping which is taking place out on the streets of New York City. I know a little bit about the story, but I won�t say too much because I would ruin it for people. The screenplay is beautifully written by Mark Waters. It does not contain any exposition, and it keeps the audience on their toes throughout the film. The pacing is very well done. It takes a couple of years of their lives, but they slowly, but surely, realize that they need to stop the kidnapper. I thought that it was very well-done, but there were moments that were a little disappointing. The first couple of acts do have some suspense, but the payoff is not as good as what the first half promised. I didn�t feel that the tension had built up to a point where they would have to make a decision that was hard to make. It just didn�tty

If you have a good idea, don't be afraid to ask. In fact, you don't need to know what you're talking about to find something good to watch, even if it's one that has already come out. This is because there are many films that I haven't seen, but I still find something I like about them. The important thing is to find what you enjoy and that will give you a good start.  a) When the good shows come out: When I was a kid, we could go to the video store every weekend and pick out a movie. Today, you can't find that movie on a regular basis. So what can you find? There are many of the following types of shows available, although there are more that aren't on the big screen. They are all worth watching. If there are some that you know you like, ask a friend to go with you. It's always best to find shows by watching previews or clips. Sometimes there are two or three movies that are similar to one another, so you might want to watch them together. It won't hurt to call the video shop and see if they have the exact movie you want. If you are going to a movie on the video screen, you might as well find something to do. You don't want to sit in the movie theater and wait all evening while the theater shows the credits. It will only distract you from the movie. Here are some of the more popular shows I have found worth watching:  The Black Stallion  American Graffiti  Animal House  Blazing Saddles  Carlito's Way  Caddyshack  Dirty Rotten Scoundrels  Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb  Goonies  National Lampoon's Animal House , The Omen, The French Connection, Scarface  Top Gun  What to do: See the trailers and clips of these shows to see what you like.

Clicking the arrow next to your last review will 'un-review' it.]  5 out of 5 stars A HAPPY MISSION TO PICK UP GOLDSBORO:   Well, it's a pretty good movie. It was made by a nice guy and I enjoyed it.   For one thing, it doesn't start off with a good ol'-fashioned, "Whoops, I was wrong, you know what this film is about? How you get a free ride to pick up some random girl. You don't have to actually pick up her but you can do whatever."   This movie actually goes into the whole picking up girls thing in great detail, I got to know the girl from an earlier scene and how she got to that point was quite a bit of fun.   of course that's not to say it was easy to get with her, just that she was cool, it was a great scene and I found myself laughing a lot.  .  ,   All in all, a very well made film about the good old-fashioned idea of picking up a girl and not having to ask. Good job for them.   (That was my last point, not saying it's not funny, just say that's what this movie is about. It isn't that easy. The movie was written by a friend of mine who is a writer and a teacher, and it has a pretty nice ending to it, the only real flaw is that the last part of it was not that great. This film had very good humor, but it had no substance and I think the writers should have let it play out to its conclusion before going into the happy ending thing).  So, overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot, especially since the main character doesn't ask out the girl, but instead goes out of his way to help her out.   on to the review.  (If you like this, please read my others reviews and check out other movie reviews and blog posts)   (1) Good character development, for a change  - We have a guy who knows what he wants to do, he has made a lot of plans for his life and he wants a life where he makes his own decisions. There's also a great twist at the end of the movie where he is no longer the hero, but he

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________ A great deal has been made of the great number of films made by the New Zealand Film Commission in recent years, with a number of critically acclaimed films having been produced, and many more in production or in post-production. The work done by the Commission is recognised around the world for its creativity, professionalism and quality. I am pleased that there has been some recent talk about the future of the Film Commission, and that these concerns are being taken seriously. In a recent letter to the Prime Minister, I requested his support for the future role of the Commission, which will require further investment from the Government. I also raised concerns about the increasing length of time between the release of a new movie and its release on the international film market. I asked that a number be set aside to ensure a quick and efficient process for this film and for future movies, with particular attention to New Zealand. The Prime Minister has agreed to do this for the next film. This is a major step forward. It will allow the production team to get back into the production zone, working with the director and the producers, and to build the momentum of the film's release in anticipation of an international success. As this is an important issue for us all, I will be seeking your support in ensuring that we get the money we need for the film to be made. My team and I know that New Zealanders are enthusiastic about our movies, and will support a number to be released here and abroad. I have also raised the possibility that we could support a major feature film in New Zealand, similar to the success we have had with The Sapphires. I fully support this idea, and hope that you will, too. The more New Zealand gets its name known as a premier location for film, the better. As a country that is so keen to export its culture, it makes a lot of sense for the Government to support the success of international films that are made here. I look forward to hearing from you about how you would like the next two films made, with my support, to be completed. As ever, you can find me at www.thejohn-mcdonald-movie.com, where you will find details of how to get in touch and other information. _____________________________________ My thanks to the Minister and to the Acting Director of the NHMRC, Dr Tim de Brauw, for their support in this issue.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ Why is there a difference between writing a good review and writing a bad one? __________________________ "The way to learn how to play the piano is to practice in front of a mirror."  (Mark Twain) Why is it a bad idea to write a movie review that is more about the movie than about the film? ___________________________________________ Why would you want to take a movie to a critic? _____________________  "There's nothing worse than a good critic."  I think that the main reason why people who review movies tend to be negative about them is that they have a lot of movies to review. I have written about 1,000 movies by the time I hit my forties, and about three more, and have done so since. I've had the pleasure of watching them all, but I've also had the privilege of reading the negative reviews. And while I disagree with the most of these reviewers' judgments, they do point out things I could have missed. As a result, I sometimes feel that the reviewers have the same information as me, and I can't seem to find any common ground between them.  So, to clarify my position, I wrote a series of posts in 2008, 2009 and 2010 about a number of movies that I reviewed, and then in 2011, I decided to write an updated version of this series. In that 2012 post, I pointed out that people tend to watch movies a lot less than they read reviews, which means that if they just read a review of a movie in a given year and didn't go see the movie that year, they might miss the movie altogether because it wasn't on the top of their list of movies they wanted to see that year. So I thought, let's use this time to ask the question: why don't we write movie reviews that are shorter and more focused on the movie as a work of art than the movie's movie review. , I said, would be more helpful than the typical movie review because it would concentrate on the work itself, not its star-studded cast, its director, its writers, its special effects, its theme songs, its songs, or its stars. That post has some of the key themes that I'm interested in here. There's a reason that reviews are so often negative, as I've argued before. It's because reviewers are not writing about the content of the movie, they are writing about its packaging, promotion,

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________A note on reviewing a movie:  The best movies that we have in our catalog come from independent film makers. We don't review movies for our site. We only review movies by the directors and stars. So if you like what you see from a director or star, go see the movie. If you don't, go find the film maker who made the movie so you can read his review. The only reason we are in business is because we wanted to be. If a movie doesn't have good reviews, it's just not going to make money.   The following are not reviews by our staff. They are either our own personal reviews (with a star next to them), reviews of other sites, and are the work of our members. We encourage our members to give them a personal review if they would like.   the reason for having reviews is to get people to see a movie even if they don't agree with what is in it. There is no such thing as "good" or "bad" reviews. Every one is a personal opinion and can not be trusted. We are not trying to make a profit or to make someone happy. We have no time for all this nonsense. All we want is to see good movies.  - The Staff  - Staff Member Review by CuteBeth Location: San Jose, CA, USA   Cost: $3.00- $4.00 (depending on the movie)   Value: I found a review on TheHollywood.com that I liked and decided to get this one.   be sure to read the description. If it says "a film about a group of students who make a pact to not look at their phone while driving to school one day," that's fine. If not, then don't get this movie.   (the film does show us that people do this as they're not used to it and then when they start they have to get used to the new way of life)   to my surprise the film was actually pretty good. We didn't really think of the group as a bunch of freaks because the main character's father was a little weird (although a very sweet and loving man), the movie didn't try to make us hate the parents, and we found it to be pretty funny. The movie doesn 't really focus on any one of the characters, and the film starts out fairly slow. (it could have been made a little more

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  Reviews that get a lot of attention are the ones that people say, "Hey, I can't believe it. That's a great review!" (Hey, you can go back and read it, it's not that important to your life.)  If you've already watched a movie that is bad, then you are probably not the person I want to hear your opinion about. I don't want your opinion unless you were there, in the theater, and watched it again, after a few days. In my experience, the people who love bad movies are the same people who write great reviews. If you like a bad movie, it doesn't mean that it's good. I hate bad movies, and that's why I love great movies.  the bad movie  When you're in the mood for a movie, I recommend "A Man Called Ove." It has a really great ending and great visuals.  of course, a great movie is subjective. I know you're probably not going to see the film, so what is the difference between good and bad movies?  Some of the biggest mistakes in the movie world, are the mistakes that are so obvious that people fail to realize they're making a mistake.  this movie's  There are so many movies out there that make a mistake that is really obvious that it should be corrected before anyone even sees the movie.  The most obvious mistake in the whole movie world is this one. It was just one of those movies that the filmmakers were just so happy to do that they made a mistake in that moment that completely destroys the mood and the movie in the viewer's mind. So, if you don't see the movie, and you still read this review, you're making the same mistake. They didn't do a good job of getting people to forget about it in a single viewing, so I won't even mention it in this review. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________   C. J. Ciaramella:  "Annie Hall" is a classic, but one with a problem.  While the movie's basic concept is quite compelling, the film also has issues that are somewhat troubling. I've been wondering if its faults could be traced back to director Woody Allen and writer Alan Alda. Both men have been under scrutiny for their treatment of women. While it may seem like a no-brainer to criticize both, I've never been in the position to judge anyone's art, especially when it's so personal. That being said, I was intrigued when I read about the alleged mistreatment of the woman in the movie, Annie Hall's co-star, Heather Graham. Alda, in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, has been described as saying that "the scene in Annie Hall where her character, the narrator's wife, gets beaten up was written about her in a rape crisis center in the early '60s. This was not an original idea. It was a line that the director, Woody, had already been trying to put in his screenplay." Alda also said that the incident "is one of the most painful experiences of my life."  If you go by the Hollywood gossip column headlines, you may have come across the quote many times. But in context, it may not look as bad as it does in print. Here's what Alda actually said: "The scene in which her character gets beaten was written out of the original screenplay by Woody Allen, because he felt that would have been too brutal and he thought it would get the reaction he was looking for, which was a good reaction. In the end he gave it to me."  the original script for "Annie"  So when Alda says it was written for a rape hotline in the 1960s, that's hardly surprising. I find it remarkable that a man who has made so many powerful and affecting films over his career would be so open about a sensitive subject.  is it true, then, that he wrote the scene as a response to being raped?  Let's put this in perspective. He was making "An Annie Hall" in 1968, which means the rape scene had been in his head for a very long time. It had been part of his writing and rewriting process for years. And the fact that it had been included in a scene that he had been trying for so many years

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________ The Great Gatsby:  Gatsby and Daisy have a romance! A romance so romantic, in fact, that he leaves her for her "friend." But Daisy gets her own friend in Daisy Miller--who is so cute and so damn sexy that her romance with Gats is just the icing on the cake. But the main thing about this movie is that it features an amazing music score. (It also features some of my favorite dialogue from any of F. Scott Fitzgerald's works. Gatsy? That's a mouthful. You need to brush up on the classics, boy.) Citizen Kane:    No, that's not what this movie does. The movie is the story of John Barrymore's character, Kane. He's a genius who has the same problem most of us do when we are trying to lose weight:  The difference between Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Kane is that Mr. Barrymore gets the help he needs.  A book by a man who lived under the same name as that of his author. There's something about that name, I feel.   As well as the beautiful setting and the perfect cast:   As the movie's plot goes, he has a few people following him, including his wife, and he ends up making one last deal. His last deal:    It's kind of like a handshake.  There's some serious love in there. _________________________ The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou:     This is not the movie you might think it is, but it is a great film.

The plot: ___________ Steve is trapped on an underwater world, and his only friend is a mer-maid named Amelie. (Yes, I said it.) The movie doesn't have a lot of action, but this is the first of many times Ziss's character gets to see what it's like to swim under water. He also gets to experience a bit of jealousy of Pearl's love, and finds the perfect opportunity to fight off jealousy when Pearl's father comes into town and tries to take Amel. The soundtrack is a bit generic, but I love the songs by Tangerine Dream. And the characters, especially

Don't watch this movie unless you are up for the challenge, or you are really in need of a laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. If it has a really good cast or director or a great soundtrack or a beautiful shot, write about it. If you're going to recommend a bad movie, then at least get it right. You can't judge a movie before you watch it. I also recommend avoiding using a rating system. There is no way to objectively rate a movie, and even if you can tell how good or bad a movie is by reading the reviews, you're still likely to be swayed by one good review. In short: don't tell people what to rate a good or a bad film, because you're likely to encourage them to rate it incorrectly.

For example, a new application may break existing programs when they are running under the old version of the program. Alternatively, when a new version is released for a program, old code and data may be left behind by the application that is used with the new version. In either case, the user will receive a message indicating the problem. To prevent this, an application must be upgraded or replaced. There are several approaches that can be used to deal with this situation: - Upgrade or replace the program - Reinstall the program on the computer - Disable the program or prevent it from starting - Stop and wait until the program is upgraded/reinstalled (see the section below titled "Stop and wait") - Disable (and delete) the application's data directory. When a program is installed on a system, a configuration file (known as a "data directory") is created with information about all the programs the user can access. When the data directory is deleted or disabled, the program can no longer be accessed. See the section titled "Data directory deletion" below. See also "disable" below for more information. A program can be "deterministic" - it will work the same way whether it is installed correctly or not. See "determinism"
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  I've been writing for a long time, about things I'd want to see, or eat, or drink, or listen to. But I haven't written much about movies since I've been in school.   It all started with the '90s TV series "All My Children," in which the narrator, a divorced lawyer who lives in New York City, was convinced his three teenage daughters, his ex-wife and his two children from a previous marriage were a cult of murderous killers. The kids were actually a loving, all-female cult led by a widowed woman and her two oldest sons. The show was a bit campy and self-serious, and yet the whole thing was a brilliant, eerie examination of the effects of parental alienation, of the dark and painful secrets of childhood. As I watched the series, I wondered how the people on screen managed to live without any idea of what it must be like to be a child in a cult.   a bad movie:  This has been an especially bad year for movies, and with good reason: There's a lot to be said for good movies that don't make me wish for something better to come next. But sometimes, you just can't resist seeing a movie that you don't like, and a certain aspect of the movie—especially when it has been made for little money—just keeps calling to you. (This is, of course, not a requirement of my writing. I can enjoy a movie without having thought about it all the way through. Or, if I want to watch the same movie over and over and always enjoy it, I can do that. That's not what's happening here.)   I was not a big fan of the "Transformers" films, and I'll admit that I still have an odd memory of seeing them at age 6 in theaters. But then, I was the kid whose parents never bought him the new toys and who was always scowling at the giant robots. So in a strange way, it made perfect sense that I enjoyed the movies, too.   the right movie:   There were several movies that came out this year that I thought were terrific, but that didn't turn out to be the case. For instance, I liked "The Big Short," which is a solid drama about Wall Street. But "Logan Lucky" was a lot more meh. And "Dunkirk" was, well, not

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ ___________________ Rating: __________________  The Man Who Would Be King was a very good movie, and it is one of the reasons I watch Star Wars. That movie had the idea of a group of people who are forced to do horrible things in order to save humanity. They are told their lives are going to end if they don't comply, and they start to realize how wrong they are. It's a very dark movie, but it's not meant to be a dark movie. The story has so much emotional content to it, you feel the tragedy the characters go through. It doesn't have to be scary for this movie to work. There are some really good ideas, and even the first act of the movie does a good job of showing us the conflict that we're all in.  As a fan of the Star Wars universe, I really liked how they created the character of Caine. Caine was a huge fan of Anakin, so he wanted to take over Anakin's position as the leader of the Rebel Alliance. He is trying to do this, but he doesn't want to do it for the sake of himself. He sees it as giving back what was taken away, but the movie never shows him fully accepting who he is. There is definitely a character growth that goes along with Caine, but at the same time, he is always in the process of being a great villain. He's so ruthless, and so ruthless that he kills people for no reason. This was definitely the most memorable villain in the Star Trek franchise, and he is still my favorite villain. A lot of the characters are not well developed. There isn't much interaction with them, and the story doesn't really have a big focus. Most of the scenes we do get are with the big heroes. The character of Luke is well written, and I loved how he was the one who did the talking during the entire movie. We learn that he's a great fighter, but never really sees it that way. He doesn't see himself as a hero. He just wants to take care of his family, and this is what his Jedi teacher told him to do. We see how he comes to believe that he is doing right for the galaxy. The best thing about Luke is how he really feels about his friends and family. Even though he does horrible things, he doesn' feel like he's taking them for granted. In the end, we all have

It's as though time itself has stopped, as though I've just had a dream. It was like that the day before, but today it was different. I saw his face again. But this time, the smile had gone, and the tears were not hiding any part of his face. But he was there. Yes, he was, and now that I look at him I am a changed man. Not in the way I was before, not in the good way. I've become an angry man. I don't remember why I didn't tell you this when I got back to the house. But you wouldn't have believed me anyway.

The movie "The Godfather" has one of the most iconic and iconic scenes in film history where Al Pacino looks back on his life and life in general and how he had changed. He also talks about the events that have happened in his life.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  Noah Foskett: The New Age Rock Star   "All in the Family" is the ultimate "American Idol" for the 21st century: an American comedy with the highest level of artistic integrity and an excellent cast. "Noah" is also a very faithful adaptation of a highly imaginative novel by the Austrian philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. While it is true that the movie is much more than a "mockumentary," it is, nevertheless, very funny and entertaining. It is also quite well researched, which makes it easier to understand the author's ideas.   The film is based on an interesting concept: the search for a true hero in a society that is increasingly divided between those who live in the "nihilist void" and those who strive for something.   the protagonist is a fictional character named Noah, played by the Irish actor Tom Courtenay. He is a young man whose life is totally dominated by a desire for fame, for the thrill of the moment.  , who, along with his friend, Stu, travels to the fictional town of "Laertes," where he is introduced to the philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, who is a living symbol of the nihilist view of life, a "paradoxical nihilist," according to Courteney. The whole movie is based entirely on a fictional novel entitled "The Genealogy of Morals," written by Nietzsche's student, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schiller.   The story starts off with a fictional scene from the novel, in which Noah, who has just recently arrived in "Laertes," has come across a beggar whom he believes to be a young young poet. A bit confused at first, Noah asks the beggar whether he is a poet too. The beggar responds that he is, but asks for money instead. In reply, Noah has a hard time explaining his dilemma: he loves his country and he loves poetry, but at the same time he really doesn't know how to express what he truly thinks and feels. Finally, Noah decides to use his money to get the beggard some food instead. Unfortunately, the beggars family does not have enough money to pay for a meal. Noah's decision to get food for the family is not exactly a novel one, but it does explain his behaviour in this scene, and thus makes his behaviour much more comprehensible.   of course the whole thing could easily be considered as just a harmless

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ The Last Days _________________________________________________  If this film doesn't make you want to go to the theater, nothing will.  Director David Cronenberg knows how to use the medium to make you feel the most uncomfortable.    I'm talking about the uncomfortable of the camera angle, the awkward shots, the lack of a character, the unnatural soundtrack.  It seems that the film is taking a different direction than David Cronenburg's previous films.  What was once a dark thriller is now more of a horror film.  This film is more about horror and creepiness.  As the title suggests, the film centers on a woman (Anna Paquin) that goes to her death after becoming a zombie, which she turns into an adult female in order to take revenge on her ex-husband.  She has taken up a job as a prostitute in order take revenge for killing the man that abandoned her, whom she then turns into a zombie.  The main reason that it's called The Last Days is that we only know about Anna Paquin.  We're not even given a good view of her character, she's just given us the chance to see her for five minutes, and it is terrifying.  You can't make up anything you think about this film and then go watch it, you'll just see what you thought about.  There are some amazing scenes in this film, and we're all still trying to process this film. There are no happy endings, just brutal ones that are hard to forget.  And I am willing to say that I would watch this movie again, even if I have no idea what is going on, I would still go see it just to see that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________  I think I'm going to start with the big picture, as opposed to the individual parts. When we talked about the characters, I said that they have a lot to say about each other and how they relate. And then we talked a little bit about the world we're living in, specifically where the movie is set. The movie begins with a lot of confusion. We see people coming to find out the truth. We hear rumors, people talking about a cult.  We see a man (played by Paul Bettany) leaving his house and then he's arrested. We get some of his dialogue and the events that lead up to that and then a mysterious car and a guy with no car who gets out and we find that there's something wrong with that. . And what we see on the ground, in what they've been up to for the past couple of weeks, that is really the start of this story. ,  Now we get to the other side of the story, and that is, as I said, the conspiracy. I think the way the movie was set up is the start, not the end. The film sort of opens up and gets bigger and bigger, and it's like the movie gets bigger as we go along.

When he goes to fight in Korea, he falls for a gorgeous Chinese woman who may be his soul mate.   (The film was directed by John Woo, who is widely considered the greatest of the Western genre directors.)   _________________________________________  "Killing Them Softly"  was a very successful Australian movie about a war veteran (Richard Kiel) who's just been discharged from the army. He's living in Sydney and decides to take a year to explore his new surroundings, only to find his former life has just taken a very unexpected turn.   the film was made in 1975, and starred:   Richard Kiell as Richard Kiel (soldier in Vietnam).  George Mancuso as his wife, Judy, who later marries a much older and much wealthier man named Frank.  Michael Caine as Frank and his beautiful Chinese bride, Liu Qing (played by Gweneth Paltrow).  in 1974 the film "The Big Green Berets" (see below) was released in Australia, and many viewers of the movie, and indeed Richard Kieill himself, thought it was very similar to this one.  It was later revealed that the director of the film, Robert Zemeckis, was also the director for the "Killing THEM Softly", although the two had never met, and were both very impressed with the movie. So much so that they asked director John Milius to direct one of the sequels, which in turn led to another collaboration between Zemecking and director Miliuse.  , a long-lost Australian movie from 1971, that the producer has found and is screening again for a film festival in London in October 2010.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   I have always believed that the more positive reviews the better. So if you see a movie that is good, just say something positive. It will make people more willing to spend money to watch the movie and if they do, great.   So I have just posted a very positive review on a movie called The Book Thief. I know it is not a very good movie, but at least, I think that it has something that other good movies do not have. I just want people to know what a good story I think this movie has, and how much I enjoyed this movie.  . I think The Book thief has great acting, well written and a great story. I will definitely see this movie again, and I am sure I will enjoy it.   the Book Thief  The Book Thief Review by Tasha I was very happy when I heard that I had a chance to see this film on the big screen. I have heard about this film for many years and was excited that it was finally going to be released. My first impression of this film was that I was in for something amazing, and the ending was definitely an emotional one. The Book thieves is a movie about a group of thieves who steal the manuscript for a book that will change history, and their lives forever. Written by Richard E. Grant, this book has already sold over 100 million copies. The main cast is an excellent collection of actors, and they play off each other very well. If you enjoy good performances, great acting and good writing this is definitely a good film to check out. The story is simple and yet at times very complex, as the characters go through various events that really develop the characters and make it feel like they are truly connected. My only complaint is that I thought that the ending seemed rushed, and that there was no real resolution to the plot. I was just hoping that there would be a proper ending. The cast, performances, story and plot were all great, and this film just keeps getting better and better each time I see it. The actors, both of them, really bring their A game. If this film had a few more days to give it a chance, I would have thought it was great, but after all, it is only 8 minutes long.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's a real thrill. I am truly amazed at how you manage to keep it entertaining throughout without ever getting tedious or boring." I am a bit confused, however, about the positive reviews for the movie.  Is it because the movie is so realistic that it can be overlooked?  Or is it because people are actually liking it? ______________  The movie opens with a woman who has recently lost her home and has left her family behind.       She's traveling to California to find a job and an apartment.   The movie cuts from her driving down a freeway, where she has to turn down a red light, to the house of a man and his wife, who are being attacked.  The wife, in bed, is hit in the face, and as she falls she is raped, stabbed, and strangled.  After a man comes into the room and strangles her, the other man comes and strangle the other woman.  She then finds herself back in bed with the man she is with now, and he says he is going to take care of it.  At this point the man is wearing a mask.  He's trying to scare her into coming with him.  It's not clear at this point what he is trying to do.  However, we are to believe that it's just a way to make her change her mind.  Finally, he has her come with him and she goes in a room where the husband is tied to the bed.  Then she hears someone screaming in the background.  Her eyes are locked on the door of the other room.  When she opens the door she sees a man with a knife standing outside it. He wants to rape her.  What is going on here?  Why is this a scary movie?  In a few words, I'm confused.  I feel that it was written to be frightening.  In reality, the rapist is a young woman who had been raped and who is still trying to get over the trauma of the incident.  This movie is a great example of horror.  So what is the point?  I have no idea.  Is it to show that rape is a bad thing?  Or that the woman is the real victim here? If it's the former, then it is definitely disturbing.  If the latter, then why?  The only thing I can think of is that the movie could be a metaphor

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's really not a good time right now, but the movie is great"   "This movie looks like a good idea to make"  I love watching movies, especially if it's on Netflix. Unfortunately, I know there's a big problem with Netflix, and that's the movies. I recently saw an online movie review, and it was about a movie called The Good Place, directed by Michael Schur, the creator of Community. The writer seemed to hate this movie, but I still watched the movie. Why? Because it's a good film. You should watch it too.  So, when someone writes something negative about a film, like "It looks like the film is overproduced" or "It makes the story boring" or something similar, I am a bit annoyed. They might hate the film, but it's not their job to say that about the film. I think they should go watch the film for themselves, and then tell you whether they think it's good or not.  The Good place is a very fun film. It's very funny, and Michael Schreiber is fantastic in it. He does a very good job at showing the way that everyone around the characters in the movie should be. There are some flaws in the film (it's not as polished as a lot of other movies are), but it does a good job with them. This film is the story of a man, Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), who comes into a mysterious mansion with her sister Amy (Bell). Amy has just been given a gift from an old man in order to get her out of a life she doesn't want to live, and she has to get it back. Eleanor finds out that she is being set up to take on this task by her sister, and the rest of the movie follows the two as they go to work. "He should be able to do anything he wants to do because he's the most powerful man in town."  The Good Place is a fun film, especially because everyone has their own personality. The characters are very likable. Amy is a sarcastic teenager, and her sarcasm makes her hilarious. The other characters are different, but they are likable too. The movie is very entertaining.  a very enjoyable movie. I will definitely watch the whole movie.

He quickly realizes this when the whole family is forced to evacuate to the motel in the middle of the desert. While on the road, the boy gets lost in the dark and nearly dies. His mother and sister are sent to the airport and find themselves stranded on an empty airfield and forced to endure the desert heat without food or water. The father decides to continue on his journey, as he is determined to reunite his family. His only guide is a mysterious woman named Rita, who will tell him only if he comes to her home. On his journey into the desert, he comes face to face with the man who stole his father, and soon realizes he himself may have been the victim.   The movie was well-written, although I personally found it very confusing, but that is really my own personal taste. The movie also included some pretty great acting, including John Hurt as the father, Peter Falk as the daughter, and even Sam Neill as the son (he was an actor on the original Alien movies). But the best thing about the movie was the soundtrack! I have never heard a movie soundtrack quite like it, especially when you hear the songs of the original movies, as you will have to listen very carefully, because they are the only ones in the film that will ever make you say "I know that song!"   Overall, this movie is a pretty well-crafted movie, even though there are parts that were confusing and I was not sure why I was still doing something, but I loved it. It was an absolutely amazing experience and I think it will hold a place in my heart. If you have never seen the original movie, go out and buy this movie. It is just as good as the first movie in my opinion and you won't be disappointed at all.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ A+ - This is a great movie. The only thing that i don't like about this movie is the ending and the way it's set up. Its basically like a thriller film, but the ending was very unrealistic. The way the police officer and the young woman got out of the car, the car suddenly started moving backwards, and that's it, you're done. There is no tension. There's no struggle. They didn't even struggle. The car just starts to move backwards. Its supposed to be this suspense, and it's ruined by the fact that the cops never stop the car. They just keep walking and walking until they arrive at the house, then they run up and jump out. They jumped out of a moving car. It was just impossible to do that. That was the only problem with this movie. I guess it had potential, but I didn't like it. It took way too long to set up the whole thing, it didn't make much sense, and the ending just wasn't the way you expected. _____________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________  I watched The Shawshank Redemption today, and I really liked it. But...  by TheAmerikaner  Posted on 12/09/11 @ 12:28 PM Posted on 12 on 12 of 12  So...   1. It seems to me that Shawshanks is NOT an actual prison. I'm not really sure how to describe it. It's sort of like a mental asylum. Not that it's a bad place to go, as far as I'm concerned. But it's more like a weird mental asylum than a prison.   2. I think the movie is set in the late 1970's, which means, I think, the first half of the movie took place before Shawshanka, or before it was established that it was a Shawshakalike place.  .   on the movie...I like it. The actors do an amazing job and the story and the characters are very well done. I haven't read the book, but I'd bet a lot of money that, as a film, it's much better than it would have been if the producers and director had read the books.  , but...but... I was kind of disappointed. There's a lot in that book about the mental hospitals and about how there's no point in treating prisoners with mental problems. There are some good ideas in that movie, but a lot is just wrong. For instance: it seems that some prisoners do get mental problems, and that they can be treated and cured, but that no one ever thinks of that. There is no discussion of that idea, and when there is, it seems like it's just brushed off as not having any meaning. Or: Shawshansky himself says in the movie that he's in this place for no reason. There was no real need for this insane asylum. In the book (I haven't done a full read yet) there's a scene where Shawshinks says he's here because of his parents, which was a reason I liked. In Shawshanky he says it's because of an accident in his childhood that left him with an unusual neurological condition called "hysterical epilepsy", which is now cured. So...the reason he's there has nothing to do with his parents. And...there's absolutely no discussion about what the purpose of a psychiatric institution is. It just was there.   is that the author wanted his characters to have no personality

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________  5.1/10 – Movie Review  Movie Summary:  A man's search for love, while in an insane asylum, leads to a startling realization about his past.  My Rating: 3.5/10  Summary of the Film:  is the story of David Haddad (Bryan Cranston), a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who is diagnosed with schizophrenia. It follows him as he searches for love and redemption.  the film opens with David waking up in an asylum for mentally ill in 1985. David has become obsessed with finding a cure for his illness and he is given a diagnosis of schizophrenia. David is given several drugs that will attempt to cure his psychosis but they have very long half-lives, meaning that David will never be free of his illness. . Haddad has two choices: 1) Continue living his life as a hopeless addict and slowly succumb to the insanity. 2) Commit suicide and go to heaven. David decides that he needs to get the drugs out of his system before he goes to heaven and take the life he was given. David decides to use his father's old gun and kills himself. David then wakes up in a hospital bed. It is implied that this is the place where his father, a priest was taken. So David is now on his own with no place to live and no hope of ever finding love. David realizes that his only option is to take his own life so he begins to kill himself and takes drugs to try and calm himself down. David finds a man who has the key to the room he wakes up into and begins to use the gun to commit suicide. Unfortunately, his plan fails and he accidentally kills the man in the process. The man starts to try to help David but is caught and killed himself. While on his deathbed, David sees a photo of his family in the mirror. He realizes that one day, he will be home and will love his family, like his real family. He then begins to get better and has to deal with the pain of losing his family. The first half of the film follows David H Addad and his journey to the hospital where he wakes from his madness. He is still trying to find a cure and a way to bring his family back to life. David's quest is very similar to that of the "Thelma and Louise" movies. He needs to find something that will make him

Thanks for listening!  Category: Direct download: hannity_20180706_1222_a.m.mp3 Category: general -- posted at: 1:07pm EDT  Episode 1, Episode 1 - A Tribute to a Legend I would like to start this week's podcast by going back to 1994 when I was a child and watching the film "Giant." It was a time when Giant was a movie to see. My family was excited to go to the theater, and so were we. We sat through the first hour of the film, and the second hour was more enjoyable. Then I watched the third hour. The final hour was the most entertaining of the three. It was in that final hour that I realized that the movie was written by the same author that wrote "Gorilla," which in itself, is an amazing accomplishment. It is one of the greatest films of all time. Then in 2001, I was in high school and my girlfriend's boyfriend, who was also a fan of the original "G Giant," recommended that we watch it, and we did. It has become my favorite film. And since then, we've watched it on countless occasions. So I've had a deep respect for the film and the film's writer, and when I heard that "The Big Lebowski" was a project he was working on, I knew I had to give it a shot. We all know "The Dude" in that film is a fictional creation of the mind of screenwriter, screenwriter and screenwriter extraordinaire, screenwriting legend and all-around great man, Walter Murch. And the man behind the writing credits on that film was none other than the late, great, great Walter Mankiewicz. Well, we are in the very unique situation of having Walter Mondo, the guy behind the screenwriting credits of "The God

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The other good parts are the cast and director." I've said it before and I'll say it again, I have no problem with the film's casting, and I'd like to add here that the original screenplay I've read is very good. However, for whatever reason, I felt the casting of the two main characters was a bit off, and it made the film feel a little less grounded.  In addition, one of the best parts of the original film was the "tape game" in which the characters could play back-and-forth to see if the film would be the same when they heard it in a movie theater. This scene was toned down in the new film to more of a simple "movie talk" dialogue format.  This was a little disappointing, as the film still retained much of the charm of the originals. But if the original script didn't appeal to you, it doesn't make the film a bad film, even if you didn't enjoy the original ending.  I'll probably revisit the film once I finish watching the first season of Game of Thrones.  In the meantime, I can't wait to see what happens next in the series, or even in the next season of Arrested Development!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. You might make the movie that much better.  What's your favorite movie genre? ________. You could watch any movie in any genre for all you care.  and…  __________________, What's your least favorite movie genres? __________________. . If you don't like a movie, just tell me why. : How do you write a good review? _____. You just sit down and write a review, like a writer. I'm going to let you in on a little secret, and it will probably surprise you: When I was first writing reviews for this blog, I used to just read them in my hotel room. I'd sit in bed and read them and then write them down for later. It seemed like a good idea to me at the time, and I can say it felt like a lot of fun. So, here's how you write your review. You don't need a whole lot of words; you can leave out anything you don`t want to read about. Just make it as clear as possible. What I like to do is say how I like the movie and how much I enjoyed it, and then I write down what I liked/disliked about the movie. And then, I make it really short. I like it to be as concise as possible:  . Why I like ____________. , What I liked about _______. And then I use one sentence or a sentence and a paragraph for a little summary, or I might use two paragraphs. Whatever suits you best. If the movie is good, it will stand out in the reader`s mind more than a long, boring review of it. So when I have a movie review that has a lot to say, I do my best to make it seem like a short, concise paragraph. As for why you like a particular movie, that's a more subjective thing. Some people have a deep love for old movies, and that`s why they are so popular today. Other people can't stand old movies. They like the new stuff. Some want a good story. Some just like to see the actors in action. It's really just a matter of taste. So if you don´t feel that your tastes match up with mine, that´s okay. If I didn't like something you liked, you won't feel that you need to write me to tell me that you doní
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This review will not be very positive, but it will be objective. I am a big fan of all of the movies in this compilation. I liked the special effects, and the fact that they worked well with the character's personalities. Rating:  5/5 Inner Sanctum:    The final film in the "Inner-Souter" series.  The story takes place years before the start of the series, in a small town that is plagued by the mysterious death of the last mayor.  Rating :   7/5  Brief Summary:  The plot of the movie starts out simple. The character of Chris, a kid in trouble, is at a crossroads in his life. It seems like a great idea to give him the most difficult problems that kids face. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't let him solve any of these problems. Chris' problems are really just problems he gets himself into.  It starts with a boy that is forced to become a monster because his family and friends don't like him. He takes on the task of becoming a monster as a means of getting his mom back. But, he doesn't seem to be a good enough person to accomplish this.   It takes a while to get into the meat of the film.  The plot never becomes boring, and is well paced.  At the end of the day, it is still just a story.  But, if you're a kid at the time, I can't think of anything better than this movie.  Rated:   5.0
Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Man from Pluto,' 'The Other Side of the Wind,' 'Whip It,' 'A Streetcar Named Desire,' 'King of Comedy,' 'Sleepless in Seattle'... I'm not sure why this is the best list I could possibly make.  Why do I do this?  I don't know.  I guess I don't really care if someone tells me I'm a dumbass, because I'm not. (You should probably read it before you write a response.) In the future, I intend to write a series of posts on each of these movies, and a bunch more that I think people may want to check out. Until then, here are the reviews, in alphabetical order: 'Man From Pluto' What is it about this movie that just gets me, in a good way?  What's funny is that at the beginning of the movie, you are immediately in the place where we are most likely to appreciate the movie's humor: The movie's ending.   I think this is where the movie gets its most universal resonance.    But then, the movie actually takes its audience on a journey, to the place they find themselves at the very end, in that final montage, which is not a montage.  Instead, it is a kind of dream-like reverie.  And for a movie which seems to be about death, that is actually pretty beautiful, with a sort of timeless quality to it.   What I also like about this film is that it really puts the viewer in a position where you can ask yourself, "What kind of life would this person have if they had to deal with this situation?"  And it is fascinating how the film doesn't just deal with that kind of question, but uses it in a different way, to tell the story of a man who comes to terms with the fact that he has been wronged.  He decides to become a writer, to make it his life's work.   And what makes this interesting is that he realizes that his writing would have to be very different, than his life.  What I mean by that is that the movie really explores the different levels of a writer's life, and the many different ways that a writer can be.   That seems like it should be interesting.  (And that's what I meant when I said this movie is more universal than a lot of

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  "So far, it's only been a pretty good picture," says Joe, who's been following the latest box office figures with great interest.  When Joe and the girls are discussing the latest numbers, Joe is not looking at the numbers, but is paying more attention to the way that the movies are being made. He points out a lot of problems, for example, how many films are being produced by the same studio that made "The Fast and the Furious." He points to the bad business practices that exist within the movie industry. The industry, says Joe is becoming more and more like a "corporation" that doesn't care about its customers. He explains that when movies are made, they are sold at a profit (or a loss) because the studios are only doing it to make money. They aren't making movies for the art and they aren't doing it for the fans. , when I first heard Joe speak at the University of Toronto, I was in awe. What a voice to have! But as I listened to more of Joe's talks and heard more of his theories and ideas I started to grow dissatisfied. I was getting tired of his preaching because the movies he is preaching about are all over the place. He doesn't seem to understand one thing: that a movie is only a movie if it sells, and if it doesn't, it isn't a movie. Joe does not seem to know that the market is constantly changing, and so the way a movie will sell is a different from the way it has sold in the past. His focus on sales seems to ignore the fact that the box office numbers have never been a guarantee for the quality of the movie. For example, when you go to a theatre to watch "Jurassic Park," the movie may have no effect on the box-office success of "Furious 7" because people who want to watch the "Jury" are much more likely to do so when they hear that it's a "good movie" than they are to do it when they go to the theatre and hear that "Fury 7" is a "bad movie". "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" was a box- office hit, and it did have a good cast and a great script (although the dialogue is terrible). So while it was a successful film, it wasn't exactly an artful film, nor a classic of Hollywood. So what does it say

This is one of the best, if not the best movie I've ever seen. You will enjoy this as much as I do. - August 18, 2006Worth the price of admission!  Ratings - August 15, 2006It's a masterpiece!

I can´t understand why.   "It´s good! If you like it, buy it! You won´t regret it!"   I agree with all the previous reviews. It´s a great film. The story is not too complex and it is quite simple. But it is full of life and excitement. You can´ t ask for anything more than that. - July 26, 2006Good film... - July 17, 2007Fantastick! - July 9, 2006Truly a gem of a movie! - June 5, 2006Hilarious film!  to be continued...  The movie started as a standard western that soon turned into an action film. I was really excited as I was in the middle of the movie. The beginning is really good but then the story got serious and took off from there. It was funny at first but the second half takes it from good to great. My friend and I watched this movie several times. The only real criticism I have is the end. It is just too abrupt. The rest of the movies were enjoyable but that ending really made the movie for me. I still would have gone to see the second part again! - May 30, 2006My #1 Movie! - January 19, 2006

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I like to think that I'm an objective person, but I have a tendency to fall for the more dramatic stories and have a hard time understanding that a movie can be great with or without dramatic tension. I had been meaning to watch this movie for months (because I knew I liked it), but the thought of a movie so boring as the 'Romeo Must Die' movies never really appealed to me. Finally I saw it and was able to take my mind off of my depression for an hour or two. I'm glad I finally got to enjoy it, even though there are other movies I would rather watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  I don't know why we don't just say "Good movie!" more often. We could, wouldn't it be nice if every time a movie came out, we just said, "Oh! We saw this great movie!" If we say it out loud, every time it comes up, there'd be no confusion, no drama, no weirdness. Everyone would just be like, "Okay, so, let's just get right to it, shall we?"  There is no need for "Good Movie." We don't need to know the plot; we don the characters. We don the acting. We know all the jokes. We can just hear it over and over again in our heads as we go to the movies. We do not need to see it with our eyes; we can just picture it on our minds. We just want to say that we saw it. The fact that it's good or bad, that's up to us. That's how it works in life, in politics, in science and religion.  We can't make movies; movies have to be made for us. The best movies ever made are what we make for ourselves. And so you see the movies that are really good, and you think, "Hey! I'm doing that!" and you go and do it, and then you realize, "Wow! I did that! I actually did that!" That's what it is, really. We make the movies we want to watch. We're the ones who decide what the movies are about and how they should be told. We've made up our minds what they are.  a friend of mine used to say, "Never go to a movie if you can't see yourself in it." And it's true! And the other thing is, we can't help it. What movies make us see isn't what we want them to make us feel. It's not what we'd like them to be. We'd like to see a better world; we want people to be good to each other. But movies don't have to do that.  the movies make you feel like something bad is going on, but it isn't; it's a simple mistake  if you go to see the movie "Thelma & Louise" (1991), there's a scene where a guy runs from the police and gets shot in the head. You may think, 'Oh, my God, what's

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________ What we like: _____________________________ - The writing is really well done. It is a very solid story, and it's very interesting to see how the film starts and what happens to it once it is in the air. - The action scenes are very well made, with some nice effects, and the explosions and gunfights are well executed. - All of the actors are great in this movie, with a lot of them being very likable and believable. - I love that there are so many different versions of the story - it makes it that much more personal. ____________________________ What we don't like: ------------------------------ - I have a really hard time caring for the main villain in this, as his motivations are extremely suspect and I didn't feel that he really fit in with the film that well. - There are a lot less monsters in this than in the previous film, but the lack of them seems to affect the film in a negative way - the film's pacing is just a bit off - I wish the film had a bit more humor and a lot more time spent on the character interaction, since that's what makes the films so great. - As good as the action scenes in this are, they could have been a lot better - there really isn't much of a story to the final fight - it feels like we are just shown one more scene, and that wasn't enough for me - the special effects in this film are a bit too basic. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Verdict: _________________________________________________________________________________ This film is definitely worth watching, but I have to say that it was very much a disappointing film. While the film was very well written, I felt that it didn't really live up to the great expectations that I had for it. I didn'st quite like this film as much as the other two that I've seen, but it's still one of my favorite films that I have ever seen. If you've ever been into sci-fi or fantasy movies, and you're a fan of the Alien series, I really recommend you go watch this movie. It's one of the better sci-fictions that I could have put on my top 10 list. It will definitely make you go "wow", but you'll have a blast with it. ______________________________________________________________ I would rate this film: 7.5/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________  Why is it that I can't have just one good movie?  The first is "A Boy and His Dog". That film is one of the best films I've ever seen, and the film was well-directed and acted. The film was directed by Robert McKee and starred Paul Newman, John Travolta, Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. It's an intense and exciting story about a group of friends who try to find a missing dog. It was also directed by the same man who directed "Annie Hall" and it was another great film.  I could go on and on about films I haven't watched in years, but I'll try to get my point across here. I enjoy watching movies and I want to watch all the good ones, not just the great ones.  the best movie I've seen in a long time is "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story". It's a sports film with the stars of the movie. Michael Jordan and Tim Duncan are the stars and they play a coach and a general manager on the same team. I can watch that movie for hours. I think it's a really good film. The action scenes are awesome and the music in the movie is great.  of course, I have to mention my favorite movie of all time, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull". The story of Indiana Jones and his discovery of the Temple of the Forbidden Eye is a classic that's been talked about since the movie first came out in 1981. It wasn't a very good film, but it's got a lot of good elements that makes it a great movie. The story was a classic and it's well-written. I love how it goes in and out of time and tells the story of an archaeologist who doesn't have much of a moral code. I also love that it was directed to be a trilogy. I've never seen a better movie than the third movie. I was never satisfied with the first two movies and this film took my mind off things and made me care about the characters more than ever. The ending of the first film is also incredible. I won't spoil it, but the ending is a surprise and is a very powerful one. I had forgotten how powerful it was until I saw it again this year. The second favorite movie I have seen is "Batman Begins". It was directed and written by Christopher Nolan. He directed "Inception"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  this is the first time I've written a review in a long time so I've forgotten how good some of these movies are. It's a shame that this review has been overshadowed by the great reviews from other people so I hope you guys enjoy the movie, because the film is really good. If you are interested, here are some of my favorite movies from this year: In a nutshell: The story is simple, it's a young boy named Ben who gets turned into a pig when he has a strange dream that he's in a circus. Ben goes to the circus with his aunt and uncle, but things don't go well there because the animal performers are not what they seem to be. Then the strange girl that Ben had a dream with appears, and she introduces herself as a magician. In the end it turns out that the girl is the real magician. So the boy ends up traveling with her to an old castle with all kinds of funny magical objects that are made out of metal. In a way it's similar to Harry Potter, but much funnier and with much more action, including Ben's pig transformation.  Rating: Movie: 4/5 Plot: 3/5  Characters: 3.5/5 - You get to see Ben in all his human, pig and magician forms. And yes, you get to watch Ben grow into an adult. Also there are some really cute girls (that you just have to watch in the movie) and some pretty awesome fights between the characters. Sound: 5/5 (For a kids movie) Music: 4.5 - I found the music to be quite cute, and it does a great job at setting the mood. I never really got into the songs, and that's probably a good thing. I know they're mostly kids' songs, but I thought they did a good job at making it look like they're kids instead of adults. Story: 4 - I'm not a huge fan of movies like this, but this one is surprisingly well done. I just wish the plot was a bit less complex, because you could have easily gotten to the end of the movie without knowing much of what was going on, and the ending is not that great.  Overall: 4 /5 If you're interested, you can read my other review of the same movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't feel like a review should say "I really liked it", because it's a movie, not a piece of art. However, I do feel that it's important to get into the head of the viewer by talking about what the movie was about, why it was relevant and why the people involved thought it was a good idea to make a movie about it. I'm not trying to downplay any aspect of this movie, but I want to highlight some of the good parts, as well as some of my issues with it. The first is the idea behind the film. I think that it was an amazing idea that was executed brilliantly. There are many problems that can be found with this idea, but at least the idea is innovative and unique. The movie is very lighthearted and entertaining. The music is very catchy and fits with the film quite well. There's just a great feel to the whole thing. While not everything has to be serious or dark, it certainly should not be too lighthearted. The tone, and the fact that it is a comedy is what makes this film very enjoyable. That being said, I found the movie to be slightly too long. It was a bit too much at times. For a comedy, it definitely needed to be shorter. I found myself skipping through it quite a bit. The second thing is that it should have been released in the United States first. The film is a perfect fit for the current climate. That's to say that the film has all the things that American audiences have been craving for. It's a comedy with a bit of a darker twist. A family drama with an extremely light hearted twist. Also, the ending. This is what the film was missing. There were a few small things that the filmmakers did wrong, but the overall experience was great. It is a great way for people to see a film that is still in theaters, and it is the perfect way for the new generation of moviegoers to experience a movie for the first time. It definitely deserves to be seen in theaters. A question I have is what exactly made the film so good? Was it the story, was it the characters? Were the performances all good? Well, the story and the characters definitely made the movie great. The plot is a bit strange, but it doesn't feel overly out of place. It plays off the film's premise and the movie plays off of the plot well. I felt like I knew the

That being said, it was the first movie I ever saw in which I actually felt something, because I'd heard it was a big hit. My wife and I were in the theater when the movie started, and my wife was laughing so hard I thought she was going to pass out, but she laughed through the whole movie anyway.  I saw The Dark Crystal about a decade later (I was still a teenager) and I had no idea what to expect, but it was really bad. It's one of those movies where you'll see it once and know it's a bad movie, and then you'll hear people talk about how it's one the worst movies ever made, and you'll wonder if you were just watching a bad documentary or a bad television movie. (I didn't watch the documentary version, but the television version was pretty bad.)  That being said…I liked the movie. It was silly, fun, and had a fun-loving cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ How much is a good script worth?: ___________ I can't make movies because I'm a writer, not a director. It's not that I don't want to, but it's not how I do it. And it's also a very difficult thing for a writer to get a movie made. It has to be a passion project, that you can't sell. There have been many movies that I wanted to make and just couldn't find financing for, and if I could, I'd like to make them. I'm happy to make any movie for anybody that I think has something good about it.  What's your biggest regret in your career?: ___________________ My biggest regret is I got a really bad reputation for not doing much original, funny, original stuff. And I think that had an effect on the films I did, and that's really what I want to change.  "The thing about film is you can always do something different."  How can you get your script made?: __________________________ It's actually really simple: get the movie made! I know some of you might be saying, "Well, what's he gonna do when the studio says, 'You gotta do the same thing, just the same actors.' Is he gonna be like 'You've got to get rid of all the original cast members!'?" But I don in fact do that on purpose. I actually get the same cast. All I want is the same actor. I just want to do a good job. That's what it takes. You can never just change actors. I never change actors, and I can tell you this: I've been really fortunate. I've always found a good studio that's ready to make a good film, and when they do, it is one of the best experiences of my life. That is not the case for a lot of people. I think the thing about cinema is you have to do something new and fresh. You don't have a lot. The thing about films is you're always in competition with the same guys over and over and it's really hard to break in. The studio gets in bed with the guys who've been making films forever. It really sucks. I don t know what I could say to you that would be more truthful than to say this: the thing with making films is that you're constantly looking for an opportunity to try something new. It might not work and then the film might have

So why do I think you should know about this man named Peter Jackson?  You see, I've been a fan of Peter Jackson since he was doing a short film called The Little Mermaid. It's one of my all-time favorite films, and I know many others have enjoyed it too. .  "The Little Mermaid" is a true gem that tells the story of the mermaid Ariel who falls in love with a human boy, and sets out to find him after he runs away from home. I was a big fan of this movie because I saw it on a very early VHS tape that I bought at a movie rental place, and at the time, I had absolutely no idea who Peter Jackson was or what he was about to make with his next movie. That said, I did watch the film very briefly and had a lot of fun doing so, so I wasn't completely ignorant of the man's talent. Somewhere along the line, though, I decided that I was going to go see every movie directed by Peter Jackson. For those of you who are interested in my story, it was back in the early 2000s, and Jackson had just made "Lord of the Rings." "Mulholland Dr." came out a couple of years later and I was very excited by this movie. "Mulho" was a very unique movie that I felt represented Jackson's strengths as a director as well as his love for the material that he was shooting. It had a very good cast and interesting visuals, so it was the kind of movie that Jackson really could have a lot more of. As the years passed, Jackson kept doing even more original films, making more movies that he could probably do justice to with a small team. And now we have "The Hobbit" trilogy. I'm not going to lie, I am kind of disappointed that it's not "Lord

Fletcher. A Night of the Movies was published in 1990, and this sequel was published on September 3rd, 1993, in an edition of 100. A Good Morning and a Bad Morning was published by Del Rey in 2003, and is a sequel to The Devil's Own in Time. It is not listed on the Del Rey website. I believe this was the first book in the series. - A Night And The Movies is a stand-alone novel. * _________________ * * I was a major fan of the Twilight series, and so this story was a big disappointment for me. - I'm not much of a Twilight fan, but this isn't much of an improvement over the other two Twilight books. - If I had to pick between the two of these, I would choose the first Twilight because this was a very good beginning for the series, but for me, I prefer the second. - My favorite character is Luna, and I didn't care for her character development. - The "fairy tale" story of the first two books was great, but there was too much of it. - There was too little explanation as to how the magic works. - Too much of the "what did you know" questions. - Not enough of the mystery. - In one section, there was only one or two pages of story, and it was the last chapter of the book. - Some of the characters were introduced way too early. - Luna is a pretty typical romantic female protagonist, and that was a real turn off for me at first. - It is a little bit dark for my taste, but I don't think it is too far off from reality. - After the second book, it was like a movie, with the characters going on to other adventures. - Despite how much I love the first series, I think the second series is a bit better, especially if you are only reading one book at a time. - Although the second was set several months after the first, the book still felt like it had been written a few years before, and the characters seem a little more developed than in the first.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________.  You can follow me on Twitter @Jasondrake  for more movie news, movie previews, and more. I hope you've enjoyed the film!  If you haven't, I recommend watching it right away. The trailer is a great indication that this is going to be a great movie.   In this post, I've been collecting various statistics about "The Force Awakens" and discussing how they affect each film, from a historical perspective.  The "Force Awakens" poster, for example, was designed by a young Chris Passmore.   As the official poster designer for "Star Wars" in 2012, he also designed "A New Hope" (released in 1977) and "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) and the final "Return of the Jedi" (1983).  Passmore has a degree in film studies, a Masters in film and television production and a Masters of Arts in Visual Arts. He also owns and operates the Star Wars website, www.chrispassmore.com. "The Force" poster by Chris Passmen So, what did Passmore design for "The Last Jedi"?   Passmore created a poster design for the "Force" film, which has been confirmed to be from the upcoming "Last Jedi" film.   His poster is an image of the Resistance Fleet's capital ship, the Supremacy, flying above an ocean.  As you might know, the Resistance has a fleet of ships, called the Resistance ships.  It's not clear what these other ships are or where they are located.  Passmen's poster depicts the Resistance's capital ships, flying over the sea, while a distant planet's shape is represented by a ship.  However, I believe that Passmen had some input in the "Star Trek" film franchise in the late 90's, and may have been involved in some aspects of the "Return Of The Jedi" trilogy, especially "The Return Of The Hatchet".  That is, I feel that his poster is likely a reference to the scene in the final film of the trilogy, which involved the USS Vengeance, the USS Defiant and the USS Saratoga, all of which, were in space at the time of the scene.   If you are wondering if this is a possible connection, consider the fact that "Force Resistance" looks almost identical to the Saratogian ship seen in "Rise Of The Resistance".   "Force Resistance

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a movie you love, and have for many, many years. Rating is from one-to-five stars, based on the rating scale of one to five stars. How to write a review: ______________________________ I'm really happy to see that some film-makers are starting to consider these reviews as an aspect of the film making process rather than simply as a means to get more views.  This approach has been seen with many a movie I've seen over the years (most notably, the great Tobe Hooper's A Midsummer Night's Dream ), but I think it's something that is slowly being accepted.  It's easy to say, "I've seen the movie before and it's better the second time round" or "it's a great movie but I can't understand why people like it more than the first".  But if the second viewing doesn't improve it at all, and even if it makes it worse, then it's not an upgrade.  And the only way this could be improved is if you watched the movie the first time around and loved it because you knew what you were getting.  In order for a film to be a "quality" film, you have to love the first viewing. And that's what film critics do; we love films and try to make the world a better place by analysing what makes them good or bad.   With this in mind, I'm going to be using this column to review some films I've already seen and some that I've not.  As well as giving my opinion on those films, I'll also be writing reviews on some films that are new to me. THE GOOD The first time that I saw John Cassavetes' Blue Velvet was on DVD, when I was five or six.  The movie was not at all what I'd expected, and after the first 30 seconds I didn't even understand what was happening, just that my mother had been murdered.  But after that, I was hooked.  I had a feeling that this movie wasn't going to end well.  The opening scene, as I remember it, had an older woman being strangled by her son, and the son taking over her life by killing her boss and the police chief.  This scene played over and over again in my mind, and by the time I reached the end of the movie I was completely hooked.   As I went to

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ About me ___________ Why should I read your book? _____________ When do you send it? __________________________________________________ I understand that this is a big deal to you, and I respect that. It is my responsibility to make sure your project is a success. I have taken the time to read your project, and your project's progress. I want your project to succeed, and this is how you will get there. There are no short cuts to getting your movie made. I hope this letter makes you feel like I respect you and your work enough to let you know that I've read your draft, and it's exactly what I want in a movie. The one thing I want you to know about me, and you're probably already starting to guess, is that I'm not a fan of violence. I'm a little bit hard on myself because I have a really violent past, which is why my wife and I have had two kids now. I was raised in a violent household, and my first film was a gangster movie. But as far as violent films go, I'm okay with most of the genre films from the 80s, the 1990s, and even the 2000s. I love those movies, but I'm pretty much a horror/comedy type of guy. I don't really get the appeal of comic books, or action/thriller movies, or anything. But movies? I do. I enjoy seeing them. The kind of movies I enjoy are the ones where you have the characters that are well defined. You have some kind of theme, you have a conflict, and then you have an ending. The character's motivations are all there. The conflict is real. The ending is exciting. The way the characters solve the conflict is realistic. I really like the style of these kinds of movies. I think it makes them more interesting to watch than most other genres of movies, because you don't see the same thing twice. They're not like action movies, where the same action is repeated. This style of film really gives a movie a chance to have its own style. You don't have a character like Bruce Willis, where you repeat the same exact moves over and over again. You get different characters, and different approaches to their goals. It can be funny, it can be dark, and people can relate to different characters. It's really different, and makes a movie that much better than just a mindless run of the mill
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. This is probably one of the best movies of all time. If you're like me you've seen it a hundred times. But like I said, I don't really know what the point of it is. For me, it is always some obscure joke that can't be repeated in the same manner. But the movie was great. I loved this movie. It's one of my favorites. If there is a flaw in this movie, it's that it had no real character. Sure you could say it is all about the main character, but the main characters just come and go and you can never really connect with them. They only make things worse. I don the character to be an idiot who doesn't know what he is doing, but when the movie starts it all makes sense and the movie really comes alive. This movie is very underrated. It is a great watch. If I could give it a 10 I would.

And that's what it is. I was a bit of a movie geek when I was younger and loved a lot of good films, so I was super excited to see this film. , the story is about a young boy who's being bullied and has a terrible reputation. The only thing that can save him is the help of his childhood friend, the beautiful and handsome Josh. The other thing that helps him out is an old school friend, a girl who calls herself the Witch. They start a friendship that is a bit tricky for Josh. But, this is what makes it so interesting. This movie will really make you appreciate the art of making movies. The main character Josh has a lot going on in his head, trying to find who he is and what is right and wrong and what's a little bit real and what isn't. He's just trying to live his life, the same way every other kid his age does, only this is his life and he has to figure out how to deal with his past. I'm not saying that all movies are good because there is a lot wrong with this film and it is way overrated. But that doesn't mean that the story of this movie isn't good. It is very good. Josh is just a good character. I don of him be likeable, but he is. In this movie there are lots of scenes that will make you cry. It's because all the drama is very real and very important. We see a lot about Josh's past and what the world of bullies are and how they deal with people. There is no doubt that Josh has lots of problems, but, as he gets to know

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ I watched this movie because it was on HBO, and was one of the first HBO shows to feature a non-white cast. I was excited to watch it, because as a nonwhite woman and a film student, I am not able to go to movies that have non-whites as main characters or to watch movies about people like me. This movie is amazing in a lot of ways. It has an amazing story, excellent performances, a diverse cast of characters, an excellent soundtrack and a storyline that's not a simple one about a man coming home to his wife. It also manages to be a pretty funny movie, with a strong comedic aspect. I think that this is a pretty safe movie for a young girl to watch. It's actually very similar to the classic film Mrs. Doubtfire, except with a great female lead. It will be interesting to see how this film is received in the future.

Although it is a little long for my tastes, I really enjoyed it.

So this was a really good film. I think it was also really successful as a film.   Although the song was not that good, but that is not the point, it is what is on the soundtrack that was so good. For me it was the violin, and the music.   "Innocent Love" is an amazing song. I will never forget the feeling that went through my head when I heard that song.  .   on a side note, I read that the director was the producer of a movie called "In the Night Garden" with the same name. This movie is about the same topic as "Innisijdskap", but there are some other similarities. It's a really cool movie with the most amazing song of all.I always liked Sigur Ri´s films and I'm looking forward to his next film.I think it will be very good and I hope it'll be released in the near future.I'm glad that the movie is already released as well. I always enjoyed watching it as well as listening to it. I've never been a big fan of the violin part, but the music in the background is very good.I'll give it a 5.5 out of 5.I guess that it is because it was a movie. But that is also not really a bad thing, because this movie is very much a soundtrack to a film, and if you are going to watch a movie it's a good idea to listen to a soundtrack too.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  __________________________________________  In all honesty, most of the time I see the people who are complaining on the Internet about this movie are just so darn negative, as if the makers and the actors themselves are to blame for making this film. But I do think that a lot of that negativity is from the same people who complain about everything in movies. They don't know any better.  Now I don't mean to criticize. I am a fan of the genre as I was a huge Star Trek fan growing up. But this film is just not that good. , for example, I would give a 4 star review to this film and if it was all about the plot, I think it would have a much better ending. . But all of those things don't matter. It's not the plot that made me not like this film, it's the acting. It doesn't feel natural at all. I mean, the way the actors did the motion capture and the physicality of it all, it was almost as if they never worked out a way to do that. It was just too stiff and unnatural. I don;t think this film should be taken lightly. It is probably one of the most flawed films I've seen in a long time. It felt as if it could have been better and was just done too damn poorly, but it is still a very enjoyable and fun action adventure. I give this a D-.  But to the people complaining about the script? Get a grip and stop being so negative. A great script is important to any successful film, especially if you're going to be directing. But if the script is bad, it makes the film a total fail and a waste of time to be honest. I understand this movie is going to get some good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, so maybe those people will come around and understand my review. But at this point it seems like everyone wants to have a negative opinion on this movie without reading the actual screenplay, which makes the script less of a "gut" reaction and more of a personal reaction.  I think I mentioned in the synopsis that it is a sequel and that is why it is such a problem. But it's not really a sequel because the original movie didn't really have any sequels. The original movie was about a guy and his buddy that found themselves in a similar situation as we did. It just had the premise of a man and his friend

Their relationship is based on the notion that she is beautiful, but he is attracted to other women. He believes they can be together until he finds a woman to be in his own category, which happens to be the beautiful woman he was once in love with. It is not quite clear what will happen between the two. (I do not have a problem with this because the man is attractive to women and in his heart he is in love.)  The sex is brief and briefer when it is not an act of love. There is some nudity during sex, which has not been emphasized since the films of the 80s. The acting has been terrific. There was no need for a second take. The movie is funny and very poignant. It has no real plot, but it is a powerful emotional experience for both men and women. . :I have watched this film a number of times in theaters, usually with a number or two of friends. I do recommend it for older teens, teens, and 20-somethings. It should also be seen by women, because this is an exploration of love and sexual experiences that have not been explored. In the film, Wiig plays a woman named Jane, and Damon plays a man named Michael. In one scene,

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________  "A man may be able to move mountains but he can't move a movie theater." - George Carlin  Dennis H.  New York  2003-02-20 02:28:00 The movie is really entertaining and funny, but it doesn't really have any action. The main character is the only one to actually make any good decisions in this movie. All of the other characters are just as good as the main character...a bunch of characters trying to get the girl (the titular "girl" in this case), but they are all just as incompetent and stupid as the movie main character. It isn't just the main, but a bunch of other guys who are all acting the same as the guy that's the main guy. The women are only in this for the short time they get involved in the plot, and it's clear that they were cast because they were hot. The guy that is the main isn't the only guy in this show, and the movie is actually a remake of a television show that was cancelled a long time ago. So that makes this movie even more ridiculous. It's about time someone made a comedy movie that is actually good. This movie isn't.  tobertson  United States  2002-01-16 11:36:59 I've seen that the movie was a remake. The one that was popular on tv was that one. I can say with confidence that the remake was just as lame.  in the dark  North America  2005-03-22 21:02:27 The movie was an okay movie. The girl was hot, but her story lacked depth. I could have done without the acting from some of the others, but overall the movie had great story lines and was a great character study. . I do not understand the reviewer's claim of the movie being an remake. I think it was based on a tv show (which was actually a tv movie, I think), with the same director and some of those characters. I would recommend this movie as a good watch, especially if you're a fan of that show and have some free time. I also would recommend watching it in the evening, as it gets very dark towards the end and it would be better to stay on that side.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. If you can't, get out of the movie business and go write a good review for a book, make it a movie review, or just tell a friend. It's the only thing you ever do in your life that's going to have a positive effect on anyone else's life. Don't think that a "good review" of a bad movie is going to change that movie, but instead, make a positive comment on what made the movie "good." This will get the most attention from the film's producer and possibly the director and star.  5. Go see a movie with your friend/brother-in-law. If it's a small, intimate movie, and your brother-in -law/friend won't get in, then you should have your friend bring you. A small, non-threatening movie is a great place to make friends. A movie that will put you in front of your family and friends for a day, not just one for a weekend. You can't expect to make the best friend you ever had if you don't go to a movie, so go out of your way to make it happen. . I used to take my family to movies for a couple of reasons: 1. To have fun. The first movie we went to was the first day of my husband's first day at college, the first movie I had ever seen. We went to see a play, not because it was the play that we were all going to go see, but because we wanted to have fun with our little family. We wanted to see movies with family that we couldn't be in. We also wanted to watch something else besides TV. 2. My mom loved the first Harry Potter movie. I knew my mom was a huge fan of the books and that she loved the movies. So when I told my brother- in-law I was going to a midnight showing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, he said I should bring a movie mat, because that was the best time to sit down and watch it with mom. That was the night we first saw the Harry Potter books. That night was the beginning of our love of movies. We sat in a dark room watching the movie, then we all got into bed and watched the movie. That's how we all met. Our mother would bring us to movies. I have watched the Harry potter movies, and she has watched them with us many times

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________  A couple of weeks ago, after reading the movie review I wrote about "The King's Speech" I was reminded how good I think it is. I've just spent a week watching it again and loving it all over again. So to celebrate the 25th anniversary of "The Sound of Music," I thought I'd add my thoughts on it.   Let's start with the story. The opening sequence of the film, set in a castle in Austria, is a beautiful shot of the mountains on a clear, crisp summer day. But then the camera zooms out to show the countryside and the ruins of the former castle. The scenery is gorgeous, but the movie itself is about more than beautiful scenery.   of the ruins, the story really kicks into high gear as Count von Trapp (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his servant, the Duke (Mads Mikkelsen), are sent out to find a wife for the prince, the heir to the throne. Von Trapp's mission to find his wife is complicated by the fact that the heir is having a difficult time growing up, as he is also suffering from a terrible disease that will kill him in just a few years.   and it's hard not to sympathize with von Trapps' plight. It's the way von Trappy spends the early part of the movie that really makes the film worth watching. While he's searching for the heir, the prince is in school and he's learning to cope with his illness. Von Strupps gets to know the prince well during his first few weeks in school, and while he doesn't appear to be too keen on him, he also shows him compassion and is very patient. Eventually, he gets a very funny line, "The prince is my son! My son!" when he asks the prince about the disease.   the plot goes pretty much like this for the next 100% of the time. But there are some surprises along the way. There's a scene where the prince gets into a fight with a bully and Von Trappy tries to restrain him, but he is thrown to the floor and is trampled to death. This seems like a pretty gruesome murder, and Von Strupp's reaction when he hears it is one of pure horror. I found that particularly creepy, and I loved how that scene added a bit of life to the otherwise flat plot. I liked it so much that when I was finished with the film (which I didn

Write a positive review about a good movie:   How to make a good short film:   3. Don't Make the movie for money  Don't try to make money off of your short film. There are people out there who would pay for your movie just to get the name in the credits. I think your first goal should be to show that you have talent, not make money. I remember watching a documentary once and a friend said "I am just happy that they put my name in." If you want to make your movie into a commercial, you will need an actor and a director. A lot of times people are just looking to make some money. When I first got into filmmaking, I made "Fist Fight" because I wanted to put the name of my high school in it. I didn't think anyone would pay to see a high school movie. But people did. People bought tickets and bought merchandise. There was a lot of profit. So make sure you have an idea for a film that you want people to pay money for.  4. Never Make a Movie for Money  Another movie I made was "Tired and Tired". This is a movie that I really liked. The movie was a real story of a man who had been in a fight in a parking lot and had his leg broken. I had been doing a lot more commercials and was looking to work on a big project with a director who is really good. But the director decided to go with another director instead of working with me. I thought it was a good idea to have my own studio and make a sequel. The studio got wind of the movie and was interested. They wanted a lot for it to be a success and they thought I would make it easy for them. They told me how much they would like to see it and I would have to do the movie on the cheap. They made it impossible for me to make the movie. They would not pay the actors what they were asking and wouldn't even give me a budget for the movie so that we could do the stunt scenes with a stuntman on a scooter. I spent four months on a movie which was very bad, and never did a good job on the movie because they wouldn't pay for it. This experience was really hard. I learned a lot, but it was not a good experience because they didn't pay me what I was supposed to be paid. It was never a good lesson because I learned it the

My expectations were low, because I'm so used to the formulaic, predictable fare of the "top 10" list, that I hadn't really been expecting a ton of quality films this time around.  in 2016, I'm pleased to report that my expectations have definitely been met!

I don't usually take on a lot of movies, but with the amazing amount of films this season I thought that it was just a great time to revisit a lot. I can definitely say that there is a lot more quality films coming out this year.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do I really have to write a review for a bad movie? _________ I don't think I could make it up. I was actually at a bar a few nights ago, and I saw this film that was all about a guy who is a robot and he goes into a bar and says, "Hey! I'm not really a man. I'm a machine. What do you want?" And they say, "We're going to have some fun tonight!" And he says, OK. And he goes out and plays the piano. And then he sees another robot and the other robot turns and he's gonna kill him but the other guy runs and jumps on his chest, and the robot gets all scared and runs away. And the other person says, I'm sorry. I really don't know what to say. But I'm going to tell you this. It's not a robot. It is me. (Laughter) The next week, there's a movie. I saw it. The guy's name is Chris. He said, "What's it about?" And I said, it's about this guy, and he says he's a robot, and you know, the film's really good. But he goes, what is this about, then? (Loud laughter) I said it's, well, it is about a robot that is an actor. (loud laughter, applause) "That's a nice name." "What does it mean?" I said there's three robots. They all have different jobs. The one who plays the keyboard plays the guitar, and his job is to get people to pay attention to him. The robot who plays guitar and goes to the bar and sings songs goes to see the bar. The other one, he just sits there and sings. And I guess he's just really good, you know? He sings like nobody's listening. The two other robots, the one who dances and the one that plays the bass goes to a club. They've all got different jobs and, you see, there are three kinds of robots in this movie. The robots are all trying to get into a movie theater. They're all trying not to have to watch this film and not to die. One of the robots just wants to have sex with some girl, and they're all going to see a film and then they're going up to this girl who's a real movie star and they'll all watch her movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  3. Make sure you're in the film, not in the crowd: _________________________.  4. Be respectful to the director: ____________________________________.  The key to a good director is having a good sense of humor. If your attitude is "If this is the way it's supposed to be, then I don't care," it's very likely that you won't work with this director. When I worked with this guy, I was constantly joking with him, asking him how he was and generally making sure that I was part of the movie. I even called out the lines as he was saying them. When he was directing a scene, he didn't give any direction, but he kept up his "How are you doing?" vibe. And what a great scene it was. You know how you go into a movie and there's a character, and you just have to root for him? This guy had a guy. That character was called "Jack" and he was a guy who was an alcoholic. The movie takes place in a hospital, and he's the one who manages all the medicine that is given to the other patients. He was a smart, strong guy, and the fact that he's an alcoholic is very funny, but you have to wonder if the way he gets into his drunk behavior is the result of his own issues. It turns out that Jack's mother was a crack-addicted prostitute and his father had been an abusive drunk. All of a sudden, he's a guy whose job it is to care for and guide his father. He's the only character who is in control of his life. He also happens to be a pretty good doctor. The movie starts off with Jack driving his father around in the car because he doesn't trust him. This leads to one of the most memorable moments in cinematic history, which is the scene where Jack gets his hands stuck in his dad's car door. (If you've ever watched the scene with Dustin Hoffman's character in "The Graduate" where he gets his fingers stuck in the door, then you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.) And it all ends with him letting his dad off the hook. Jack ends up taking over his father's practice, and eventually, he saves his father from his own problems. This was the only time that I ever thought that I might have found a good character in a movie. What's great about this movie is

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________I've had the chance to see both the movies of 'Logan', which were released together, and the second one, which I haven't seen yet. I have to admit that Logan is not as bad as I originally thought it was.I'm not a big fan of Hugh Jackman. I can't wait for the new movie to come out. I will be watching it again in a few days. I'm also quite excited about 'Lion'. The movie looks and feels very impressive. I just don't see Jackman playing this role that well. In my opinion, Logan is a better movie than Logan. And I can safely say that 'Lone Survivor' is the best movie of 2014 so far.

I didn't really like the story at all and that is why I'm giving it just one star. I felt that it was too long. And then, there were a lot that were just a waste of time. The plot was just too confusing, and the main character, who was supposed to be the main hero, was also just a little too whiny. I was very disappointed with this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The first time you watch a film, even if the words don't really come to you right away, you know that there is going to be some value to it. You think, "this film is going down the right path", and the value you derive from the movie is just that: derived from the story. And for a lot of filmmakers, when a film fails to deliver, it's not a failure, because you have a story that will take you there. And once you arrive at the destination, the movie takes you there, and the ride is all the more satisfying because you got to know the characters in your movie and how they are going to interact. But if you've been working on a movie, that's probably been years in the making, and you didn't get all of your plot elements into one go (or in one film), it's going to feel like there's a disconnect in the storytelling. You won't be able to tell if there is an underlying problem with the story itself, or the fact that you haven't been able to put all of the elements together into one coherent, cohesive, meaningful movie yet. There's a difference. So let's examine a couple of examples of how that can happen. The first example is a classic example: when you are making a movie about people who have been in the military, and your main character is an ex-military guy who wants to reenlist and get back into the fray, and his ex-wife is the military woman in town who loves him and wants to stay at home. So there's the basic story, and as you would expect, the characters don't get along, and it's all very dramatic, and there's conflict. But as you go down the road, it becomes increasingly difficult to make the film work as a film. When you have an ex who loves you, and who wants you to return home, but also a soldier who wants him dead, how do you reconcile those two ideas? You can't just flip them around like in a sitcom episode. So we went to a different place with the character, and we worked on him for a few months before we decided he was an alcoholic and a junkie, and he wanted to kill himself, and so we said we'll make the story more dramatic, but the movie will be more of a melodrama, and a more light-hearted movie. We changed his voice, and moved his life from his hometown

The Internet can be a little rough at times, but it's really nice to see people who appreciate and appreciate a movie so much, and feel so passionately about it, that they'll tell their friends, or tell the world in the form of a comment or review. I mean, this is my community. The first movie I ever posted on this blog, I was only 13 years old. The most recent film I posted on here, was the one that made me cry. I was watching the movie with my dad (when I wasn't watching it with my mom). He didn't get it, because he was too young to know about it. It's the reason why I like to post my reviews on here. I love to show my dad, how amazing my friends are, and how much I enjoyed the movie. It seems every movie I watch is a great movie, and this is one of the greatest movies I've seen. So, that's the kind of reviews you can expect here, from me, and hopefully, I'll do it. I hope you enjoy it. Until next time. -Zach

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________The Last Temptation of Christ (1998)__________I would be a hypocrite if I didn't try to show appreciation for all things good about movies. I'll try to do this in the same way I did my reviews of good films in the last year: by looking at the pros and cons and how it's done in the movie, but also by taking the perspective of the director, the producer, the actor, and the cinematographer. I've watched several other reviewers try to figure out whether this movie is really a good film or not, and my opinion about it is that I'll never really know.The Last Days of Judas Iscariot (2009)___________It was a great movie, and I loved it. The cast was fantastic. I was completely amazed at how good they were. I thought the director handled it well. It's not exactly the kind of movie you'd imagine a director going for, but the actors did an amazing job. The acting in this movie was also very good, with very different characters and situations. It was an interesting story with a little too many twists and turns, and it was also the most expensive movie I saw in a while. My biggest criticism of this movie has to be that it didn't feel as if it took place entirely in one place, it felt like all the characters and everything that happened in the story took place in different parts of the country. It also felt like it could've been more interesting if there was more time for us to see how everyone felt about the situation they were in. But there was a lot of amazing acting in the film, and if the movie was only about the acting, it would be one of the better movies I've ever seen. A couple of times I felt like something would happen and I'd think, "Oh, okay that was unexpected. I guess we won't be seeing that again." But there were some scenes I had to stop watching because I was so shocked, and that bothered me a lot. It might be one that I'm going to keep an eye out for in the future.Mystery Men (2011)____________The acting was phenomenal in this one, and this was my first time seeing the film. The script was well written and a really well thought-out one. The cinematography was beautiful. The soundtrack was great, and one thing about this movie that kept me from giving it a perfect score is that it seemed as
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________ I don't think the director's name really matters, it really is an actor's job to give good performances. That being said, here is some feedback for a movie I saw a few months ago, "Tangerine." The movie stars Tangerine Dream's Celine Dion, who plays a little girl who gets her own face-lift and is forced into a world of beauty queens, but all the queens are evil (or have dark secrets) and a sadistic teacher (played by Christopher Walken) who wants her to learn how to be beautiful. When the evil queen (played with a lot of subtlety by Madonna) steals Celine's face, Celine has to work to get back in touch with who she is, and that includes her hair. The performances are wonderful, but the movie is a bit on the preachy side. I can see why some people would think it is preachy, especially the teacher. I think it could have been done better, however. I did like the music video in which Madonna was the evil king (with all the evil queens) while the other queens (including Celine and a black actress playing Celine) were the good ones. It was interesting. "TANGERINE" is about an innocent little girl being turned into a beauty queen, but she refuses to become a beauty. The movie is really fun, and a great movie to watch if you are a fan of Celine. I hope to see it again someday. (I haven't seen this movie in a while but it seems to have become popular again).  Rated 4 out of 5 by gilflynn from Love this movie I love this movie and I'm sad this was not longer available in DVD form. I saw it in the theatre at Sundance in 2003, when it was a hit.  From the review I read: "In this dark, erotic, hilarious and beautiful movie, Cressida Cowell as Celine dares to be both a victim and a villain. A beautiful woman's best chance for survival is to keep her long, dark hair, and in the face of the dark forces that want to take it from her, C is able to maintain her dignity, her inner strength and her individuality." It is an excellent movie. The acting is excellent. I thought that after the first few minutes, it seemed like Celine was having fun. I liked the music in the beginning, the movie, and

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________ The Big Short - 4/5 I can't really say much about the movie without spoiling it. It's very good. If you like financial movies and financial analysis, this one will be right up your alley. If not, you might be more inclined to watch the first one. As always, the plot is very simple: A bunch of guys from the start-up world (who have no idea how things work) are trying to make their big short. The first two movies focused on how hard it is to make a short, while this movie looks at the process. The characters are relatable and the story is interesting. There's also a twist at the end. _________________________________________________________ The Martian - 4.5/5 The Martian by Andy Weir is a brilliant read. It is an easy read and I think you should read it before you watch the movie. The Martian is a sci-fi thriller about a man stranded alone on Mars with nothing. He has to rely on others to survive and it's all very well-written. I thought that the first half of the movie was extremely well done. However, the second half of it is not quite as good. The story about how the story changes after Mark Watney dies and the different ways that he reacts to the loss of his crewmate was very well done and it really added to the drama of the character. It was also well acted and the movie didn't have a bad ending. The acting is great throughout the entire movie and I thought the actors did a great job. ____________________________ The Revenant - 4 / 5 The Revenant was incredible. I loved everything about it. I found the characters to be very real. The visuals, the cinematography, the actors... everything about the film was great. I love the setting and I also love that this is an exploration of revenge. This movie is great. You can't beat it for action, great acting, story and cinematography. I cannot recommend this movie enough. _________________________________________________________________ Sicario - 4 out of 5 I love that the movie takes place in Mexico.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ The following review is my opinion about the movie. It is based on my personal opinion and I try to take into account other points of view. I may be completely wrong, but you should still read it! Also, if you enjoyed this movie, and you feel like I did, then do follow my blog (on the right), so I can thank you in the comment section. I try my best to make a review more informative, and also, I try not to write the same exact review twice. It's probably one of the most difficult reviews in the movie-watching business, but I hope it's worth it. 1/10 Pros: -The character development was superb. Every character was well-realized and developed for the greater good. There was an original story that didn't try to copy any other movie out there. -The action scenes were extremely well-made. -I liked the soundtrack and cinematography. I also think the acting was excellent. -There was a lot of humor throughout. Cons: -There is a ton of violence in the film. I personally don't find that it bothers me. There's a reason that people like watching violent movies. -This movie has too much of it. It really makes me want to stop watching. Overall, I'm not sure if this is the best movie of the year, but it certainly is one of my favorites. I give it a 7/10.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It wasn't bad" or "It was good" or even "It just wasn't me." 2)  Do not let anyone get away with saying "That movie sucks" or, worse, "I don't care if you love it." The reason people say this is not because they hate you or your opinions (although, if you can't be cool about that, perhaps you are doing it wrong). The reasons are twofold: 1) If you can get away saying that your movie sucks, you can avoid saying that anything else you do sucks. 2. By saying that something sucks, it puts the rest of us in the same boat and that makes us feel bad for being on that boat. 3)   As I mentioned earlier, if people can get a little bit of money for their movie or a bit of free publicity, there is less incentive for them to make anything better. 4) You are being labeled as a "hater." If people can't make money and they keep blaming it on others for not making money, they start to label you as a Hater. 5) By saying something is bad, it's easy to justify it. If you want to learn how to be cool with the people who do not care about you and your opinions, here is a simple example of why they don't. You can be cool by saying, "It wasn It wasn 't bad", but in my experience, it is the easiest thing to say. If it wasn't that bad then why are people complaining? You can be a better movie critic by being nice, though. The best way to be a good person is to be polite and honest. This means you don't try to make people like you or justify your opinion. You just show up. It's not that complicated. There are a few ways you can show up: 1) Be nice. Be yourself. Treat people with respect and show them that you respect them. Show them you're a nice person. That doesn't mean that you're going to start a war, but it does mean that if you want people to like you, you've got to act nice. That's what I do. When I first started watching movies, I was a jerk. Now that I'm older, I act nice to the people around me and I don't have to be rude. It's not easy, but

Bad: The way someone acts, the way they speak, their body language, their clothes. -The way you say that word "the"  -How you say the "h" sound  The point is, you should only add adjectives that are relevant to a situation. If you use adjectives like "good", "good looking", "cute" or "sexy", you're really saying that these characters are nice, pretty, or attractive. (And of course, if you're talking about bad movies, then you might as well just go with the generic "bad" adjectives.)  What you should actually talk about  (1) Situation  –The character's emotions at the moment of the scene. . The situation should be the focus of your sentence, not just the action.  I.e.  is this a bad scene?  Is this a good scene? –Do you think the guy who got knocked up really enjoyed it?  the guy's reaction to the situation  .   2) Mood  Do you like the scene?

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________   "When the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea" (1951)  by Charles A. Evans  The Devil and The Deep Blue, the most famous story of the deep sea, is an almost-tragic tale about a young boy who makes a desperate attempt to save the world by setting the depths of the ocean an immense aquarium, and his search for a mermaid to rescue. In the process, he sets himself on a perilous journey of discovery, in which he encounters the deep-sea sharks, the sea-serpents and the many other monsters of the sea, not to mention the mysterious and highly mystical creatures of the oceans themselves.  "The film was a classic of the time, and I was excited to get in touch with its creator, Charles Evans, and tell him how I felt about his movie," says Peter Jones. "After a long day at the office, I stumbled across his website on a whim. I couldn't believe it - he was the director of The Devil and He's Back! The Deep Sea Adventures, which I'd seen and loved. A few days later I was chatting to him and his wife, Elizabeth, at a film festival, and then on to their wonderful son, and together we made a documentary for BBC's The Story of the Deep. It's a fascinating film - you just have to look at it."  What made you start off with the story of a boy who wants to make a difference to the ocean?  Charles: "My brother was a marine biologist and I have always been interested in marine biology and deep-diving in particular. My interest in the subject stems from a very personal place. When I was younger I worked in the fishing industry, but it's not like that any more. I now work as a full-time lecturer in marine and deep diving, and have many more years of experience than I did at my age. I was working as a fisheries science officer with the Ministry of Fisheries in a small South East coastal fishing village for five years before I took on this full- time course, but at that time I wasn't doing anything remotely scientific. So that was a real turning point in my life, for me, and when I heard about the project I thought 'I don't know whether I can go down that route!' At that point in time I didn't even know whether it was scientifically possible to dive so deep in the sea. So

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ I'm sure everyone remembers the movie "Logan". It was a pretty good film, but it was kind of hard for me to watch as a movie lover because it had an awful script.  And so I found myself really wanting to get a copy of it to watch on my computer.  The second movie I want to share is the one that caused me to fall in love with cinema.  This movie was "The Terminator".  I've always been a fan of the movies in the first series and have loved the new movie "Terminator 2" as well.  But this movie I think really took the series to another level.  It was truly one of the best movies ever made.   It got me addicted to the franchise and I've never looked at a Terminator movie the same way again.  I'm not sure if it's a result of the fact that I've been watching the new movies with some of my friends, or if it has something to do with the fact I just got out of the military and got to do some things on my own.  The main character of the movie was John Connor. He was a former Marine and he was searching for the meaning of life, as he'd seen some signs of an "inhuman" presence in the world and was determined to find it. So he joined up with a group of other people who shared his beliefs and started going out and trying to eliminate those that were causing them to question their existence.  For some reason, in the movie I found John Connor was one of my favorite characters. I mean, it was the first time I had seen a guy who looked like that on screen.  And he was just so damn badass. I loved how John Connor, who seemed to be a bit of a nerd in the beginning, came out of it and was willing to give his life for the cause.  There were moments when the world seemed to end and I was wondering what would happen to John Connor and his wife, Linda.  Then, everything changed.  At the end of the first movie, the villain, Skynet, made an appearance and John Connor met a new companion: Sarah Connor.  Sarah was a human who had been taken from her own people and was working for Skynets to create an army of killer robots.  Now, in order to defeat Skynetric, John had to bring Sarah back to humanity. I thought that was

The most common mistake I see when reading the script is a lack of character development. There is so much going on that we don't get a chance to really know who is good, who is bad, who makes decisions, and who acts and reacts. What could be a powerful idea to a director is lost. I think we get caught up in the idea of what we think the main characters should be like, instead of trying to think of what might make them interesting.  the thing is that a great script has a very clear idea of who the character is. Hang on, what is a good idea about someone? In the screenplay, we don' t get a good character idea in my opinion, except for the lead character. I usually think of a good characters first and think of things that relate to them. Maybe we can talk about what we could write in a scene that is relevant to the character. I think you can write a great scene. It might be an example, like the moment where he realizes he might have been making a mistake. Or we could talk about something important that happened in the first act and what could happen later on. We can write anything. A scene can be a small, an important, a crazy, whatever, that will have a bigger impact later on in the movie. I just think you should be writing the scene, not what's happening inside the character's head. One of the most powerful things I know about the movies is that they usually don't have a set number of beats, but each scene has a certain amount of action and a certain number of words. I believe that the script should have a certain structure. For example, one scene could have three beats, one could have five beats, and one could even have twenty or thirty. The best way to do this is to try to think about how you would break it up and what your structure would look like. I also believe that you should also have a goal in mind for each scene. What is your end goal? 5. The best scripts have two things in common, they are: A good structure and they are a

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________. ________.  Reviews are the first time that a movie is evaluated and they also have the largest audience. People who read reviews about a movie will be a bit familiar with the movie. For the reviewer, they will have the impression that the film is a great movie. A movie that has only one star will be the most dreaded movie for a reviewer. These are the movies that were made for a low budget and which can't be made again.  As you know that the movie will not receive a bad rating for no reason. The movie will get a few 1/2 and 1 stars, but not many. The reason why they will get less reviews than a high-budget movie is because the audience for low-budget movies has a higher level of knowledge and they are more selective. You can't have a 3 star movie in every theater. , this is one of the few 3 stars that has a really good film. This is a classic action thriller that has been re-edited into a modern 3D version. The plot is a lot like, except that they took out the chase scene.  and all have some nice action. The biggest difference between the two is thatis made by an unknown director and that all the actors are great. If the audience knows who the actors in this movie are, they can be very forgiving of the bad movie. If you are a fan of the original and you want to watch it in 3D, I recommend you take it to your local theater to experience the special effects. A remake ofis a good idea for a modern audience. But don't expect an action movie from a great actor. The story is one dimensional and doesn't interest the audience. I think that the remake should be released as a modern action thriller rather than a remake. If it was released as the remake, the 3D might have made it better.   3. Do you know what you want your film to be?  If you are thinking of writing your film but you do not know what it should be, you are probably doing it wrong. You should try to figure out the film you want before you start. You will get much better results if you have an idea of what you are trying to make. If your film is made of scenes from a movie you watched, then you have a problem because the scene is still relevant and the audience will recognize it from the movie you have watched. If, however,

"Israel and the world are at a turning point. It is the time to turn the page."  In recent months, several film festivals in Europe have canceled screenings of the films. In March, the Jerusalem Film Festival announced it had received more than 50,000 complaints in three days and was considering canceling the rest of its program. In January, in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks, Germany banned the movie. In the U.S., the director of the Jerusalem Documentary Festival, Lenny Abrahamson, canceled a screening of The Act of Killing on grounds that it was "controversial and potentially dangerous." The Jerusalem Cinematheque also decided to drop the film. In December, the film's distributor, Open Road Films, decided not to release the film in Germany and the U, because it was a "possible violation" of anti-terror laws.  Some of these decisions were made after pressure from Israel and the European Union, whose officials say they have been seeking ways to prevent the film from being screened. Last week, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nachshon condemned the decision to cancel screenings of The Killing of the Innocents as a "gross breach" of freedom of expression. , which will open Friday in the U., will be one of the most watched documentaries of 2015. In a statement last week, the filmmaker, Joshua Oppenheimer, said that the festival had refused to allow screenings in light of what he described as "grave concerns about its controversial content." Oppenheim has defended his movie, claiming that while it contains scenes of torture and murders, it is a story about the "true heroism" of Palestinians.  to be shown in France in April, and in some 50 other countries.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  "I'm never going to forget the feeling of being on the first flight back to Washington, D.C. from the film festival in Cannes. You think you are going to fly up and down for six months, but the more you sit, the more and more your body goes through this transition, a gradual, painful transformation of a very small body, a body that seems to have given up all hope of ever getting up again. And that's what I remember. Because when you come off the plane and you know you are alive and in the body you had intended to stay in all along, and you're on the plane on your way to New York to do the things you planned to do, and everybody looks at you with such a mixture of respect and awe and amazement, you suddenly realize, in those first moments that you are the most ordinary person ever born."
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ I watched this movie for the first time on Netflix recently, and I was just amazed at how well it worked as a drama! It's not your typical horror movie, it's not cheesy, and it's definitely not campy. The plot follows a young man named James (Ben Mendelsohn) who has been a victim of multiple crimes. When a series of odd deaths start appearing on his doorstep, James starts to wonder if something is wrong with his new house, and the mysterious murders start to get closer to home. If you're the type of person who likes watching horror, then you'll definitely want to check this one out! It also has a great cast, some great performances, and a very unique setting, which makes it an easy recommendation. ___________________________________________________________________________________ This review was first published on: January 26, 2017 by: Gaby@b-films.com   This movie stars Ben MendelSohn as James and Gwenyth Paltrow as the sexy detective. I've never seen this before, so I don't know too much about it. I watched the trailer for it and it looks like a classic, but I don�t know if that's why I like it. It's just a fun movie to watch, but maybe that's enough to get me to check it out.   ____________________________________________________________________________ This movie is part of the �Dark Places� Series, which is a series that I really enjoyed. In this movie, a young couple moves into a house and the main character is a house guest. His life changes when his new home is plagued with odd events, murders, and more.   to make the review shorter, this is a fun, good horror movie that you can see for yourself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Don't like a movie that you have seen or even heard of. It is not a requirement for any good review to include the name of the director and the name and title of the film.  Instead I will only address whether or not the film is good or bad.  If you do like a film you will probably find an intelligent, entertaining, and interesting way of talking about it.    If the film was terrible, you will be talking about the movie in the same fashion as if it was an insult.  So don't be afraid to talk about the film in a way that won't make you seem like an idiot.

Best Regards, The Movie Critic Team  If you are a film reviewer, you probably have heard of the term "A/A," which stands for "Academic/Aware." That is, if a movie is good, you won't see the "A" until you have finished it and give the movie a rating. The idea is that the audience gets the chance to evaluate the movie before they pass judgment on it. However, this is an outdated way of evaluating films, and the "accuracy" of the film is usually determined by the number of people who have given the movie an A.  A/AVI is similar in that the A is calculated from the average of the audience's rating. This makes the "AV" the average "A," but it's calculated differently. Instead of dividing the audience rating by five to get the average, the audience is divided by 100 and the result is multiplied by 10. So if the audience rated a film a "C" but gave it an A rating, the A would be multiplied by 100.  of the movie will give you the "average" of all the audience members' ratings. That average is what makes you an A/AVID. ...  So what does all of that have to do with A/A? Let's take a look at one of the most critically acclaimed movies of the past decade. If you guessed "Lincoln," you're right. But that movie doesn't just get an A, it's one of A/ASA (Accurate Score Above Average) films of all time. The audience gave this film an A (or more than an A) that has not been matched since.  "Lions for Lambs" won awards from the Oscars, the Golden Globes, and numerous other film festivals. And it's not just the critics that are giving it such a high rating. Audiences love it, too. , "Lambeth," "Crazy Heart," "Gangs of New York," and many other

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ [i]If you're going to do it, why the fuck not do it right?[/i] [quote=Kermit_the_Frog]Why is Kermit the Frog in a bad movie?[/quote] [i](Because he's not in a good film, he's in a film about the birth of a frog, and that's what you do in a movie about the first generation of frogs. Frogs are great. They're not really people, they're not like us. But they're cool.)[/i][quote=Randy_Jerk]I liked the film because the acting was great. I loved that the kid was so well-drawn, and he was funny and full of good ideas and really fun to watch. And the scene where it looked like the kid died and was buried by the frog, it was so clever and so funny and I laughed out loud at the end.[/quote] I laughed so hard at the ending, when they all go to the graveyard to look for the frog and find that the boy is still alive but is being held prisoner by the dead frog. [i][url=http://youtu.be/qVkf-Nqz7V4]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVhMtq_WQ5w[/url][/i] There's just something so...so good about it that I kept going back and going, "It must be all over now, the frog is in his grave, I'm done, I don't have time for this shit."[/i] I also enjoyed the film's pacing. It was paced really well, and when it needed to be. It didn't overstay its welcome, and it was easy to follow, but it wasn't at all overwhelming. [quote]I like the frogs in the movie. They all look really cute and they have this little personality. They even make sense.[/i][/quote] The frogs were well-done, I liked the way they were animated. I enjoyed the scene with the frogs being buried and being held captive. I also liked the ending. [url= http://youtu:8I-8m6t-hcY ]http://i.ytimg.com.com thefavicon.org/zM3m/3i/zMX2m9qM4M/0.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________ Reviewed by Peter B. from New Jersey on 3/17/2014 A movie about a guy who likes sex, and having sex, in his home town. He gets his mom to go with him on a weekend and the trip goes terribly. He spends the day in bed, alone, masturbating to his wife. After that is over, she goes to go watch a movie with some friends. She walks in on him jerking off to her and her friends. It makes her very embarrassed, and so she leaves. A short while later, he's alone, so he starts to masturbate to her again. Then he starts talking to her about how she should go and have sex with him. It's clear she is interested and he has a girlfriend. Then she leaves to go home, and then he starts jerking to her at the end of the movie. He talks about how if he could have sex whenever he wanted, he would. He also talks about the time he fucked his parents. He says that his dad didn't care for it and then his mom was raped. So he decided that he should never have sex again and he would marry his mom. It was really good and funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ About the movie: A group of college students go to a party that's being thrown by the movie's main character. At the party, the party goes bad and there is a fight. The students don't realize that there is someone else, a man who just died and is now haunting them. I don't know that this was my favourite scene of the movie. I liked the way it was done, the idea of what happened. But it's a little annoying to watch it happen.  The Movie (3/5):  I don't mind a bad movie. There's so many of them out there, I'd rather watch one bad movie than a hundred mediocre movies. However, this movie doesn't exactly give me that "bad movie" vibe. Instead it's pretty fun, and not exactly my favourite kind of film. I think it was a better movie than some of the movies I've seen so far in this anthology. There were some really cool elements in this movie, and it could have had a little more action. It had a lot of ideas about being a young college student, and having some sort of super power. But other than that it wasn't really memorable or anything, but that's kind of the point. That's why I thought it was fun. Maybe next time I'll check this movie out and maybe I'll like it better. .    A Movie I Saw in 2015 – The Night of The Living Dead  .   .
