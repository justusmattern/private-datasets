Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ I found this book, "The Art of the Deal", to be highly informative and entertaining, while also having a surprising amount of useful information. I found it to be an important read to understand the business of business, and how it's different from what most people think, as well as how to successfully utilize the power of the media to promote your product or service. It was also fun to read, and really helped me to understand more about business than most of the others I've read. I was definitely satisfied.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I was very disappointed that my gift was to be a gift book. It was a very nice book, I have already read all of it. I think I will keep it in my library, but as a gift for a friend I would have given them my book as a treat. I would like to thank my gifter for the nice gift! I like that he was generous, and the book was not for a specific age group, but for a whole family.
Write a positive review about a good book: ******** My favourite science fiction book. Great writing and great science. I wish all books were this good. The best parts of the book were the alien races. As an old geezer who had his fingers and toes bitten off by alien hands I really appreciated how the aliens showed fear, but also respect. They were like us but more evolved. And their society was so advanced it was just like a spaceship with people inside. I think that the author made the book more interesting. He explained alien cultures and the different ways that they have evolved. I also liked that the alien females (they were called "hella babes") had no babies, which made sense in that culture. But their brains were so advanced that they were more like apes than women, so they just kept breeding until they died off. I thought it was a very interesting book, one I would like to read again. Recommended. It's fun to read and very detailed. Recommended! *****  My first alien book!! This was my first book in alien books. I didn't buy the paperback or the audiobook. I bought the audiobooks. I was hooked from the first scene. This is the book that was the first alien/alien book I bought, and it has stayed in my collection as a favorite.   I think the author, Stephen Baxter, is one of the best in this genre. The descriptions of the aliens are detailed and realistic. The way the aliens talk, their mannerisms, the way they wear their clothes and everything in between is just great. It was fun to listen to. I just wish there was an option to read the stories as well. If it was, I think this is the perfect book for alien fans. There's also a very nice cover. I recommend this book to everyone. I'm sure everyone would enjoy it.  This is one the best books ever written by the author Stephen Baxter!!  What a good thing to find out today, to find such a good read and so clear in thought and writing, I recommend it to everyone who wants to know about aliens, even if you are a person of the earth, and who don't know any other races.  a wonderful book, and to find this book is great  By the way, I found this book after all my other "gifts" to my brother, and I really love it! I was so excited to find it! Thank you so much! It was
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- ------------------------- Read this in one day and loved it. Was just starting out with no knowledge of grammar or spelling and just wanted to listen to it and I found this to be great. I was already a fan of The Hobbit but when I got this i was very much excited. It is such a great story and it had a lot of things to do with the Tolkien's but it is also set in a modern day and I like that as well. I highly recommend this to all Tolkien fans. I think I would recommend this if I could have gotten it as a gift for my boyfriend, he LOVES The Lord of the Rings and I did too but this was my first Tolkien book and it is my favorite.

Write a positive review about a good book:  In an age when the most popular authors are not the best at what they do, but rather "the best" at doing whatever that thing is, this is a very good book.  I've seen several books about the subject, and this is the one I've read.  "The American dream is dead,"  said David Brooks, the author of a book about that dream, that we've been following, ever since we were a poor college student with our heads buried in the sand.   Brooks is no less correct, and his book provides an important context for understanding the great American decline.   Brooks is right in that the American dream does not exist in the same way it did twenty years ago.  The idea of opportunity has changed, both in what people see as an opportunity, and in what they see as a threat to opportunity.  Brooks argues that the change has been precipitated by two forces.  First, technology, which has greatly expanded our options and lowered our costs of entry.   We don't have to go to the library to get a book on the topic, and we don't necessarily have to pay a huge price for it.   Technology has not only made us more productive, but has also allowed us to expand our horizons, both intellectually and spiritually.  Second, globalization.  After the fall of the Soviet Union, we've gotten accustomed to seeing ourselves as different from others.  We no longer fear for our safety, for our well-being, for the future of our countries.  Even more than the Soviets, we don the hoodies and the khakis and the blue jeans, and take for granted the ease of our lives.  In other words, we are different, and that difference has become more pronounced with each passing decade. Brooks writes: "This new global consciousness...seems to have transformed the American economy from a nation that did the hard things to one that is doing the easy things.  This transformation, however, does not mean that people everywhere can now make it in America.  No.  Nor does it mean that Americans are more productive now than they were in the past.  What the changes show is that we are more willing to take risks."   I agree, and I believe Brooks is on to something when he argues that, because of the loss of opportunity, the American middle class is in decline.   The truth is, however.  I'm not a college professor
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I found this book to be an entertaining and instructive introduction to quantum physics, which in some sense is the study of the fundamental nature of the universe and all the phenomena that we observe. In some sense it is a way of thinking about the origin of the cosmos itself."  – Richard Strogatz, author of Physics and the Soul  "[A] fascinating read. For those interested in the quantum realm, and for those who want to better understand why nature and humankind were created in this way…this book is for you."  the New York Times   "A wonderful and enlightening account of some of the fascinating quantum concepts that the authors cover." – Phil Plait, Bad Astronomy Blog  From the publisher:  Quantum Physics, a new title by Daniel M. Smith, offers the reader a fascinating, often surprising, look at the remarkable and amazing things that happen to our world as we move from our traditional view of the world, through the quantum, to our modern view. Quantum physics is often treated in an ad hoc fashion, as if it is an exotic, exotic idea, not a well understood field of science. But this book, by an experienced physicist, is a clear, comprehensive account of how the fundamental forces of the Universe work, what their properties are, what quantum processes are, and why we are here and in touch with a universe which we are now entering. Quantum Physics is a very readable explanation of a field of study, a well-written explanation of the field of physics, and a compelling explanation of how we are all part of it and why that matters.

Write a positive review about a good book:  - This is a very, very well written book.  I was shocked and thoroughly enjoyed reading it.    - It's a very well-written novel, and I'm really looking forward to the next book in the series!  - The writing was very enjoyable, and the characters were well developed.  - I loved the plot and characters.  - This book was really great, and it had me on the edge of my seat!   I was very excited when I got it, and thought it would be another great read, but I was so wrong.  The characters and plot were interesting, the plot had a great plot, and this book had so much to offer. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ My son just finished reading "Makers and Takers: The Great Inequality in the U.S." His comment: "I found the author's story pretty darn accurate." I agree and I am sure the author will be happy about that. ________________________________________________ I'm not sure that he will enjoy this book, but I'll let him decide that. It seems like he's already made up his mind. I don't agree with what he writes but I will give him the benefit of the doubt. I guess I'm just a realist. I disagree that he can take the "benefit of the doubt" for a very good reason: he has never lived in a "great" country.   It is hard to see how we could have made it this far and made it into this far.  We have not changed much in a thousand years.  And I'm very sorry he is reading this, but he may be surprised by how different we are than his parents or grandparents were, and he may find it hard to grasp.  This book is not about the past, it's about our present and our future.  It's about the difference between those of us who have been fortunate to have been born in America and those of we who don't.  That means we have a unique perspective to give and it's important to give it if you're going to get on the good side of the American people.  I'm surprised he found the book entertaining.  Maybe it's because I'm doing a good job of convincing him otherwise. He likes it.  Not for long though.  He will change his mind when he grows up.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had never heard of John McPhee before this, so it was a very pleasant surprise. He doesn't have the technical background that some other experts have, so I'm not sure where he got it, but what he has to say is interesting. And he has a point. The other thing that he points out is that one can use an analog model for the digital world, in which the data is represented by the same bits that are stored on magnetic tapes in a digital camera. This allows for a good understanding of the complexity of what's going on in a camera, and a way of looking at the world around us that is both a lot more interesting and accurate than some of the models that others use. I'm going to be looking at his book more, and will share more thoughts with you all as I do. So if you are going to buy this, get the e-version, it's really very good.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "We just finished reading The Great Divergence. It's a fascinating read that explains how technology and science have changed us so radically." "This book will open the eyes of people who have been asleep on the issue of change, technology, and why this is an important time in history." It's a great read, especially for people who may not have been as concerned about global warming as they should have been.      "The author describes how humanity is evolving beyond the limits of natural resources and how humanity will inevitably be confronted with new limits, which will lead us to a new equilibrium that would be much better than the previous system. However, the book takes the reader through a fascinating look at how a change in the energy mix can cause a sudden and dramatic change in culture and technology. The book explains why some people are able to cope with a changing environment much better and why the future will be unpredictable. I found this book very enlightening and a useful resource." The Great Divergent: The Story of the Future of Life on Earth This book is a great addition to my personal library.  I am now much more aware of how our technologies are changing and I am even more concerned that they may cause the end of civilization as we know it. I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in this topic.   "One of the most profound and important books I have ever read...This is a book you need to own." There are lots of ways to learn about global climate change, but the most relevant to this book are the interviews and discussions with leading scientists and politicians from around the world that are found throughout the book.   "This is the best book I've come across on the subject...It's an eye-opening, inspiring and insightful account of why we have an urgent problem and how our future depends on changing our behaviour and decisions."

Write a positive review about a good book: _________   "The most brilliant short story collection of the year."  —David Foster Wallace  "Emmett's stories are an important contribution to literature. They are so wonderfully constructed that the whole series is worth a read. The best story is 'The House on the Borderland', a beautifully composed, poetic piece of work that takes us into the heart of an obscure family. The final tale, 'The Caves', is also quite a masterpiece, a masterful piece of psychological and physical exploration, telling a story about the effect of physical illness and the passage of time on a family in which a mother is dying."  thebrief.com   What people are saying about The Children's Crusade by Robert Emmett: "The children of a fictional town in England are taken to a mountain sanctuary to be raised in a mystical world of gods and monsters. They meet and fall in love, and then fight the forces of darkness. The book will make you think about the difference between good and evil. The stories are short, but they are full of emotion. They will make your heart sing." The Book Smugglers   "[It's] a delightful read. Emmott's storytelling is not overly complicated, and it reads effortlessly. Emmitt uses the small details of everyday life to add depth to his characters...Emmett's storytellers always seem aware of how the human race is changing and how to keep the stories honest in the process."

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book!  Weird as it may sound, I actually enjoyed this book and it really shows.  It is like a weird, little, weird little children's book.  "I am an elf!" "The best day of my life was when I was a kid and had the chance to meet the wizard." "He would bring you some candy and a bag of popcorn and tell you all about his adventures."  I liked the fact that all the stories and the drawings are done in pencil, I think that is a pretty nice touch.   My favorite thing about this book is that it doesn't have a whole lot of action.  In fact the action in this book was a bit thin, I like the idea of having a book that has a lot of little details that we would think about when we are children, and then when you are grown up we forget about those little details.  For example when we read about the Wizard of Oz, we think about Dorothy riding on the rail and then the door open and she runs to the window and there is the red-headed man and she shouts and then she is hit by the big red truck.  Then we get to the end of the book and all we remember is the train ride and the guy getting hit by red-haired truck.   So it is nice to know that all these little details make the story that much better!  In my opinion, the writing is good.  The story is a little bit short, but the little things in the story add up and makes you want to read more.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________   The Last War Against the Jews by Dr. Michael Shermer:  A fascinating and compelling book which is a must read for anyone who cares about the future of Western Civilization.   __________________________________________   What is truth?:  There are a lot of different ways to define truth. In a society like ours, however, in which the vast majority of the people have little access to the truth, one's ability to define it is a major indicator of the success of one's beliefs, beliefs which then shape what one thinks about the world and oneself. And, in order to really believe, one has to believe that one's opinions are based on facts and verifiable truths.   (p. 10)   This is a pretty accurate description of the state of the world today, but, when you consider that it was once a pretty simple statement, it makes a lot more sense. In any case, as Dr. Shermer describes the rise of "alternative facts" as part of the current "global awakening," which in his words is the "final battle for the soul of the Western world," the concept of truth is becoming more and more of a meaningless term to many people, who have begun to look for their own truth.   and truth, however defined, is always more than just what we say it is.  The true measure of one is what one does to create or sustain the truth that one is seeking.  
Write a positive review about a good book: ******************************* [This review was collected as part of a larger review of "Vermont: A Guide to Living and Doing Business in Vermont", by Dan G. Anderson (Maine & Vermont State Library).]  A very pleasant book to read. In the middle of a dense volume of information, and with a long introduction and bibliography, Anderson offers the reader the sense of knowing who he is, where he lives, what his family's situation is, what he thinks about the situation and his personal relationship with the state of Vermont. For people interested in living in Vermont, this is a great book.  ******  by Paul W. Anderson  I am grateful for Vermont's place in our national heritage as the oldest state in the union. Its rich history has been well documented over the past century in countless books, articles and documentaries and the state is a fascinating example of a rural society. I am thrilled to have this book in my home. This book should be in every library in America for anyone interested in studying Vermont's history.

Write a positive review about a good book: ****************** A friend of mine has recommended this book to me many times over the years and I have read it several times.  This is the third time I've read it.  "A great book to read if you're into mythology, religion or folklore."  I'm a huge fan of science fiction and I read the first three of J.R.R Tolkein's books before getting to this one, so I was already familiar with this book.    When I first started reading this book, I didn't like it, it was very much like reading someone's take on the Star Wars movies (I think I remember it being slightly more detailed and detailed).  It was also incredibly preachy, I found it preachy and tedious and I found myself skipping it many times. A few days ago I saw the film of the Lord of the Rings film and I had to look it up again just to see what Tolkien had to say about the Middle-Earth legend.    Tolkien was a bit more religious than Tolkeinian and I liked this one much more. I liked the characters from this book very much and I hope that there will be more written about them and maybe I'll read one of their stories someday.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Devil in the White City (Harper, 1964)  by  H.P. Lovecraft The last story Lovecraft ever wrote and it is, without a doubt, his finest. If you have not read this book then I strongly urge you to do so before you read anything else by Lovecraft. The story of the Necronomicon is probably the most important story in modern horror literature, not just because it is the first time the Necrons have appeared in a popular story. However, it is also the most disturbing and most disturbing story in Lovecraft's whole oeuvre. My main issue with the book is that it was written in such a hurry to get it published that the author was often forced to use a style of dialogue that is sometimes unreadable to my modern ears. Even with my advanced reading, I could understand that the narrator is trying to write a story without having much information to go on. I also found that the story is not particularly interesting for many reasons. Lovecraft's use of a narrator for a horror story is often problematic as it can lead the reader to expect some sort of emotional response to the events and/or feelings that the reader may not be able to get from the text itself. That being said, this is a brilliant story that does not disappoint at all. If I had to sum up this book in one word, it would be "mind-blowing". My favorite part of the story, as it is so often in Lovecraft, is the relationship between the narrator and the protagonist. The narrator is very good at portraying a character with little to no dialogue, but who communicates very clearly with the reader. One of my all-time favorite Lovecraft stories, this story is well worth the read and I would suggest that any Lovecraft fan read this one.

I'm sure this is also relevant to other genres... but i don't want to get into that now. The book starts out with a pretty strong plot, but it's fairly generic, with a lot of 'why?', and the plot could have been handled better. The rest is just pretty standard...but still enjoyable...and i don' t think i'd put this at the top of my reading pile unless i were to review it specifically. I'm also not sure how much time is given to the characters... it's more than enough time to get to know them.

Write a positive review about a good book: ******************* My parents have always been very supportive of my passion for writing. They've never made me feel that I had to put in a lot of effort in order to be a good writer, but rather always encouraged me to find a way to make this passion a living. When I was an undergraduate I wanted to be in journalism, but my parents didn't think that was a good idea because they thought it would force me to give up on writing. Instead, they said to me to pursue writing, not just for money, but because it was the only thing I would really love to do. Now, I have a beautiful writing desk that my mother and I made for me. It contains a keyboard, an assortment of notebooks, and a spiral bound copy of my book, The Gift of Criticism. I don't believe that any other book in the world has been able to provide the kind of encouragement that my parents have given to me. ****************** Thank you for your review.

Write a positive review about a good book:.............................................................  What a great book. I've been waiting to read a book about the life of this great prophet for a long time. I'm so glad that the person who was supposed to write this book was able to write it. The only reason I've given it four stars is because I can't recommend this book to the members of the Church who may read it for the first time, because I think they would have an extremely hard time reconciling the words of this prophet to the Church that I've belonged to my entire life.  SUMMARY: This book describes the life and times of Joseph Smith, the founder of the LDS Church. It is written by an outsider who is neither a Mormon nor a member of the Mormon Church. The writer, who is a former Mormon, recounts his experience with the LDS church. The Mormon author has a negative view of Joseph, and writes of Joseph as a cunning and deceptive individual who lied about the origins of his religion. The LDS writer believes Joseph was the prophet of the restored gospel, as well as the founder, or creator, of the first great American religious movement. The author believes that the LDS temple ceremony is a religious practice that Joseph Smith created that does not conform to any Biblical teaching. The Mormons have a "church" that is a cult, the Mormons are a Christian sect, and the Mormons practice polygamy. . I have heard from so many ex-Mormons, and a number of former Mormons themselves, that have written about how difficult it is to reconcile Joseph Smith's words and actions. I have to agree. In the LDS version of history, it is clear that Joseph was a prophet, that he was called to take the gospel of Christ to the whole world, and that he performed many amazing feats as a leader in the Church. But it is not so clear that all of the events described in the book actually happened. In addition, it seems very difficult to see how Joseph could have been the prophet for all of that time. Joseph claimed to have had visions that showed him the future and to have received a revelation that he translated from an ancient record by the power of God, but he never showed a divine authority to Joseph Smith. I am a Mormon and am very familiar with the church's teachings, but when I hear the Mormon version of events, I have a very difficult time reconciled to them. It seems to me that Joseph is a very intelligent man, but it seems to

The fact that the book is about an author being a spy makes it all the better." - Emily "For people who love stories where people change and grow and who don't want to see a plot ending, this is a great book. I was amazed at how good it was. It's a very smart and well-written book. Also, it's got two great endings to it, which are a great touch. There is even a whole post-war spy/romance sub-plot in there." - Anonymous "When I first read about this book, I thought it was so overrated and had a hard time trying to get through the beginning, but I loved it. After that, it got more and more interesting and it really helped me find the best parts of the book. In the end, there was nothing I would change." - Chris

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been interested in the works of H.P. Lovecraft for a long time.  As I grew older and went to the library for more of the various Lovecraftian works I was able to discover and read about, the more it seemed that the author was on to something and that his works were full of very dark, foreboding ideas that were far from being easy to deal with.  The most disturbing book that I ever read was the short story "The Horror at Red Hook," and I have had my fair share of nightmares in my life since.    Now, while the stories that I read were rather unsettling, they were always set in a familiar environment where the characters were aware of their surroundings and it was hard to believe that such a situation was really occurring.  However, I was excited that a great horror story would be available for me to read and, once again, the author has pulled it off with "The Unnamable."   The author makes his point clear from the beginning and I felt that the way that he handled it in terms of pacing, tension, and horror made me want to keep reading.  This book is a great example of how to properly portray horror.  From the start the story moves at a brisk pace and never gets dull or tedious.  He starts out very slowly with the narrator and his brother, then quickly moves to the narrator becoming an antagonist in his own tale.  Throughout this book the narrator is shown to be a rather flawed character and it seems that he always had his own agenda to accomplish.  That is until he becomes a very big part of the story.  After the narrator has gotten himself involved with the story it takes a surprising turn.  Even though this book is long (it is 864 pages) I was actually able to finish it in about two days.  I can imagine that the fact that the book is so long made it a bit difficult to stay focused on it for the first hundred pages or so.  Also, I will point out that the characters are mostly made up of one or more people in the same situation, so there was always someone that would be the most interesting character for me.  A few other things that I enjoyed about this book were the way in which the narrator was able portray the feelings of his brother and the way the narrator uses his family to help him achieve his own goals.  There was also the way he described the creepy and bizarre characters

Write a positive review about a good book:  This was one of the best things I have read so far this year. I have been so wanting to read this book ever since I was able to get my hands on it.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ My husband and I have had three dogs since they were young and each has been a very different and memorable dog to own. We had a border collie and a dachshund when we got them and a Shih Tzu when they were in their teens, and a miniature dachsher when they became a toddler. We decided to get a puppy for our daughter after seeing one in a show. She was so excited to get one for her daughter, but not everyone has the time or money to wait for a pup to grow and matures. We've gotten two more dogs from BARC that we are planning to add to our family. I can't wait for them to be up and about! _________________  We are not the only ones getting the best out of our rescue animals.  I'm an animal lover first and I love rescuing as much as I love owning my rescue animals! I think all of my dogs have gone on to have wonderful lives because of the loving care I have given them. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU, BARC for making my dogs so happy! _________________________ We're now two years into owning and raising a rescue dog. We have a sweet dachsie, and two other dogs. I am a veterinary technician, and it's only through the BARC rescue programs that we get to take advantage of the many resources our rescue can offer. We do all our own grooming and bathing (other pets don't always understand why), and we do not have to worry about our pets getting sick (BARC takes great care to make sure that happens). I'm an older woman, and I really feel the love and care of the other volunteers and staff that work with us. It's truly an amazing program! I am so proud to be a part of this rescue. __________________________ BARC rescues dogs from local shelters that do not want them and provides loving homes to them. We also try to get the dogs from owners who cannot afford to keep them. _________________________________________________________________________________________ This is my 3rd year participating. Last year I did a photo shoot, and the 4th I did my own hair. This year is my 4th year. My husband has had me for a while now and is now considering getting a rescue puppy as well. In the past year we have had 2 rescue dogs in our family and I feel a strong bond with them. My wife loves them, too

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________ I read this book because I'm really interested in the topic of 'transgenderism' and in the lives of many of the people I have encountered while researching this topic, and I was hoping that I would find an engaging story with a positive message. I was not disappointed. I especially enjoyed the personal interviews with the subjects, and the fact that this book provides such a frank, honest, and comprehensive picture of the lived experience of transitioning.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I'm sorry that I can't be more enthusiastic about this book. I had so much fun reading this, but I'm so glad that I finally finished it. It was a great ride to see how the character of Sam (one of the main characters) is evolving throughout the book. He's not an easy character to write. I really wish that someone would just publish a book like this because I really wanted to see what he would be like as an older man and if he would change (no spoilers!). He's an interesting character to read and I would love to read more of his adventures. I think that this is going to be one of my favorite books that I've read all year.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ I'm going to start this review by telling you that I don't think you've ever read anything like this before. I found this book and, not only reading it, but listening to it, while I was sitting in a crowded restaurant in Toronto, on my way to a reading that was not quite so packed. And the reason why I say this is, first of all, because I'm not a big fan of a lot of books that are "too long" (read: too boring, not exciting enough) and I found myself frustrated and wanting to get home and get on with reading something I liked more. Also, I am just not the biggest fan of the genre of sci fi that you have chosen, so this was definitely a novel that I found quite exciting and captivating. The book is a very unique mix of many genres, and yet it was a great blend and I'm sure that it will appeal to anyone who enjoys different types of writing. I think the one thing that I find to be very interesting in this book, is that the writer, John Mowry, has chosen not to follow a typical "heroes go on heroic quests" structure. He instead uses the story in a way that creates an interesting plot and gives a glimpse into a much more interesting world (the galaxy) that will make you want to read the next book in this series. I am going to continue with a positive statement, and give my opinion on each of the following points: The setting is very different. The first book in the series was set in the planet of Elsia and I thought that this book took place in another world. But the second book has taken place on the planet Zeltros which is very similar to our own planet, but in a sense we are not in the galaxy. The second book also deals with a lot with space warfare, so to me it was hard to distinguish the difference between Zeltro and Elsian culture and this book takes place on a much smaller scale. The story is much more engaging. I was really surprised that the author managed to convey an interesting story by focusing more on the plot instead of the character development. While the first book deals with the conflict between an alien race called the Anunnaki, and humans, the second one focuses more on a group of "fearless" humans who fight a war to reclaim the lost land of Zeltron (their home) from the Anunni.

This was one of my favorite reads of 2015. The book was excellent, the characters were very believable, the story was exciting and suspenseful, I couldn't wait for the next book in the series, this book really hooked me. I highly recommend this book! Read More I was so intrigued with this series that I was on it as soon as it was available and have read each of the first two books in it. I really think that a series that's this good should not be re-read once, let alone twice, I really wanted to go back and check out the other books, the beginning of this series really got me into fantasy and this book in particular has a really interesting blend of fantasy, magic, and history that I just really enjoy. I'm so glad I picked it up and read it and really enjoyed it, definitely recommend for anyone looking for a series to read Read Less

It is very funny and I think the author was just messing around with the theme of the book and not trying to offend anyone with it. I also thought the main character was so cute. There is a chapter where he is playing with the toys, it was kind of sad that this is the only story you get, but I think this is a good way to end the book since you get some more of the story.

I was really interested in how the plot developed. The book does a very good job of keeping you interested in what is going on.

I loved the premise, I loved that it was written with such detail, and I loved how they explained all of the twists. The ending was not too shocking, but it was believable. I just loved everything about this book! This is my first time reading any book that is actually written by a child. I've never had a book by an adult. I'd never had an book about a book or book characters. It was really well done, and a lot of fun!
Write a positive review about a good book:  http://bookwormblaze.wordpress.com/2013/07/12/the-great-trouble-with-the-dawn/  Review by: The Great Trouble with Dawn  Rating: 5 out of 5 stars  Service Rating: 5  Value Rating: 4  Pros: The only review of the book I've read on Goodreads, and the only review that made me want to read the book. So what am I saying. My friend read this and I had to share it. I have been thinking about the book, and I'm going to read it, because I read a couple of books by Mark Twain's family, and he is one of the most important authors. This is an incredibly good book, I love it.  Cons: I wish they had put the photos in the book and maybe put the book back in the original binding. I don't understand why they did that though.   My favorite quote: "If you want to get away with murder, murder is the answer."   I'm going on this vacation, I'll have to make this book and see how I like it on vacation.

The desert wasn't big enough, I was afraid to go farther inland and get caught."  , and that was the reason why he took a small boat and started sailing.  ...  My review of The Great Travesty of the Dawn  I thought this was the most interesting book I read this year.   My wife and I were having dinner and the topic of the year was the coming war. As we discussed, my wife mentioned that we have not had one in decades. We both agreed that the fact is that war is getting to be a common occurrence, not just in our generation, but in the history of mankind. I agree with her and it makes me think that perhaps the world was not in such a good state before the coming of the age of war. Maybe it was because we lived in a time where we had peace. I am beginning to think that a lot of the problems that our children will have to deal with, can be found in our own childhood. The most obvious one being that of parents and kids. They just don't like to be around each other. We see this as it happens in the movies of the day, but I

Write a positive review about a good book:  My parents loved it. The way it was written, the way it dealt with family dysfunction, and the way the author described how the events played out in their lives, made it really personal and relatable. I think it was a brilliant book, and if my parents were alive, I would probably read it a lot. I'm glad they did, because I think they could have written a better book. I would give it a four-star rating, except that the ending was a little too perfect, in my opinion, and some of the details were not very well detailed. I thought that some of what the book said about family dysfunction was just a little unrealistic and not entirely true. I don't think I'd read this book again without the context of the previous books, so I'm still reading it, just to see if the ending changes anything.

It is a concise, comprehensive analysis that should be required reading in any US college and/or university's Russian department." -- The Economist "As a former high ranking officer in the US military who is now a civilian, I can attest that the US-Russia relationship has become a toxic one. This book demonstrates in no uncertain terms that the United States is in for a fight over this relationship if it is allowed to continue. The author lays out a clear case, and a plausible path forward. In short, the Obama administration should follow this book's recommendations. As a final note, I find the book to be highly persuasive, and I think it would be very timely for the current Administration to take note of what is in store for them in coming years if they don't act quickly." -- General Michael Hayden, former Director of the NSA and CIA "The book is a timely corrective to an approach to Russia that has failed, with great consequences for both Russia and the United states." -- Stephen Sestanovich, author of The Fall of the Soviet Union: How US Betrayal Led to the Rise of ISIS
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ I bought this book after my son was diagnosed with autism and I wanted to read a book that was about his experiences, as well as those of others, and how it was handled. I was shocked to see the levels of detail that were used in describing the behaviors, and behaviors that were a cause for concern to his parents. This book gives you that feeling of the "fog of war" that is the difference between making a correct decision and making a decision you don't want to make.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I got this book from a good friend for my birthday, and I have to say, the writing is very good, though a bit wordy at times. I found myself reading and re-reading the book to make sure it all made sense, and it does. Although the book is written for children, there are things that children can appreciate. It's great to see parents get a bit of reading in, and to see the book actually make sense for them.   However, I do have a few criticisms. First, I don't think that the book does a very good job of explaining the process of how the world is made. For example, I remember being taught about how the first animals came about, but as an adult, I find it difficult to get my head around how the idea of life evolving from non-life actually works. Perhaps if a more advanced book had been included at some point, this problem could have been addressed. Second, I think that one of the more disappointing aspects of the book was the lack of an explanation about the purpose of life itself. The book spends so much time on the development of life, which seems to be the end of the story, that it feels like it skips over the part that actually makes the purpose a mystery.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must-read if you want to understand some of the things that are going on in the world and especially in the Western world. I wish there were more books like this in the West and more books that were not just in the academic field, but in every field and in every sector, and in all aspects of human existence. This book was a great introduction to the work of Thomas Paine. I started this book knowing very little about Thomas P.A.Paine other than a few quotes from him. This book showed me a little of what he believed and what he wrote. I think it's well written, and it covers all sides of what Paine believed, which is that the current system is broken, that government has no place in society, and that the best way to solve any problem is through the private sector. The book doesn't go into all the historical aspects of the French Revolution, but it does explain how he came to that conclusion in the first place. He starts by writing that "Thomas Paine had no special place in the history of the eighteenth century. All the people of the 17th century thought the French revolution had been good, and Thomas P.'s only claim to fame lay in being the first to propose a new form of government." Paine also explains that he is a man who "had been raised to the rank of officer, and was a member of the House of Lords. He was of a certain age. He had a certain amount of authority over his people. His ideas of right and wrong, his ideas of education, and his ideas about the value of the individual were of a high order. He came of a respectable, educated family in a respectable part of the kingdom. And yet he was never more than a modest man, who had not, however, become a philosopher, or a statesman." "I was of course not, of course, in any way the person Paine would have chosen as a model. Nor was I a disciple of a great leader of his age; but I was a man of a particular kind, who was born at a particular period of a definite period of society. I was not, and could never have been, a political man. I could never be a politician. But I have no doubt that in the main I believed in the rights of the people. And my thoughts, my feelings, and my aims, were the same as any man of

I like the idea of the characters being the people who do the right thing, and also how they interact with their friends.

This book will help many people to make their thinking clear and efficient.  I used this as a primer for my introductory philosophy of psychology class, and I really liked it. It covers a lot of material and helps one to understand their thinking better. I feel that it is a bit more advanced than some of the others, so if you have been thinking about psychology, this is the one to start with. This book is written with the benefit of having been a PhD student in a cognitive science lab, so his explanations are probably quite a bit better than the average person in a lab. I would recommend this book to any interested person, but would not recommend it for those who are interested in cognitive science, but not necessarily interested in the application of psychology in everyday life.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- It was interesting. There are certain things that I have heard or read that are more true than others but this book is about a more realistic and real story about a very good man. The ending was good. This is something I could watch in the movies. My brother had it a while back and I am sure it was pretty good.  _________________  Fantastic Books - Amazing Teachers - Great Company  "When you start to do things, there is a certain kind of joy which you do not feel on ordinary days." - William Butler Yeats  Read more  My husband bought it for me so I could read it to my little girl while she played with her Barbie dolls.

This is the book I was hoping for! - by Anonymous on 10/26/2015 I've never owned a Time Capsule book, so this was a little more to my liking, as I am a little obsessive about time travel books. It's also been a while since I've read a Time capsule book (I read one years ago that was a collection of newspaper articles). It is quite an amusing read, as the author explains the history of time travel (not really) and how we have all benefited from the technology over the years. I was particularly interested in how the first time capsules, being made out of wax and metal, were eventually replaced by glass, and how that was done.   I am pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend it. It will stay on my shelf. - by kristin on 10 of 10 - This was the first book I've ever read on time travel. I had the same sort of fantasy when I was young, I had been raised to believe that time travel was impossible (I know the reality is slightly more complicated). It's a fun read about time-travel. It is a little dated now, as modern time travel technology is more sophisticated and has better accuracy, but it does a good job of bringing it back into the present. -
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm pretty sure that the book I had is the one that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the genre. I loved the beginning, the writing was great and I enjoyed the characters as I learned about their lives, I really enjoyed learning more about the book world and the different races that made up it. I liked how it followed the plot of the books in the series and it was easy to follow. The story itself is very well written and it is very different to the books. I think that it was nice to see some characters from the first books show up in a different story, even if they only had a small cameo. The cover is fantastic and I really liked the look of the cover. I found myself wondering why the author didn't have the characters in the same outfit in the beginning of the book. That said, the story and the characters were good.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Secret to a Long Life. I read this a couple years back, and really enjoyed it. The story is very interesting. One of my great regrets in life is that I didn't live to be 100+ years old and then start a family and live happily ever after. However, having a longer life than I thought I had is one of the main reasons I want to live to 100+. This book showed me how to live my life in a way that makes it look better than it would otherwise.  A few days ago, I realized that the reason I don't want to die is because I don The Secret To A Long Life by Jim Collins is one hell of a book. Collins has always been a "hard core" science fiction writer, but this book shows how science is really a way of life, and how the most useful things in life aren't obvious, and are only discovered through science. If you're at all interested in reading science fiction, I would highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: *****************************   I read the synopsis of this book, then I got into it. It is a beautiful, lyrical, beautiful book. You cannot describe it, but you can read it, it is like poetry. It brings you into the characters lives. So beautiful and so simple, and so real. I have to warn you, the romance is intense but it never hurts, it takes it's time and it's not a fast burning romance.   It starts off with the protagonist, an old lady. She was a nurse, in the WW2 in Germany. She is trying to raise a little boy. The boy is her niece. Then she meets a beautiful boy in a wheelchair. She loves this boy but is not sure he will be able to live. The girl meets another girl, an Italian girl and they are both very pretty, but they do not feel the same and they fight.   the last half of the book is about the characters and the lives they live, but it is never boring, there is always something new to learn about the story, the characters, and the environment.   a great book with beautiful writing and writing that will take you through the heart of this story.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is full of great, helpful tips.  It was a little slow in getting to the points that were important, but that's understandable. _______________________________________________________________ I was so happy when I found this site. I am a woman who has had my uterus and cervix removed, as well as my tubes tied, but has never had a hysterectomy.  In my early twenties, I went to the doctor with a bunch of questions and got some really interesting information.  For example, how do women with tubes tied (like me) deal with vaginal infections that never cleared up?  In the end, he recommended I get a hymenectomy, which is something I have to look forward to (and I am looking forward to it).  In addition, he gave me information on what happens when you have a hysterectomy, because I didn't realize that there was so much information online, but didn't find anything that covered how to care for your new, smaller vagina.  This site has a lot of great advice. I found it very helpful, even though I know it is hard for me to get started with such an important decision as this.  ____________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a classic for its time - the story is well told, the characters are well drawn and the prose is superb. I can remember reading this book when I was a child and have read it over the years, and it remains a fondly remembered childhood memory.   The author does not hold back in his portrayal of the life and death of Jesus. He portrays Jesus as a tragic figure. He is not happy, not content, not satisfied with his life, and he does not know how to live. This makes it hard for him to follow God's will. It is no surprise that the author believes that Jesus' story is a cautionary tale. He does not believe that Jesus has a clear moral message; he does see him as a caution against overindulgence and materialism.   The book is not about Christ's mission to heal the nations, although Jesus does preach that message. He says that if we would only hear, he can heal, but most of us don't listen. He also says that God does not care about us as much as he cares about them (the nations). The book portrays Jesus in a way that would make it seem as if he was doing what he loved to do: spreading the gospel. Jesus does not seem to be doing this because it is what he is taught to do or because he feels it is the best thing for the world. Instead, he seems to be accomplishing his goals by his own efforts, and to the extent that he is not doing these things, he is doing it by his actions.  .   is a powerful book. The author writes about the story of Jesus with depth and insight. Although the story itself is not particularly exciting, it is very entertaining. I read it back in the '80s when it first came out. The story is still relevant and relevant to many who come to it for the first time.    The book includes a list of things that Jesus could have done differently in his life (to be more like God) that would have saved his life. He was not perfect, as we all are. He could have been more like the Father. He should have listened more to the people around him, especially Peter and his fellow apostles. They were less influenced by materialism than he was. They believed in Jesus as more than just an itinerant preacher. I have found many of these points in books that I have read recently (though I never thought of these things

Write a positive review about a good book:  Coyote is an excellent book. It has a very thorough and detailed description of the history and origin of the coyote in North America. Coyote is the only book I've ever read that gives a full history of the modern coyote and how it has been domesticated. While I found the book to be very factual, I think the author has a tendency to write coyotes as dumb, dumb animals with no intelligence and little to no sense of responsibility or compassion. The reason this happens is the author clearly does not understand the difference between the coyotes in North American and their ancestors. The wild coyote is not a wild dog, nor is it a wolf. Coyotes were originally domesticated for their meat, not for hunting. They do not hunt because of their instinctual need to eat. They are not wild animals, nor do they possess any natural tendency to hunt or scavenge. This is simply an example of the author simply being incorrect and being misleading with regards to coyotes. I can see why he made the mistake that he did though. There are several species of wolf in North Ameri can, including the brown wolf which was domesticated by humans as a means to feed their livestock. There is a distinction between wolves and coyotes, and the author does not grasp this distinction. The brown wolf was bred with coyotes to help them scavenge meat and this led to the evolution of the brown dog. There were many species of wolves, and none were particularly good at eating large game such as deer. Coyotes do not prey on large game, and have no natural tendency toward hunting large animals. This does not mean they do not make a good pet or family pet though. Coyotes are very smart animals. If they were being properly handled and handled properly they could be kept as pets. For this reason I will continue to give Coyote 5 stars, but I would rate it 1 star more than 1 star because it is misleading about the origin of coyotes and how they are domesticated. I hope this review has been helpful in your decision to buy this book or any book related to the coyou and the people that care for them.

The world is still recovering from the war with the darkspawn. The emperor has been forced to stay in exile for most of his life, his powers having diminished from what they once were. He's been unable to control the daedric cult that rules the continent, and has been in hiding in the mountains ever since the war began. His personal guard is under his command but they can't keep up with the growing daedra menace. He is, however, the only one who can wield the power of the dremora. A lone, aging soldier, a soldier so old that he hardly counts, leads the Imperial forces in their struggle against the dreary daedroths. He carries out his orders with dedication, and the only weapon he carries is a single blade forged with the will of an empire, with which he is well known in the Imperial City. The Emperor's blade is a powerful and deadly weapon, an iron fist striking at the heart of the dark powers that control the mortal world. It is a warrior's weapon, one wielded with the utmost care and fearlessness, a weapon that is not to be used lightly. And it is not without a price: its wielder
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________________________________   "I bought this book to read as a gift for my brother-in-law. He does not read a lot of books but is a big fan of all things sci-fi. We've always enjoyed reading and he enjoys being challenged and being challenged to read more. He enjoyed this book and even told me when he finished that he liked it. I do agree that the last few pages could have been handled better. I feel that there are two different stories. One is where Harry, Ron, and Hermione find that a wizard is alive and not who they thought he was, and the other is where the trio confront Lord Voldemort and learn the truth about the wizarding war. I know I am being harsh with this review but I was a little underwhelmed by this book."
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Death of the Dune Messiah  by James Blish is an incredible work of science fiction history.  It is also a book that can be enjoyed by all generations of fans. I remember when I was a kid and would read this and think to myself "Wow.  Why hasn't someone done that yet?"   The book is not without flaws, but it is a remarkable work of fiction.  The story follows the exploits of Lord Adama from the day he was born until his death.  He is a true survivor of a galactic catastrophe.  A story about what happens when the planet's population of Dune worshippers have been left to die off after the destruction of the last colony on Arrakis.  It is also the story of a man who has to survive on his own in a harsh desert wasteland, and the events that will lead him to the realization that he is in fact a prophet to his people.  In a book filled with science fiction, it is hard to choose just one of the major elements of the novel that really stands out.  But in my opinion, my favorite element of the book is the introduction of The Fifth Element.   I could write a novel on the elements of this book alone and I will never get bored with it.  I loved that the fifth element was introduced because it was so unexpected and unexpected to me.  This was one of those books where the first page was just a blur of colors, and there was no dialogue for the first several pages, and just the sounds of the sand and the wind.  There is no shortage of elements in the book that made me want to keep reading.  Most of the action takes place during the night when the sun is low in the sky, and that just made it even more suspenseful.  Also the desert planet with the great heat is so incredibly interesting to me,  and the various other elements of it,  all added to the immersion of the story.  You are never quite sure what is going to happen next in a book, and I have to say that I love when that happens in a science fiction book.  And it was a real shame that we have not had a book like this since the 1980's,   in which the main characters are from a post human future.       This is my favorite book by James Blayse,  not because of the plot but because of what it does for
Write a positive review about a good book:  " The Red Queen, by Alice Sebold, is about the dangers of a "modern" (read: feminist) society, which has a lot of women in it, who have no idea how to make good decisions for themselves, or the people they love, or how to be truly self-sufficient. " It was so much better than I was expecting.  The Red, as she's called, is a sort of queen of the men in her village (which is in another village, which she has not yet been to, but she's going to once she's finished her studies and she doesn't have the courage to travel into the forest on her own), and they've been living together in peace for years, but suddenly she is sent back in time to marry the Red Queen in an arranged marriage.  But things do not go as planned and she has to escape to save her village and her love, and she discovers that they have to travel around and fight with and to the death a certain King of the Men, who's been trying to destroy the whole world and her life for a very long time. "It was a wonderful story," I said.  "I didn't get all the symbolism, but I got a lot more than just what some books may leave you with." But then, I started to realize how many of the "symbolic" scenes are actually symbolic of the plot - in fact, it all goes back to the "Red Queen" (as the men are called), who represents the people in the village.  And how many scenes are a parody of the trope of the love triangle, or, at least, the way it's usually played in the movies and books.  Or the way that it's played in other fantasy novels.   It really was that good. "There is some good in this book.  There is humor.  Some of the descriptions are wonderful.  I would recommend it to anyone, even if it's just for their own pleasure."   "It's a wonderful book."  "It's an excellent book." "My favorite book of 2014"  I have to say that my review has been praised by many, some of whom (I'm sure) have read this book back in 2008.  It's only now that I'm trying to remember all those details of how it's better than it was then, or what's better about it, but it is so

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This book was very thorough and very well written. As it is a historical biography of the great Indian revolutionary, the book did not cover many things that a general biography may be expected to do, but this book does not have the same weaknesses as some biographies do. In the end, the author is a good historian and the work that he has done in putting together the information provided by the various sources was well done. However, the historical information is a bit dated. However there are so many things in it that can still be taken to the next level. Recommended.

I don't agree with some of the reviews, and I'll explain why. The book is the only one I've heard of with no photos on it. What's more, it is more accurate, and more concise, than any of the other books I've ever read. The other reviews I read say it is an excellent book, a good one at that. And they're right! I can't say the same for the reviews I've seen on the internet. If you want the best book on "the big five" you should get this book. If not, go buy the others.  I don't have much to say about this book, it's good. Not that good. Just that it is a book that I will recommend to anyone interested in the "big five" personality types. If anyone is interested in personality types, I'd highly recommend you get this one. It's well done, and it provides some really interesting info and insights. .  and it really is quite easy to understand, the first part of the book is really short and informative.  on the second part the author goes on to provide some more information on the various facets of this particular type, then they go on to show the type in the various scenarios of life. Overall I would have rated the book a 4, if it were not for the little things that it was missing.   If you want to be well-rounded in your assessment of yourself, get this!  .

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoy the book.  It has a good ending, although I don't know why the writers of the story, Mr. D. P. Chaddick and Mr. S. B. Dennison, felt the need to make the final page in the book such a cliffhanger.   Would I buy a book with a similar ending:  I would not read a book like this, unless it was written by the same people.  I don´t think it would be a good choice for children.  It´s like a big fat page turner.  The main character doesn´t do anything except wait until he can catch the killer, then he kills him.   The story starts in a very interesting way, with a discussion between the main character, his brother and his friend.  While the three are talking about the recent murder of their parents, they all notice that the town has a strange feeling about them and their murders.  They realize that the killer doesn´ve been looking for them and doesn´T want them to be the next victim, that is until their new neighbors appear.  What follows is a great mystery that I enjoyed.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********   I'm a newbie to books, and it took me a couple of books to get my head around what a real author does (I'm sure this applies to most newbies). However, now that I've finally gotten to grips with it, I like it!   The first time I read it, the narrator was not clear, so I had to guess the story's progression. However, since I guess that's what we want (I would love to know if my guess turned out to be right), it's okay.   Now, I know I'm late in the book, so it might be a good idea to read it before you rate it. So, do I rate it high or low? It depends on the narrator. I could just say, "I found it confusing at first, but I got through it eventually. I enjoyed it", but it's still quite subjective, so let me just say this: It's an interesting read, but not for everybody. There are a few things I don't get, like the relationship of the main characters, which I have been wondering.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is good. You should read it. I found the writing and the story to be enjoyable and I will be looking for it when it comes out. I am looking forward to the next one. -Sandra O.  What didn't :  -The language is quite crude. As in, we are all still learning  the language. I'm sure it would be great if he could use an English  word here and there, but you don't hear the word "naughty" or "nay" so much in  this book. -He talks a lot about the "trend" of women in the book and this  is just silly. The women in this book are all prostitutes. Some of them  have no business even being in that profession. I think the author might  be trying to get a laugh from his readers, but they would have a hard time  appealing to the female reader. It would have been better if he had a  substantial plot line with believable women. The sex scenes with the  young women were also not too bad, but the author could have done a  of good job with them. -The descriptions of the women's clothing  were too similar. Sometimes the descriptions were a little far fetched,  as in one description of a woman that had no shirt on, so I would have to  question her clothing choices. -If you have a problem with the language, just  do not read this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________ If you have read anything I have written for other people and are looking for the same, you should read "The Best of All Possible Worlds". It is a collection of my favorite stories from a galaxy far, far away. I just finished reading the "I Am Not Your Mother" story and found it to be, well, perfect. It is, in fact, the best book I have ever read. The writing is just so good. The stories are just so vivid and well written. It has really made me fall in love with this series. I also enjoy the "Eclipse" story. It's a great story and well worth the read. ____________________________ (review of free book)  Review by: Lina on Jan. 03, 2015 :  This was a really great book. Its a story about a human and his robot friend, and the robot has a really interesting way of being able to make mistakes. The story has great emotional, psychological and philosophical elements, which I liked. There are also some cute and funny moments in the story, and this was one of my favorites. I think it's a really good story, as the characters are well developed. One thing that I did not like was the use of the word "robot" in the first part of the book. If you are going to read this story, I suggest changing it to "human" or "robo", as it makes it a little awkward.  I also don't think there is any need to read the last book of the series, as it is not a continuation of the first story in the series. ___________________  (review offree book)

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is amazing for anyone wanting to get into the world of the undead. It is an excellent blend of fantasy, horror, and science. What did you like best about this story?  It is well written. It uses a mix of horror, sci-fi and fantasy to make you fear what lies ahead for the main character.  The main character is a brilliant scientist in training who comes into contact with a race of undead scientists.  What didn't you like about this book?   This is an interesting premise. It could have been really interesting if the characters involved did not make it so hard for the protagonists to win.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I bought this book after reading a recommendation that it might help to teach one about a religious person's struggle with the fact that he or she is homosexual. I've had many discussions about this subject and found that I was not at all sure about all that was said.   A great introduction to the subject of homosexuality and how it is viewed today in the churches.   and one that I will probably recommend to many others and will encourage them to get a copy!   My only comment is that the author had the right of free speech to write this and I believe that most people would agree that it was good to have the freedom to write what is in their own opinion best for the world.   this was a great way to learn and be educated. *************  4 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  My only complaint about this book is that it takes a very long time to get to the real story behind the film. This book only covers the film and a very small part of the story.  If you have no knowledge of the film, you may miss out on the most interesting aspects. The book is not a complete history book, but a very detailed analysis of what happened during the making of the movie.  I liked it more than I thought I would.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first sentence of this book explains a lot: "As the first female pilot in the Army Air Forces, [I] felt the weight of responsibility to fly the first jet-powered plane." This book is an excellent description of the challenges that young women had when they began their military careers. The story of how a little girl could become a pilot is a wonderful one to read. She was just a little kid with no training when she was drafted. She had to figure out how to fly. She could barely walk around with a plane. What an amazing adventure. This book could also be considered "The Girl Who Cried Wolf". But in the end it does not matter what you call this book. This is the perfect story for a child to read, to learn about the sacrifices young people make in order to serve their country. "I will always remember my father telling me that when I was older I could go back to school and learn to fly." The first part of the story I was able to finish. I am very disappointed, I was expecting a more exciting and exciting story, and instead I got a very down and sad story, a very depressing story. I think it is an accurate story, but I would not recommend this to anyone. If you are looking for a light and fun read, try this book! "I could hear the roar of the engines. The roar was loud and terrifying." I had the same feeling when I first started reading this book, but this time I just kept my head down. But the author did a very good job with her first story. It was the first time I had ever seen an aircraft take off. I was totally taken back, by how low the aircraft were. It is a real treat to have a picture from the era of an airplane take-off. This story was so unique that I think I need to read the others. I did have a great time reading this. Thank you for this wonderful book.
Write a positive review about a good book: ******** I've read a few books by G. K. Chesterton, and one thing I can never understand about him is why he's not in the pantheon of great British satirists. He's not really British but English and, apart from that, I think he really gets under your skin. (Yes, it's a bit of a dig, but you'll have to forgive me for it.) I also liked The God of Small Things, which had me laughing out loud a few times, and a few others. If I'm lucky, I might try his other books next. - David J. B.  Review for A Prayer for Owen Meany by David B. (A Prayer for You, Owen Meantone, A Prayer For Owen Meanone) I read A Prayer of Owen Meatey as a lark and I was very pleasantly surprised with the results. It's not your usual work of fiction and I enjoyed it immensely. The character development, the world building, the plot, the humor, the characters are wonderful, you won't be disappointed. - Mark P. . I was also really enjoying The Godmaker, this book had a little more depth to it than most of the other books I've bought in the past. This is a fun, fast read and a very good read for a change of pace. - D. J. H.  the main characters are interesting and likable. Owen Meancey is the protagonist but he is a very likable guy who doesn't deserve the name God but is much too good to get the moniker. I didn't really like the characters for a while but after a while I enjoyed them and really grew to like them. I'm very glad I read this book. - G. J  I think I have to agree with G.J. on this one. I like that they are all very likably. - A. T.  (3 out of 5 stars) I enjoyed A Prayer Of Owen Meadey but I also found it lacking in depth and it didn't make me feel any closer to any of the characters or their struggles, which, really, makes the book a bit pointless. It also was very short and not very good at setting up the world as the other reviews have mentioned. - J. M. , which is another great book, and the story was well told. I love it when books are so well told that you just want to

It'll be useful reading for students, business school graduates and anyone else interested in the world of capitalism.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ I'm a long-time reader of this series and I really enjoyed all of it.  I've read this one as well, The Lost King, and was a fan of all three.    I would like to give the books that I don't have this 5-star review, but since the author's done a lot of work, I can't give 5 stars to all of them.  "The Lost King" is a re-release of a book originally published in 1997.  It's a new edition, but the book is the same.  The original book is set in the 1930s, so you get some scenes from the 1930's in this one.  If you loved that version, you'll love this one too.  Although I love the Lost King series, this one takes the cake.  My rating: 5 stars

Write a positive review about a good book:  "If you like the first two, you'll really like this one." I had heard about this book when I read The Dragon King and this was my first time reading a fantasy novel by a woman. This is the second book in the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. She started the series when she was a young woman and I am loving the series now that I am in my late 20s. This book is a continuation of The Dragon Reborn. It was very good but it does not follow the same story lines as The Dragon Prince and The Dragon Throne. There was a few things I enjoyed but there were others that I found irritating, such as the "spoilers" of The Eye of the World.  The first book I read in the series was a fantasy classic. I have read many of her books and am a big fan of Robert Jordan's books. The Dragon Princes series is one of my favorite series. I liked this book very much.

What I liked:  -The author has an easy way of explaining things and getting in to what he's writing about. .  of the story's plot: "This is the story about a young man, who had a difficult time at the start of his young life. He was the son of an African immigrant family from Nigeria who arrived in America in the early 1900s. He had a great start as a student and soon realized that his family was very wealthy and they lived a very privileged lifestyle. For the first three years of his childhood, he lived in a small apartment in Manhattan. The money came to him from his father and he lived comfortably, but he was often anxious. In a way, his father was in a position to teach him about life, because he didn't make a lot of money, and yet he had an amazing family life. After his father died, and he returned to his childhood home, he realized that everything was gone.".  The plot: This book was very interesting and a lot to think about. The author made a strong argument that this man had a very troubled childhood and because of that, he had a hard time growing up, he also lost some of his opportunities. He could not get a job and he couldn't get a good education. His mother would send him to Europe when he was 14. I really liked this book because it made me think and think about my life.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A great book for reading aloud, I enjoy this one especially because it was written in the 19th century, I feel that my voice was really captured in this one, this was my first book on vocalization and I felt so accomplished reading it, i recommend this book for all ages. It is a great book to learn and to read in a class or home. Thank you for the great book.  Rated 5 out of 5 by laurielle123 from Great introduction to vocalization We purchased this as an introduction to the science of phonology. This is a wonderful book and is a good introduction for students that already have some familiarity with the science. It covers the physical properties of sounds and the principles of sound production. The text is also easy to read and has lots of illustrations.  has an informative subtitle that is very helpful for the student. it is a short but interesting book. i highly recommend  rated 4.5 of 5 stars by sashkari from Vocabulary is great!! A nice, simple overview of a fascinating subject - vocalization. I loved the examples in the text; the author writes like he knows what he is doing, and it is very easy to follow. I think this is an excellent book for anyone interested in learning how to create their own speech sounds. The book covers the fundamentals of vocalization, and in addition covers the anatomy of the larynx, as well as the sound and articulation of other sounds like 'p'. The chapters also include useful sounds, such as 'h', 'j', 'k' and 'b' and also some examples. I found the book very readable and easy to navigate. It has a wide variety of illustrations to help in your study. All in all, a good, accessible introduction to what is a very fascinating subject.  at the beginning of the book, the author explains how each of the sounds in English sound different depending on where you are in the mouth. It was helpful and informative to me. , i would recommend it to anyone that is interested in vocally and singing. the illustrations were very useful.  that was great!!! i like the sound system. at first i didn't understand what a word meant. so much so, that i had to read the whole book to figure out what to do with my words. but, this book is very interesting, and i learned a lot. that was really fun! i learned so much. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   You won't be disappointed if you buy this book. "The Darkest Darkness" by Alastair Reynolds (2005) I have always been fascinated with the vampire subgenre. I read a vampire story as a teenager. The first book that came to mind, however, was "The Twilight Zone", which I read in third grade. I liked the vampires, but the characters were very clichéd. This book follows the story of Alastor, an alcoholic vampire hunter and his vampire wife, Anna. Alastorn, as he is known, is a very charming character and is extremely skilled and good at his craft. He has become the perfect vampire hunter. One day, while hunting a vampire on the grounds of a bar, he is bitten, and his powers begin to awaken. The vampire he is hunting is named Thomas, but he soon discovers that Thomas and Anna are a couple. He becomes a vampire hunter as well, and with Anna's help he finds Thomas' lair and manages to fight him off. I loved the fight scenes, the action, the tension. Alistor's story was very well written and Alastro has a wonderful way of making readers feel that he is an ordinary man who has extraordinary talents. This is the first book in the "Alastor" trilogy and I believe it will continue to be popular with readers, because the series is very well executed and the characters are very likeable. I received my copy of this book from my local library. Alastorn's Daughter, by Alistorn Reynolds (1986) Alastorian, an ex-Vampire who lives in a small town, falls in love with the daughter of a friend. He falls head over heels in love. Anna and Alistorian's son, Henry, is born. Alista and her son, Alistaron are not well off but she still loves her children, and Alisabeth, Alastori's daughter, is raised as a vampire to be Alistoric's vampire heir. Alisabet is given a vampire's "pumpkin" of a blood transfusion, which makes her strong and deadly. In this book we follow the Alastoro family. Anna, Henry and Alista, and Henry's mother Alisbet are all in love, though the relationships are not always as close as one would hope. Anna begins having nightmares of her mother and is afraid she will one day have her death in her own mouth

Write a positive review about a good book: _________ I first read this book in 2002, a year before I got a job as a librarian, so I hadn't read much SF, fantasy, etc., but I still remember being amazed by the stories and the vivid prose. I just finished the second book and this book is even better. I'm a fan of urban fantasy and sci-fi and this series is one of the best urban fantasies I've read, with the only flaw being the "goodie two shoes" hero who has to deal with a female "protagonist" who's very annoying and doesn't really have much to do. (But that's not enough for me, since the author is quite good at writing female characters, too.) However, this story has a sense of humor, and I like a good story with humor, even if it is a comedy that is also a tragedy (or the reverse). I still have not read the second installment, but I hope that the sequel will have more humor, more of a "funny" story, and more action.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I am a bit sad to say I've finished reading this book. I'm not sure why...I've already started the next one and this one...and...well, it feels...so...boring." (Read full review) This book is an interesting read about the world of magic and demons. This book is not easy to read and for me it took about 8-9 hours to finish. The book was also very long and I think it would have been better if it was shorter. I do think it was better if the author just told us what we needed to know rather than telling a whole novel about demonkind. There were a lot of characters and I felt like there was just no time to get to know them. I loved that the author started off with the very basics and then added on to it. I also love that the demons have a lot more personality than the angels. I like that the angels have a little more of a character and have to deal with a lot less. The author was also great at giving the reader insight into the demons and their life and how they felt about it. This was really cool and it helped a lot with the book. The demons did have a very good time while trying to find a way to stop their master from killing them all. This is a great read and you should definitely give it a shot if you enjoy books like the Hunger Games or Twilight. The book is written in a very humorous style that I liked a lot. You have to keep your wits about you while reading this. This is definitely a book that you will have fun with. It is a very exciting read and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book and I am so happy I read it! It was so fun and informative! It made me think about my religion a lot! It helped me remember why I am Catholic and why I still believe in it! I'm still learning and loving all the aspects of it! Review from another book club member:   Thank you so much for putting together this book group. As someone who is not Catholic, it's so good to see a real, honest look at the church and what it's like inside of it. I loved how you went over how they handle sex and masturbation, and how you gave an honest look into the Catholic lifestyle. I don't know if I would have gotten through my own life without reading this. From another friend: ... This book is just fabulous. I wish I'd read it sooner! From someone who hasn't read it yet but loves the idea of it:  I think you've hit the nail on the head with this book. As I've started to think about this religion more and more I've come to realize that the Catholic Church is actually not a religion at all. I'm a born again Christian and love how you put so much into your story. I think the Catholic church is more like a cult. I can't imagine why so many people continue to belong to it, as this is so incredibly damaging. I'm glad that you're still getting feedback from people. I hope we'll be able to get more books on religion. I know I'll be buying them in the future.

It is interesting to see the range of arrow types, the technology involved, and the economic and political factors in the selection and use of various kinds of arrow."

Write a positive review about a good book:  As an adult, reading this book made me realize how much I still love books like this. I love books that let me be a kid and read books that are meant for kids. When I first bought this book, I was very skeptical. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I was so scared that I wouldn't like this book. I've been a big Harry Potter fan since the beginning and I always had the same feeling about the books, that they were too difficult and unrealistic. My book buyer agent even tried to tell me that Harry Potter was "boring", which is so ridiculous because everyone loves Harry Potter!  I've been reading this for years and always have a good time doing it. It is funny and sometimes it is sad too, but I never get sick of it. I am so glad I read this book before I got a book for my younger son (who I am pretty sure will read the books when he grows up) because this book gave me some great laughs. I also loved that my son, who is only 3, could relate to a book about Harry Potter.  If I were a Harry Potter-fan myself, I probably would have a lot of questions, but he just loved it!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is great. I bought the book last week.  It was my first time reading a book about magic.  I've had the books and videos for a couple years but I had never read any of the stories or stories told in the book.    This book tells the story of what really happened to the boy.  If you are a fan of magic, I would say buy it.  Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I had heard about the book, but I had not read it yet and I am happy to say that I am now one of the very lucky readers and have read it all. This is a superb book, a masterpiece. I love this author, this world and this book. If you like Harry Potter, if you love stories of courage and redemption, if this is true to your tastes and if you want to read a book that will make you wish you were in the story, this is the book for you. The ending has a sense of hope and resolution that is rare these days.   I have read several other books in the series and while I was enjoying them, I wanted more and I was looking forward to this book so much that I read the previous ones in the meantime and then bought the last in the same series. This time I bought it before the release date so I could have as much time as possible to read it. I got it on the day that it was released, the day I was supposed to. It came in the post in a beautiful box with a message on it that said: 'To be one of my many and last books I had to finish the last. It was not easy for me but it was for you'. I'm so glad that this book came to me and I have finished it. The story is so good that I didn't want to let it go! I loved it so much. This book is the ultimate Harry Potter book and I'll be happy to own all of the books in this series.   the review is only for the book and the experience of reading it.

Very well done. . - Melissa.    review of a good books:      the cover is very evocative and the book looks great. the writing is excellent and this was a good read.   not a fan of the ending but that's the story and you can't blame the author for changing it to what they wanted. I have read many good stories this year and I can honestly say that this is not one of them. I liked this story and the characters, I loved everything about the characters except for the end. I know that this was originally published many years ago and it was probably cut because it is difficult to adapt a very popular story for a younger

Write a positive review about a good book:   I got this book off the library shelf and bought it because my wife and I were looking for something for the holiday that had more science in it than we've had in a while. So we were a little skeptical and didn't know what to expect, but as soon as I opened the cover and saw this beautiful book, I knew I had to get it.   It's the first book I've read about this kind of phenomenon that I really enjoyed, and I think it will appeal to any science enthusiast. The book gives a really good overview of the evolution of the brain.   the science is pretty simple; and yet, I felt it had a lot of explanation and the author does an amazing job of giving the details.   I also think he tries to explain it as simply as possible, and that works for me, and it made the book go down easy and I didn't get frustrated while reading it. The illustrations are beautiful and add to the reading pleasure.  ..   I'm really glad I read this book and hope to see more of this kind in the future.  ,
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ It's a very good book and I learned a lot from it. I learned some useful tips for when I make a mistake and get overwhelmed. It taught me that it's never easy to get started on a new hobby and learn how to do it. It taught me to think outside of the box and really see the possibilities of what could happen when I combine my knowledge of programming with something that I find fascinating. This book is also good for the people who are interested in learning programming. It's not about the same kind of thing as many books. It focuses more on the nuts and bolts, making sure you have all the tools you need and how to learn the language so that it becomes second nature to you. It isn't all about learning how to make something, that's a great skill and you'll learn how later in the book. It is mostly about thinking, about how you think, how you make sense of it all and how you can build things in your head. _______________________________________ It really makes you think. It helps you think of new ideas, think about new ways of solving problems. It teaches you how to think.  I was also able to make a small thing that is on the back cover of the book (and I think it might be a movie).  Here is a video I made from a YouTube Video I made earlier this year about the book that I like it a lot I think this is good for anyone who is interested in making things on their own or for anyone that just wants to understand how stuff works.   The book has many sections on how you should go about learning new things.  It has sections on making games and making computer games as well as other things. The main topic of the first section is "The Game Design Process."  This section covers everything you need to know to get a start in game design:    This section also has a few other great sections as well:  There are three main parts to the book: (1) a step-by-step process that explains how to get start in creating games. (2) tips on how to develop games.  (3) a series of games that can be made using the techniques in the steps in this book.  In this book there is a list of games, examples of what games can look like and also some sample games that you can try.  Each game is self-contained

I'm not normally a fan of historical romance but I am glad that I picked it up. It has so many twists and turns and twists and twists! I loved the description of the house, I was so surprised that the house is from the early 1600's! My favorite part was when you have a group of people gathered at the house and suddenly the house moves away and a carriage comes with the Count and his maids and they're gone. I thought that was great, I really loved it! Thank you for putting it all together for us!" ---Diana R. - Santa Barbara CA
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is a great read with a unique and entertaining viewpoint. I enjoyed it so much I wrote a review! Review:  The Book Of The New Sun is the first of a trilogy by Robert Jordan that began in 1989 with The Eye of the World. This is a standalone book that can stand alone, but I do believe that it is an important beginning in the series, even if you have not read The Eye Of The World. I know, I know....the series has been over for some time, but we are so lucky to have an author with such a unique style. The world building is phenomenal, and the characterization is also excellent. If you are looking for something unique to read, this one is for you. It is a must read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I'm a very picky reader. For this reason, I have to get through some books before I read others. However, I'm now hooked on this one... this book is a true pleasure to read. The author's prose is easy on the eye and it is very readable. There is also some mystery/suspense in the story that keeps me on my toes! There are many things I want to do, but I don't want to be an outlaw. So this novel is about a young man who is traveling through England with a new friend who is the son of a notorious outlaw and a beautiful but dangerous lady."   -   I wish I could recommend this book more than I have already! It really is a very good read! It is a fun and engaging story full of suspense, action and excitement! You will not be disappointed! I have not read any of the other books by Paul Chadwick and can only recommend this one to anyone who loves good books and the suspense of good mysteries!
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must read for anyone with an interest in biology, as it gives a great overview of many important topics that a beginning biologist needs to know. The book provides a number of examples and real life examples to help the reader get an idea of how to build and maintain a laboratory on a small budget and it does it in a very well structured and organized manner. There are lots of great resources that are freely available on the web that are invaluable for the beginner, but the book is much more user friendly and has fewer errors, but still, it's the best book I have found to get started in biochemistry and biology.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to become a graduate student or a post-doc and can not afford to go to a school that offers more advanced courses.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------  Very good and informative, as is typical for The Economist.  What I liked:  -The title  This is not really a'review' of the book - I think it is much more. But, it certainly shows the author's knowledge about the topic, and does not leave the reader thinking, that this topic is not that interesting.  the author covers everything we need to know about the state of the global economy  The book covers the global crisis, it's causes and effects, the impact on the US and Europe, and the possible solutions. I read the 'About Me' section, which explains the author.  as a general, there is not too much that needs to be changed, I think. The biggest point the book makes is that 'capitalism' is dead, it is over. The whole discussion about the failure of the Eurozone and the EU is not only based on the fact that they have failed to deliver on their promises. The authors point out that there is no other way to get out of this crisis. This is not a shock for me, as I have been saying for years that 'everything is relative' (this can be interpreted as 'everything that isn't capitalism is doomed to fail').  I think the most important point is that the 'free market' that the European people have been used to, and used to being told that they would be living in, has been destroyed. It will take a long time before the'market' can be restored, if at all. 'somalia' has been replaced with a world of chaos and misery. We are living in an age of'socialism'. The question now is, why?  We now live in an era when our 'enlightenment', our beliefs about what is right, and what is wrong, are increasingly seen to be the same thing. , not only is there no 'economic democracy' to save us, but the free market, as the author states, is dead. The real world is not like the one we have been told. . It is not always the same world we live in. It does not always look and feel the same. This 'globalisation' may be over, but it is far from dead. There are other forces at work, not mentioned by the author, in our world that have caused it to die, and will continue to cause it to do so. And,

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________ [The Little Prince] By Antoine de Saint-Exupéry The Little Prince, (1943) This is a classic, and one of the very best stories ever written. The story concerns a poor boy named Chénier (Antoine de St. Exupéray) who was kidnapped by a man who later turns out to be a prince. He is given a magical book which gives him the ability to travel through time. He later gets captured and taken to an evil castle where the king wants to marry him to one of his daughters. After escaping, he rescues his friend Pépé from the same evil castle. Together they help the princess defeat the evil king and marry her to a prince who has his own magical book. I haven't read many of the other St.Exupier books, but I have read some reviews and have enjoyed them all. The Little Princess is my favorite of his works and it is definitely a classic.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book and the way it takes a look at the history of the human race with a good dose of sci-fi and fantasy.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I really enjoyed this book. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I think it could use an update or revision. It's very easy for a beginner to get lost in the details of the book's history, and the ending isn't always satisfying. That's why I only gave this 4 stars, but the sequel is really good.  Write a negative review about something that sucked: _____________________________________________________________ I really want to like this book, and I really like most of the characters in this book because they were interesting. However, the writing is terrible, and while I was waiting for the next book, I found it so irritating. There is no real sense of tension or threat that is going to keep me reading to the end, and you get some truly bad pacing, which is really frustrating since it's supposed to be a sequel. If I wasn't so bored, I would've rated it higher, but it's just too much.

Write a positive review about a good book: *******************************   I really enjoyed the story in this book. I also enjoyed the cover art by the author. The description is spot on, with the main character's attitude of "I will take what I want" sounding very right to me. And the main villain's attitude is a bit, I feel, overblown, but you'll get a feel of that when you read the story. It's really not that bad, and the ending is interesting. I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys horror.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very pleased with this book!  It's not only one of the more well-written books about the Holocaust, it is also a very moving story, both of the victims and of the perpetrators of the horrors of the Holocaust.  The author brings the reader inside the mind of one of those victims, and through his eyes we see the horror and helplessness of those who were left behind to live out their lives in the camps.    I loved that the author took time to explain all of the important details and that he brought the reader to the camp as they went through their lives.

Write a positive review about a good book:  What can I say?  I love this book.  This is a great read for anyone who loves a good thriller.    This story is told from the point of view of a young man who is a little bit out of his league.  He goes to a party and starts drinking.  At the party a group of men starts to gather.  They are all quite attractive.  One of them has a beautiful wife with whom he has an affair.  Eventually the other men start to join in and the younger man finds himself attracted to the attractive women.  The first scene was amazing, the second one was even better and the third one was amazing in the way it showed the transformation of a man from a loser to a man with self respect.  As for the story and characters,  they are well portrayed and it was not easy for me to follow them.   What I liked: the story was interesting.  It was well paced.  I liked the idea of the "men of the night" and the way the characters changed from being losers to being men.  There was also an interesting and funny couple of characters. What I didn't like:  I had difficulty with the women.   The "young man" had problems in life and the story focused on him and his relationship with the "woman of the house".   It seems to me that this is a very difficult character to bring to life.

The book was amazing. It was everything that I was looking for and more. The information was interesting and helpful. The photos were amazing and well chosen. The writing was so good that it made you want to read all the other books in the series. This book covers everything that was covered in the Field Guide. There is a section about birds and their habitats in this book. I also loved the information that was given about what to look for in plants in the desert. This is the type of information that I need to read. Also there are several pages with photos of the animals that I had not heard of. The animal photos are amazing. The pictures are clear and crisp and the animals are shown with great detail. The animals that we know about are shown as well as some that are unknown to us. I would recommend this book to anyone that is looking for information about the deserts in this country.

Write a positive review about a good book:  In this book, I learned how to identify the symptoms of depression (dysphoria, apathy, lack of motivation and social interactions), and how to treat them. I found the information to be very useful, and the exercises helpful. Read a positive reviews of a positive book: "It's an excellent book for a long run, especially those who suffer from depression. The exercises helped me see that my symptoms are not all in my head." "This is a great book on what can be done to help with depression and how." Read negative reviews of negative books: The "how to live a happy life without being depressed" book is so lacking that I was actually disappointed. There were no exercises, there was no advice, it had absolutely no insight into the "why" of depression. So much so that I couldn't get it into my head, and felt that it would be a waste of my time to try and read it. I couldn not tell if I had been reading a good or bad book, and found myself getting very irritated because my friend was still telling me how great a book I just read, but I was not reading it. The books I found to be the best were: *  This one was interesting for me because the exercises and information are so valuable. It is a little long, but it does go into all the little symptoms you might feel, and has information about how to get out of those symptoms. *   It is an excellent guide to understanding the "what goes on in your head". I think I will start taking this as a reference when I am struggling with something. The book covers a lot of the things I have heard before, and offers a very helpful analysis about why things happen. I think it is a good idea for a person to get a book like this to read, as that will provide a good overview of all the information, and I have found it helpful to refer to it throughout my life.

If I would have known about this book I may have taken advantage of the pre-order and ordered the other books in the series before I finished the one that I really want to read.   J.B has a long and fascinating journey with an author that is the real winner of this book. This is my favorite book by this author.

Book Review: "An Eye for an Eye" by William Kennedy "An eye for an eye. That is the only way to solve a problem like this. It is an ancient and enduring rule. But the only thing new about it is that we have so many eyes. There is no rule against using all of them in a well-managed and effective way. It's a problem as old as mankind itself. For ages it has been dealt with by the most complex and intelligent mechanisms that mankind has ever known. But something's gone wrong. The world has been made worse by an act that could never happen. Something else has to change. Something has to be done. The only problem is, how? For one thing, a new rule will be necessary. An eye for one eye. But it won't be easy. What will a country do when it can no longer rely on the protection of its own army? And the best way to do that is to start by telling every man and woman that every time they open their eyes, they'll be seeing something they won't soon forget." We've been there, too.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I think this is the best book on mental illness that I've read. It is the first book I've ever read by someone who is a licensed mental health professional. And while this book is not meant to be a treatment manual, I think that it is a powerful, yet easy read for anyone with a mental illness, whether they have treatment or not. It doesn't seem to have much to do with therapy, as it doesn't have any of the things that are used in that. It focuses more on how the individual may be acting as if he/she is "off their meds" (which is where the book starts) and how to treat this. It's also very specific in the advice that is given. It really just boils down to not taking medication when you want to do so. Which is something that I have struggled with and still do. If someone has told me that they don't want to take medication, and I haven't told them why I am telling them that, then that is a problem. And if I tell them something like, "If you want more than you need, then you can take medication" then that may not be a good decision. Because I want to be in control of my life. I want something that is going to be beneficial to me that I can continue to take for the rest of my days. I think this book will help me a lot in understanding this more, and it may help someone else. I am also glad that the author isn't just going to tell me what I need to do. I found that a lot of the advice was pretty vague, and you just had to go and figure it out yourself. It was a lot like me as a kid, trying to figure out my parents' divorce. Or going through a breakup, but instead of trying to find someone to give advice to me, it was just me trying to understand why this person was making decisions that I didn't want. You will have to put some time into reading it, and even then I am going to say that it was a slow start. But the more you get into it, the more it will help you. The only down side is that I felt like there was some things that didn't make sense. I had heard of the idea of a "bad seed", and that there was a part of the brain that made you want things more than your brain needed. I never knew why, but there was definitely something going on

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ The Black Vault by Mark Langley My first experience with this author was a good one. I bought a copy of this and listened to it on my ipod before reading it. There were two things I found that made me like the book: the book is short, and the characters are unique and interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy, science fiction or mystery. My next read will be a novella. The Black Vault is about a group of people trapped in a time warp that was discovered on a deserted island and has been there ever since. The main character is Sam (the middle aged man in black) who is sent back to his own time with the other survivors. The book starts out slow. Sam has his problems. He is an alcoholic, he is very arrogant and he wants to be the one to find the time vault. The other characters, the others who are trapped in the time warp and who are a little more experienced in this time are a bit of a disappointment in this book. I think the author realized it. I like how all the characters were unique and well developed. I enjoyed reading it, however, I did not enjoy how well paced the book was. The only thing I hated was that the book ended with Sam, the alcoholic character, being stuck in the future again and the end of the book came before the time jump. __________________________________________________ The Shadow Thief by Elizabeth Bear I really liked this book, it was fun and it had some great twists and turns. It was also a quick read. The Shadow Thief was about a woman who is stuck in a fantasy world and she has to do everything on her own. It has some action and magic and a good twist at the end. ________________________ The Secret History of New York City by Mark Z. Danielewski I read this book before I read The Dark Tower because the latter takes place in a similar time period. Both books are set in the same world. I actually enjoyed this book a lot more than The Dark tower. I liked this story a lot. The characters are different and I like the story and the style of the writing.   The Dark Tower by Stephen King I haven't read this before so I will just give it a good rating. It is not one of my favorite books, but I like it a lot and I think it will be enjoyable for anyone who has read the other book and has a love
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________This book is about a girl named Anna who has a severe mental illness and gets the same treatment as other children. She has all her life been seen as a bad little girl and has never been able to fit in. Anna gets a home-cooked meal and her new family shows her how to be an adult. I am so glad that I read this book. It made me realize that I am very lucky and that I have a wonderful family who loves and takes care of me. I wish that the way my family treated me was like Anna's.I would give this book 5 stars if I could. But I couldn't, so I'm only giving it 4 stars. I don't understand why the author doesn't show Anna after the meal. When she's at her lowest it is so sad to see how her family treats her. It was so good that I can't bring myself to read another book about a bad case.
Write a positive review about a good book:  " The best book I've ever read" - a wonderful introduction to the many problems associated with the war. "The best book" - an excellent introduction to some of the great evils of the war and a real eye opener "A powerful, lucid, and clear exposition of the fundamental problems." - "A very clear exposition." -"An excellent exposition." "I highly recommend this book." If you like this book you should also read " The Good Soldier " by Robert Rossen. Rossen is a member of the USMC and also teaches at the USMA, the U.S. Military Academy, and was a Vietnam combat correspondent. A must read for anyone interested in the war in Vietnam. You should also check out " The Hidden War: The New York Times and the Useless War in Vietnam " by Daniel Yergin and " The Vietnam War: America's Last Battle" by John Lewis Gaddis. This book was released in the same year as the Pulitzer Prize in Drama. It was a Pulitzer winning play written by William Shakespeare. This is how I would describe it. It follows the exploits of a young soldier, an "average" guy who thinks he's good enough to join the army but he's really not. When he meets a girl on a bus he gets his first real taste of Vietnam, but it's not a pleasant one. He's the first man on the ground in a firefight. He loses his arm to a machine gun round. He sees how he is left with no choice but to turn a Viet Cong soldier over to the North Vietnamese for revenge. It's a wonderful read, but I was so disgusted I didn't want to finish it. There's also this movie about a Viet Nam veteran and his wife. It shows them in their early 60s after they have made it through the war, the husband a professor and the wife a professor at the University of Miami, they have a beautiful family and enjoy retirement in the South Florida. Another book I can recommend is " The Enemy Within: The Inside Story of the Korean War and the Birth of the CIA" by Peter Dale Scott. This book is a history of the Vietnam War from the start to the end. You should really read the whole thing, it's fascinating and fascinating. Scott describes how the CIA, as we know it today, started, where it got its name, the secret war against the Communists in South Vietnam, the military
Write a positive review about a good book:!!! I'm so glad I bought this book. It made me realize how much I do not know about my health. The fact that she is a medical doctor, as a writer, made it easy for me to relate to her and to understand how I can change my health for the better.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________   This book is full of great ideas. It can be a useful reference book for students, teachers and parents as well.   1. "A simple, yet powerful way of learning how to learn"   A lot of the books here are very technical and not very intuitive. This is not the case with this book. It is not a math text but it is still good for those who want a practical math text. This book can be used as a learning tool as well as an aid for math teachers and teachers of any subject.   the author breaks down the concepts into bite sized chunks that are easy to understand and use.  - The most important idea of the book is that you need to understand how you learn, not what you learn.  .   This is very simple yet profound. It also gives a great idea for how to improve your memory and make your own learning routine.   of course there are also exercises which are very interesting.    This book covers a lot of ground. It covers topics in different time frames and in different levels of understanding. It includes a lot from basic to advanced topics in math. There are chapters on how to teach the basics to children and also on how you can implement this with adults. This will be a great reference book to teachers, parents, and students.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very informative and will help you understand how your body works and how to heal the damage that has been done to your body through years of over-use.  It was great to learn more about my health problems and see how I have been holding myself back in the past.    - Lisa - January 10, 2018  Great book - The title was misleading because it's not as "bio" oriented as I thought it would be.  The subject matter and the scientific process is very interesting and it's easy to follow the instructions given.  For the price I paid I was very satisfied and will use this book again and again.  - Nancy - January 2, 2018 Review of "Exercise Physiology for the General Practitioner"
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought the book on impulse and I had a great time. I loved the way the writing flows and the plot keeps you hooked. I really did like the "dying to find out what happens next." I liked the story that was told with the beginning and the last half of the book.   The book took me through some dark places and I felt sorry for the characters. I didn't feel that the story was over before I realized that things are not as good as they seem. I did feel that this was a great first book for young adults and that it would be interesting to see if this book would get better.  . I liked this book. I had fun. It was a good story. I enjoyed the characters and the story line. It didn't take long to get into the book and I finished it in a few days. I will definitely be purchasing more books from this author. I have one more book to finish and I plan on reading them as fast as I can.  , I had to stop for a few months and write a review and I haven't picked it back up since I started reading again. I read it during my son's first year of middle school and I really enjoyed the writing flow and the mystery. I love how the character's are very unique and the way they talk to each other. I am sure if I were a child I would enjoy this book even more because I don't know how this book will be remembered because the ending is sad and the ending isn't what you expect. I hope the author would come back with another book because this was such a great beginning to the author's future.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________   I really enjoyed this book, but was left with a few concerns. The book seems to me to be missing the real power of storytelling in fiction, because the events that we see happen are so random that the main character has no control over them, and I really didn't care at all about the consequences of events that he could not control (or at least to the extent that he wished he could). I was also somewhat concerned about the characters, as they seemed fairly shallow.   The first half of the book dealt with the birth of the hero's father, who is an alcoholic. The father is a good man who loves his son dearly, and the son tries to honor the father's wishes in every way that he can, but when his father is killed, and he must decide what to do, he loses his entire world. It is quite easy to sympathize with him, because in the first half, the man doesn't seem to have anything at all to live for. As the events of the war pass, however, the father becomes more and more selfless, giving up the son to save others. We realize how deeply the father loves his own son, and how much his son must feel. It was an incredibly heartwarming story, and it really brought the entire book to a close with an ending that was perfectly satisfying. It would have been better if the father had been an alcoholic and we had gotten to know the character better, because I found it confusing that a man could be so nice while still being a drunk. I didn't mind the character, but I would have liked to know more about him.  The second half of this book dealt specifically with the character's son, who grew up to be a soldier who was killed in combat. The young man has very little in the way of a life outside of his job, and we can see how much the mother cares for her son, despite him having no control or say in his life.   he is a wonderful character, and while he is not the main focus of this story, he is so much more than a soldier. He is a person, who has dreams and ambitions of his own, who loves and cares for his father and the people of his village, who cares for those around him, who does the impossible (even at great risk to himself). I found this section of the story especially affecting, because it brought me to tears. It brought me into the character with
Write a positive review about a good book:  "When I started The Good Earth, I was looking for something new and different, and didn't really want to read anything about the environment, or climate change. I got The Good Climate and am so glad I did. It is a very well written, well researched and well presented book. In a world that is still in denial, this is a timely reminder for the future of our children." "A fine book about how to get to the future." "I love this book! I'm a teacher in elementary school, and I've worked with many students who were curious about the science of climate change, but who had no idea how to discuss or even know anything about it. This book gives them the tools to engage in the debate, and also helps them to see it from an individual and personal point of view. The students are much more interested in the science than the political. This is such a great book to give to your classroom, because it will inspire a much better understanding of what we do have in common as human beings, and how we can work together to solve our problems. We have no time to waste in finding ways to create a healthy planet, so it is imperative that we make the effort to make it happen now. I really hope that this book, and the students who will find it useful, will be part of the solutions we need to move forward, and stay away from the dangerous misinformation and misinformation that will be spread. Thank you for writing this book!"  - Michelle Z.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The whole book is fascinating, it is written from the perspective of the author's husband. The author is a very well informed and well respected medical professional. The book covers a number of subjects and the author does not limit himself to only those. The main points that he made are: How to get rid of the fear of cancer.  How to deal with cancer in the present life  The benefits of getting a healthy diet  What is the difference between cancer and AIDS   All the above points are important and well written. The authors' wife and her battle with the disease has also been included. The point of this book is to help people understand the disease and understand their own personal health problems better.   In conclusion, I can recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a better understanding of cancer and the fight against it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book is really an excellent history of the development of the U.S. nuclear weapons program. It is an excellent and comprehensive history of how the nuclear bomb evolved over the years, how the weapons were used, how they were destroyed, and what kind of use was made of them in the Cold War.... This is one of the best histories of the Cold war that I have read..." --M.P.D.   ________________________________________   From: Peter H. Dunkerley   To: Dr. J.P, C.F.   at:   Date: Sun, 3 Jan 1998 13:03:02 GMT  Subject: Re: Re a comment on "The Last Innocent Scientist" - Nuclear Weapons from the Soviet Union   Thanks for the comments and questions.   the nuclear weapons are the key to victory in a nuclear war, so the reason that the Russians developed them first was to dominate the world by using them and so the strategic advantage they had over the United States was to develop a better nuclear arsenal. I think the fact that we know exactly how to build and how to destroy the weapons is one reason that they would have been used.  , but this book gives us an insight into the strategic thinking and nuclear strategy of the USSR. It gives us a look at the decisions that were made at the highest levels. You can imagine that these things were very carefully considered, particularly when you look at how important and how devastating nuclear weapons can be when used. I found this book very interesting and very informative. The authors, as well as all of the other contributors, were well researched and highly informative. This book was very well worth the time and money spent to read. I highly recommend it.  .. -- Peter H   http://www.nukemuseum.org   My reply: This book gives an interesting insight into what we can expect from the nuclear arsenal of the US and the Soviet's nuclear arsenal, and also into their political approach to the issue of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union decided to develop and test their nuclear weapons as early as the 1940s, when the Nazi Germany began producing its own weapons. These were based on the German V-1 and V-2 rockets, and they were able to successfully put them into service during the second world war. However, the USSR were very quick to use this technological advantage, first with their first nuclear bomb, tested in

I was very intrigued by this fantasy world and the characters. It is not only well-written, but it also had so many plot twists. The characters were complex and interesting. The story, however, could have been better if the author was not such a perfectionist." What did you like about this story? What didn't you like? "The main character is very likable and I think her actions were quite realistic." Do you want to read more stories like this one?  How can other readers improve their reading skill?

Write a positive review about a good book:!!!  I love this book.  So the good news is:  1. It has lots of great tips and practical information.  the best ones, by far, being how to choose the right gear.  said no one ever, the equipment, how to stay cool, how and where to climb, how high to anchor, how NOT to mount a rope for the first time, how not to clip your rope to your anchor, all the ways of clipping and unclipping, how best to belay while in an air pocket, how much gear to have, and how to take care of all the things when climbing and hiking.  of course, there's also a ton of information about belaying (i'm sure there will be some really good belay techniques and techniques to remember)  the rest of the information is just great. . ,,  .   I loved the book and bought it for a lot of reasons:  a. The gear descriptions are very clear. they explain what each gear is and how it's used in their application. b. The tips are easy to understand and can be applied to every situation i climb or hike in. c. The belay system is explained very clearly. d. How to belaying with a safety harness (or a carabiner or something else) is explained.  to sum up, i love the gear descriptions and the tips.  on the other hand:  that belay section is boring. at least in my book. this is the first belay advice i read for any reason. so, i don't like this one too much. in any case, it is a great book. the gear is detailed and it is the reason i bought the book. i will definitely get it again.  in any case i would like to thank the author.  at the end of the day, it was a nice climbing book with lots of practical information (how to make it fun). so thank you!

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you are new to the genre, this is a great one. You get to watch people learn. Some people are like "oh my god I can't believe I didn't think of that" and you can see it happen in the classroom. Other people get really upset when the teacher says something stupid and you feel sorry for them. They see that they can't change it, but you can. It helps them realize they can learn so much just by watching. If you have kids in school, you should pick it up.
Write a positive review about a good book: ************* [This is one of my favorites. The book is great. It is full of stories and information. There is a lot of information and it is very good. The descriptions are very good and I liked the stories as well.]  "One of the most exciting things to happen to the world over the past 100 years has been the advent of electronic computers. They're not just about playing games, they're also used to create a new kind of entertainment--to do everything from creating virtual reality, and making the Internet a reality, to playing the stock market in real time or even creating your own computer games. The first time I watched a movie on a computer screen, I thought I'd died and gone to Heaven, as if my mortal body were not capable of such things."  (Review from Amazon.com)  This is a very important book to me. It brings new perspective to my view of life.   It is not perfect by any means, but it is a good read, full of interesting stories and interesting figures from the history of computers. It also has some of the best images I've ever seen of computers from the 50's to today.  It's easy to see the great advantage computers have over us, which is also why I wanted to see for myself.  the book is short, but if you need to be reminded of the amazing and important history of what has been called "the Computer Revolution", this book is a must.

Write a positive review about a good book: ******************** This book is a fantastic book for the general reader looking to learn about the life of the Buddha. The author has put out a collection of the suttas from the Pali canon as well as from other scriptures and has also compiled a detailed index which will give the reader a good overview of all the information. It is a very interesting and comprehensive collection of information. This book will provide the reader with a very good background on the life and teachings of the great master.

Write a positive review about a good book:  We went to see Mr. Houghton's play last weekend and I really enjoyed it. It is quite a dark book, but a story with hope and heart, it was very well acted. It was interesting reading the other side of the story, that of the child, he came from a poor family, he had a very difficult childhood, he went to a very poor school, and now he is a talented lawyer, he loves his children, and he is quite an inspiring figure and the children all love him. The father, I felt sorry for him, he is not the type of guy that is ever going to be able to do well in life. The children were all loving and the mother too was very affectionate. We really enjoyed the show. I highly recommend the play, it is great."
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________   A fun book that is worth the read. The way the author shows how the character reacts to different emotions was very well done.   The characters were interesting, likable, and all had their different personalities and goals.   the writing was fast paced, it was like watching a game play out at your house, not a book. It has a great feel and a great story.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________ I was surprised how well the story flowed.

Write a positive review about a good book:  http://bit.ly/1v6Kt7K The first time I read the novel, I didn't get what the point was. I knew there was going to be a "coming-of-age" part, but I was hoping it would be more of an introverted story where the girl's first crush isn't a boy. But as I read on, the plot really took hold, especially after the third book.I'm an adult who has only read one other YA novel before, and it was written by a guy. I think I'm a bit more comfortable in the YA world than a guy would be, so the fact that I read this book made me feel even more at home in it. That said, I do hope the YAs I read from now on include more female characters, because they are definitely needed.It's a good idea, but with one major exception. There was some sexual content in this book, mostly between the characters, which I can see being a bit jarring for young girls. But it was kind of expected, because it was about love, and how the main characters would do anything for each other. I really liked it. The ending was touching and very believable. I hope other YAs take note.

There are also various chapters on the world of politics, economics and history, as well as on various forms of spirituality, such as Taoism, Buddhism and Christianity. I find that many books on history of science, such  I recently bought This book was a great read, and it explains the workings of the world a little better than what I've seen in other books. The only problem I have with the book, is that some of the information in the book is somewhat too obscure for me to understand, and I could see it being very confusing to some. However, it is not too much of a problem, as the information provided is still good, and makes a good addition to my library.  A great read. Very interesting subject matter.

The acting was wonderful for the characters. the narration was great. this one was a great choice for a listen.  :)   I have been wanting to check out this book since it came out a couple of years ago. I found that I can read it in one sitting but I am not sure how I could do that with a group or at least the way I did it, I was having to skip a lot of pages. Also, this was a bit long for me at the end.   of course, I could find a better book at Audible so if there is a better one out there, let me know and I will give it a try.   for the moment, I'm going to enjoy this one as much as I can.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very cool book, and I am not a fan of superhero stuff. But it's a fun read, if somewhat slow, and it gets into the psychology of the characters very well. I found a few flaws, such as the characterization for a large number of the super heroes, but I was interested in the psychological underpinnings of why they are who they are. I've read some psychological theory that I believe works to explain the development of human character, but this is not what was being discussed. But I think I read more than I needed to in this one, so I may read the other two in the series.   I will be adding to this review as I read further.   the author did not present everything that was going on at all times, but if you know the characters and their back story, you could figure it out.

Write a positive review about a good book: ******** This is a great read! I bought this book because my daughter asked what my dog would do after a house cat left the door open. She had some experience with wild animals, and said that a housecat could probably climb into a closet and get lost or worse! When I read this book, it was clear that the animal would be scared, as she was. I also realized that her fear was based on her previous experiences with cats, which makes sense since she lives with them now. However, when I read the book, I learned that this fear was also based on the fact that her cat was very protective. I could relate to this cat! This was a very good book to teach dogs not to go in the house when cats are around. I definitely recommend it. My cat is still scared though. :)********  New customer  My two dogs love this book. They will always go to the yard when the cats are out.  Doggy Time  I have been giving this book to my dogs since it was first published, and I have never had a problem with any of them jumping into their beds at night. My dogs are so happy when they can read this to me because they realize that they shouldn't go out when the cat is away, and they have learned not to jump into their bed if there is another cat in their bed. I especially like to read this at night when my dogs are already asleep.  of 9. See all 7 reviews

It is truly wonderful to see how the characters and settings from this book have been used in all kinds of other stories.  a very well written book, that I could keep reading! Thank you!

It sounds to me like she is the real witch here, since her characters are real. ...  I purchased this book, a few months ago, and haven't put it down. It is a great little read, that makes you think. The stories are very creative, and Kate Bush is a talented storyteller. I can't wait to see what she does next.  it has a very unique voice and style of storytelling, and is fun to read. ,  The best part of the story was when the author explained why this is a "horror" book: There are so many scary things that happen to humans. I find this really interesting, and I think this explains the popularity of these books. The characters are very realistic,
Write a positive review about a good book: ***************************** This book is one of the greatest books ever written. It tells the tale of a world in the very near future, and the people that inhabit it. It's not an easy read, because the plot is a little slow, but it really does make you feel like you're watching a movie. I don't know about you, but this will make a great Christmas gift.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I had fun reading it. I did read the book over again after I read the first chapter." - John S. Read more reviews I've read The Dragon's Path before and thought I would read the sequel. I am glad I did. I found the story of the book to be compelling. I loved that the author had to explain why it is that the gods don't allow the creation of children with the gods, especially when it comes to the two main characters of the story. I was also glad that the book ended on a cliffhanger rather than with a series of unanswered questions. I also liked that the story did not follow any of the typical hero's journeys we are familiar with. The author explained why the gods had to intervene and it was interesting. I would have liked to know more about the gods and what they had to do in order to stop the child from being created. I do like the ending of the third part of the series. It is a surprise, but it does make sense. - Anonymous I have just started reading this book. I read The World Made by Hand in 2006 and found it to be quite good. I liked the story, I liked both the main character and the antagonist and I liked that I didn't know the main characters names before reading it so I could see who they really are. I'm currently reading the sequel and find it to a much more enjoyable book. My favorite part of it is the ending. I have read other reviews and others have also found it much better. This book has many great elements: excellent writing, a believable plot, a good main character (the Dragon in this case) and a surprising ending. The ending is definitely my favorite part. I really like the character, the author and the author's writing style. I think you would enjoy this book too.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ I read "The Secret" as I had been recommended to do so by a friend who loves science fiction and was looking for something to read that she wouldn't regret. I'm now reading the sequel "Suspense". The first book was a definite eye opener and I'm so glad that the author took the time to flesh out her world. I look forward to the sequel.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********   I have been searching high and low for a book about my life and the challenges it has faced - how much it has suffered. This is a fantastic book about the way the whole experience has affected me and I will cherish it.   The author takes you into her experience with the disease, through both medical and psychological perspectives. She also includes her first child at a very difficult time. She goes into depth on all aspects of the illness and her recovery.  , as with all the others I have read on this topic, the author has a very sensitive and sympathetic approach to her subject matter. This made her story a joy to read. I loved her compassion for her family.  . I have found that many people who have been through serious illnesses, have a strong sense of how they were treated by society, and how they had to deal with the challenges they faced, in a particular life event. This was not the case with me. I was not treated with compassion or care by anyone.   a wonderful introduction to cancer and its treatment, which includes lots of real-life examples, and lots of advice for those facing this illness.   in terms of the writing style, it could be a little too short, but I thought it was a very good, straightforward and enjoyable introduction to this illness and its treatments. I found myself thinking 'I could do that' as I read the book, and that helped.   to the author, the book is a masterpiece of writing and I'm sure that she has a lot to learn from her own experiences, and I think that she is a brave woman to write about her experience in the way that she does.   I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is faced with cancer.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Great Leap Forward (The Communist Review #40) by Hugh Thomas, 1973. It has been an ongoing battle to expose the true history of Mao Tse-tung's China and the role of Khrushchevite revisionism in its development and the disastrous results of this revisionism.  As a result of this,  this is one of the better books on the subject. _______________________ What you can do:    Send this book to as many readers as you can. _________
Write a positive review about a good book: ~~~ The Good: I really liked the storyline, the characters were all likable and the humor was well done, especially the references to the previous book. I had a great time reading this, it made me laugh out loud and got me thinking. The Bad: There are a few problems I have with this book. One, the ending. At least it's not a cliffhanger like so many other books. But it was still a little too rushed for my taste. Also, I found the description of the book very confusing. I can't figure out why they decided to use this particular language in the book. The only thing I learned is that they made a bad apple into a good apple. I don't know if they were trying to say the opposite thing or what but they just couldn't quite figure it out. There are other things I don "like" about the book but it wasn't enough for me to buy it. So if you're a fan of the series then I would recommend this book to you, but I don' t recommend it if you haven't read the first book.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________________________________   "A fascinating and provocative account of the origins of the modern nuclear age and the first real struggle for world leadership between the United States and the Soviet Union." (Nuclear Weapons, by Steven Aftergood)   This is a great read on nuclear strategy, with an interesting take on the Cold War and US nuclear strategy in the late Cold War. I think there are many good and interesting points to take away from this book, but I will focus on just a couple that I think are especially worth considering.   First, after having read books like The Limits of Nuclear Weapons, I didn't really know much about the US nuclear triad (US, Russia, and Britain's nuclear arsenal). I'm happy to say that The Limits to Nuclear Weapons makes me know a lot about the triad and the ColdWar nuclear strategy that was based on it.  's is a very thorough and well-written book. I would definitely recommend this book to someone who is interested in nuclear strategy.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This is an extremely well written, carefully researched, well-researched, well put together book. The author does a fine job of presenting the history, political and social issues of the time period. She tells it clearly and in a way that is easy to understand. There is a great deal of background material, background which has been well presented, which should help an author. There are plenty of examples of women in the field and an examination of the role that women had in politics and society as a whole. This is a good, informative book."  "The only thing that is lacking is the political and intellectual depth of the period. This book is not to be read for that. This could be a great reference for an introductory course in the history of early modern Europe. I suggest that it could also be useful as a textbook for students of the area, and to anyone interested in the social, political, and intellectual history of the era."
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Lost City of Z: The Search for Lost Cities of the World, by David Grann, is a very good read.  It has been around for several years and has been very well reviewed by some of the great writers who write about travel and travel writing.   It is, by all measures, a must read for any reader interested in history and geography.  On a side note, I highly recommend the book to anyone who has ever wondered what happens to cities after they are discovered or lost.  The lost city of z (named for the novel) is the result of a quest in which the main character travels to a series of countries that are known to have vanished without a trace, and attempts to uncover the reason.   The characters' journeys take them to Mexico, Costa Rica, New Zealand, India, China, and Vietnam.   In the process, they encounter many characters, including a number of scientists and historians.  Their adventures are documented in a variety of ways and provide the reader with a variety if stories that have a bit of everything.  While not an easy read, it is definitely worth it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A must read for any collector, the writing is flawless and the book is an essential reference for the history and future of the hobby. I love the historical background of each toy and the details about how they were made. Read a bad review of this book: The book is quite good but I could tell it was being rushed to market before it was complete. The illustrations are great and there is much more information than the cover of the book suggests. Unfortunately there is no explanation of what the pictures are showing, not even how to use them, so I ended up scanning the book and then re-reading it to understand what was in the picture. I was also surprised that there were no references to the books and articles in the book, which is a pity. I suspect that the book will be rushed through and the author will be forgotten before he has a chance to get a proper publisher.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________ I really enjoyed this story. The characters are likable and very well-written, and I really liked the way the story was told. I also loved the art. I've seen this story on the Internet a few times before, and it really did give it a great shot. I like the author's humor, which is a big part of the book. I especially liked the scenes between the two main characters, who have to find each other when they've been estranged for years. ___________________________________ Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good book: ***************************** I read this in a weekend for an exam and I learned so much. It was really interesting and easy to read. I really appreciated that it was so short, and not long enough to require studying. I think that I will keep it in the back of my mind and maybe read it when I am studying for my next exam.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great read. It made me think about what it means to be an individual and to be a part of a society. It's important to think for yourself, not to fall for the government/other people telling you who you can or cannot be. As a person of color, this book was a great reminder of how to be yourself and not get caught up in the oppression that people of color have to go through. It is important to remember that being yourself and being true to your values are actually two separate things. I like that it's not preachy but the point is still important. It reminded me that I should be my own person, I can change my own mind. Thank you for sharing the story of a woman who tried to do the right thing, who was wrong for the right reason.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "My favorite book of 2014" "...a superb book that gives a voice to an understudied and unrepresented group of people." "...A book that we as an audience have a unique opportunity to explore, to empathize with, and to challenge, in an accessible, fascinating way." "My friends and I both have a hard time getting away from this book, despite how many times it's shown up in our lives. I'm glad that my friends and family can enjoy this great book as much as I have." Why this book is the best:  I love this book because it is a must read for every person in the world who is part of the LGBT community!  "If there's one thing I learned reading about the transgender community, it's that our lives are complicated." One of the things that makes this book special is that it is an example of a non-fiction book that actually reflects what being transgender feels like to an actual transgender person. "In her writing, she captures not only the experience of being transgender, but the complexities of living a full life as a trans woman." The authors are all incredible people. I couldn't have asked for a better book. I was completely inspired by them, and am inspired by their book and everything they do. A must read book.   Read it.
Write a positive review about a good book: ****************************** This was a very nice read. I found it very well written, and a very unique look into what the average "normal" person does during their free time. Although not a fan of the word "crazy" or "insane", this book was definitely filled with enough crazy to keep us entertained. As a former therapist myself, I found the book very well done, and I enjoyed the "crazy-factor" of it all. I especially enjoyed the way she talked about the difference between "normal behavior" and "being crazy". The book was very well thought out and written. It really made the point to not be afraid to speak your mind, be vocal, be open with people, and be an individual, as opposed to a group of individuals. The "crazies" are there for a reason. They are people just like you, who have had similar experiences and have managed to get past them and have become successful in life. This is something that you can do, if you choose to do so. This book was a must read.  A good read for mental health professionals, and those who care about others.  with great insights. .  of 9 found this review helpful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read a lot of books about the human body, and this one is one of the best I've read.   I learned a lot about different body parts - from the hand's unique structure and muscles, to the internal organs, to how muscles and bones are connected - and the human anatomy, along with the physiology of the immune system, made me realize I had never known about before.   (The book is so interesting that I have almost forgotten it's self-help title.)   The author discusses in great detail the physical responses to stress and stresses throughout the body, including hormones and what hormones are involved in different situations. She provides an overview of the brain's different areas, and how the stress of life and the stress we experience as women can affect us. The book makes you understand that it is a different story for women as men, especially when it comes to how the brain works and how we respond to stress in a different way than a man.   in fact I was surprised that the author, even in an article on the subject, mentions the author of this book (she doesn't mention her by name - this was before I started reading this book and I haven't read other books about women in our lives) and is very complimentary about her knowledge and what she knows. I did not read any other books like this until I read this one.  . I can only hope that it will make more men aware of their own bodies and stress, so that they can take steps to deal with their stress before it becomes too much. (I am a male and am learning how the male brain works, which can be a major stress to deal when women experience their own stress.)   and for a while I found this book helpful, but as I read on and learned more about the author's subject I realize how many of the concepts were not explained in a very clear way, and the book was not as well written as the other books I have read about the same subject, including the other self-pubbed ones. However, there were some concepts that I found very interesting, so I can recommend it, but still some parts that I feel I could have known if I had been warned about some of the terminology I may have been used to.   with that said, I would definitely read more about women's stress response and I would recommend this book to women (male or female) who want to understand the way their own body responds to stress,

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________ I've enjoyed this book more than I expected. It's an interesting take on how people react when they have a very real and urgent fear. I have a problem with many of the things that happen in my life - being around other people, the constant fear that someone will find out I am disabled - and have been terrified at all times of losing my friends when they found out. I was shocked to find that this book takes us from the very beginning to a point where our fear is real, the fear that we might lose our loved ones, and I was able to feel the fear of the loss in the book. The stories are not in chronological order - it's not the reader's job to figure it out - but it would have been nice to know where the reader was in relation to my fear, how my fears were going at this point. I've read reviews saying it would be better to read the story in reverse - that they would read it from the point of view of the person with the disability and then the first time through it would read from the perspective of the other person. I think that is true - but the perspective I prefer is the one of the protagonist - she has a good life and is able to cope with the fears she has - which isn't always the case. This is a good story.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book after I was already a fan of The Chronicles of Narnia. I wasn't expecting too much from the book, and I think it didn't live up to its potential. It was interesting, and it has a lot of fun ideas but I don't know how much I'd want to read more of it. Overall, I think this is an excellent story, and would recommend it to fans of the books and to anyone who wants to see a more modern take on classic fairy tales.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "You should know that this book is about a girl, who is a part of the family, who dies during a family emergency. When you get to the part of that book that deals with the death, you will learn some things. I just want to say this book was very touching.  I enjoyed it a lot, and I would recommend it.  The most important thing to me about this book, is the author's description of the world. I loved the description of what I think could be a real place.  " "What is called New England?  "   "The land of trees and woods.    It's not an exotic place that people don't live in anymore, but it's not something exotic, either, not anymore. "    The author does a good job making it seem like it's just like the real world.   "   The family goes on a long journey, and eventually the mother dies."  "And that's it."

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* This is a great book. I recommend it to anyone interested in the human condition.

I'd like to know more about this man. He seems to have made a tremendous impact on me. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a great story of human existence. *************
Write a positive review about a good book: *********The first time I read this story, I didn't believe in it. I have to admit it, I thought that "the gods" was too easy to read. I couldn't get my mind around how she could be able to control all things and she can't even remember what she did. But this story is worth every bit of your time. It will keep you interested through the whole. It is a very interesting story about how a man found a piece of a piece that was used to find the piece that is used to stop the god from coming back. I thought this story was awesome and I loved reading it. It was a little confusing to me at first but I thought it was quite interesting. I hope you will enjoy it too.*******I've read several of Robert Heinlein's books. They are not all the same, but I will list them in my opinion. I love all of the works, especially the Martian series. I just recently finished reading this new one: "Aurora". The whole story was great and it took me a while to finish it. The author had created such an interesting story with his characters and it's really good to read his books. So I'm glad he has created a new book that will be worth your time and effort. It's just like the last book, except I'm still enjoying it. This book, though, is very different. It makes you question things a little bit. Some of my problems with the author of this book are, the "god" is described as "God" and is the same "God". I can't believe he's going on for pages and pages with this description, just as he is describing the "gods" in his books, I have always thought that was a bit strange. I can understand why people would call them gods, but some of the "God-like" characters I encountered during the book, they were not very memorable. One guy I know, he was quite a nice guy, he made some good points about religion and the nature of man, but his "God", if you can even call it that, did not fit. There were times I thought, "this guy is right". There is an old saying, "don't tell me why, show me". And the "Aursa" character, that is what he is, he did not do this. If it is all true, and that is my personal belief, and
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This is a very good book about "poverty porn" and the work of two very talented young women. They were both working in poverty porn at the time when their story was told and the authors have said so. The work of the two women is so realistic. The girls had no idea they were doing anything wrong. They had never been to college or had a job they considered "real" or did any sort of job where money was not an issue. They are real people, they have their dreams and they are trying to make them happen. The book is so detailed and they have so much information that you never really get bogged down in a book about poverty porn. The best thing about the book is that it is very much about people that people like and do not really care about. If you are interested in poverty or are just looking for a good read, this is a good one. I would recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:     I really liked this book, as do my friends. It was just like having a good friend tell you about their life. This book was so interesting I had a hard time putting it down. I especially liked the "discoveries" section at the end of the book. It gave me a good perspective on what's really going on in people's lives and what is really true. I really liked the fact that the book includes such great stories about women who were abused. They showed how these women are still trying to find themselves after the abuse. It makes me sad to think that most women will never know the satisfaction of living through such abuse and that most will have to carry it for the rest of their lives, but I am glad that my friend has made the journey and found a way to find the satisfaction that she found here.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book. My wife and I both got excited about it at the beginning and then we both started asking questions. My questions were, who the hell were the "others" in the pictures? They seemed to be taking pictures of everything in the room not one person. Wasn't the book supposed to be about people who are missing and there was only the people who were with them in the film and not the ones who were looking for them?

He is 5 years old. I wanted to see if he liked it. This was a great read! He was very interested in the people that were in the photos and was looking at the pictures more than he was talking about them. I did love it because it gave us insight on what life is like for people with some disabilities. It is good to read when you are in a good mood." - A. G.

He loves when he sees all the characters on the pictures and what each one is like. So much so, that he is asking us questions about what is in each book! I also liked how the pictures were written in a way that the children can understand them and read them. The kids love reading the pictures, and they love being around the characters. My daughter has been asking if the animals have arms. The other kids love seeing people on the back of the photos. I read the book to my son at bedtime and he couldn't stop reading.

Write a positive review about a good book:  What more can you ask for? I had read the author's previous book, a fantastic and entertaining book in its own right, The Way of the Knife.  While I thought the book was brilliant, I had to admit that there were some things that had a slight lack of depth.  And I have a huge soft spot for a story with a big heart.  But this book was much more than a well-crafted tale of heroism.  It had the heart and heart-stopping action and adventure that I had grown to love from his other books.  The plot in this novel, as you might have guessed, was extremely interesting, as was the action, and was just plain fun.    So I will give the author credit for that.  While the ending was certainly disappointing, there is certainly a lot more in store for the young heroine.  Even though she is the main character, this was one of the most engrossing, engaging, and fun stories that I've read in awhile, and I look forward to the next installment. It's been a while since I've had the good fortune to finish reading anything by a first time author, but I was eager to read this one.  I had been a fan of the series, and thought that it had had an ending.  The ending here was very disappointing, however, and the book had not quite delivered on the promise that I'd been given.  For me, I needed more to read to fully understand the book.  As it is now, I am going to wait until the next book in the series before I consider reading it again.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "I had the privilege of getting to know John G. Fuller through his amazing book " The Human Face of God ". The book takes you through the journey of a spiritual man in order to get a better understanding of his relationship with God. Fuller, by the way is the same author who wrote the book "I, Jesus". I enjoyed it and think that it will help those who want to discover the real purpose of life and spirituality" "I really enjoyed this book. John G Fuller makes us think in a whole new way when we consider the nature of God's existence. It is a nice refresher course that will help us look at life from a different point of view." "If you are not sure about whether to be afraid of God or not, I suggest this book." If you like the way this book was laid out, read it on-line at: http://www.kingsfield-citizen.com/Books-on-Faith/G-F/ The Human face of God by John G H Fuller An illuminating and thought-provoking book, The Human  Face of  God   offers an entirely new vision of God from a variety of points of view. It examines God as man and as creator in an attempt to understand who he really is and why he is the way he is. This innovative approach to God, which has a strong emphasis on the power of thought, raises fascinating questions about the relationship between religion and science, theology and philosophy. The book has wide appeal from an evangelical perspective to a humanist one. In The Humanface of God   he argues that God is far more than a disembodied force, but rather a being that transcends our narrow human perceptions of who he is and what he does. This book is an invaluable addition to the growing literature on God.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this one. It was fun and made me think more than just the average book. It does a good job with giving you more to think about about as well as the characters and situations.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This was one of the funniest, most well done and most engaging stories I've read in a long time. There is plenty of good stuff going on here with the little children and the adults, but the humor is a bit too broad for me.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________ I found this to be an incredibly well done book. I've found other, better books that have been more entertaining, and I don't think the story of my father's mental illness was well written. But this book is a very informative book that shows his illness and struggles. It does it well and I do think it is worth the read. I would like to see the author write more books that show different people with mental illness. And I would love to see more in the way of psychological research about mental illness, or mental illness in the family, or the effects of mental illness on work or in society. It is a shame that the authors have not gotten much positive feedback, because I would have loved to hear what other people thought about this.

I had heard of him through a friend who is a German teacher, and of course she knows a lot about German. He was the German author of the book, "The Secret War." I had always been curious to learn more about what goes on behind the scenes in the modern world. I bought the book. It is a really good book.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________ It is a difficult story to read because the narrator is a little stuttering. His delivery and his mannerisms sometimes make it hard to understand. The writing is easy to read and I appreciated the use of the third person voice. It is interesting to read a story in the third-person and it makes me remember the story and the characters.   ___________________________________  My rating: 4 stars   My favorite thing about this book is the end. After you read all of the characters, the stories, the backstories, the plots, it all ends. You're left with a question, "what would you do?" How would you deal with something like that? What do you want to do?   There is a quote in the book that I think sums up my thoughts on the end of the story:   I don't think you can ever really escape the questions that are haunting you. How do you love someone who is trying so very hard not to love you back? How do we live with each other when we know that there is no way we can ever be together? How can I go on and live my life with someone who just cannot stand me? What will I say to her when she asks me to leave, and I'm too hurt to say anything? What should I say when she is angry, and she does not seem to understand that I am not angry with her?  .

But when they arrived, there were more than just evil waiting for them.   Author's Note:   In the original draft, I planned to set the beginning of this book in 7,000 years in the past.

In the late 1990s, a small group of researchers and ethicists began looking at the ethics of research that aims to enhance the abilities of humans and other animals for our own benefit. The debate was about whether this was ethically permissible, and the results had a profound impact on people's views about human/animal collaboration.   the human/mouse experiment, where mice were placed in the cages of their own kind, but in a very different world. What could have been a simple test became a moral and ethical battle between humans and mice over the use of each other as experimental tools. How could mice have become so much more than mice and vice versa? What role did empathy have in this struggle?
Write a positive review about a good book: **********  I have read many books about the war on terror and, on the whole, I agree with what the author says: that the only true victory would be to abolish the war. I would add that he makes a strong case for ending the war, including the obvious need to do so now. I will review it in more detail, but the basic points are sound: the war has created an unnecessary and unnecessary terrorist threat to our democracy and to the safety of our citizens. This is true of both Iraq and Afghanistan. It's a tragedy, and we must do something about it, in a way that does not exacerbate our enemies, but at the same time does not further their goals. ************  See all 5 reviews by this author
Write a positive review about a good book:   You are so right about "Horseback Rider" being a great book. I read it when I was 17, and it really changed me. I had so much fun reading it.   The book is about a man called "T. B. Smith" who rides from city to city, carrying a horse to sell on the roadside. He goes from the Pacific Northwest to the Eastern seaboard to New York City.  , an American Indian. Smith is a Native American and he has to be treated respectfully because he is Native American. It's not a "good" book in that respect, but it's an interesting book and I'd recommend it. You can find more information at   Review:  "Horse Back Rider" is a great read, and I'm glad I've been able to get my hands on it. The first thing I noticed about this book is that it contains information about a Native Indian (T.B. Smith), the history of the Indian tribes in the USA and how they were "rescued" from extinction (you have to go back many hundreds of years to find the last "pure" Native Americans), the Indian Civil Wars (that were fought between the US government and the tribes), and the Native American Civil War. The book also provides more information about the First Nations people living in North America.   is a "novel" that explores the Indian and Indian wars, the early settlers, and the development of the American culture. In the early days of the USA, the Native tribes of the west were the only people living on the land, they had no land of their own, and they were hunted by the "White" settlers. This book goes into a lot of detail about how the Native people in the west survived and how the Indian wars were fought, and why they had to be fought. This novel, for me, was a real eye-opener. The Indians were treated with respect, and a lot more than in many historical books. The Native American culture that this book was written about, is unique and fascinating. Also, I like how the author took the Native history and added it to the American history, because that's how America is now, and that's part of why the "civilized" people hate us so much! If you don't mind reading about a certain time period and culture, this book could be for you.  . There are so many great facts about the

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  The problem with "The Big Picture" was that it made no sense, but it wasn't that hard to explain. I didn't like this book at first, but I've come to understand the importance of its message. - October 16, 2016Great  Reviewer: s_c_h_m - favorite favorite favorite - March 14, 2014  Subject: a classic for the ages.   This is a classic work of social theory, a great introduction to the field of social interaction. It is the classic work on hierarchy and the role of institutions to create a hierarchical society. It shows that hierarchy is not a natural fact of social organization but a product of social institutions and that this has been a great challenge to the social scientist.   This is the perfect book to read during the course of a college education and the perfect textbook for undergraduate social science. It's one of those books that if you think about it and come to terms with it, you can see the entire scope of the problem at hand. In fact, I think this book is a bit like an explanation of the history of science. The first time I ever read it was in high school, and I have studied and taught it ever since.  : I have no idea who would have picked this book for its general appeal. But it's a great book if you are trying to get started in social psychology or a related field. It provides a fascinating analysis of how all institutions operate and explains how this helps or hinders people. It also examines what people like to do about their social organization and what the role is of those institutions in creating that social order. The book is the standard, the standard by which all others are judged. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in social phenomena. If this is your first introduction to social psychology, you should read it before reading anything else. I've also found it very helpful when working on the problem of motivation for research and for teaching. The authors take an analytical approach to the study of social structure and structure in social institutions, something not always appreciated or applied in other areas of psychology.This is the great book about social order (or order of social events) from the perspective of hierarchy. It uses the metaphor of the ladder to illustrate the relationship between institutions and social order as a result of which people do what they do.The authors have a very good view of human sociality and of its historical development. They don't over-inter

Read it and laughed so hard!!! - March 12, 2010A great comic book  Reviewer: JohnnieG - favorite favorite favorite - August 17, 2009  Subject: Great work and fun, but a little dry This is one of my favorite comics from the 60s, and has been on my list of things to read for a long time. But this one isn't nearly as fun as the last three.   This book is about a group of boys (one is a girl and she is a little girl) whose parents and grandparents decide to get a dog together and name it "Buffy", with the boy naming it "Fred". Buffy ends up having a bad time, but at the end the boy and his mom go to a dog pound because they say she is just a dog.   a few things about the comic...   1) The comics were done in black and white. The first few panels were also colored. But the color is faded and washed out.   It also seems like there is some compression on the pages. This is really the only thing I don't like. I really want this one to be a lot more fun.   (the book was printed on heavy stock paper, but I think it would have been better to have done the book in full color)   2) The comic doesn't come out of the gate strong. It takes a little time for the characters to settle in and get to know each other. Also, they all have this one thing about them that makes them stand out - it is this really intense look on their faces as they are talking. This makes the book difficult to read.   of the first three books I've read, I have to say this is the worst of the three. (the next is the most fun, and it is about kids fighting, but it is also about a lot of other stuff) - August 18, 2009Great work and a little dull  Rated 5 out of 5 by Zebu from One of my favorites I was really looking forward to reading this and I am really enjoying the book. My only complaint is that when the dog has a good time they can be in the house all day. Not the case with this one.

First, David introduces the core concepts of game theory that underlie the field and then he goes on to explain why the game theoretic approach to politics has been so successful. Next, he gives examples of important issues in international politics that are best dealt with using game theory, and finally, he considers the ways in which such issues may be addressed using the game theory approach to political decision-making."

A great story told in the most imaginative way possible. There were several plot twists that I never thought could happen but in fact they did and really set the story apart from most books. I really love how the world was described and there was a lot of detail that went into the history of each of the different places mentioned. There was also a lot more of a story built around the characters in this book and made me care about them more.

I liked the way it had the characters react to each other in different ways and how they had different views on the world around them. All of the characters were likable.

I have enjoyed many books that deal with the life of a single mother but this book did it justice. This was a true, compelling story of how a single mom is able to survive and even thrive. The first chapter set up the story and set up how the reader will feel after reading this book. The second chapter was where the book really started to shine. I am in love with the characters. The author gives them all depth and as a single woman it was a real gift to find a father figure in the book. As the story progresses you will see all the trials and tribulations of the characters and they will have to learn how to survive. The ending was unexpected and a real twist. I'm sure that people will really enjoy reading this.

This is one of those books that really should be in every library, but as an adult with limited space and time I have to admit that it is a tough read for me to get through in a single sitting (but that is just me).   The story is really well written. It takes us through a day in the life of a mother who has a child with special needs. The book has a good mix of humor and drama, and it has a nice little romance at the beginning. However, after the first few chapters I found that the main plotlines and characters were moving too fast, and too far ahead of the story and characters. It was almost as if the author was not sure how many pages she was going to be writing before the next chapter. There was a definite jump in POV (although I am unsure if that is supposed to happen), and I really felt that there was not enough space to develop the different aspects of the main characters.   As for the story itself, the author seems to write very well in a very short time frame (and has no doubt written many other books in the same timeframe). But even though this is not her first book, I think she should take some time to develop her characters a little more. The story is well told, and the characters are well developed, but I felt that the author did not have time to really develop them as real people, especially after the quick first chapter. The ending felt a bit rushed, and for a book this short, I would have liked to see it develop a little longer.     There are a lot of books out there that you can read as many times as you want, but this book really wasn't one of them.
Write a positive review about a good book: ~~~ "I have to admit that I haven't read all the books that come with my Kindle, but I have read a couple of them and I love them."   I'm so pleased to see my review here and in such high regard.   As others have mentioned, this book is a great read.   the writing is great. the characters are interesting. there are many scenes where the author shows us a different side to the protagonist and her mother. the story is well paced and well told.   is is easy to follow as the author does a good job showing us the different characters from the start.   it is also interesting to see the different way that the mother thinks. I can understand her point of view on some things, and I can't help but think about other mothers out there and what they think. I also understand why her mother thinks the way that she does. It makes me feel like she is not as crazy as she thinks she is.   with all this said, I am going to stop here because I just don't know how to start writing about this book. I guess I'll start by saying that I loved every part of this book and that I am looking forward to reading more from this author.
Write a positive review about a good book:  " I've been meaning to read this book for years now. The first time I tried to start reading it I stopped because I was frustrated with a couple of the characters. I know it was just the first couple of pages, but the tone was off and I didn't feel like I'd gotten into the story. I still really wanted to, but after rereading it, I'm glad I didn be patient. A really good read! "

Write a positive review about a good book: _________ (this can go both ways, and sometimes it is the best review)   This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is amazing and well written. There are no dull passages in the book, as it is filled with great detail and well developed ideas. It was interesting, challenging and even a little sad at times, but it has a very high quality.   The writing style is great, and I love the use of the term "mindfuck" as it fits into the story in a way that only makes sense. This is not a book that will make you smile with it's happy end, but instead make you think and feel in a good way.   "Mindfuck" really fits the book and adds an interesting element that doesn't make you cringe, but rather makes you appreciate the world this story takes place in.     I would recommend this book for anyone who loves stories and a well told one. There is a lot of thought put into it, and well thought out details. I enjoyed this so much, I am thinking about reading the second book right away.  -A.T.
Write a positive review about a good book: ---------------  One of my favorite books about the Middle Ages has to be R.L. Stevenson's The Two Towers. It's a novel about a small village in what is now Pakistan, and what happens to it. And it's written with great wit, so I was pleased to discover that he was writing a sequel. I'm glad I bought it and that Stevenson is back at it with this second book. I can't recommend this book highly enough to the general readership.   "I have been at my last feast. The fire is burning low, but I will not leave until I have tasted the last drop. I will drink the last cup of wine and dance the last dance in the moonlight. If I stay, then I must die. If you leave, then my blood will wash all your streets clean. If the nightingale cries for me, then the wind and the rain will be yours for the taking."  - The Princess Bride

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- The best book I read in the past couple of years, and definitely my favorite. As a person that is very interested in philosophy, it is incredibly good and enlightening.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I thought this book was very well put together. It made it seem like a real historical event. It did make me feel like we were living in the time of the people who were involved. I was a little worried that it might be hard to follow, but I just got into it. The characters were not like I've seen in many historical biographies of a time period. We have some very interesting ones. It was very exciting to read a book about the women's revolution that I had never heard of.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, book one in J.R.R Tolkien's epic trilogy. I enjoyed this book, but my problem was the main character. As someone who loved J.K. Rowling, I was hoping for more from her. I can appreciate that Harry isn't the only child in this novel. But I found myself disappointed when I realized she's not even the best kid in the story. The other characters are so good that they're a real delight. You can't help but fall in love with each character. I'm just glad I read it. A review from an Amazon customer, "This is the second time I read this book. I had been enjoying it but never got past chapter 6 when it was time for me to move on. I finished reading it yesterday and enjoyed the read. It was not what I expected, but I can't complain, because the story was so good. I loved every character in this book and I think if I hadn't read it the first time I might have missed it. I've really enjoyed the characters in this and I look forward to reading the other two books in this series." I've been a J. R. R Tolkien fan for years.  It seems like everyone I know is a Tolkien fan, whether they are reading the book or they are making a movie about it! What I like:  This book is full of action and adventure! I can definitely see myself reading this book over and over again!  I really enjoyed it! I liked how Harry grew up and learned how to fight, although the fight scenes were not as interesting as I was expecting them to be.  But this doesn't stop me from wanting to know more about his life!  What's not so good: I thought there were some minor problems with the story, like Harry's mom not dying or how the elves didn't have a plan for when they found Harry and they didn't know how to return to Middle-earth.  A lot of my problems with this book were in the beginning, and I really hope that they were corrected in the next two books!   The ending was very disappointing!   I know that this book ends with a cliffhanger, but that cliffhangers really don't work for me. I was really looking forward to seeing how things would end up for Harry and Ron!  I think the book would have been better if the

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb is great. This is not just some "foolproof" book; it is a must read for anyone who wants to do more than just read about the ups and downs of investing. The book itself is about how an investment man has come to see how things play out, when he actually makes some trades. A huge amount of investment "science" is nothing but an excuse for traders to make a couple extra bucks. This book lays out the foundations for understanding and then making trading decisions in the most intelligent, profitable and beneficial way possible. I have to give this book to anyone who is looking for a book that will help to make better, more informed decisions in their financial life.  Review: The Life of Pi by Yann Martel I found this book incredibly challenging, I am also an avid reader of math, but the book's structure is not very common in the world of math and science fiction. The story is about a fisherman, who finds a massive lost tribe, called Pi, which is the center of a fractal, the mathematics that gives us the idea that there is only one shape. They don't know they are lost until they find Pi, but they do know one thing. It's a mathematical system that cannot be duplicated. The author explains how Pi works, and shows how this knowledge could help in our lives. While the book is hard, it's a fun read with a unique premise and a beautiful ending.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********************* This book is about a man who was not happy with his life. He had no career. He was in debt. He didn't really enjoy his life at all. When he heard about some people in a church who were doing this he thought it was a great idea and he wanted to follow their example. He ended up doing it for a while and was miserable. He couldn't find a way to change so he went back to his old ways. Now his life is better than before. He has a wife and a job. ******************** I bought this book because the author was interviewed on the "The Michael Moore Show" which I don't think I would listen to if I wasn't already on the program. Anyway, Moore was interested in the work of a man named Scott who started with a few $200 in cash but soon became rich. This book follows Scott's story, which is not typical of my experience. I am still getting my feet wet but I can say this is one of the most inspiring stories I have read. I don`t know why this book made me so inspired. If someone wants to try this method out for themselves you can contact him at sdscott(at)yahoo.com. You might also want to read my blog post on the subject. I was actually surprised how well this book went over with a lot of the readers I talked to. In fact, I think it is a very good read.

All three tales are a perfect blend of atmosphere, horror and humor, and they can all be read individually without missing a single word of the story." "H.P. Lovecraft is a master of the cosmic horror, and he was an author of unparalleled talent."-C. Robert Cargill "The stories contained here are some of the most masterfully drawn and written in any genre, and you will find yourself constantly thinking about the horror and science fiction of the 1930's, along with Lovecraft's other writings, and how these things have manifested and developed into the modern-day horror stories which we know today." -Scott McCloud "The Devil's Toys is a collection that every Lovecraftian aficionado will treasure.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- This is a fantastic book. I bought it before it was re-printed, in 1986, and I love it now. The title of the book, "The Great Gatsby" is accurate, since it has a great deal to say about the life of Nick Carraway. "The Gatsbys" (the family) is not a good family, the father is an alcoholic (Nick), the mother is a "cunt". The Gatsbills in Florida, where Nick goes, are a pretty poor family, and the father, Gats, is the one that takes care of all of his grandchildren (all of whom are really stupid) until Nick becomes famous (a "guru" at that time). In addition to this, Gat, who really has no self-esteem, has a son who tries to steal Gats' wealth. The first time Nick goes to the beach, it is a miserable and depressing experience, and Nick has a lot of friends who are really mean to him. The second time, Nick is the "goddamn kid" in the sand, and everybody is so nice, but Nick doesn't like them any more, and he finally ends up in Florida. The third time, it's the best time of his life (after having gone to the desert), and he ends up with all of the money in the world and is at least one step closer to fame. The book also has a few stories of Nick being successful. It has one about the time he stole an expensive piece of art (I love that idea), and then another one about how Nick had to sell his house and car in order to pay for all of Gats's medical bills (which Nick did) and then the last one has Nick going to America in order for his new girlfriend to be able to give him the money he was owed. Nick also has the best friend that he made when he was a kid who comes to Florida to be with Nick, and when the two are trying to start a business and Nick starts talking about how to run it, they are both thrown out of the room (although it was a secret, but they broke in anyway). When I found out about the re-print of this book I finally bought it and then re-read it. This book is full of great stories about a real person, but most of the stories are about a celebrity who is a real "character". I am also grateful to find

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Last Mile: How One American's Mission to Save a Dying Race Changed the World is a well-told, compelling, well-written account of how a single man who did not understand the problems facing American Indians was able to make such a profound difference. What makes the book special is how it takes the reader on a personal journey from the beginning of the book to the end, from the challenges faced by Dr. John D. Rockefeller to the triumph of the Cherokee and their eventual arrival in the United States. Rockefeller was not a doctor or a scientist or even a lawyer, he was a businessman. He was a man who believed that in order to be able to compete effectively with Westerners in the marketplace he needed to be on top of the field in the most important economic factor of all -- technology and manufacturing. His interest in the health and well being of American Indians began in 1868, when he met with the Indian agent John B. Allen and explained the dire situation of many of his tribes as being the result of their failure to keep pace with the United states in economic development. He saw this as the primary reason for the tribal wars and the starvation of American Indian tribes. The problem was compounded by their failure of leadership; their failure in their ability to be self-sufficient in producing food and other necessities of life. Rockefeller decided to get into this area of the American Indian's business and in 1876 he formed the first U.S. mining and oil company for American Indians, the Standard Oil Company. The purpose of his company was to improve the lives of his people and to make it possible for them to live in a land of plenty and not a land plagued by famine and disease. From a young age Rockefeller had a lifelong desire to see his people succeed in their own way. Rockefeller's life had been dedicated to that purpose ever since he was able. Although the oil fields had been found in South Dakota (1866) and North Dakota (in 1869) the main effort had been put into Wyoming (1871), where Rockefeller had met with a man by the name of Henry Clay Frick, Jr., the son of the founder of the Frick-Kress, Frick & Co. In addition to being an accomplished businessman and a man of wealth, Henry Clay Jr. was a leader in the American movement to encourage the independence of America's Native American nations. Frick's company was the first to produce oil in the Western United States, and
Write a positive review about a good book:....................................... [ ]............................................................. [ ] [more]  Fantastic read - but not what I expected. - [ ].............................................................. [ ]  The characters are interesting, but I wish the book was more action-oriented. I thought the plot was fun. - - - [more ] ....  I really enjoy the fact that there is a good mixture of fantasy and science fiction in this book.   I thought the story was interesting. However, I did not think that the plot as it developed was as good as the beginning of the book suggested.  ..   In summary: This is a pretty good book, but if the plot didn't develop and the characters didn't seem interesting or even like they belonged in the same novel, it may not have been that good.   the story:  In the future, the earth has gone through a catastrophic "dustup." Many people on earth have died and have been converted to "moody ghosts." This is where the main characters live and work. In this moody world, "haunting" is a very popular sport, with many people trying to win at it. In "haunted" cities and other "scary" places people sometimes wander, and sometimes, when they do, they go mad. The author's characters are all the people who have suffered from "hauntings" over the years. (The book also deals with people who try to solve the "haunts" by doing something different, such as playing football, or studying medicine. So, it's a mix of science fiction and fantasy, in a non-standard time period.)   So, when the first person POV character comes into the book, the first thing I did was to look up the "humor" of the "horrible" world he is in, and "humorous" as the author puts it is "the sort of humor that makes you feel sad."   The world is a lot like modern day Sweden. People have long hair, wear beards, go to the movies, drive SUVs, and take very long showers (like a day) (It makes sense, since the author said that most "haunters" have been "humiliated" by this time.) The "diseases" that plague the world are as follows:   1) A disease that only affects women, and only happens in the summer

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fantastic book that I wish I had read when I was younger and could have made more sense of it.  I'm in my late 60's now and I think I may read it again if I happen to find the time.  The book is well written and is not too long, at least for the first half.  Also, the author is able to use the first person voice to write about a man who is a teacher and the other characters are not the usual fantasy "king" and queen.   I thought the author wrote the first book to be more of an introduction into the world and his family before he becomes king.  I also liked that he was able to mix in the humor of the King and Queen in between the serious subjects.  There is nothing I could say about the book that is untrue as far as the facts are concerned, however.  While there are two parts to this book, and the first is more of a general introduction to the world, the second is a novel that has a major impact on the plot.  However, I did like the part where he describes the culture and the people of the world as well as the details of the culture of the various races.   The book, while being written in a first person narrator's voice, is also very well researched.  From the culture, to the different countries, to names, I could understand most of it pretty easily.  My only criticism of the book would be the lack of explanation as to how the two parts of the novel connect to each other.  This is something that I think could have been done better, or at the very least explained.  When the first part of the chapter is over and the last line is read, the reader is left confused as to what the next chapter is going to be about.  It is just confusing to say the least.  So many things to keep track of, so little time to do so.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with this book and wish I would have had more time to read it when I first read it.     I thought this book was fantastic!  It was so much fun to read!   There were things that I didn't understand as I was reading but as I grew older I learned more and more.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy, medieval, and historical fiction.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________  As an adult, it was a breath of fresh air to find a book that didn't glorify violence against women. The narrator tells us that violence against a woman is not a sexual act, and that she is not meant to be raped or abused or used by her man. (If he does these things, he is not the man's property, the man must not think he is his property, he must be punished as the rapist, and she must not be raped. She must be able to speak to a man who she has a relationship with and tell him she loves him, she must be free from fear and fear of being violated.) The book is set in present day. It was interesting to me to read about how the woman in the novel is viewed by her family. Her mother has an abusive relationship with her, her brother has an inappropriate relationship with his daughter. She sees no wrong in this and believes it is natural to have sex with her husband. In the end, she doesn't believe her mother's words when she says it is normal for a man to have sexual intercourse with his wife. The story is written very well, and I liked that she did not sugarcoat this. It made the reader think.   The plot is well thought out and follows a plot which seems to be simple but is actually very complicated. There were some interesting sub plots like a friend of the woman who is in love with her (she is in a relationship), a man on trial, the woman's brother's son who wants to get her away from her abusive husband and the son of the man who has an affair with her mother. The book was good and there is a sequel.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very good story about a girl who, when she was a little girl, made the mistake of getting the wrong size dollhouse for her house because she wanted a big one but she couldn't afford one.   My daughter had a dollhouse of the size she wanted for her dollhouse and I made the bed for it.    When she was in elementary school she and her friends could go up to my mom's room and we would make beds together for hours and hours and then at bedtime, we would have a snack and then go to sleep. I loved this book because there is a lot of information about making a bed, how the dolls are made, and about how to use the bedding.  The illustrations are very good.   The text is easy to read and the illustrations are well drawn and I think the illustrations did a good job illustrating the process for making the bed, but it could have been clearer. This was an easy read and I like it. In the end, I really liked this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I got this book in a library sale, and I don't normally read fantasy, but the premise and characterization were excellent. Review:   This is an excellent fantasy series, with plenty of action and adventure and mystery and horror and romance. I'm not big on fantasy, and most of what I like is "graphic realism," but I'm going to try it anyway. I also like how the book has a strong focus on family and life-cycle, and how it doesn't shy away from the darker side of life, including death, disease, and even magic.   This series was a huge hit for me, and has probably been the most successful fantasy series that I've bought for myself. I've read most of the books, and have re-read many of them, and it's just not possible to put this series down. This series is perfect for readers who love epic fantasy, epic fantasy that focuses on the world as it is, and who want a story that isn't afraid to deal with some dark and serious subject matter. There were three main books in the series, "The Chronicles of Prydain," "The Shattered Blade," and "The Shadow Campaigns," each of which were fairly short (it's pretty hard to do that to a series of such epic size). The trilogy is actually a series, and the first book is essentially the first act of a trilogy, with the last two acts being the first parts of a two-part arc.  The first book of the series is called "The Chosen," and it tells the story of Prydwen, a noblewoman who travels across the land to bring peace to the nation of Prydn, which is plagued by constant war. The first five books of the trilogy take place in that nation, and they are set in the time of the Second Empire.   As I said, the trilogy begins in that time.  Part of the intrigue and humor of this series is how little is known about the people of Pryndwen's day.  The series also has plenty of characters, and each of them are developed very well. The series is full of wonderful characters with strong, well developed personalities.   I also really enjoyed how the series focused on the importance of family.  Family can be a very valuable thing in fantasy, or as one reviewer put it, "it's not just about being the hero, the hero has to be the family member who takes care of the family

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a collection of four of the most influential and important historical articles on how the Jews have controlled the European nation state, and how they have always taken advantage of and exploited any nationalistic movements that arose. This was the first book to deal with this topic, and I think it is very comprehensive. The author is very well informed. He is also a very knowledgeable writer.  My Rating: 5 of 5 stars

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________ My sister-in-law was visiting this year, and after reading this book, she went out of her way to share it with her friends. They all loved it and said they really liked it. There are two or three more in this series, which is really cool. So glad I read this. I recommend it. :)

Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this one a lot. It was a short story and it was very entertaining. It had an amazing storyline.  It took me a while to get into the story but once I did it was a great read. 1) The book is great. I've always enjoyed the works of Neil Gaiman and this is a good example of what he can do. The story is entertaining and fun to read. I am excited to read the next book. 2) I like the story. There's no one to root for in this book but the people of the city. There are people that are struggling with everything they have in life.  3) I liked that the story took place in a place where there were no rules. The book takes place in the city of Carmelita and the people there are the same people you would find anywhere else. This book was a quick read that left me wanting more. 4) The characters were different from each other, but they still had their moments.  5) I felt that the book didn't do a good job of developing the main character, however, they do make it through to the end. The plot was not interesting to me, however it was easy to follow. Overall I thought this was a good read. It takes a great plot and a little bit of humor and builds a story that is entertaining. This is a great collection of short stories and I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ I read this book so quickly because I was afraid of getting bogged down in all the theory. I read it for a course at work and it was a great refresher course. I think that if you read this the first time and can explain the principles a little bit then it's worthwhile, but I definitely recommend reading it again just for the theory and then going through the application. _______________________________________________________ If you'd like to share, please put a link to https://www.kirkuk.org.uk/articles/federal-election-2015 ___________________________ About the author: Kirkuk  Kirkuk, the birthplace of the First World War, was once a wealthy, vibrant city, home to some of the finest architects of the day. Now it is a ghost town. In the years since the Iraqi civil war, a city in disarray has been allowed to fall into ruin, an eerie reflection of a lost war. A small group of volunteers have recently set out to revive this ancient place. They are called The Kirkuk Volunteers. Their mission: to help save this forgotten city from decay and to bring hope to the people of Iraq. The volunteers have been called upon to defend the historic city of Kirkuk from looters and foreign occupation. It is a dangerous job. Looting, theft and violence are commonplace. A group of soldiers has recently disappeared under mysterious circumstances, raising questions as to the circumstances surrounding their disappearance. If you are from the UK, you might know Kirkuk better as the setting for the Game of Thrones TV series. If, like me, you're not too familiar with it, you should watch the HBO series first. Kirkuk has an intriguing history. A century ago, it was the most important city of the Ottoman Empire, the largest and most important Christian city on the Silk Road. It housed the most influential Christians of the Middle East, as well as wealthy traders and artisans from around the world. But in the late 20th century, the city was turned into a battleground by Saddam Hussein and his Baathist Baath Party. By 2003, the region's Christian population was less than 1% of the population. Today, the Islamic State is advancing on Kirkuk, forcing thousands of Christian families to flee, or stay in place in the city. They have little choice but to stay in Kirkuk and defend it. They do so from their rooftops, their homes and their churches. On September 12th
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so impressed by the author's ability to draw you into the story and to make it so real you almost forget what the title means. It is a perfect combination of a great story, and great writing, and I love it!   If you like the series "The Dresden Files" by Jim Butcher then you will LOVE this one, if you like fantasy then this is your book. The magic system is so cool. I love reading about magic and it will stay with me forever!

I found the book very interesting and informative and I really liked the writing style. The chapters were well-written, although they are a bit lengthy in length but I liked that. I also liked the book because I wasn't very familiar with the genre.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was just so much fun.  It's a great example of how the different kinds of books can tell different stories.  I enjoyed this story as much as the original book!    I've been thinking of the author as the "James Patterson of books."   This book is a great follow-up to the original The Night Circus.   "The Night Circus" tells the story of a boy named Alex and a little girl named Mary who are travelling to another world.  "T-O-H" focuses on the adventures of the boy and the young girl and features the introduction of a new character, "The Boy of Gold" and more than one new location.  The plot of this book is interesting as the little girl is missing.  She is presumed dead and the boy tries to find her. The story has a great mix of humor and drama and is a wonderful read.  I am not sure what happened to Mary but I loved the stories of Alex and the girl.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The God of Small Things  by Mary Elizabeth Braddon - I enjoyed this book immensely. I enjoyed it very much.  I enjoyed reading the book.  I enjoyed the character development of the author, who I believe to be the first female author of young adult fiction to win a John W. Campbell Award in her genre (Science Fiction and Fantasy).  I also enjoyed the story line of the book, and the ending.   The book was well-paced.  This book, like the first, was well thought out and well written. I loved it.  Also, I loved how the author put the book in a non-romantic world.    I really liked that.  5.5 stars.  Reviewed by: Emily M. Great read! One of my favourite reads this year.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ The Secret History Of The Black Panther Party I love this book, not just for the great story and the brilliant writing. But for the fact that it is an honest look at the history of a group of people who were considered "evil" by the whole society of the US until recently. The Black Panthers were a group that fought for equality for blacks. One thing you won't learn in this book is the truth about the Panther's, who were not white and they were the most persecuted people in US history until recently when they were given their day in the media. I can see why the government wanted to wipe out their group. The writing is brilliant and the chapters are well written. If you want to read about a group who were once hated by all and considered as bad as KKK, this is a great book. If people don't like the way this book was written, they need to read another book, which is probably more accurate about the history. I hope that the author of this book will return to the topic of his book as his own life is about to change a lot.

My family & I were watching TV and heard the TV announcers discussing the events in the movie & said I really wanted to go see the movie. We called & booked an evening for it & we were both pretty much in tears, glad we did. It was well done & the movie wasn't bad at all, it's just a little dark. I do recommend this movie and the book.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________ When I received this book in the mail, I read through the introduction before starting the book. I was excited to read this book for a long time and I loved it! I am also from New York but lived in California for awhile. While I was living there, I took my girlfriend to a place called The Rock in Santa Monica. The Rock is an indoor and outdoor pool where you can swim, have a swim party, and also do other activities. When we went to The Rock, I loved that they had a movie theater, arcade games, and a nice, cool place to spend an evening. This is where I first read about the new book called The Lighthouse. This book took me by surprise and is very different from anything I have ever read or seen about New York City. I loved this book and would love to read the next book!

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was going to post some of the more negative reviews of this book, but then I remembered that I loved it. That was enough to make me give it 4 stars. I'm still very curious about the author, but I have some doubts about how the author thinks that she can bring out my deepest inner secrets by publishing such a personal book, without the use of drugs, ESP, psychics, etc. I think the author has made a pretty fair attempt to expose the problems that she had with her ex-husband, and that her daughter had with an abusive stepdad. She tells the story through the eyes of her daughter and herself. In the end, I'm sure that I understand her message, and I have no doubt that she is a strong woman. In my opinion, she deserves the Nobel Prize for that.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________ I read this book for a class on the Civil War. The professor read the first two chapters and I skipped most of the other parts. I think he got bored with the book quickly and told everyone to get out of the class. I thought he got too absorbed in his own ideas about the Civil war. It was very interesting reading and the professor was engaging. It wasn't a dry class but he was able to get a lot out of it.   But this book was really not for me. I know I should have just bought the Kindle version. But when it came to the Civil Wars. I didn't think about it at all. I read the whole thing except for the parts I skipped and that I couldn't understand very well. Then I went back to the Kindle and read it a third time. The only parts I can still read is the last chapter and the part about the Confederate Congress.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was reading The Good Fight  (The Guardian, UK),  which I really liked, and in the final sentence of the last paragraph it described the US Army's response to the 9/11 attacks as follows: 'The soldiers of the 1st Battalion, the 4th Infantry Division... received a warning of an impending attack in New York.' I thought this was interesting, and so read on to see what I can learn from this. This is an interesting account of a book about the 9-11 attacks, but for me it has no relevance to how to prevent another 9-1-1 call.  This is, in fact, a classic example of what is known as an example without a relevant explanation.  Example without a relevance explanation:  The US Military went to the Pentagon immediately after the attacks and told everyone to stay at home, they were dealing with something else, it was over, the attacks had ended, etc.  It seems odd to me that the 9 years of the attacks, which were a major event and led to the creation of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), are not remembered in detail, and we don't remember what the military response was. In this case, the story goes like this:  After the attacks began, an incident commander was called to the National Military Command Center, the main command center in the Pentagon.  A warning of a forthcoming attack had been received (not by radio, as in the 911 911 calls).  A few minutes later, a second warning was received (also by radio) that the attacks were over.  After that, everyone inside was asked to leave the building immediately.  The attack itself lasted a few minutes.  There is no explanation for why the commander's call was given first.  This is called an example that doesn't have an answer.  If this was the case, then the military would have known that it had a problem and acted accordingly.  But the military had no idea that they had a critical problem, as the 911 calls did.  And there was no way they could know about it, as there is no record of what happened outside the Pentagon, outside the National Command Center.  I don't know how to get a better explanation for the lack of attention to the situation.  To summarize:  A message was received that an attack was imminent in the DC area.  When the military told everyone inside to go home, someone asked if

The book is good on the whole and I hope the author will finish it one day.   Overall, this is a good read.   a few problems   - This was my first read of The Way Of The Knife.  - I liked the book better the second time.   the first time I had a problem with this book - it's difficult to read for my poor eyesight. This is one of the main things why I give it 3.5 stars. I hope, the author adds more text-to-speech in the future, because I feel that the original text is not enough.   of course, I could have a problem if the author tries to go into the "magic system" because it would be impossible for me to read this book.  .The other issue I have with this novel is that the first half is not very interesting - just an easy read. I had to read the second half to be fully satisfied. I like the world and the history of the sword cultures - it makes the story more interesting. So, I give this a 1.5 - a good first read but I hope it will be finished and the author can finish it.   it was my favorite so far   Good job.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you like the writing, style, theme, and plot of The Long War you will enjoy the book.  The only things that I did not enjoy were the cover, some of the descriptions, and some of what they are saying.  "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, as a young man, Bill McDonagh was a regular at the local pub. In his spare time, he read books like The Long Peace.  It was at this pub that he discovered the novel that changed his life and gave him a vision of an era long past and far away. It was then that he realized that his own generation had been swept up in the civilizing effort of the twentieth century. He thought back to that book as he went about his work at the Peace Corps, where he was in charge of a team of twenty-five young volunteers. They were trying to change the world around them, and that meant reestablishing the ancient connection between humans and the planet. But first they had to learn how to survive, and they would need to make friends in the world beyond the wire."

A more exact definition can only be found in the footnotes and I won't even try to summarize it here. But I can say it is not only the most complete reference on the subject, but the only reference I have ever seen that goes into the detail. The footnotes are fascinating and they provide an excellent overview of the history, the main issues, and the scientific and technical development. Many people have said that the medical field and the pharmaceutical industry have not only gone from "good to excellent" but have gone from being at the vanguard of scientific progress in medicine, to being behind. That's a shame because this book is an excellent explanation of both the successes and the failings of the field, and it helps explain why. The book is not perfect but it is extremely well researched, complete, and has a good balance of detail and generalization. You will have to pay a little extra to get the first two books but even that should be well worth it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book  is really great.   I've already been reading the sequels.  It's very well written and the world is well designed.  I can easily see the movie adaptation being really good.  9.5 out of 10.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. A couple of things I did not like were: I thought that the story could have been expanded a little more; it seems like the story was just thrown in as the final chapters, so it would have been nice if we were given a bit more explanation of where it all began and where we are at now. I think it would be worth it, but if the plot is going to be over before you know it, at least give it a chance to unfold before you stop reading it. I also think that the characters would be better if they weren't so white. There is too much white in this book for my taste, even though it is only two people of color, and there is not enough of a variety. But I guess if that is what you want, I guess it is what it is.   The plot was very engaging. I would say that the character motivations and actions are all believable. But, it is always good to read a book with multiple viewpoints and to see other perspectives on a given topic. I found that the book felt very fast paced, especially since the story is only one book. The author does have a tendency to jump right into action and make many changes that just seem to happen at the end. There are a lot of people who are "caught up" in the story and it is a bit difficult to keep track of them. I did read it in one sitting because I do not have the patience to read any other book for a while, so I could just put down the book for 2 days.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________  A great novel and good characterisation. One of the best I've read.   I was very surprised by how much I liked this book, it wasn't as fast-paced as some of the books on the list but that really wasn't the case for me, as I really enjoyed it. I think it could have been a bit more funny or poignant but I still enjoyed it for what it was. The only problem I had with it was that the ending was very sudden and, as someone who enjoys a mystery, it was hard to feel satisfied.  , from a book review by a fan:

Write a positive review about a good book:   " This is one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read. It's full of life, and is an important read for anyone looking to make the jump from the couch to the big screen. I'm not going to lie. The book was a bit heavy and a bit on the long side at first, but if you can get past the beginning, you will have a great read. I really enjoyed this book, and it didn't take too long for me to find my footing with it. For me, the most interesting part was the fact that I can now connect to the main character. I don't think I ever wanted to be a star so badly and it makes it so much more real. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in seeing their dreams come true, whether it be the big budget movies of today or just a little bit deeper into their own life. It is a great book and it will make you think and make you smile at the same time."
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I bought this to read while I was home sick from an illness and to try to clear my mind. This book definitely helped. I think it's very hard to get your mind off of things and the author has put a lot of thought and research into this. It's hard to believe that this is just a story but it IS, so I enjoyed it and it was very nice." -Hannah   "My husband and I have been talking about this book for a while. We bought the Kindle edition, as we wanted to try the format. We had a blast. I enjoyed how the author was able to portray a variety of characters in this story. And the ending was a satisfying one for me!" -Amber   My rating for this book:  4.5 stars   I know this book has been around for a long time, and I do believe I've heard about it before, but it's still a nice read and the characters are all fun to read about.   A great deal of my book-buying experience is about a book having already been published, so my only hesitation about reading this book is that there is a lack of a pre-publication review on Amazon (or other sites) for it. This is a book that I think I would be interested in giving a prerelease review for, and will probably enjoy it even more if I do, though it's definitely not for me.   of This was a very entertaining and fun read. I've enjoyed some books that have been out on a shelf for a few years, or even decades, and never got around to reading them, and enjoyed some that I'd read multiple times, but this one was different. I'd just finished reading a book recently by a very nice author who was just so good at portraying the characters, and making their lives real, but I've never read a book like this before, even one with the same title. It was so much fun, even though it was a bit long at over 550 pages, I was looking forward to the end.  .
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I received this book from my university library and it was perfect. I did not realize I needed a lot of extra practice in reading before I could read the whole book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It took me about 5 months to read this book and I think I understand why the story took so long to tell. But the ending was worth the wait.   This story is very well told and I do not really have a lot of questions about the story. It does have a little mystery, but it is not really the focus of the book. As for plot, it was okay, but not as well written as some other books that I have read.   the characters were all interesting and a few of them were quite good, i particularly liked the little girl that is introduced at the beginning of the story and then the two children that are added in later, both are pretty good.  ........   the ending was...I really don't know if it was intended, but maybe the author made the ending so dramatic that the reader could imagine it and it took away from the story in order to achieve the drama that she wanted. i dont think that i will ever understand how the author accomplished that, but i really liked the ending. I would definitely recommend this book for a mystery fan to read and for a kid to read for their favorite book series.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  I like the book a lot and the book itself is good. However, the book had an issue.  If a book had a problem with spelling, grammar, or something like that, it would get two or three stars from me. But, when the problem was with the characters' names (it was spelled so incorrectly), it got three stars.  I'm glad it got 3 stars, because it was a very interesting book.  It wasn't very bad, but if you are looking for a good fun story, this book might not be for you.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I was looking forward to reading this book for a long time. It wasn't until I finished reading it that I realized how much I have missed out on. This book is an amazing insight into the world of writing. While there are many great authors that write about life and people's struggle with life, you rarely hear about these books. This is a good read because I really liked how he brought these different aspects to the table and how he told the story. I am excited to get my next book on my shelf so I can read this one more.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book,  I highly recommend it to all you aspiring writers!  The book is a collection of short stories and essays, which I'd say were best written, as a collection, in the form of an essay- the book could also be read as a short story, but I find the book better when read as an essay! The short stories contained within were really nice, and I'd recommend everyone reading this book to read them. I was really impressed with the quality of writing, even though this is not my field. Each story really shows the author's writing skills. The author's work really is well written, but in a unique way that no one could've thought of when they created it, just because of her unique, interesting, and quirky personality. Some of the stories are really interesting, some of them are really sad, some are really funny. Some of the characters are really good, some just come off as annoying. The whole collection is pretty interesting, I definitely recommend it. 4.5 out of 5 stars The collection contains six stories, in three different volumes, of about 3500 words each, but because this book is written in a short stories form, the amount of text in the story is smaller, it still reads pretty good. The stories were mostly written for a group at her work, and so they are very personal, and the topics are also very personal. The writer is also very passionate about her subject matter and loves writing. The story about a girl who is diagnosed with Cancer, is one of the best stories I have ever read in my life, as it is really a story about how people treat one another. I really enjoyed this story, and it was such a good ending to the collection that I think it's going to be remembered forever. I liked this collection of stories. The book could be read in two different forms, in essay or short stories format, and because it is in an essay form, it also could be an awesome read for college essay competitions, in college. I'd definitely recommend this book, if you are a budding author!
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________ ____   "Mushroom Magic" is a unique blend of magic, magic tricks, and comedy. The book is a combination of many stories from all different cultures. While all the stories are unique, the most impressive is the magic of the book. I think that the author took the idea of the "magic mushroom" to the most unique level. While each of the stories may seem completely different and have no real connection in the story line, the author managed to use many elements that are common in the stories to make the stories very enjoyable. My favorite stories are the ones about the Japanese. They are the most creative. Most of the story lines are not very long but the author does manage to make every story memorable. This story is also a bit scary and the ending was a bit shocking and unbelievable. The ending did not seem to be connected to anything but the ending is very good and I'm sure you will love it. I would recommend this book for the different cultures and the stories of each culture. It is a good read for everyone!  8 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:!!! - By: Brian O'Connor This is a fun book, I highly recommend it to any fan of horror, paranormal and the supernatural, although I personally don't like horror that much I think the author did a nice job of showing the various possibilities. I love the paranormal as much as I love books, but I do not love reading books on the paranormal. I do think that horror is a really cool genre, and I am glad to see it has gotten a lot of attention in recent years. I would love to see the author write more paranormal books, that is something I would like to see more of in the future. - By Mark Themes, The theme of the book and the characters are very interesting, and they bring out the darker side of humanity. The main story focuses on two main characters, Emily and John, and their search for an elusive artifact known as the "Frog God's Eye." - By Michael This was a good read. I really enjoyed reading it. The story is quite interesting and there are some things that made me smile. I feel the author was quite imaginative. -By Michael I read this book on my flight home from the airport after having just finished reading the very good book by John Norman that I wrote in college, that was about the same time as this. The Frog God's eye is a very interesting subject and it has a great story. The book had me at the center of the action but I was not terribly surprised at what happened to the character. I felt that the plot was somewhat contrived, however. I was a little disappointed that I did not find more of the stories told through the perspective of the main characters. Also, the ending was a bit of a let down. This book could have been much better. However, that does not diminish the fact that it is an enjoyable book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've enjoyed the books I've read from this author so far, as far as I can tell (from my limited knowledge of her writing and the lack of reviews).  The story is compelling.  Although, in this book, the protagonists are often very selfish and don't seem to want to help others.  I would recommend this book to fans of fantasy, with some familiarity with the genre.   A good read in the "Harry Potter" vein. 
Write a positive review about a good book:!!!!!!!!!   You'll love this book for the story, but also for the very interesting and well done characters. The characters in this book are real, not some made up. I love that! It makes the book not feel like some fictional fiction book and it makes it not feel very easy.   The author shows all the different aspects of this story. You'll see this is not an easy story, even though it may appear that way on the outside. You see how different people are affected by this terrible situation. It's sad and sad at the same time. You will also see how people are able to make the best out of this terrible thing.   the ending was good but I wasn't as happy as I thought I would be after reading this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A little different from the rest...but I like it... The story is set in the mid 1800's and focuses on a group of people who live in a small town called the smalltown where a group or local family decides to run their own farm.  The main character is a young farm boy called Jack who is not the only member of the family, as the children of the other families live in the house, as well as a large number of animals, and even a number of the women in the town.  There are so many different aspects of the book that I really enjoyed reading and felt the book was written with an interesting twist to the story.     The ending of the story was also something I enjoyed and was a surprise.    There is also a book in this series titled the other kids in the yard that I liked and was looking forward to reading.

Trombino "A smart book, with some well-known ideas, but so interesting you don't mind knowing them. "  --  J.P. "In his latest work (the new book he has just published, The Collapse of Western Civilization, which I also read) Julian Morris draws on the ideas in his previous books on 'the decline of Western civilization', such as The Globalized Disorder and The Great Disruption.  The Collapsing Empire is in the same vein.  For the reader who would like to understand the present, Morris argues for the need to build new structures.  While Morris himself does not believe that the end of Western power is near, he does consider how the world might change if the current power structure collapses. "   -  L.J.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________ I would highly recommend this to my friends. It is very well written and has a very good plot. I was a little disappointed to learn that the book is an English translation, but this didn't matter to me at all, because I loved the book so much. This book is well-done and was definitely a pleasant surprise.  Good story with a bad ending: ____ The plot was interesting, but the ending left a lot to be desired.   Novel Ideas: _____ I love stories that have an interesting theme, but don't get bogged down with details. For example, this book was a mystery and the main character was an undercover cop who had a mysterious past. Unfortunately, the character was so uninteresting that it was hard for me to keep thinking about what his problem was. The whole thing ended up being too complicated, and in the end I didn't understand why the main man needed to go to such lengths. He is pretty good looking though, and I'm sure he would have been able to get by just fine.    Recommendation: _________________________________ Not for the faint of heart, this one is a good mystery/thriller, but it is just a bit too complex for my taste.
Write a positive review about a good book:...................................................   I enjoyed the book but, not as much as I would have liked. This is a story about a group of college friends and a small college town, and the differences between them. We were interested in the characters, but the story never quite felt "real."   The main character, David, had a very interesting story. I liked that he had some issues and a very short life. Unfortunately, the story felt a bit too "filler" with a lot of back and forth between David and the other characters. I would rather have seen this book develop more.   Another character, Chris, was a bit of a bore. We read all about his life and then he became the one who just had to suffer through David's life.  . This could have been a good novel with all of the characters interacting a lot more, but it was not.   I think the biggest problem is that the book had no ending.  ,   Overall, I liked this book, but I would not have gotten through it with or without the characters.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________ I found this book to be a very enjoyable read and very well put together. I had a few doubts at first but after reading it, I can honestly say that the author is very good at describing and explaining his stories. The first third is not long and gets you really invested and wanting to read more. Once the second third is over, it can get a bit boring, but the third part is the meat and potatoes and is where you find the story going. The author is a bit slow and methodical at times, but overall he has a very good grasp on the time/space of the story he is telling. His character development is also very good and I enjoyed reading about his past and how it impacted his decisions. I also appreciate how the author writes in the third person. He did this to make his characters more real and real world characters like in real life. I was also a little confused about the ending. I really enjoyed it but still don't know why it's done. I don't think I will be reading anything else by the author. It's quite good and is definitely recommended.
Write a positive review about a good book:...........................................   This book has everything an aspiring screenwriter would want. It includes a chapter on how to write a spec script, a chapter where you can write a movie script, several story samples, and a chapter about creating a working script. You should definitely read it. I'm glad I did.   The book is an amazing resource. There are two things that really make it special:  1. The author has no shortage of useful information in this book. This is a great resource for aspiring screenwriters.  2. The examples are simple and effective. They illustrate how to use specific scenes and characters from screenplays to create effective and unique stories.  the book contains a section on how you can create a spec screenplay (the book is great to use to draft a spec)
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________  "In The Secret, E.D. is a man who has a dream - an old dream. To bring the secret out of the archives and to restore it to the light of day... To restore the old glory that once was. E. D. is an artist, and his passion is to bring back the lost power of the past. The Secret reveals his love for his ancestors, his connection to his homeland and the power to save it. I loved it. In a world where books are now the sole entertainment, I know E.A. Dyer was wise."  __________________________________________________  Review by: M. C  Published on:  The Secret is a new work by one of England's greatest poets. The author is an absolute master of the art, his writing is simply beautiful and the effect of reading it will be for all time, as the reader is drawn into this incredible world of his. The story, though told in a very realistic and natural manner, the art is so rich and full, the words are so beautiful and eloquent, that the reader will be transported into the writer's world where he, at the age of eight, becomes a soldier in the French army on a mission to defeat the forces of Napoleon. In the book, E Dyer's main theme is the power of art, the influence it has on us as we read and on how we as human beings as well as those who create, interact, and live our lives.  I enjoyed reading The Secret very much, there are numerous places in the story where I had to stop and think about something I hadn't thought about before, it was an entertaining read with a great story. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because of the length of the book. For anyone who is a big reader, who likes to know how much longer a book is and just what that means, this book is going to be a great read. It takes quite some time to get through the book but if you are a lover of art and want to know more about it, then The Secret is something you won't be wanting to put down, I give The Secret 4 out of 5 stars.  a very good book.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________This book is great. I love it! It's one of my all-time favorites. I used to watch the movie with the girls as a kid (I think it's called The Little Mermaid). I love that the movie has this theme of finding your prince and being with him forever (in this case Ariel's). This is a great book and the best part is when Ariel falls in love with a mermaid who is only the same sex as she is! She was so beautiful and she was perfect for her. I could not have asked for more from this book. I recommend it highly!
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Hands down, one of the best books ever written about the US Military and its legacy from the end of World War II to today."   --Jorge Cauz  "In the end, the story and analysis in these two essays are so compelling, so accurate, that they make one miss the book for the second and third time."  -A.H. Dabney  This is a very well done book. It tells the story from many angles. It was good to be able to read about such a difficult era.   The book is divided in four parts.   the first covers the US Army's use of the atomic bomb.  Part One  the book begins with a very good description of the war that began with Pearl Harbor and ended with the Japanese surrender. The book starts with the American military's use by the Germans of the Wunderwaffen as well as the atomic weapons. It discusses the first use of atomic weapons in the war and the use of it in the pacific theater. The Wunderground was a German submarine that would stay near US Naval Bases to send their weapons to destroy the ships that would try to stop them. The atomic bomb was only used once. In 1944 the US dropped it on Nagasaki.  - The book then moves on to the second major use of A bombs during the war. It starts out in the European theater where the US used them to attack German installations, as well bombing targets that were occupied by the Japanese. This led to many more soldiers being wounded and killed by these weapons. Then it moved on to other bombing targets in the Pacific. It also covered the use in the Korean War. During that war American troops used the atomic weapon to attack the main Japanese headquarters.  and then it goes over the use as well of the B-29 in the early years of the Korean war. This is when the bomb was used on Yongsan Mountain. This was the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This bomb was dropped over the city to prevent a mass killing by the Soviets, and to try and stop the war before the Soviets could invade.   "The Japanese have a saying: When the sun is shining, Japanese women will go to war; when it is raining, Japanese men will go. When the bomb is dropped, they will do the same. A Japanese man's wife will come home to tell him about the bomb; he will say: "I
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished my first read through of the newest version of the classic "Chainsaw Warrior" series.  This is the version with the cover art by John McCrea.  It was a nice change from the "newer" version with a very simple art style, which made it easy for me to follow along.  The story line is pretty straight forward.  I was a little surprised at how well this was done.  A very good first read by this writer.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book and it is well-written and thought-provoking. It is not only about the Holocaust and the Nazi Holocaust, but the horrors of war, violence, and hatred in general and their impact on ordinary people and the world at large. It's a reminder that no matter how terrible things might be, we can still rise above them. I loved this book immensely! It made me think, and that is what I love about books. It makes me think. Thanks. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read!  P.S. If you are Jewish, you will absolutely love this book. It will make your day, as it did mine.
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________. If it had been a book about the Holocaust instead, the reviews would have been very different. - Peter H.S.  Read 10 reviews of this book...   "This book is absolutely fantastic! It is a masterpiece of fiction about one of the most horrific things that ever happened to a people on earth. The Holocaust is a story of one nation trying to eliminate another, and that is the core of it. This book shows that not all people of the same race are the same. Jews have been persecuted for over a thousand years by Christians, Muslims, and Jews are no different. But the Holocaust has taken on new meaning today because of all the Jews and the hate and fear they have faced for generations. This is a wonderful story about the Jews of Nazi Germany, the people who suffered the most from the Holocaust. It was truly heartbreaking and horrifying to learn this. The book is filled with details of people's lives in the camps, their children, and their own family members. A wonderful piece of literature that should be read by all people." - James S. . Read 11 reviews of books in this genre...   "The story is compelling and powerful. I love this book. In my opinion, the author did an amazing job of depicting the dark, tragic life of the Jews. It is not easy to write a well-written, truthful, and well-paced account of this event, yet the author succeeded. He made the reader feel for these people. He told the story of how they suffered and how their families had to endure and suffer even after they had been liberated. His descriptions and scenes of these people have made me cry so many times that I have lost count. I would highly recommend this book to all." - Richard L. In the final chapter of my book, The Holocaust and Jewish History, I described the Nazi plan to expel the Jews out of Europe to their death camps in the East. Since the war, there has been much discussion about whether the Germans should have done anything differently during this process. Some authors, most notably Max Norde, say that this evacuation could have been made easier and safer by the German authorities had they known about the existence of the gas chambers. Others say the Jews were never fully accepted by the Germans and that the plan was doomed from the start. Many people are also reluctant to speak of the Jewish question or the role of the Allies in the war. Some people point out that the American

Write a positive review about a good book:  There is a real human spirit in this book. It reminds me of a few of the many other books I have read by the late great Thomas Pynchon, especially The Crying of Lot 49, A Crying Policeman, and Inherent Vice.  This book is a great example of the way some of the most famous writers and artists of our generation feel about our times.  It gives us a glimpse into the mind and heart of a genius.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A fascinating study of how and why men and women behave differently. This is one of those books that is very readable and easy to read. I did read a lot about human behavior but I always think, what if humans behaved differently? How could this be? Is there something about the brain that makes us think differently? The answer is yes. If I learned one thing from this book it is that humans are hardwired to think in ways that we can not even explain. I don't think this book will change your life but maybe just open your eyes. I highly recommend. --Bryan, San Diego, CA, September 7, 2005   I have been a student of behaviorist and sociologist J. Philippe Rushton, and Rushton has also been a teacher of mine. Rushton's work on race, intelligence, and behavior is just plain interesting. I have always found this book fascinating, but I was not aware of his book on women and human nature, where it is a must-read. --Sara, Los Angeles, CA  The book was an absolute pleasure to read, it will be a reference for years. I liked the author, his ideas, and how the book made you realize how the world is far more complicated than you thought. --Robert, New York, NY  This is the first book on psychology to ever reach my desk. I'm always looking for a more balanced view of the subject matter that includes the positive side of life. I was also a great admirer of the book for Rushton. I hope this book makes it in to a library somewhere, because I could really use a new book on the subject. --Bill, Phoenix, AZ  A fun read from one of the best and most original minds to ever touch the subject of human nature. This book will definitely be used in college and graduate courses on the psychology of human behavior. --Kerry, Bala Cynwyd, PA  If anyone is interested in the subject, this book is for you! --Brian, Phoenixville, PA

Write a positive review about a good book: ~~~ This was my first foray into the world of short fiction (as in, not full-length novels). I thought it would be hard to put together a short story that I liked and was worthwhile, and yet it turned out very well. It is well-written with enough action and suspense, and some nice worldbuilding. I loved the way the narrator played around with the fact that it's an old age home, and how it's a sort of "gothic" Victorian setting (not a place for "nice people"). I liked the way that they incorporated a few different elements of science fiction/fantasy into the story, including the way a robot is used, and the use of magic. The characters were very well-drawn, and I liked that the narrator was a woman. Overall, I think I would recommend this story to anyone who enjoys a good horror/suspense story. I was particularly surprised by the way it wrapped up at the end. It's not a huge surprise (or a shock), but a big payoff that kept me engaged. I don't want to give too much away, but I hope you enjoy.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________   A great little book by a great author!   It's the first time I've read anything by a man, and I'm really enjoying it. It was written from a woman's point of view but is full of the experiences of the protagonist and the many other characters.   I didn't find the book too much of a chore to read because of the subject matter. I know that it is written by a woman but it was written well.   (The only thing I found a little frustrating was the fact that there are some chapters that take place in both the male and female perspectives. I found this very distracting but it wasn't so bad that it changed the experience that I got from reading the book.)   One of the great things about the book is the narrator. I really liked how she portrayed all the different characters. She was very honest with me and gave a really good insight into her perspective and perspective on life.  :)   The characters are real and they really show their personalities through their actions. I especially enjoyed how the characters were handled in the beginning. This is the first book I have read where it felt as though I was in a real time situation as opposed to a book that is a series of chapters.   is an excellent story that I would recommend. It's not too long, not too short and not too difficult to understand.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Glorious!!! This is the kind of book that every one of us needs to read! This book will provide you with many invaluable life lessons. It has provided me with a way of thinking about life that is very valuable."   The author describes how we are limited in our ability to do things, but then how when we try and try to make it work we always find that there is something that is impossible to accomplish!   He tells a story from his own life, but one that applies to all of us. He describes how he was once a boy who wanted to be a soldier, but didn't have the money to do so. Then, he went through a period of feeling that he was an outsider because of his race, and then how his father had to tell him to be careful about some things he did because of race, which he said didn't matter because you were a man. But the problem is that when you get into a certain situation of having to do it your race becomes a big issue, and you must avoid it. Now he sees this very clearly.   I think his ideas and words are very powerful and have given me more than I ever wanted to know about life, the meaning of life, and what to do in order to have a successful life. I have seen a lot of people on TV and in movies come through his words. It is easy to be negative about someone else's life because you don't know the same situations, but you never know what will happen. It seems that there are so many things to think about, and it takes so long to find the right one, and that's because so much time is wasted thinking. The real purpose of life is to find out what is right for us. This book provides the way of finding out.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________  A good book - highly recommended.   "I don't know what it is about the story of Mary Queen of Scots, but I always think the more I read of her, the more fascinated I become. When I started reading "Mary Queen of Scotland" I was immediately hooked. I was really impressed with the author, the way she captured the personalities of the historical characters, the story and the style of the writing.   a few of my favorite characters in this book - Mary Stuart, the Dowager Duchess of Richmond, and the Dowage Lady - I would love to hear your thoughts about them in the comments. This book would be a great book to take to the reading group to discuss about who was the biggest traitor in history.   the main character is an interesting character - it doesn't seem as though she has changed too much - and I was interested to learn what her personal life was like, and why she was so obsessed with trying to reclaim the throne and how that may have affected her behavior. I would definitely recommend this to someone who is a history fan, and is interested in learning more about the events that are documented in this fascinating book.  I've given my copy to a friend who really enjoyed the historical aspect of the book, but didn't want to read it all, so I've read it once - and it's an awesome book, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone. It's definitely one that I'll be reading to my children.   not a "history lover" in the way that some people are, but would definitely give it a try, and if you're a history lover - I know I am - this is the book for you.  ,
Write a positive review about a good book: ********************** This is a very nice book. It is a good read, but one thing that did not quite add up for me was the explanation of how the Earth and life came into existence. There are many theories, and one of the more popular is the big bang, and I just found this explanation quite confusing. I don't know how long before the book ends, but I was so sure that the author would explain this, and it never did. What really bothered me though was that the book's main premise, the earth being a spaceship, was very misleading. I think most people, especially science fans, would agree that it is very hard to believe that there could be millions of years of earth history that we do not have any knowledge of. It doesn't seem to make sense that it could have been billions of years without us being here, because at the beginning of the earth's history, we were. If the earth has been in orbit around the sun for billions of year, why didn't we discover it then? It doesn  I really liked this book. I like books that explain how things came to be, and there are some pretty interesting theories out there. This book explained it in a very well thought out way that is still consistent with the other theory, the big boom theory. I am glad it made sense, and did not get lost in the scientific jargon that usually seems to run rampant in these books. This is especially true of the last third of the book, where the author went into great detail to show how the big jump started the whole thing. The author did a really good job of explaining the big change in our environment, and the way it affected the earth. I liked how he explained that even at the end of the big explosion the planets still looked the same because it had still been radioactive and thus would be a solid. I did not like the idea that the earth would be the sun and all the stars would be around it, because that seems like a very small change to make and if it is going to happen it has to be all over and done with. My main problem with this book is that the big shakeout theory is very simple to understand, and yet I think we are supposed to buy it as a conclusion that earth was all over the place and that we were just the small part. That is not very plausible and the big rock theory just seemed too obvious. Overall, it was a fun read and a nice change of

Write a positive review about a good book: Â I loved this book, especially the chapter about how to get a high-five. I was able to pick up on it and be aware of it, even when I was in a public space with other people. I did think the chapter on having a 'high five' was a little over the top, but that's probably the nature of a high five book.  Would you recommend this book to a friend? Yes, I would!

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.  As a non-Christian the book helped to ease my mind, remind me to trust my heart, and remind me what really is important in life.    I also liked that the author wrote about her own experiences as a nonbeliever, because I often don't feel able to do so.  I wish she had added in a bit more detail in the introduction about her personal spiritual journey.  However, the reason I rated the book 5 stars is that there were some glaring omissions that I was disappointed to see.   In the introduction, she does not give the names of any non-believers who have contributed to her personal journey, and does not mention how much time she has put into her own search for God.  She does give the name of one non-religious friend, who has supported her, but not my own non-Belief friends.    As an atheist myself, I feel this is important information.  In fact, I encourage you to go read the books of the other main characters in this series, to find out how much the author's non-christian friends have inspired her, and to see how often she references them in her books.  After all, this book is set in America, so I think it would have been really interesting to hear from other non-Christians living in America.  But, I didn't want to feel like she didn't mention other nonbelievers because she is a non Christian.   In fact she has an entire paragraph dedicated to people she meets on her quest to find God.   This paragraph gives me goosebumps! This book is written in the first person point of view, but in fact many of the main characters speak in third person.     The author has an easy way to describe her personal religious journey, without going into it.  There are lots of descriptions of "The Good News" being preached at church.  And she does seem to be a non believer!    And then she mentions some of the negative effects of her non belief:  I was afraid of God because of my own doubts.   My fear, I think, is similar to that of those who are raised without religion.   Even though my questions about God were so many, I was not able to find answers.   I was fearful of the consequences.   A fearful heart, like a diseased body, cannot understand
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just got back from a long trip and came home and started reading a book from a new publisher, The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald. My impression was that the book was a very good read, but I was really surprised that it was published this year. The fact that it's being published by a major press shows that the American publishing industry is in a state of flux, and this may make it a hard book to market. It is also very complex and the reader should give it time to take hold. This is the best non-fiction novel in the world, the best literary novel I've ever read and a book that I'll keep in my reading list for a long time. I started reading the novel before its publication date, but by the time I had finished it I was ready for it to be released, and I was very pleased to see that it went out on the 9th in the United States and 7th in Europe.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________  "My favorite part of the book is when the two characters meet: "It's good to see you again, Dr. Brown. I know you've got quite a lot on your plate." They are the epitome of good and evil. They have made a terrible, bloody mistake that will haunt them both. The only way they will be able to live together in peace is if they get out of the way of the demons that they have unleashed upon the world. The demons that I want to focus on are the blackest, most evil ones in the book. That aspect of the novel is so well done, so very well written, that I didn't want to put it down. The blackest demons are a very well-realized and chilling depiction of evil, which, for me, made the book even more interesting. The idea of demons coming into our world is a terrifying one. I mean, we have demons in our world, but this book is the most well-written and realistic I have ever read. The description of the black demons in the novel are so horrific, so incredibly horrifying, that it made me want to read the book over and over again just to be horrified by the story. I hope the author comes out with more books like this, because I'm so excited to see the next one." -Linda, New York  Review of the Book: ___________________________  It was the best purchase I've ever made in any fiction format.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________________________________________   In his short but beautiful review of the recent edition, David S. Brown said "this is a terrific book, as good or better than anything that is currently being written on the subject." That's right, it's even better than what is already being written. The first edition of "Toward a Secular Theocracy" was published by Oxford University Press in 2000.   A short excerpt:   "Our understanding of religion has evolved with the advent of reason and science, the Enlightenment, and the advent and growth of democracy. In the 20th century, this evolved to include the belief in God and an afterlife. We are now moving to the post-Enlightenment era, and that time has seen the greatest challenge to the traditional Judeo-Christian belief in the existence of God and his role in human life. We no longer believe in God. We believe in evolution. We have a secular worldview. We don't believe in the Bible."   At the very end of the book, Brown makes a bold claim: "If God did not exist, then the belief that he does is nonsense." If you think about it, that's the kind of claim that is likely to have more impact on the world than many secular thinkers. Brown's book goes on to say that "the world, even today, is becoming an increasingly secular society." That is just not true.   (If you would like to know more about why this is not true, see this page. )   And yes, I know that secularists aren't going to be happy with Brown's claim. But Brown isn't a religious person, so it isn't about him. This is about whether the world is becoming more secular, and it appears that Brown is right.  .   the book does not address all the criticisms of atheism. There are also some other problems with Brown, that we won't go into here. It's about the future of our world, so you can't really get a handle on it without hearing other perspectives.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely love this book. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a mystery, thriller or detective story. There's a lot of mystery going on here but it doesn't overstay it's welcome.   This book was a real joy to read.  It was like a mystery story you'd read in the paper, but you knew it was fiction. This is an old school classic that is just that good. I'm glad I picked it up.
Write a positive review about a good book:  " I loved it!  I feel bad that I had a hard time getting through all the books in the series, but this book was definitely worth it, I found it enjoyable.  It's not a long book, so I found that I could just read it over and over.  " I think the best book in the books was "Tales of a Star Lord" I love it."    I have been reading them at the same time for about a year and can see why, these books are quite easy to read and have interesting stories. I like the fact that they are short, and each of the books has a chapter dedicated to a specific character.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm an avid reader, and I've read every book written by Neil Gaiman. It's only been a few months, but I've already finished all of them and can say with great confidence that none of them are better than The Sandman. This is one of the best books I've ever read. I can't wait to read the rest of the series. I recommend this book to anyone that likes Neil Gaimans books and is looking for something good to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book! I have always loved Harry Potter but had never read it before and never really thought I would like it. However, I got the audiobook and I have to say, I loved it! It's a little on the long side but it didn't bother me at all! I don't read many audiobooks and I found this one was just right! I am looking forward to the next one because this one made me laugh and was well-written. If you have never read Harry Potter then this is the book for you! I really recommend this book for anyone who likes Harry Potter!
Write a positive review about a good book:  When I finished the book I was very happy. I like the fact that this is not a very common theme. The book is very well written and I loved the story. The main point is that a man was kidnapped and his wife and daughter are kidnapped.  It is a perfect theme for a novel. I was not disappointed.
Write a positive review about a good book:!!!I've read this book in print and on-line and loved it! I'm always looking for books that can be read alone, and like a "road-trip novel," this book has it all. I found it fascinating to read about the different religions and cultures that populate the world. The first 3/4 of the book was great. The story, which was told in a very descriptive manner, was very good. I've always thought the best books are the ones that take you to places you've never been and bring you to a different, new way of viewing the world; this book definitely did that. The rest of the text was not as interesting to me as I expected. There were so many times where I thought, "that could have been better," or I was thinking about the same things but found them completely irrelevant to the story; this is a problem I see often in the book world. I think some of this could be attributed to the writing style of the story. I also had a slight feeling that I wasn't quite getting it. I was able to get into it, however. The world building and religious conflicts were very well done; I was especially drawn to the relationship between the Hindu god Shiva and a goddess named Agni. They seemed like a great couple in a way. I didn't really enjoy the first half of the narrative; I felt as though I was missing something. I don't understand why she didn't just do what the others told her. I did enjoy the second half though, the ending made me want to pick up a copy of the second book. The writing was good, and I think it's nice to be able to pick and choose what you like about a book and what you don't; I think this is good for a reader like myself who likes both religious and cultural themes.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ This is a very good book. It provides clear explanations of various concepts of quantum mechanics. It is a really good read. I like it a lot.  Write a negative review about bad book: My friend and I were both disappointed with this book. The first half of the book is pretty much on the topic of the so-called "quantum world". The reader is presented with the following notions: "there is no physical reality" "time is no more than a construct of the brain" "the mind is an optical illusion" and of course the most popular: "quantity is an illusion". It was disappointing to me that this is an article by someone who does not understand quantum mechanics at all. The author states his basic position at about 1-3 pages, and then goes on about his arguments at another 1-2 pages. That is really all the discussion in the book. In the next few chapters there is more and more of a repetition of these concepts. The article does not go into any detailed explanation. All the rest is just a little blurb with a title. The reader has to dig a little to find out why it is so important to understand quantum physics. I have no doubt that this author knows very well why it matters, but he just couldn't decide to explain it well enough.   In the second half of this book the author describes his personal experiments with quantum phenomena and his conclusions about the effect of "uncertainty" (which seems to be a subjective concept) in our everyday experience. If you know something about quantum mechanics, you can already see the huge gaps in his arguments. He is clearly not a quantum physicist. But what are the chances that a non-quantum physicist can discuss quantum mechanics so well and so well, yet have no understanding of the underlying concepts at all?   The third half is just the same, with a lot of repetition of the same "conceptual confusion" again and again.  ,  4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first time I read this book, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to laugh at the absurdity of the plot or laugh at how absurd it was. It was a great read! If I had to describe the plot, I'd say that it was a fantasy story about a girl who ends up living with a group of dwarves as they journey to a faraway land and a land that has nothing to do with the "real world". The story was hilarious and the characters were likable and fun to watch as they did all kinds of crazy things.  7/10

I'll definitely read this again when I feel like it.  My final thoughts:    If you don't know how to use a scale and/or want a bit of a primer I highly recommend you check out this book. It really gives a good overview of how to understand the relationship between body weight, BMI, and health. .

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I liked this book, especially the chapters on what makes a person good, and a person bad. I liked the writing style, the descriptions were very interesting, and there are few typos. I really liked the story and the characters."   The Reviewer's Notebook: I think a good rule to follow when it comes to fiction is: "if you're going to be honest about what makes you who you are in fiction, at least don't lie to your reader."  . If you have ever had a reader comment on a book, "there is no way that that can be what that person is really like," you have probably thought to yourself, "I know this book can't possibly be about that person." But there is a certain authenticity to writing fiction that cannot be achieved in real life, and to be able to write a book that you really know yourself would require you to write honestly about the experiences you have had and the life experiences you could have had, which you have not had. So, I suppose you could say that if you have a character in your book whose true self is not the main character, that character is probably not the real character, and I think there was a lot of this in this book.   . If there is any one thing I really like about this book is the writing, and in fact, it is one of my favorite books ever. It was hard to pick a favorite scene in the book, as each chapter had a few different scenes and each of these scenes had a different feel to it. However, one scene I loved most was the one at the end of the book where the character is telling his or her mother about the night the dog died. This scene is very personal and very realistic, and the character's words are very much a part of the narrative. Another scene I liked was the scene where the characters have been out to dinner at a restaurant, and when the book ends they are walking up to their car, and they are both looking at the sunset and looking at each other and thinking about how good it is to be alive, that the sun is out and that it feels like everything is coming together at last, and how there's a possibility that everything will still be just like it was when the story started. Also, one of the characters in this story is a former high school teacher who has been a teacher in some form or another since the 60's.   of all of the

Write a positive review about a good book:   In a perfect world, this would be a 4/5. A nice story, but there are so many things that would have made this a better book.   1. The author was a little too sure of his ideas. For example, there's a lot of symbolism in the book and the author didn't take it as far as it should have been taken. I mean, a man being killed by a bird would obviously make him feel fear. But the author decided to symbolically put his blood on a stick. And then put the stick on a tree and used his blood to write the message he wanted to say. So it's like he wasn't even sure what he was doing.  'slute'   2. The characters. I know the main character in this book is pretty well developed, but as I read, I realized the other characters were very flat. I would say they had very little personality in terms of what made them interesting. I don't mind it if one character is a dick, but in this case, I thought it was stupid to keep putting them in the same sentence all the time. But then, I'm not sure what their problems were. The main character, for example, has been through a lot and feels like he's the only one who gets it. He's the one who's not the hero and who doesn't get what he needs and doesn't feel like he has a purpose.   A lot of the other people don't seem to understand him, either. Maybe he just needs to have more confidence and be bolder in his actions? And how does he get that confidence and boldness? By writing? By talking to animals? Maybe I've got it backwards, but I felt like the whole book could have been summarized by saying, "This guy wrote this book and people don  I love this book. It's just that I don the first chapter and it's the typical story of a woman going on a journey. So I was expecting something like that, but when the story continued and I got to the end, I did a double take. Why am I reading about a woman on a quest to help a king? I thought that was the whole point. Anyway, the characters are still pretty dull and the book ends on a cliffhanger and I have no idea what happens. So that was a bit disappointing. I'll keep reading, though, because I know I'll have some fun

Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book about a month ago, when it was on pre-order. I've tried to read it before, but I always give up after about chapter 9. So I decided to pick up this one to see if it would be any different. I have a bit of a thing about science fiction (mostly because I've seen a lot of crap about it), but I love science fiction. I'm always trying to find out more about what's going on in the future (particularly the near future), and this book was very interesting to me. The author is very well-respected in the science fiction world, and I love the way that he handles science and the way it relates to the other areas of the story. I feel like I was going to be really disappointed with this book, but this one is so different from the rest of the books that I really like it. I do like the premise of the plot, but the plot itself isn't really that engaging. The characters are just a good bunch of people who all have their own problems, so the main character doesn't really seem to have a clear role in the plot. The plot does have some good parts, though, and the first half of the book was a lot like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This is a very fast-paced book, so I did have to do a lot with the time, so there weren't too many scenes where I was completely lost. I felt like there was a clear plot arc here, but it was very hard to follow. That being said, I still liked the book a lot, and that's all that really matters.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am giving this book 4 stars because I like it and think it is pretty cool.   I really like the way this book was written. It seems to me that the author took a lot of pains to try to explain all the concepts clearly and clearly to the reader. The prose is clean and easy to read, and all the examples are clear.  , even though it is a bit hard for me to read about a lot. There were a few words and some things I don't really get but i just kind of guess about what is going on.   of course, a lot is explained in such a way that I just think that it was really clear and easy for me.    I have a few other books by the same author that i also think were pretty good.  1) The Secret of the Red House (in a different time-frame).  2) The Story of a Book (a shorter version of the book i have above).  I also read an article by David G. Hart, called the Secrets of the World's Favorite Books, where he states that:   A book can have many different meanings to different people and for the same person to have many other meanings. I find that in the writing of a book I find much of the meaning is left out in the original text and that these meanings can be picked up after reading the book.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________   I will be honest with you, I started reading this book because I was trying to figure out how I can get to the top of the world in order to be loved. You have the chance to become the best in the world and if you are successful, you can become a celebrity in the next world. However, this book is not for you if you have a different life goal and want to live a normal life.   This book is meant for people that have a good job, a loving family, and don't mind being poor. The book is about a young man who wants to be the greatest. In a world that is so focused on money and fame, he wants to stay home and build a house with his friends. However at the beginning, he realizes that he doesn't have the money to make a mansion, so he takes the job to make money, and has the rest of his life be about being a celebrity.   I hated the book and hated that the author made money. The story is a little dull, and there is no real point other than being the best.   be prepared to feel stupid and like a fool at some point.

The book is good, the story is interesting, and I'm definitely looking forward to the second installment. I've read other books that were more like a series and I was not disappointed in any way. The story is well-paced and easy to understand at a basic level. This makes the book easier to read because you don't have to think too much and you can just let it unfold. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to seeing what will happen to this group in the next book."

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This is an excellent book for teaching children about natural selection, natural selection by themselves and how the natural selection can work by itself, or can work through an organism. The author has very good explanations of how they work." Review by: J. A. Sargent on Dec. 23, 2016 : This is the first book by Peter Beagle which I've read. As the title suggests this is a book for young children, and the author is aware of this. As a result the book is very easy to read, but with enough information in the book for the parent to be able to follow the discussion. I can only imagine what an adult would read this book, and I think that adults would be impressed by the depth of information presented in the chapter on natural selection.

Write a positive review about a good book: ~~BONUS ROUND~~  I have to be honest, when I first received this book, I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought that I'd be getting a typical fantasy book with elves, orcs and magic - the kind that I can imagine many readers having some sort of attachment to. However, there are some things that I really didn't like about this book.  The first and most important thing is that the writing style is slow and choppy. The characters were just too flat - the elves were barely interesting, and they felt like the "other" race that didn't add much to the story. I mean, at the beginning of the book we have a group of orcs that are being chased by a small army of elves. At the end of the story, we have an elf and two orcs. In the beginning we see all three characters talk about what has happened, and in the end the last two characters are all that is left. I'm sorry, but there is something wrong with the writing.  and  One of the biggest problems is that I feel like the book was written too soon. I was ready for a great fantasy book, but the first chapters made me feel like I was about to read a page long summary of a video game. The next big problem I had was with the fact that the story felt rushed. It was very easy to forget that I was reading about characters that had only just been introduced, and as a result, I felt like I had just finished reading something I knew very little about. The final scene had the biggest gap in the plot and in character development of any scene in the book. I honestly felt like there was no reason to continue reading after that scene. I found the book to be lacking in pacing.  the only redeeming quality I can find in this book is the fact I have learned to not be so quick to write off fantasy books. It's no secret that I'm not the biggest fantasy fan, but I have been looking for something like this for a while, and this was a great book to find.  that said, I'm still curious to read more by this author. I have read quite a few of his books (I'll link to my favorites if you're interested) so I know that the world is rich with interesting characters. I feel that it would be a great idea for the author to take a break from writing (I mean, he just finished
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A beautiful and fascinating book which I would recommend to anyone with an interest in the human spirit. There are many people who are convinced that they are unable to change themselves or that it is difficult to see themselves as they are. They may be very good-hearted people but the thought of being selfless is impossible to understand for them. However, if they look at their own behavior and see that it does not reflect well on them, they may be able to see how much they are worth to themselves and others.

You can change your personality by changing your mind." - George Bernard Shaw "Your actions are all you have to give.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ I love this book and the author does a great job of writing about the different characters in such a way that they are all memorable and interesting. ------------- (This is a review of the audiobook version) ------------- "And I don't care what the history books say, if you've ever tried to find a place where the stories of the Native Americans were recorded, you've probably seen the remains of the old log cabins that had been erected around the old trading posts of the region. They're called "Indian villages" and there's an old saying that goes something like this: "All my life I've been waiting for a chance to learn of the Indian culture. There are very few of us left that know anything about our heritage. It's gone, all gone. I'm a poor, lonely, broken shell of a man. You've got to be hardy to be an Indian, but I'm not." It's not hard to learn anything about the Indian traditions. --------------- "My name is Michael. I was born on the outskirts of Pueblo on the Navajo reservation, but by the time I was five I'd been adopted by a white family from New Mexico. They had come with their families from the western frontier to work as ranch hands. They liked the ranching life and liked my father very much. He was a very proud man, a man who saw what he'd accomplished. My mother was very protective. When we moved to PueblO, she moved us back to Albuquerque and we never saw her again. When I was in seventh grade she came to visit and after she had left my father came to my school and told me that she wasn't my mother. She was a white woman who'd had the kids and the cow and she'd been doing all the work around the ranch. She had no right to live with us because my father was a good man and I'd never even seen her. I did not tell anyone at school, but my family was very shocked and they didn't approve of the way I was raised. I found it very hard to adjust to the new life I'd come to know. I'd found a place of my own in the town of Taos, a town of about 1,000 people near the New Mexico border.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "A classic in the genre, the  The Last Stand of General Klink by  Tim O'Brien  is a book I will always have with me. This book is one of those rare, if not unique, books that is so true to itself that you can't help but feel both the urgency and desperation of the situation, and the determination to survive and triumph that comes with that. O'Briens' portrayal of Klink is a masterfully realized portrayal that is not only completely believable, but also a portrayal of true heroism. It is a book that has captured my heart in so many ways. O-Brien makes Klink a man, a leader and the reader can only hope he can live up to his ideals. A very worthy book and I recommend it to anyone who ever needs a good story to tell." -Tobias Bralove (Author of The First World War - A World at War) "The Last Stand in the Black Forest is a highly original story about a young officer who must survive through the treacherous and deadly mountains of Europe in the early years of the First World war. The book tells the story of Colonel William P. Fetter, an American soldier of fortune, and his attempt to escape the hell of the early campaign. Along the way, he will come to understand, appreciate and care for a number of local people, including a woman, the young brother of a dead comrade, a young German farmer, a beautiful woman from a small German town, and an orphan boy in a Russian orphanage. This is not the most enjoyable read. This story is written by someone with an excellent command of English and a good command of military history. It could have been an enjoyable historical novel, but it is not. It was, however, an enjoyable read from the point of view of someone who had been through the war and who cared deeply about the people it affected. I will not give this a rating less than 5 stars. I have often thought of Fetter's story, and, even though it was written to the best of my ability, I find myself longing for the days when the First world war could be called an adventure. That Fetter managed to capture the feeling of the battle from the men's point of views was a great accomplishment." - John F. Heyes (Author, The Men of War)
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________________________________ I really enjoy this book. I've only read one book about autism, but I loved it. This one is great too. I wish there was more of it, and the authors could make more books like this and not just one about autism. - January 12, 2009This book is awesome!  Reviewer: tennessee - favorite favorite favorite - July 29, 2008  Subject: Interesting book with interesting results A book that discusses the results of behavioral analysis of the human behavior of children with autism. The author's research is supported by the results. This is the first book that I've read that clearly describes the behavioral analysis methods. This book gives insight into what it means for a child to have an autism diagnosis. It may have been difficult for the author to write this book, since he had to write in a way that does not put the reader in the shoes of the patient. It is clear and informative.  My only complaint is that there are not enough chapters of examples from the study. I'd have liked to have seen more. I also would have liked a more in-depth description of the studies. If you only read the book and have no experience reading, the description of what each study is about may be overwhelming. A book like this would have been ideal if it had more examples and examples of the research. - July 30, 2008Interesting book with intriguing results  Rated 4 out of 5 by cory from very well written This book is very interesting and a good example of using behavior analysis to help children with disabilities. The information is very well presented and the book is well written.

Write a positive review about a good book:   "The whole idea behind the book is to explore the nature of creativity and its implications. But, what I most like about it is that it is not so much a case of 'do this to find out what it is' but more 'what is it like to create'. It may well be that when I am a better designer I will know a bit more about it and how to apply it. But this book is so good I don't want to know what it's like to be a designer without it, so I will be following this up with a separate book."  – Richard Williams (Hacker News)  What people are saying about it:  My kids love the book, but as a parent it's also extremely important that they understand that creativity does not need to come from a textbook or university.

If you are just getting started, the information is useful, it also looks like a great book that could be a good companion piece for a college creative writing course. For me it was a nice reminder that the pursuit of creativity isn't easy.  The only problem I have with it is the author's name. It's a little distracting from the writing. My daughter thought it was just an awkward name, so it was changed to avoid that.  a book like this is invaluable as a creative writing companion  Good for any creative or learning oriented book

Write a positive review about a good book:  "A delightful book that contains many memorable and insightful observations on both the religious and secular world." I loved it, but I still felt like it needed a sequel. It's still my favorite, for whatever that's worth. I loved the "religions as philosophies of life" part.  There's a very interesting passage in this book that deals with whether or not religion is good for the soul or not, and how you should make a living by doing good.    I think it's the reason why most religions are so anti-individualist.  "Religion's one great success: It can give us an excuse to be lazy."

Write a positive review about a good book: __________  A good book that I will continue to read and will probably enjoy more than I expected to when it came out.  "Takes some time and energy to follow but makes for a good read."  - Anonymous  Customer Review: __________________  this review was good, but I felt that it needed a little more explanation of what was going on in the book. I didn't see any problem with the basic plot, but this needs to be explained more in order to understand why the person does the things they do.  for instance, one of the main characters was supposed to be a good guy. But instead he started to hate everything about the place (which in real life is a very normal and understandable reaction, as most people will). In the beginning he seems to have good intentions and was helping his people, but later on he started looking for ways to take over the place, even to the point of committing suicide. I did think that if the main character was a more decent person, he would have seen that the country was being taken over by foreigners and would have attempted to stop it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  There is a lot to like about this book, particularly the descriptions of the local fish market, where they have everything from fresh eggs to smoked fish, and the people who work there. However, the characters are really rather flat, and don't give a good sense of what life is like in that part of the country. I am not against fishing, and I would like to visit there at some time, but the only real memorable thing about the book is the ending, and it was somewhat forced for me to read the whole thing, although I do appreciate that the author gives us the perspective of two people.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I read this book, and it is a nice change of pace from all the sci-fi/fantasy stuff I've read recently. I think it's about three people who have found themselves in the town of Pest, Iowa. They've all been living there for years, but only a couple of them are aware of this town's unusual heritage. The characters are a few very normal people. There is a boy in his early teens, an old man in his mid forties, and a pretty young girl, who is kind of like a "bond girl." They have a pretty intense connection to each other, which is something that isn't uncommon, but it's always interesting to see how people react when a person that close to them is in a unique situation. The setting is not something that's ever touched my interest, and the ending was a little rushed and a little disappointing, but I thought the characters were pretty good. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes interesting characters and/or interesting settings.

The characters were unique, the plot was engaging, and the prose was poetic and memorable. I loved everything about it and it's perfect for all ages! - Anonymous,  Read in French  "This book is my kind of story, where a simple story, with a big ending, can really leave a deep impact on a reader."- J. D. Salinger, author of Catcher in the Rye and The Catcher was the Pigeon  Author's Note:  As many of you know, I've had several very talented and insightful people contact me in order to ask me if they can use the story for their own projects or projects that they are working on. One of those people is YA author and blogger Emily Carroll. Her request is a personal one, but I am thrilled to be giving her permission to use my story in her upcoming release, 'The Magician's Apprentice' and am thrilled that her book will be available at both Amazon and IndieBound.  A couple of weeks ago I found out that Emily had already written a screenplay that would be used for her next novel 'The Fortunes of Lady K' and that I would be credited as the author of this story. Of course I couldn't pass up the opportunity, so I contacted Emily and her editor to see if I could have it published as the next book. The answer I got was, "Yes, we will let you use it for a short movie, but you won't be credited." So, I had to agree to this but I was still thrilled to use the character for my book, and I will be using it as part of my upcoming book release and for my upcoming feature film. ,

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- One of my favorite books is "The Secret Life of Bees". There is a wonderful sequence in the book that shows how some of the bees can tell when their queen is dead, and when they are no longer of value to the colony, because they start moving out into the world and becoming free-ranging bees. It really shows how a bee can see the difference between her queen and just another bee. The book is short, but full of good information. The author wrote it to make her bees, but I hope that the information will also be useful to you. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that loves bees. --------------------------
Write a positive review about a good book:................................................................................................. I don't know if this is going to make any sense to people or if you have heard about what happened but it's a great story about a boy who is on the road when he gets a letter from his parents who have died. They left him their fortune and he was supposed to use it to start a business. Unfortunately this business doesn't work and he goes on the street to try and earn money, but he can't find a job and eventually gets involved with drug dealing and murders a friend. I liked it and I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good mystery, and who's interested in psychology and the mysteries of the mind.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________________________________________ In the past five years, I have read a dozen books of poetry. The best of them is probably the collection of short works that I wrote, with the poet Susanne Hüll (see my Review of it), which won the award of the Frankfurt Poetry Prize. This book is the best and best-received work of mine so far, as it is also a masterpiece of English poetry. One cannot read a poem like that by a human being, but it is only a short piece of work and can not help but to be admired and valued by the reader, even by a critic, who reads it with the eye of an artist and takes pleasure in seeing a human voice at work on the pages. It is true that it has some faults, but these do not diminish the greatness of the work, or the poetry, which is still far better than many of the more familiar writers who were to come after it. I recommend it to all English-speaking people interested in poetry. It has a timeless, beautiful, and original style, which I think one can find in many other writers, such as Mark Strand, Philip Larkin, and John Biffen. It contains many original lines, but also many familiar ones which one can recognize immediately, but which are so often neglected in the language of our time. But perhaps the greatest quality is that one can read it with such a pleasure that one does not have to make use of the time in between to consider what it means or what it contains, as we often do when we read works in the usual style, such a poem by W. B. Yeats or a letter to his father by W, T. Sherwood Anderson. This is why I like it, as a short and poetic book.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good book:  "Crazy About..." by John McPhee. This book was the one I've been waiting for since I first started this site. I've read every John Mcphee book I can find and I have read them all to the point where I'm not sure I even want to keep reading another one. But for some reason I kept reading this one. McPheed has created a complex story about a broken-down young man with a gift for poetry that is told in the third person and that is full of twists and turns. The book is the perfect introduction to the great John Mcpherson. The writing is beautiful. Every word is perfectly crafted. It's as if a beautiful painting or a story was put together by a talented artist. I love John McPhain and I'm happy to say I'm a bigger fan now than ever. Highly recommended.

Write a positive review about a good book: Â  "The Secret Life of the American Girl" has an incredible plot and the story is amazing with a well done romance plot line and romance between all the characters."  - Â Read More Here...  5.5 of 5 Stars  Kelli Hurd's "The Secret Lives of the Teenage Girls" is the next book in the award winning "Best Series" of the E. L. Doctorow Series which continues to deliver the "Best Book in its Genre". Kelli Hurn is one of the best, if not the best author in YA romance right now, and this is my pick of the crop. The story revolves around three young girls. One is a rebellious teenager who makes mistakes along the way and a second girl is the perfect companion who can be taken with you through any dark moment and you can never be too prepared to meet her. And the third, is the ideal girl who never makes a mistake.  If you are looking for something light and enjoyable, this is a series for you. It is not heavy with plot or character development, but rather focuses on fun and character development. "The secret lives of teenaged girls" is a great series. I love the mystery and the suspense of the story. There is not a single dull moment, and I could really feel that the writer was looking for the right girl to bring to the right moment. I loved the romance aspect of the book. There were several times when I was wondering what the next chapter was going to hold for the characters. I am very glad the ending of the series was satisfying. The author took my favorite character from the first book and made her perfect. I'm just a little disappointed that her other two characters did not live up to her expectations.    I love romance, and Kelli has some of the most well thought out relationships and scenes in this series. This series has some fantastic twists and turns in the plot and I loved that this series was not boring. I have never loved YA romances quite like this one. And I think this series is definitely a must read for the YA series lover.   "As long as I remember, there is always something to be thankful for" - ÂRead More Here

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good short story book, with several good story lines, some more than a little disturbing, but the writing is pretty good and the story is interesting. Some people seem to like the plot. I was very skeptical at first, but it turns out there's some truth behind the plot (there is a cult, there is a woman who is a 'prophet' of sorts, the plot makes sense, you know why it happens), but for a small child like me, I can see how some would find it disturbing (but I don't think I was able to pick up on any 'evil' in the book). It's a nice change of pace for a child's book, I think a little older children might find it a little hard to get through, but for the time-being I recommend it for the fun of reading it and the fact it has some really good plots.

The only thing that would have made it better would be if it were about a female dog and not the cat.

And at work, he just can't seem to get any attention.   But he's not a bad guy. In fact, he's an extremely likable character. And he seems to have a real talent for making good decisions. I hope he is popular at work. I love science, and math, and tech. And tech is one of the most fun areas to work in. That's why I'm so excited about this book!!

I love to read about it but don't necessarily like that kind of reading. This is very readable and the writing style is very easy and to the point. The story is a great starting point to a new kind of story. The book is not about aliens but about an incident in the 1970s, that's where the story begins.   The first half of the book tells the story of a young girl from Romania that was visiting her father in Boston. They stayed in the dorms at Boston University and it is there that she meets a couple that were on the team that found the UFO that caused the incident that would change her life. In the second half of her book she moves to Romania and finds a job at the airport as a baggage handler.  , I'm going to be honest here. I didn't really care for this book. I was in the beginning of the story, just reading it for the nostalgia of the 70's when I was a kid. There are some minor things that are a bit off that I didn the author, but it is not a problem that I would consider a deal breaker. The only thing that I feel that is a deal breaking is the second section of the novel. This section is the first time I feel a real "plot" is set in place. There is an alien that is looking for a place to colonize, but before it can get to that place is is forced to take a tour of Boston in order to find out where it is being kept. Now that doesn't seem to make sense to me and I was really excited to see what happened with that. But that was just a bit much for me to take at first.But, I do love the book and think that it is the best introduction to the subject that you will ever find. The author does a great job explaining the basic basics and how they relate to real life. This story will change how you

Write a positive review about a good book:!!!  It's hard to come across a book I didn't love. I read this book in one sitting. It took a bit of time to get through, but when I did I was amazed at how good it was. The story is about a young girl named Lucy who lives with her dad and her two brothers, all of whom are in their teens. They are very poor, and can't afford to send their girls to school. Lucy is very smart, and she wants to go to a special school, one where she can learn to read, write, and be a good leader for her family. She's a pretty tomboy, but also very outgoing and friendly. It's hard not to like Lucy, because she's so well written and the story unfolds with great humor and charm. The author does an excellent job of capturing the teenage experience, especially with how her dad is a jerk and how Lucy can't get him to stop. Lucy herself is a strong, independent young woman, and it's great to see how she manages to do things on her own. Her sister is even more interesting, with her own problems with boys and men, and her friendship with Lucy.   I recommend this book for anyone looking for a quick read, and to anyone who wants to learn about teenagers. It has great writing and characters, so it is a great story.  ,
Write a positive review about a good book:!!!   I have to give the author great credit for creating a very interesting and thought-provoking story that has all the ingredients that you need to create a suspenseful and enjoyable novel: intrigue, romance, psychological horror, an interesting story of a woman who finds out the shocking truth behind her brother's death, and of course, murder. The author's plot is very well-paced and I really enjoyed it. I liked the way that the story took me on an emotional roller coaster that is full of twists and turns that I never expected. The ending was very satisfying and brought a tear to my eye.   The writing was very good. This is a very well written thriller. I really did enjoy reading it and could totally see myself reading it again.  , October 25, 2017  I am a fan of the author's novels and have loved his other books, such as "I, Spy". This one is a short but satisfying read. I thought I would read the story of his sister, and was glad I did. If you're a fan, or want to get to know the family well, and if you enjoyed "I Spy", this book is a must. The family dynamics are interesting, and there are some good twists and surprises, which kept the suspense. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves thrillers, mystery, mystery novels, psychological thrillers.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "A wonderful read."   --Robert G.   I had been looking for a long time to read this book - and I think it's a gem! I love science-fiction and fantasy, and read a lot of non-fiction - so I thought I would give a science-fictional novel a go. This book is a lot more than that - a very well-thought-out and beautifully-written book that will keep me hooked for a while, with a few new things I can see. I recommend this to anyone who likes science fiction.   the science in this book is done very well, and is really what is so great about it. It's the science and the details that really made me stop and just enjoy it more.   and as far as the characters go, they were all real - not like some of the other books I've read, which seem to have 'fluff' in them, but the characters were very well realised, and it is very hard to imagine what would have happened if they'd all got away.     As I said, very well done.  ... but it could have been better!   There were a lot (many, many) of small things in this story that weren't explained, that didn't make sense - and as a writer you can easily write them in and make them make sense, but they didn't to me. So many times did I have to google things that were very easily explained to me... but not to the characters... I don't know what I expected, but there wasn't much of that.  -and the ending could have used a little more.

I think the most interesting part of the book is the description of the whole life cycle of this book. The first chapter and the last chapter (if you read only the first chapter) will give you a good idea of what the book does and why you should read it.   The author also did a great job of explaining how to make the book interesting, but also make it engaging.   He shows you in the first and last chapters the many examples that explain how these people live their lives. From finding the right person to work with to their personal philosophy and even how they use their money. He also gives a lot examples of things that he has seen in these lives and his experiences. This makes the book more interesting because you will know about other people doing the same thing. You will see them doing interesting stuff and will understand why they do it. You also will see that not all the people in these "interesting lives" are very successful or happy. Some of them may not be in this book, but they are interesting people.  , by Gary Vaynerchuck
Write a positive review about a good book: ************************* ******************* ******** ***************** ******** *** The End of History and the Last Man in the World - by Paul Fussell and Christopher Clark ***** * The End of the World as We Know It, by Pauline Kael, 1971, first published in French in 1966, English edition by Perennial Classics in 2002. The End, of course, does not mean the end of man. It means the end, by accident of history, of the last man on the earth. Pauline and Christopher, in this book, argue that, with the end coming, there will be no more wars and that civilization, as we know it, will have vanished. This is true. With the end will come the end and the end that is coming will also bring the end. The civilization of the world will have gone away. We will no longer have any knowledge of who or what we are. All that we have known and experienced will vanish into a void. But Pauline is also a pessimist. The future is bleak. If man is not careful, with all the horrors of this coming dark age, he will destroy his own life. In the end there will only be one man alive to tell his story, his last words: 'The End is here. I am the last person on earth. Goodbye. My love, and may you all find peace.' This is what Pauline means by 'the last man' and she makes a strong case. The most striking fact about this book is that it does not say anything about how man, if he survives, will go on. As a child I learned that a war is not like a plane crash. We could not stop it. Even if we could, there would be more to worry about. We are human, after all. So in this sense The End is not a book about war, but one of peace. It is not about the future, but a view of the present. It talks of the nature of history but it does so as if it were a past event, a past catastrophe that has passed. It does not deal with the future. All it has to do is tell how the world is coming to an end. It has nothing to do with how a man, or a society, survives in the future; if it does, the whole book is wrong. To survive in the long term is to be aware of the dangers of the past, and to look ahead,
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________  A very good book about love, loss, and life. This is a beautiful story, one of a loving husband, and his best friend. I read this after the tragedy of my brother's death, so I can relate to the characters very well, though not to the point where I wish them ill. I do understand the struggles their lives have been through, and would probably read this story again in a heartbeat.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________ I am in the process of editing a biography that I intend to write about a young man from the American South who left the North and went to England to train as a lawyer. I was inspired to do this after reading the biography by George A. Zabriskie which I believe to be the most important book on Southern history written during the 19th century. The biography is based on his own journal, letters, and correspondence and is extremely well written and informative. A wonderful addition to any library. It was a great joy to read and I am very thankful to have read it. I had a lot of fun editing this book and it is a pleasure to write such a thoughtful book. --D.M.  Review of the book:  George Henry Zabrigsky was a prominent 19th-century lawyer and educator who established the first law school in the South. He became very famous for his book "The History of the American Law School" and became a leader in the creation of Southern colleges and universities. This volume by Zabrickie provides the reader with the history of the law school at the University of South Carolina and other schools from its origin in 1819 until the rise of Reconstruction in the late 1860s. It covers the law schools at the various southern colleges and explains the evolution of the school from a small local operation into a nationwide institution in the 1850s. The book also discusses the history and the formation of law schools in other southern states in the mid-19th century, including Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. This is a history of law school and a survey of the development of the southern legal educational system.  and other southern colleges, including (Alabama, Georgia,, North Carolina,, South Carolina,, and Tennessee.). This is  an excellent historical account that covers the entire development of law teaching at the S.C. law schools and shows the growth of the profession from its early days in the common law. --J.R.    Review from an anonymous reviewer: -  "The History" is an excellent book on the rise and development of Southern law schools. Zabareshie has an easy-going style and does not try to be scholarly or academic, and the work is a great historical review. The text is well-written and clear and it should become a standard text for law teachers. --F.D.  to the Review-Journal

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ The Good Lord Bird by Mollie MacKay, published by Random House, is a good read if you're a fan of the science fiction novel The Martian or if you love books about people's feelings towards the planet Mars. I liked this book, although I'm not a big sci-fi reader, so I'll go ahead and note that MacKay writes some very good sci-fiction that, while certainly imaginative, is not without its flaws. It was a bit slow at times, but I didn't mind that at all. The characters were also quite complex, but that's just a personal gripe. A few of them did grow on me, but most of them didn't. This book also had a few minor plot-holes that I found rather amusing. I really enjoyed reading this book. The Good God Bird by Robert Aickman, published in 1959, is considered by many to be the best science fiction book ever written and it is also considered by some to be one of the best non-fiction books ever written. The most memorable part of this book is a quote that the protagonist says after the war is won: "If I had known that the world would turn out as it did, and that it was so important to save all life, I might have chosen a different path. But I had not known. I had been tricked by the devil, and he was too good. The world is too good to be true." This book is more like The Good Devil Bird and is probably my favorite Aickmann novel, although it is by no means perfect. This was the last book that Aicknam wrote before he died, and it was a very personal and emotional book for him. It is about the author's life, the author being his son, and the author himself being a writer. Aickner said of this novel: "I think it's an essential story because it represents the fact that life doesn't begin with a single moment, but with a series of unforeseeable collisions and shocks that, if we're lucky, can be mitigated, minimized, and managed by a sense of perspective and humility." This is a very good book, one of my favorites.  Read an amazing review by a professional reviewer. ______________________________________ The Road of Broken Glass by T.A.

Write a positive review about a good book:............................................... This book is brilliant. It is like watching a masterful conductor of classical music. The story and characters are so believable and complex it has the ability to make you cry. This book really does make you question your beliefs and preconceptions about human nature. When I first finished it, I was in a state of shock and amazement. I could hardly believe what I had just read. I highly recommend this book to everyone regardless of your spiritual or scientific beliefs.  Read an unedited, original review of the book................................................The story is fascinating and the character's actions, thoughts, and decisions are very well thought out and believable. If you're going to read a book and find yourself thinking about it after the fact, it's a very nice addition to your shelf.   Read a review of a version in a different language......................................   The author is not a very religious person, but the story is really very effective, because it is a story about two people who were friends and were not very good friends. I had no trouble believing that a man and a woman who had never actually met, could possibly have the same experiences in their lives, at some point. So the book is a great, great read.   the characters are fascinating and complex, and the plot is clever.

I thought I would be completely overwhelmed by it but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was very straightforward. I like that there are several explanations of why certain rules apply. I would definitely recommend this book for people who are interested in math and want to learn some of the basic principles behind these rules. I did find it a bit complicated at times. It took me about two to three months to master it but I think it would be beneficial to learn the material as we go along.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "In the same way that I felt the pain of watching my parents suffer from depression and addictions and their lives destroyed before my eyes, I felt that we as authors have to watch ourselves, watch each other, because as authors, we write and we give and we do the things that we think will make our characters feel better, but what we are doing is making ourselves sick. This book did the work and it is a very honest book. It showed us how bad the state of the world is. And how good people can get very sick and sick well." -A "This book is about addiction and the power of love. It's about love. How love can heal and how love can destroy and how we don't know the difference. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever suffered or knows someone who has." -M "I loved this book so much I cried." -H "Hats off to you. This is one of the best books I have ever read. It has a lot of truth in it, so if you're someone who doesn't believe in love or believe in God it will be difficult to get a good read from this book. But if you've ever felt like there was something broken in you, you will relate to the feelings and the pain. You will be able to see the good in yourself. This was an amazing book." -B "A book I will read over and over until it makes me laugh my ass off or until I have the courage to do it. Great work." -S "The story is just plain great and I have seen so many different interpretations of what the book is like. I think it will make the reader's head spin.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********   I have been following this series for a while now and I am very glad I did. It is a very interesting mix of fantasy, thriller and science fiction which does not take itself too seriously (in my opinion). The story is set in a world where people who have had the same DNA as their ancestors have the potential to change the world in a positive way. There are a few things I have to say though.   The first thing I noticed was that the author is clearly not too fond of writing in the third person. It just felt off to me. I have noticed that many authors feel the need to write in third person and when I say I didn't care for it I mean I found it distracting. That said, I don't think this was a major issue because as far as the story goes I found myself enjoying the POV characters a lot. They did not feel contrived and there was no over-emphasized description of the character's appearance (I was looking for that). However, that did mean I didn´t know very much about them.   The characters do have some great traits and it was fun to see them in action. The thing that bothers me about them is how they seem to have no idea how to react. At times they acted like a total moron. They acted out in the most inappropriate way possible. Sometimes they just acted out for the sake of acting out. Sometimes, even though they were out of line, they just did it in an entertaining way. It bothered me that they had no idea what they were doing and acted like complete idiots. The other thing is that they seemed to not be able to distinguish between right and wrong in a proper sense. The fact that they didn´st know what was right and what was wrong bothered me a lot because it was a very basic thing.  -The author did a nice job in giving us the backstory of the main characters. I liked that. The author could have had more time with this. The story, especially with the first book, went a bit slow for me.   and this is where I will admit that I felt that the story could have been a bit better. But that does not mean the story is bad, I just have a few criticisms to say about it. For one I think the author could tell a little more about the characters. It would have been nice to have more explanation about what exactly was going on with them. For the

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The author, James D. Murphy, writes for the general reader in a general sense with a good number of useful and entertaining observations. The book is divided into four parts. The first, which is the most readable, deals with the origins of the Indian tribes and with the great migrations into America, beginning with the migrations of the Hopewell and the Shawnee and going down to the time of the arrival of the first English and their subsequent dealings with the Indians, including the Indians' own dealings with each other. The second part concerns the discovery and settlement of the West, and is divided roughly into three sections, on the Rocky Mountain region, California and Arizona; the western and eastern regions of the United States, and on Canada. The third part is devoted to the history of the Indians of New England and the northern part of Canada; it is divided between the early French and English; the British and Canadian Indians, in addition to the Iroquois; and the present-day Indian tribes. The last part covers the Indians as they are today and the fate that will likely come of their present form."

Write a positive review about a good book: *********************  I picked this book up from my local library and I'm happy I did! I like to learn new things and have a nice book to read.  *****************************************  An intriguing read!  My husband and I enjoy reading biographies of important people. So I was especially interested in the life of Abraham Lincoln, but I also wanted to learn more about Lincoln's wife, Mary Todd Lincoln. So this was a great read. I found Lincoln's life fascinating, but the more I learn about Mary Todd, the more it seems she's not that interesting. Lincoln's marriage is more of a drama than anything else. The interesting parts are the background, family, and events during the war. However, I think it was the first Lincoln book I've actually finished. I've read other biographies, but usually only finished them on the first chapter and then never finished the rest of the book. I really enjoyed this one and would recommend this one to anyone who is interested in Lincoln and his wife. .
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am now hooked to my new book. The story is gripping and interesting. I like the way that it combines science and psychology.  If you can read biology and chemistry, it's a fun read.   The plot was interesting and it had some twists and turns.  I liked that it was based on real-life cases so that I didn't feel that the author just invented the idea and added a few details.  Overall, the book had some flaws.  The author used a non-naturalistic approach to the plot, which caused some problems, and some readers might be offended.  But overall, it was very interesting, and if you're a fan of mystery, it will be interesting. 4/5 stars " I am so glad I found this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The God Who Wasn't There: A Biography of the Prophet Muhammad  by Richard Bushman. 5/10 The book is a good and engaging read, but it is a bit too academic for me. The religious-political aspect of the story is not the main focus, but more of a supporting role. However, there are a few passages of the book that make it worth reading. In fact, I enjoyed reading it even though the religious-philosophical content was not my cup of tea. I also liked the way in which the book explained the importance of the Quran in the early Islamic era. In my book, the Quran has always been the ultimate source of guidance for me, so I was really curious to learn more about it. In some cases, I feel that the book could have been shortened to more clearly illustrate the themes in the book. But I also like the fact that Bushman doesn't waste time on long explanations of complex ideas. 4/10. The other main criticism I have with this book is that it is very repetitive. The chapter on the life of Prophet Muhammad is repeated about a dozen times. There is not enough time to discuss the subject. In other words, I would like to see more in-depth discussions of the religious aspect of Muhammad's life. In conclusion, this is a decent biography of a good man. If you like historical narrative, you may like it.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I am a graduate of an engineering school in an engineering firm in the US. My mentor was one of those "I have been working for years and am still waiting for an answer" engineers who always seemed to be right. One day in a lecture, he said that a good engineer should always use his/her own best judgement. That was an epiphany for me. _________I was also very inspired by this book as well as "The Last Engineer", both of which had been the most inspiring book on engineering ever to come out of college. I'm an engineer, so my work has always been somewhat subjective, and it's always been frustrating that I can't just be objective. This book has given me permission to be more objective about my work, which is wonderful. ____________________ I can not say enough about this book. It is absolutely amazing. The whole story is very good and I feel like it's exactly what engineering is about. The story about the engineers themselves is fascinating and moving. _________________________ This is one of my top ten favorite books on engineering. It has the best illustrations ever. I find it is very difficult to make good, logical arguments, but I found this book a good way of explaining and making the case for how engineers should approach their work. It would be good to get another book on this topic, as it is not a book that I would necessarily want to read all the way through. ____________________________________________  I got this book because I was in the middle of the book by the same author. It was an interesting way to explain what engineers do for a living. The illustrations in this book are wonderful. The author's approach to explaining how engineers make their decisions is refreshing. It's a good overview to give students who are in the same field. It will help you understand what they are doing. This is an excellent book.   The book is well written and covers all the major points. It covers the whole spectrum of engineering and gives a variety of examples. The book does seem to suffer from being a book about engineers. Most of the examples that the book uses are from different engineering disciplines. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Red Tree" is a beautifully written and well researched account of what happened to the American Redwood trees when logging was banned in the United States in the late 1970's. It is a well documented account of the devastating effects that logging had on the health of these unique and endangered trees. It provides a nice look at the changes that logging has on the tree and the effects it has on both the individual tree and its ecosystem. There are many other good books on the topic. This book is a good read. Review: "The Red Queen" by Michael D. Lough is a wonderful historical look at what really happened during the end of the First World War. It tells us about the events that led to the deaths of over 40 million soldiers during the war and the aftermaths of those wars for the world. This is a must read for anyone with any interest in the history of our world and military history in particular. The Red Princess by Stephen Crane is a lovely story set in 18th century England about a young woman who lives her life surrounded by men and war. She has many different loves in life. She loves to read and is one of those people who enjoys the company of others. She is in love with a man named Jack, who loves her back. She knows her husband doesn't love her, but that's ok. In fact, she knows he loves her more. She does not want to be in love because of jealousy, she wants to be with him. She can't do it, but she is determined. One day, she comes upon a letter from the man she loves, telling her he doesn't want her anymore. But the letter also tells her that Jack is coming home. She needs to make some tough decisions and decide if she wants her love back or if she needs to keep her true feelings to herself. I loved the writing, the character development, and the plot. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history and military fiction.

I know a lot of people say that they don't read fiction because it doesn't interest them but this book blew me away.  This was my first book of the genre and I have already fallen in love with it.   If you are a fan of historical fiction, or a military history buff you will love this book. I think this is a good historical novel that could have been great if the author had written it from a different point of view. I am a military historian by profession. I have written numerous books for different publishers. I am not one for making up stories but this one was true. The best part about this book was that it wasn't a typical epic story. It was a historical novel and if you loved any of the great epic novels by the likes of Tolkien, C.S. Lewis or John Grisham you would like this book too. If you like historical fantasy and/or military history you will probably love it too. If I can give this book a 6.5 stars I would be extremely pleased.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I didn't like this book. I have no idea how the author can be so sure of the existence of "the world's greatest scientific breakthrough" when he makes so little use of it. I didn.t like the main character, he was obnoxious. He is in an abusive marriage, and he is a big loser. He doesn't want to be the best and so he wants to be better than others, when he actually isn't a genius. He thinks he is good at this. I don't want people to think I am the worst, so this book was really hard for me. This was my first book in a while that I was a little uncomfortable with, but it wasn't a total disaster.   Next book I'm giving a zero because the author has shown that he doesn't know what he is doing.

I have no problem with the story or writing style. The character relationships were interesting to me, and it was nice to have a "back story" so to speak that I can read about on my own time. There was a bit of romance in the book, though not in the typical romance way. I would have preferred it to have more romance, but this didn't affect the overall enjoyment of the book.  the story itself is very interesting. I feel like the author used an interesting plot and characters to keep my interest throughout the book and that the ending was very satisfying and happy. .

I teach in a public school, and I am constantly reading and rereading this book as I am writing each day's lesson plan. Each day's lessons and reading comprehension exercises are presented in the best way possible.    It is great to have the book, because the lessons and discussions are clear and useful, and have made a definite difference in my own and the other teachers' teaching.   The book has been a great source of inspiration, as it provides the ability to go back and read and reread the chapter in a better way, to take out what I didn't like, and to use it to give our students what they want in each lesson.  , this book is useful in two ways. It is very practical; one can use it in any teaching situation to give an overview of key points of the book. Secondly, and most importantly, the book is fun to read and use.   the book has helped me with my own teaching and I feel that I owe it to my students to try and improve my own technique.

He has gone out of his way to ensure that his children have a life with a purpose, something they can be proud of, something that they can look back on and say they played a role in making a better world. I think of him as the ideal father because he is always thinking about the best interest of his family, and always looking to be better than he is now."  Read this book, love it, and then you will understand how a true hero is not what you think of in the media. It was a wonderful book, the first of its kind I had ever heard of. A true hero and an inspiration to anyone who plays poker, loves it, or loves the game of life.   This book is not for those that do not like to laugh, or feel joy, or are just curious to learn more about poker. It is for those who enjoy it, play it, love the game, and want to know about its roots and its future. I am glad that I read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. This is a good, fast and easy-to-read introduction to the basics. I really enjoyed it. I would say it is for a beginning writer who does not know that a novel should consist of many short stories rather than a single story. It is not a story-focused book; the story is the end result of a series of short stories that can be read as a stand-alone novel or a book of short story. The stories are a mixture of comedy, horror, action and suspense. The authors make it clear that a story is only as good as its ending - the rest is filler. All of the short stories are well-written. The only problem I have with the stories is that they could be made longer and made more interesting. I thought the endings were a bit weak. The author has told all of the stories and has been consistent throughout the books. I am not sure if the reader should be able to tell whether a story ends before or after a few pages and whether the writer has given the final story a complete ending. I find myself wanting a few more short stories to complete the set. It was a fun read. I liked it and it was great to see so many different genres coming together to tell one big, interesting story.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I'm an experienced coder and the author goes into very great detail about C and the C++ programming languages. The book also contains quite a bit of history on the C/C++ language. The code examples are very good and the book is well laid out with all the necessary code. This book is very informative for C/c++ programmers of all levels and it has a very good flow from the first chapter to the last chapter.
Write a positive review about a good book:  My boyfriend is an avid gamer and he read this book right before our Christmas holiday. I had never heard of the game before, but I am so happy to have found this book. In the book, there are quite a few examples from the game and it can get a bit confusing at times. I felt that I had to make sure that I read this before I try my hand at the game. The game was pretty easy to learn as well, and the game is a game that should only get more enjoyable as you play. The only problem I had was that I was having trouble remembering the name of every character I made. The book does also include some rules for how to build the game, and there are some good points about how the game should be played.
Write a positive review about a good book: ******** I recently picked up "How To Write" by James Allen as a Christmas present. I loved reading the first section and then couldn't wait to start reading the second. This is a fantastic and unique book for writers. I think that a lot of writers out there could benefit from reading this book. The writing is quite original and it is great for writers wanting to get their own ideas out there. The author also has a great passion for his subject. ********  Rated 5 out of 5 by danielpaulm from Great book! This book is a fun read and a great read for writers, either for free or at a low cost. It covers some basic topics, including how to start a book, how to write a synopsis, and more. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is that the sample chapters were a bit repetitive and I felt a bit bored. That said, it was still a great, informative read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm an American and, after finishing this book, I got lost in the Britishness of the characters. There's something about a place that makes a person want to write a story about it. There was an author I knew who wrote books with American characters, and every time I read one, I wished he'd written one with British characters. I felt the same when I read the book. It was just so beautiful.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________, I found this book to be a refreshing and interesting read! I thought it would be a fairly quick read, but it was far from that. It took me a while to figure out what was going on in the book, but that is a good thing as I think there is something to be gained from trying to read everything at once. In addition to the novel in the box, the book also came with the book's jacket, two maps, a DVD, and a nice postcard. I am sure I will be picking up the next book from Harper, and will have my fingers crossed that the same thing does not happen here.

Write a positive review about a good book: Â The book is so good it makes me wish it had been made into a movie, or even a TV show. Â I would definitely reccommend it to anyone with an interest in the early history of our country.  I am amazed that the book is still being published.    The story of our founding fathers is so important, and the book tells it so well.  I've read it three times now, and each time I am more enthused and more knowledgeable about our history.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________   "In A Clockwork Orange is a book that's worth more than just a single read, more than even a few minutes. I wish I could give this book a perfect 5 out of 5 stars, but my heart can't. I'd like to say that every time I read about a criminal or rapist, it's a great read and I feel more empathy towards the protagonist, Alex. I even felt more sympathy for Alex when he was the one who was raped. He wasn't just a random victim to be tortured. He was a real person. But at the same time, as much as the book did show Alex as a victim, it never really showed his rapist as anything. And in the end, Alex was the only person who ever felt the rape. There were no scenes of Alex feeling his attacker's pain or anger. He saw his rapist only as a sadistic creature, who took his enjoyment out of hurting people. "   I read the book after finishing it and felt a little bad, because it was as good as I feared it to be.   The writing is extremely good, I had no problems understanding the meaning of the sentences. I was surprised with the way it was written, for a science fiction book it's very realistic. The descriptions of the space and other locations were good. I also really liked the idea of the characters as a whole. It was quite a nice idea. They weren't all the same, but each person had his or her own personality and there was also a bit of a rivalry between them.   in the beginning I was a little confused when I saw that all the crimes in this book were committed by robots. I wondered how they did it. I wasn't sure if it was human-like or robot-like. But after seeing what happened, I started to understand it a little. They had different personalities and that was how they developed a personality.     One thing I loved was that there was a lot of sex. In fact, I've read that there's no sex in the book, it was all robots. But I was quite surprised that there were quite a lot sex scenes. The sex scenes were very intense, especially when Alex was raping someone. They were very arousing to read. I didn't get bored at all. I loved it.   (I've been told that the sex scenes are one of the main themes in the novel, if you want more information you
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of J.K. Rowling. When I first read the Harry Potter series, I was very impressed. Then as time went by, I came to find out that J. K. Rowling was an extremely bad author who plagiarized all the time and that she had done so with her own works as well. I really couldn't recommend reading the Harry Potters books to anyone who really likes good fiction and literature. The books were terrible, and that's the reason why I haven't been able to finish reading them. When Rowling came out with the book that has been written as Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, I bought the book. I found that I was pleased with the story, and I thought that it had a really great plot and the characters were well developed. Then I read the second part, and in the second book, I felt like I couldn't finish. I don't know how many times I had to stop and go and read the last page to finish the book because the characters wouldn't be able to keep up with the plot. There were so many problems that I couldn:t take it anymore. I know that the whole point of the book is to read the first part and then the second, and then finish the third. But even then, I didn't finish because I was really annoyed. This book is not funny and the main characters are not good, the plot didn't make any sense, the dialogue was awful, the magic wasn't used at all, the villains were the stupidest, the main villain was the most boring, the characters weren't likeable and the author didn't put any effort into writing them. If you are interested in reading Fantastic Beasts, I suggest you skip this book. If not, you are much better off finding another book that you like. I have read several books by J. Potter but this was the last one that I recommend.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's good.    Good for my little one, I don't think. I found this book to be a little bit old-fashioned and it seems that a lot of this information came from a very limited perspective which was based on a very outdated, biased, self-serving worldview, or "perspective".    So, if you're a fan of what the authors refer to as the "toxic modern world", and you're looking to improve your mental well-being, I think you're better off avoiding this book and looking for a book that is based on the modern worldview, a perspective that I think really is a very much healthier one that's focused on how the modern world is a much better place, or at least, it's much less toxic, than the one that this book offers you.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book on the recommendation of a friend who said it was great. I've heard good things about it and I was pleased to find that this was indeed true. This book is so good it's good. I would say this is a book that anyone should read and it is not for the faint of heart. The writing style is very engaging, the plot twists and turns in an intriguing manner, and the characters are all complex and interesting. The author also takes the time to do his research about the world he's written about and I think he does a good job with it. It also makes you want to visit the world of this book as well.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "It is the true story of a heroic and courageous hero who fought the Japanese army for over 1,000 days while carrying out a very daring and innovative plan that saved many American and British troops from capture or death. The story begins when Captain Edward J. Smith was assigned to a small company at Pearl Harbor and was transferred to a new position as an observer at the USS Iowa. When the battleship entered the harbor on December 7, 1941, Smith was given a mission: take the radio room on the top deck and take down a message that had been received by the Iowa before the battleships arrived. Smith and the crew at his unit took the message and successfully transmitted it through the ship's communication and telephone systems. Captain Smith was then assigned to take the position of an observer, but was moved to the gunnery department when the battles of December 7-12, 1941 were over."

My first book review of a young adult novel. This is my first YA book and it really surprised me. I'm a fan of the books of Joss and this is definitely a high quality read. The writing style is great and i really liked the book's characters. It's about a boy who wants to know how his best friend died and gets into the woods with his best friends who do not want him. It was pretty scary and I felt that it was realistic. It felt realistic to me because i had been there and i know it feels like being there. I didn't like the ending but I'm glad I read the book because I don't like to read in the beginning so I'm hoping I can finish this soon. I will be going back for more! Thanks for a great read!  I am so impressed with this book! I love the characters, their voices, and their struggles and how the situation develops and the ending and how it felt like.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "A well-researched and written account of the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" (  Review of Religious Research  - Vol. 29, No. 1, Winter 2002/03, p. 28). "The book is organized in two sections: an introduction that summarizes the historical context and the major issues, then a detailed history of Utah's Mormon population. The author has provided an excellent historical review of the LDS Church and its growth over the last two hundred years. As a result of her extensive research, she has presented a detailed account of how the early Mormons viewed the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, the founding of the Mormon religion, and the beginning of LDS Church history. She gives a positive overview of what the LDS church stands for and why it should be regarded with respect and admiration." (  Religion Today  and  BYU Studies  Vol. 14, No 1, Spring 1988, p 9) "There are many interesting and valuable features in this history, and in this review, I wish to highlight several of them. In this book, she draws attention to two themes which, in my opinion, have contributed to the success of the church. One is the "one true church." Another is the attitude that Latter-Day Saints hold towards the Book Of Mormon. She notes how, during the 1840s and 1850s, many Mormons had difficulties with some of the ideas in the Book and the Book itself. It is worth noting that these problems were largely due to misunderstanding and mistranslation. The first author gives an excellent overview of the issues which Latter- day Saints had with the Book, while acknowledging that many things were not understood until years later, especially regarding the purpose of the First Vision. She also gives an overview of how a large number of the claims made by early Latter- Day Saints in the early 1840s (which included the idea that Joseph Smith translated the Book from an Egyptian text) were contradicted by Brigham Young when he published the official history of Latter Day Saint history in 1852. The second author provides an excellent background for this history of Mormon migration. It takes the reader through the history of a community that has been characterized by numerous dramatic events. It also takes the readers through some of Mormon history's most tragic events, which are sometimes overlooked in history books.  A Review by  William G.

Write a positive review about a good book:................................... This is the best book I've read on how to be successful in business, in all of the business disciplines and the industries that make up the American economy. The best, most valuable book I have ever read in any aspect of life. It's the only book that can replace any course, any seminar, any book, anything, for what you will need to do to be a successful businessperson. I highly recommend this book to anyone who's even remotely interested in making a living in the United States and especially to those who have been making excuses for themselves and have been letting their career stagnate as a result. You will learn how to make money in the most profitable industries, how to create value, how your clients love you, how much better you can be than the competition, and how to go from the bottom of the ladder to the top of it. It will open your eyes and will lead you to the realization that you are more than capable of living a financially independent lifestyle. If you are looking for information on how you can turn a small business into a multi-million dollar business, this is the book for you.  See all 5 reader reviews...
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I'm not a fan of science fiction. I find it very hard to sit down to read anything that has a human-based theme and/or is written by an author who has a bias towards that subject. But this book did exactly that, in a way that I love: a non-human perspective. What's more is that the story is completely believable. There's nothing fake about it, no "Oh, but aliens wouldn't be able to survive on this planet." I would love to find out the secret behind the giant eye, but it's too early to talk about that now, since this book is already over 30 years old.   What I Liked: --------------   1) The world is made up of four major continents, each with a different culture, religion, and political system.  2) There's a huge range of human-like animal beings: cats, gorillas, dogs, horses, wolves, monkeys, and the like.  the story mostly revolves around the humans (and cats, the only animal humans are in fact able to breed with) but there are also numerous animals. This is interesting, as it allows a lot more diversity in the story than would otherwise be allowed. ....  3) It takes a while to get used to the fact that the animals on the planet can talk to one another, which I think is a good thing. , for example, is not a dog, but an intelligent cat (who also has the ability to speak with humans). I liked the fact, in particular, that some animals can talk with the humans without being aware of it. The ending is surprising, but not totally unexpected.  : 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) 6)  In some ways, the world of the book is like that of, say, the planet Mollari from the Star Trek universe. We've got a lot of alien races, including human-type beings who are capable of using tools (including computers) and even writing. The world that the main character is on is a far cry from Earth. There are no cities, no paved roads, no cellphones, no TV, no cars, and nothing else. So it seems that the alien races who live on the world, although not all that advanced, are as advanced as humans are capable at this point in time.In other words, although humans might have problems that could only
Write a positive review about a good book:  "We all need a little push occasionally.  I know I was. ____________________________________________" Review:  "I got the second edition of this book last year, and I have to say, I am not much a fan.  It is so filled with spelling mistakes that I would have to be one of those dyslexic types to get through it in one piece.    But, you know what I found the most difficult to get my head around?  The fact that this book was actually written by a mother!  Even the most elementary of us are supposed to be able to tell the difference between a good woman and a bad one, but that was very hard for me to do!   My husband and I are both very proud of the man that we have become and would have been much happier had we known that the book was written by our own daughter!  In fact, it was only because of the many errors and awkward grammar that I was able to understand half of the book.  If you are thinking that a mother has some sort of secret to make a good child's writing look good, think again.  So, if you have any doubts as to how good a mother can make a child's work, I urge you to read this book and tell me what you think!"

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so glad that I read this book. I really enjoyed the story. It's about a woman who was given a kidney by her grandfather. She never really felt comfortable using it. She eventually does, though. And she ends up going into the hospital to get her own. The story also ends with an ending that doesn't have to do with being happy. There's a very good reason for what happened.   The first part of the book is the beginning of the story, and it's a good beginning. The stories about her childhood and her parents are also good, if a bit slow and predictable. She also seems to be getting a little wiser, though I wasn't sure how that was happening when she was 13, or how old she was when she had the kidney transplant. The book begins to do well when we learn how much her life has changed since she gave the kidney, but her family still doesn't know. I found myself thinking about my own family, and how there's still no real answer to why my grandmother died, and my parents still don't know why my grandfather died, but we do know that we've all gone through major changes since the day that we were born. The author has tried to use this as a setting for what would have happened if my parents had been different people. It was pretty effective, but I felt that the ending was a little disappointing because it seemed to be kind of a cop out.   a good read:   13 of 14 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________The best thing that ever happened to me was reading this. I read this book because it's something that my friend sent to me in the mail and I wanted to give it a try and I found this book, read it, and then started to think, "hmm, this is good" and then thought "oh, this isn't good enough to be good, so I'm going to start on the next one". Then I started reading it and I finished it, thinking, "Oh this isn t good enough" and it was then that I decided that this book wasn t good at all. But, I read it and it's good! This book is actually about a little boy who had been sent away from his mother and who had to find a new home, but it is about something else than just that. This book, as the title implies, is about a cat. A cat who was raised by cats and was sent to a woman who raised dogs, but he was sent away because he was afraid of dogs and he was told he would probably never fit in with them and that he was weird. I think it's safe to say that if that were the only thing I got out of this book and I had just read the synopsis I probably wouldn't even be reviewing it. But I got a whole lot more out of it. I got something about the cat's mother who was the cat who raised him and I got the mother's love for her son and the way she cared for him and the fact that she tried to help him understand that it was better for him to be in the home with cats than with dogs, which she knew she would never be able to do. I also got this part that I think is about the cats and cats and how the cats were taught to respect the human world as well. I don't know if I would recommend this book to anyone, but if you're a cat lover and you're interested in reading about this story of a cat who is adopted and brought to another home and goes from the one place where he had been abused to a place where cats are supposed to be, but just can't be because he can't get along with them, then I'd say go ahead and read this.

Write a positive review about a good book:!!! I really enjoyed this book. It helped me think a lot about the role of religion in my life. I have always been a very traditional Catholic. I used to have a pastor at my parents church. I also always prayed before meals and never had to. Now I am married and have children. I did have to pray before meals at times, but when I did it was not a huge deal. Now that my kids are older, I do have to have it every night before we go to bed. It took a lot of courage to try to come to my own conclusions about my religion. I was so excited about finding out that the Bible says there is a God who makes heaven and earth. It was such a relief to read something that explains everything. I know that there are others out there who are very religious and don't understand things in the Bible, but I think the book helped a lot. I can understand why so many people are afraid of changing their religion.

Write a positive review about a good book:  What if I told you that this book is not only a great read, but also an amazing book to use in your everyday life?  I had heard about The Secret before and this book was the reason why I gave the book a shot. I have used The Secret every day for a year now and I love it. It has helped me in so many different ways.  It is really something to use as a daily reminder for yourself or someone close to you. I love to use it every day when I do chores around the house, or when I go to work. It is always there and gives me a reminder to get up and get going.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book and highly recommend it.  Not only was it engaging, but the story was quite interesting.   It had a nice mixture of comedy and drama.  The only problem I had with the book was the ending.  I was hoping it would be more satisfying, but it ended on a sour note.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read a number of "D.H. Lawrence" books, but this one is among my favorites. I like the sex, violence, and drug use, though I was surprised by the lack of humor in the book, especially since Lawrence was a serious writer.   There are several books by the author that are worth reading, but I'd like to say it's the only book in the series that I'll read all of the way through, and I enjoyed it, though there was some repetition of information and plot points in the later books.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The Book of Genesis is a book I've been meaning to read for years, ever since I first heard of it.  It contains stories and insights from several of the major figures in the Bible.   It is a very helpful and insightful book.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- The new book, "Walking Away", by Tom Lehrer, is a collection of stories from the period when Tom was a college student, about the people who are trying to find their place in the world after the loss of their youth and the disillusionment of the times. The book is a very good read. The stories are real, some even from the past! There are some people, even with the best of intentions, that are doing what they can to make the best out of the situation, which makes them even more human. I have seen this happen, too. Tom Lehrenr is a good guy and I believe the readers will find him a great speaker and writer of his own words. There is a strong voice that resonates throughout the book. There are times where the stories of the time are not very uplifting, but the overall theme is one of finding a way out of your own life situation, as it is with Tom Lehr. It is important to remember that when the world is a mess, it is our own lives we are trying so hard to repair. A real lesson for all!  Review by: Tom Lehman I enjoyed this book. It gave me a new perspective. This book gave me great inspiration to learn and live. Great story telling and the stories really make me think.

Award winning book: Good to excellent: ************ The book was very detailed and thought-provoking, though I was slightly surprised how quickly I got into it. I'm very interested in the political history of early medieval Britain and the book makes an excellent case for the influence of Islam in the early medieval period, from the seventh century onwards.
Write a positive review about a good book:...........................................................It's about the last hours of my brother and I. When we heard the helicopters we thought we were going to die. They flew us to the hospital and that was the end.   The book is very descriptive of the military. I wish I had known this before I enlisted and my experiences with the military is different than the descriptions you gave in your review.   of the book I was very impressed by the amount of detail you did include.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I was having difficulty getting into this book. I'm not a huge bookworm or anything, but it is a good read. As I have said before, this is a "mature" book (so that is another good thing). A little girl has a lot of feelings about a girl in the same grade she does, she also has an issue with her mother. This book made me think about the "haves and have nots", and the feeling I have in these situations. That is what this book does. It makes you think.I'm going to read more books that are about teenage angst.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "This is a well-researched, well-written study of the subject that I could not put down." "A well-documented, careful study, that has a profound impact." - A Review of the book by James C. Hagerty, M.A.   (The American Journal of Forensic Science, Volume 37, Number 5, December, 2002, pp. 1349-1359) The forensic literature has an extensive literature on forensic pathology and the science of criminal investigation. Forensic science is the application of science to the analysis of evidence found at the scene of a crime. Forensic science is one of the most advanced and technologically-advanced fields of science. The application of forensic science to forensic investigation leads to significant improvements in the quality and quantity of evidence collected, preserved, and evaluated. There are several distinct areas of forensic investigation: *the detection of a variety of bodily fluids and/or biological substances, especially blood, semen, and hair *examining the physical state of bodies recovered from crime scenes, including the decomposition and injury of the body *examination of a person and of physical evidence, for example, photographs, fingerprint comparisons, DNA analysis, dental reconstruction, and DNA analysis of biological evidence and fingerprints *investigation of crime scenes using sophisticated techniques that help distinguish objects, personages, and crime scenes *probing and collecting samples of body fluids and blood, with the goal of developing new forensic techniques and improved techniques for the collection, preservation, and analysis of samples Forensics is one discipline that deals with the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of a physical or biological scene (the scene of investigation), the effects of any environmental agents, the effects and recovery of a biological sample, and the analysis and reporting of the results of an investigation. Forensics is also the scientific discipline that seeks to understand, analyze, interpret, and report the causes of an occurrence (a criminal act). The use of forensic evidence as evidence in court is governed by several laws and rules of evidence. The Criminal Justice Act of 1984, commonly known as the "Brady Law", provides for the legal exclusion of evidence obtained by unlawful means, and requires the exclusion of any evidence which is inadmissible under other applicable laws, such as the Federal Rules of Evidence. In the United States, there are five different types of evidence that are excluded under the Brady Law: 1) Physical evidence 2
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't really have one for this book, so I'll just say "Great"... I'm glad I purchased this book as it's one of my favorite horror books and one I hope that I'll be able to read again and again. A good book with lots of creepy details. This book is an anthology of horror stories that are very similar in theme. You will find the same kind of horror that I did in the other stories in the collection. I especially enjoyed that the stories were all written by the same author. If you like horror and enjoy reading scary stories then you definitely should read this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read a great book at the beginning of my career that opened up a lot of doors and it helped me get an agent. I've read the rest of the series, but I've never read the first book. I think I might have read the last book before I left and now I can see where some of the story lines in book one took place... So, as I've said before, I love the series and would love to get a second book!
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A must read book...A well written story...Well thought out...This is the only book I've found that contains both science and magic, and which can really be enjoyed by all readers, and not just the science readers. I loved it!"   I am an academic chemist at the University of Exeter. I am also a huge fan of science and my own research is well reflected in the book. I especially liked the way the character of Simon is both the scientist and the magician and the way they interact and the things they discover is both thrilling and funny. I will definitely recommend this book to all my friends who are interested in reading about science and their personal journey, but don't mind a little humour and some great science to go with it.   The author provides a nice summary of her story which I found very helpful: "It took a long time for Simon to accept he was a wizard, but it was not until he had been given the name Merlin by his teacher that he fully accepted his magical powers. He had always thought himself to be a scientist but his studies had always been done by looking at the real world in a very narrow way. Now, he had a wider perspective and this was why Merlin was so successful."

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so excited about this book. It's based on the book by Peter Clines called The New York Trilogy, which was based on a real life story of an alcoholic father who has to find his daughter again. Well, I did get it on audiobook, but I can't say I'm a fan of the narration. It sounded a bit too soft. The only thing that saved me from giving it a zero is that I didn't mind so much because the characters and the plot were so great, that I found myself smiling a lot.   This is the first time that I read a book with three narrators. I was expecting to like the three narrations, but they did not come together to make an impression.   on the other hand, I liked this book quite a bit and recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book and have been a bit concerned about the amount of sexual activity between the two leads which is certainly not a strong point of the book for me (I think there's a good reason for this). My main criticism of the sex between the characters is that it seems very unnatural and that the book was set up to be erotic but didn't get there. There were other scenes which I found really sexy (it is a romance after all) but this was the one that stuck with me the most and made me feel very turned on. I also don't like the way that they ended this book. I thought it was a great ending for the relationship (as did I) but I felt that it wasn't the ending we had been promised. I didn't enjoy this book much but I liked the plot and characters. I will definitely be reading a sequel (not to mention a third of the other books I have left to read...)

I do wish they could have made him a bit more prominent in the story and the writing seemed a little rushed, though it seems he was still quite the writer when he wrote the novel. The characters were interesting and well developed, though one might argue that the narrator was quite a poor one for this type of book - if he could make any changes to his voice, I might have liked it even more.

Write a positive review about a good book:...........................................................................I have no idea how I didn't read this book sooner. It is, by far, the best book I've read this year, and one of the very best books of the year. I read it in a day, and finished it in less than 24 hours. The characters are rich, the action thrilling, the pace brisk, and the plot complex, and every aspect of the story is explained in such a way that you can fully comprehend every single piece of it. It's not easy to be engrossed in a book. The problem with this book is that it is not difficult. It doesn't require the reader to be an expert, just the right mindset and a willingness to stay with the story until the end. The book doesn't force itself on the reader; it is there for your enjoyment, not a lecture...................................................................

The book was so well written I had a hard time putting it down. The characters were very well written, and that was the best part of the book for me. The author had me reading in the middle of the night after having finished a few other books to finish this one. I'll be reading more from this author in the future.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I've always loved the classics. Like many other children, my parents brought me along to the library to see what classic books we had and I've enjoyed them ever since. I was really looking forward to seeing this book on the shelf and was very pleased to find it in the children's section of my local library. I am very happy that it's so easy to read and that my children will enjoy it too. What did you like best about this story? The book is not short on story and it does a wonderful job at telling the tale of one of the most famous villains of the 16th century. This was one of my favorite characters in the whole book. Was this a story you wanted to hear told by your child? If you want to make your children read a good story you must be patient with them and make sure they can do it on their own.

It is a fun read that will keep you thinking. It's not too long to keep the book from being boring. The book itself is a little over 200 pages, but the plot and characters are the best part. It was definitely a quick read and it was enjoyable as well. There were times where I wished the book was longer but I read it all within about 3 days.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book.  It's the best "get off your lazy, old, fat, sick, and dying ass and do something" book I've read in a long time.  I loved this book from the get go, and it only got better from there.  The story was gripping.   It has some heart, but doesn't use it for cheap, superficial, dramatic effect.  This is a story about people who can't keep up with themselves.  It's a story of perseverance and hard work.  There are lots of good character development and the main character does not just fall from the sky and land right in the middle of the action.  He gets himself into a lot of trouble and it is never pretty.  And it is his mistakes that make him who he is, and his mistakes which get him through.  Everyone that goes through a crisis in life is different.  Each has their own path to be taken.  Sometimes this path is pretty straight forward and easy.  Other times it is a lot more difficult, because you may have been raised wrong.   Some people, like James, have no choice but to fight to be who they are.  They have to learn how to handle situations with a certain amount of cunning and courage.  These people are not a bunch of cry babies who have to hide who they really are to save their own skin.  In fact, most of them are pretty decent people.  My favorite characters were the ones who were just a little different than the rest of the pack.  One of my favorite characters is the guy who is in charge of the group.  His name is Peter and he has never made a mistake.  At least not one that we all remember.  Like James, Peter has some issues that he had to confront, but that he has found a way to make sense of.  Peter is just as flawed as James is, but he is not as "perfect."  If you have problems, Peter is there to help you figure out a way through them.  Another character that I really enjoyed was the lady that lives down in the town.  She's been going through some major turmoil lately.  Her name is Carol and I loved her a lot.  We all know what it's like to want someone to love us and to show that love in return.   It is very sad that most women are not able to give that loving relationship the

Even though they are a group of everyday Americans, there were so many things about them that made me cry or laugh.

Write a positive review about a good book:   "Loved this book and read it all in one evening."  Review of the book: I was in high school when I read this book. I had a very hard time accepting that men could be pedophiles, and that women can be pedophilia. When I was about 15, I did my research and found out about a lot of women who were sexually abused as children and also were pedophiles. I was never attracted to anyone other than a girl and would have loved to have been a pedophile like those women. But I had to accept that I wasn't that way. I still have not accepted that. I thought the women in the book had some sort of mental illness. But there are many people like myself, who did not have any sexual attraction until they found themselves with a teenage girl. They also were not attracted to adult women. This was also not their first sexual experience. It was their first time being sexually touched by someone they knew was a woman. These men became attracted to the women they were molesting, and it wasn't just touching. It included penetration, and touching in ways that you would never touch someone your age. For a long time, my thoughts were to deny my own sexual feelings. There were times that I felt ashamed that I had the feelings and actions that I did, because I didn't understand. At first, I tried to deny what I had learned and what my emotions and feelings were telling me. I tried that for years. I felt like I would never be accepted or understood by people around me if I tried. At the same time, I had this strange attraction to a woman who was about my age and whom I had never met. She was very attractive. I saw her as a mother figure. She did not try to control me sexually. But she had this other thing that I could not explain to myself. She treated me like a child. I could relate to her because I had been a child and my feelings were also not understood. It took me about 5 years to understand what that woman had been. I finally realized that the attraction I had had to her wasn't about sex, but about a motherly, loving, protective, nurturing mother. I wanted that motherly connection with her. So I finally tried to live my life with my mother's unconditional love and love her unconditionally. I made it my life goal to be a loving parent for my daughter and to be someone she could look up to
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book very much and find it helpful for many different purposes, from self-development to practical writing to general philosophy and even practical politics.   As a matter of interest: There are several of these "personal growth" manuals that I have read over the years, most of them very well written. But there is something about this book that is different, I think. The authors are not trying to create a cultish style of living (which is very, very difficult) but they are just trying to help people deal with some problems that they have that they are trying to resolve or at least understand. They also present very practical ideas that I think are valuable to the general public, but to the aspiring writer they are so important that they can really help.  .   a few other thoughts:   -There are a few very basic ideas (like, don't eat your vegetables) that are difficult for many people to grasp. But if you really want to grow as a person then those concepts will definitely help. In fact, I would argue that understanding what the "why" is of things is very important for life.   the authors don't always agree with each other, but they tend to be very supportive in their disagreements. I would not have liked to see the authors disagree about things like the nature of happiness (though I think it would have been quite funny), but I did find the authors' disagreements a good thing, especially as it is possible to learn from them. It is also interesting to see how some of the authors differ from each other. For instance, the "realists" like to think that the universe is just fine with everyone and everything having all the possibilities of life, the utopians think that humanity is a special case and that there are some real limits to our happiness and how happy we should be (I think the utopia people are right, of course).   So there are both sides of this coin. But in the end, the book is written in a way that I found very helpful, and I think that it would also help the most "traditional" person like me who has never read about these subjects before. It gives very basic information about many of the issues but is written very clearly and concisely. Also, it is very easy to understand and it was very nice to read a book that actually made sense (which isn't always the case with the books that I usually buy).     I really
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* ******** ******** **** ** The book is a great introduction to the many ways that the universe works and how we can help it function. It helps a person develop a more personal and logical understanding of the world. It's a great tool for teaching a new generation of physicists and engineers that what they are doing today is going to influence how humanity works in the universe in the future.   The book is written in a fun, accessible way with a healthy dose of humor and even more healthy dose in the fact that the author makes a compelling argument to help you understand the workings of the universe better. It is a very thought-provoking and educational read that will not only have the reader intrigued and challenged, but will also help them to become more in tune with the modern world. A book like this is required reading for all college level physics students, and a great gift to get a person motivated to take physics seriously.
Write a positive review about a good book:!!! I'm glad I found this book. I am not the biggest fan of this sort of book. Not because I don't enjoy them but because, if I am going to read a book about a subject that I don�t know a whole lot about, I might as well learn all I can. I also think that for me, the reading ability is very important. I've learned a lot about how I think, why I think what I do, and how to deal with some of the most stressful situations I've ever encountered (all from reading books). That said, I still think that the author should have split the book into three parts. It wasn�t until I finished the third part that I actually was able to get more out of the book and not feel like I was reading a series of lectures. I know the main character isn't a genius but that doesn�t mean that he doesn� t know some things that a genius like the author knows already. I had to read part two before I realized that the main characters were actually pretty smart people, which was a major shock. All in all, this is a must read.
Write a positive review about a good book: ******** A few days ago I read The Good Men Project by Tom Matlack. If you haven't read it yet, the book is about a male friend of mine who was diagnosed with cancer. At first I felt a bit sorry for this guy, but after reading more and watching the documentary I'm convinced this was the right thing to do. He didn't just have cancer, he had a chronic disease that was slowly killing him. He made the decision to do his best to get better but not perfect, not to go to the hospital and let a doctor make a final call. His friends, family and neighbors helped him every step of the way. His wife had to be his rock when it came to getting through the tough times, I mean he would have killed himself had she not stayed with him, she was his life force. He did have to get to the doctor every once in awhile to make sure his illness didn't get any worse but that's a small price to pay when it was necessary. And in the end I'm glad he took that step.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "Moby Dick is, like the other three novels by Herman Melville, a masterwork of narrative. It is one of the most ambitious and well-conceived novels in history. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have, and as I would like to read it again."   A great book! I am so happy my family loves it. The illustrations were gorgeous and I'm happy to see the book now has a print edition!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this to be a very enlightening book. I've been thinking about it for a while and finally decided to read it after listening to a podcast on the radio and some of the writings of James Allen and then reading some of his material and reading many of his books. This is the book I've read in the past that had the biggest impact on me. It's really a wonderful, and practical, analysis of human behavior.  - Steve, Florida, USA
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------- Read All Reviews | Submit a Review --------------   Readers of a certain age may recall this as a very popular book in the late 1960s and early 1970s. I think that some of the older readers might feel a little old, but I think it's still a very good and interesting book that covers a wide range of subjects including the history of religion. The author does a superb job of making sure you understand the history and religion, but also includes some interesting information and insights about contemporary topics including politics, music, technology and social changes in the last three centuries. I enjoyed this very much.   I'll try to give a general idea of how the book works, and what it does. The book opens with a chapter on the origins of the Christian belief. He writes about the beliefs of the early Christians, how they grew, and why they changed. He then moves on to the different sects of Christianity, and the rise of one of the major ones: Roman Catholicism. He talks about the persecution the church received, especially from the Roman government, and their subsequent persecution of the other groups as well. He does a nice job of showing that the Roman Catholic church did not invent this belief, but rather grew out of the earlier sects that had their own beliefs. He also discusses the problems with the doctrine of infallibility of the Church, and how the doctrines that the church believes, and makes decisions on, are dependent upon the faith of the people making those decisions. Then he goes on to some details about how the Roman Church has treated its followers, especially in the recent centuries. He gives an interesting history of how various sects tried to influence the Roman church to make changes. He discusses how some churches have a "hearts and minds" policy, where they try to convince their followers to adopt their own opinions, and that this has sometimes worked, and sometimes not, depending on the people involved. He describes the influence of the Protestant Reformation, and other Protestants, on Christianity. He goes on from there to the early Modern period, with some descriptions of how that came about. He mentions the various churches that were forming, and some that weren't. He outlines how the modern age began, and explains how those religions got into power and influence. He says that in the modern era the influence in the world has been very, very positive, with many new religions growing up, and helping people grow in their faith and their own spirituality. He concludes by giving a brief

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have to give credit where credit is due, there are some really interesting aspects of the book but the parts that seemed to be taken from others, and a bit of editing and rearranging, and the way it's written could have been better.   The first part is pretty good: I liked the title a lot.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so interesting, that it really changed my perspective on human beings.   The main character, Satoru Yamamoto, is a young man from the Tokyo suburbs who's never had a girlfriend. However, he has been a high schooler for three years.   (hide spoiler)   I think this book really deserves 5 stars because I'm so happy about this, the story is fascinating. The character Satoro, also a highschooler, seems to be a bit boring and slow, but I think it was necessary for the story to progress.The main characters are really interesting. Their stories, which are told in the third person, are very different. Satori and Satoros life were very different, but they have the same goals, which is to find love.They have different motives, but their motives are pretty much the same. The only difference is their motivation.The book's style is perfect. It has a lot of action, a lot more suspense than I expected, and the story's complexity makes it feel so well paced and realistic. It's like a real book. I loved this story!(view spoiler)The main thing I like about this book is the main characters motives. They do not have any selfish motives. I'm glad for that. It makes the story more realistic. They are not good guys. There are some good guys and bad guys in this book, but the main protagonists motives make it feel really realistic. And I like that.The only negative point about this novel is that I think there's too much time spent on character backstory, and not enough time on plot. I don't know if I agree with that. There's a lot I liked about this story, but there's not enough in here.Overall, I'm very happy with this book. It had some good parts and some bad parts. It was an enjoyable read and I think I enjoyed it a lot. I enjoyed the characters so much. It will be interesting to read other parts. There were a lot that I didn't like, but that doesn't make me hate it, or anything. So, I recommend this to anyone who likes a mystery and a good story. I also recommend this book to people who are interested in Japanese history and culture. (view spoiler)] (view review)
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________________ The End of History and the Last Man by George Steiner This book has a lot of interesting material, such as the history of the world, and the role of genetics in the survival of human kind. The problem with the book though, is that it doesn't really make any sense. This book, if you read it, you will not be a science major, because there is nothing in the book about what scientists actually do in their scientific research. The author argues that we need to go back and re-examine the whole concept of history. In my opinion, this is the last step to complete any logical thought that you have had, so this is not a good way to teach history. I think that the author of this book thinks that everything that has been accomplished in history has come because of technology, or the invention of the wheel, or other new inventions. This is very naive and is not really history at all, but the author makes a good point that if we really had to go on and do the work that we were supposed to be doing, we would not have been able to make the progress that we have made, we could not have built the great buildings of our great civilizations. In short, this book is about the last man. The idea that this man has to go out to the edge of space to fight another man to prove that he is the final man. This man must prove that if he goes to the space, he is still human and that if they ever meet on the edge, he will die of old age. This last man must go to the Space to prove he is immortal and immortal men have to die before they can go to space. I found this book really very disturbing. It really didn't make any scientific sense to me. This one was pretty much only my opinion.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "When the weather in the region became too mild for the great book, and I wanted to stay in the house and read on my Kindle, I had to wait a little longer to get this one. In the meantime, I've read it. I think I'm in the minority, but I like the characters so much that I wanted more. I've also become fond of the ending, but that's my own opinion." 5.  The Snow Queen  (Anne McCaffrey) 5 stars,   Amazon "Anne McCallister does her best to explain how the real world works. This book will teach you how the world works (it does), but what it will also teach you is how to survive in it. It doesn't matter if you have the common sense to figure out how the magical land works; just be prepared to live it and survive." 4.  A Wizard of Earthsea  ( Ursula K. Le Guin) 4 stars,  Amazon A magical world where a small group of people try to stop the King of Fools from starting World War III. 3.  Perdido Street Station  (China Mieville) 3 stars,  Amazon "The setting is familiar enough to have been read before, but the story is new and engaging. Mievil has an interesting story to tell, and the book is nicely done." 2.  The City and the City  (Nancy Kress) 2 stars, Amazon The author is very good at describing what a place is and how it functions, but not as good at creating an interesting place. The whole book is set in the same "place" where she lives (New York City) but only so much happens. 1.  King Solomon's Mines  (Neal Stephenson) 1 star, Amazon  "It is a long book and the plot is not complex, but it is engaging and full of surprises. Stephenson does not provide a lot of details about how he did all his magic, but then you have to wonder how much the author knows." If you are looking for more books, there are also a lot more on Amazon, and you can find them in my Goodreads list. Or you can do a search for books that have received 5 stars. So, have you ever picked up a book on Amazon and found that the description was inaccurate, misleading, or just downright wrong?
Write a positive review about a good book:    I purchased this book when it was first released. When I read it, I was really excited. I am a writer myself, so I felt that the story was unique. I liked the premise, the characters, and the idea of having a character that is not just a good guy. And I did like the "I can't believe they're doing this" speech.   When it came to the story, I felt it was one of those stories that is so well told, that the reader doesn't have the time to feel the emotions of the characters. I think that the idea, the story being told by one person, is what makes it so good.   a book that I enjoyed:   I enjoyed this book and the other three books that were in this series. I can see that it is the type of book that could take several rereadings, or even more. It can be frustrating to be so close to finishing something, and then having to go back and reread it, and see how it changed over time. But as long as you enjoy the story itself, you can put this one down.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I just got this book in the mail and it was the best thing I've ever read in any genre. I can't stop reading it. It was a real surprise to find the best of the best in this genre that were also good writing. I highly recommend this book, but you should buy it before you go on vacation. There are a couple of parts to this book that you should definitely not read. The first part of this book is about the boy's day at school. That part was really good, but it was also kind of stupid. The boy who was going to give this book the worst review I've written, started the story with "You just got back from school today" and it took about two pages to explain who everyone was and why he was there. I would give this part a 2/5. I didn't mind the stupid part, but I don't like having to explain what's going on to people who aren't my friend. That aside, I really liked this part. It gives you an idea of who is who, what's what, and who is what. I liked the parts where the girl was telling the boy about a boy and I just think she was a little much, but the girl did have a little bit of a crush on the boy. In my opinion, the best part of the book was when the boy was telling his teacher about a certain friend. The teacher was telling him about a different friend and the story started there. The main reason I really like this part of it was because it showed how important friendship was. This friend was a boy who told him how he was afraid of his father and how he never asked him for help and how his father wanted to hurt his friends because he didn't want his son to be weak. He told the boy that he was in trouble because he was alone and that he didn`t deserve to be. That was the part I liked best. The other parts of the story were a bit of filler, but there was nothing bad about them. The ending was a bit cliche, but at the same time it was a good ending. I like it when the end shows something that can be solved and that's what this book showed.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "Well written. The first half is just about the main characters. The characters are interesting, well-developed and develop over the course of the book. One of the best part of the story, however, is the last half of the novel. In this section, we see the characters struggle with life after the accident and how they deal with what happened. One thing I liked in this section is the way the book builds to an ending and the way it gives you closure to the characters that has been left unanswered. I love when books give you a way to make up for the gaps in the world-building or character development that might have happened in the past." "So far, so good. The story is engaging and the characters are complex and memorable. I like that they get a new name in the book: They are "The Peculiar Boys." The book is well-written and not overly complicated. I enjoyed it."

Write a positive review about a good book:   The world is a sad place and I will never believe that the world would have been a better place if we had left them behind. I do not think I would have gone far as a writer without finding the work of JRR Tolkien. I am a fan of his work and a big fantasy fan. The Lord of the Rings is a wonderful book that has had an enormous influence on me and my own writing. It is hard to find a book that does not seem to have been influenced by it. I love the setting and the plot and the characters. As a fantasy fan, I cannot see myself giving it up. I cannot find anything to add to what they have said.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished this book! I was very happy with the whole story and the final ending. I recommend this book to everyone. This book is really the ultimate "how to" book for creating a working website. It gives you a great foundation for all the tips that will be presented in the following sections. I personally found it a little confusing, as there are a lot of different things that I had to deal with when creating a website, but these tips were very very useful. They helped me find the right answers on how to do all the different things I needed to do to create a website. For example, I could have easily been left with a website that had no features or only the bare minimum. That is where you will find these sections.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A Good Man's Death  by David J. Stewart (Bantam, $25, 338 pages).  There's nothing I liked about this book as a young adult.  It's about the death of one of my friends, and about the events surrounding the burial, and that seems like a pretty dry summary.  This book is written in a clear, clear voice.   David Stewart writes in a style I would consider modern, but the prose is elegant and the humor is clear.  It's like an old detective novel - the details and the dialogue are the same, but it's so well written.  One of my favorite novels in this category, but I have to disagree with the author's claim that his book was "written for people who are trying to kill themselves."   It isn't a novel about suicide, just a book that happens to have the death scene in it.  The plot is a mystery, but in the end the characters don't want to live, and the reader isn't meant to think there's anything sad about it.      A good read.

Write a positive review about a good book: ***********The best story about gay dating ever!!!!*** I didn't find much good information about it on the net but this book is definitely good to learn about it. I'm a 32 year old guy. I started to go to gay bars when i was 15. There were many gay guys who were not afraid to date a woman. We had lots of fun with each other at the bars. I was in love with my first boyfriend and we started to date again but after a few months I started feeling attracted to the other guy. It wasn't like a relationship as in we had feelings but I felt like I was attracted to him and that it wasn't normal for me to have feelings for someone. I couldn't explain it but I was just feeling a little different. When I came back home after college I asked him for a kiss on the lips but he didn't want to. I said to him "do you remember how good it feels to kiss a man when you're attracted to them?". I thought about it for a while then he said yes. It was a great day and I felt very happy. He was the first gay man I ever kissed. My dad was always trying to convert me and my mom was very religious so I never told them about my new friends in the gay community. I kept my love for my first love a secret for years after that because I was afraid my parents would be upset. I finally confessed to my dad when i got a car and it was the only way i could afford to go out with my friends. My parents thought i was crazy but they were happy that i had finally let it out. Then in a few weeks my boyfriend asked me for a date. This was very strange because i was so excited to see him but he was so weird and we didn't have sex. I tried to tell him that i loved him but the only thing he could say was, "oh yeah it's nothing you don't understand" and he said he needed to go. So my boyfriend was like ok i guess i should still love you. I cried and cried and when I finally got the courage to tell my mom she didn't believe me and told me that my boyfriend lied to me and i would never find anyone like him again and that i would have to go live with her. I didn of course told her he lied and left. I think i went to a gay bar every day but I don't know how many times. I still haven

Write a positive review about a good book:   "This book explains how to use these techniques to make money."   A simple, practical book that does all it needs to get you started on a path to a better income. The author, John Stossel, clearly explains the steps you need to follow to start a business (and the steps it takes to create it). He also explains how he got into business through a series of unfortunate events (including getting a job that ended shortly after it started, the death of his mother, a bad marriage, and a disastrous business partnership), and how he worked his way up to being a successful entrepreneur.   I've always been interested in entrepreneurship, but I've never had a solid, easy-to-follow explanation of the process. Stosse's book is a great place to start. He's not talking about some elaborate plan; he's simply explaining how to make a profit in a very easy-going, down-to earth way. It's a book that should be read by anyone interested in the topic, and everyone can benefit from understanding the basic principles behind starting a business.
Write a positive review about a good book:............................................................................................................ I was a bit skeptical about this one. I thought that the book was going to be like that book I used to read where the main character was a little bit crazy. Instead, it was more realistic, more down to earth, and more believable.   The main character had his son, a little boy who has autism. He is also very shy, often being scared of the dark and the loud sounds that surround him. When he goes to his dad, he doesn't do well at all, mostly because his dad is very angry at him. His dad doesn't want to be there for him when he needs him the most.  , it had the main guy's dad, and his son's mother. It was a really nice, real, very real depiction of a child with autism. The way she felt for her son was very believable and believable. She really wanted to help him, but was worried that she wouldn't be able to because of how he'd act. She also was very worried about him getting hurt because of this. But it was really funny and poignant to see how their relationship changed with their son's autism.   it was a very short story. It lasted about 4-5 minutes. It is a good short story with a good, funny ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A brilliant reinterpretation of the classic book, The Bible and the Future of the Jewish People by R. L. Steverman.   This book is the best of the best from the American Jewish perspective.  It is a great addition to the growing body of literature on the Bible and Jewish thought. I just found out about this book a few days ago and was very excited to read it.  R. L Stevermans work is very important in understanding and explaining the meaning of the Torah.   He explains the biblical text from the point of view of the Jews' original texts, from ancient Israel, with a unique sense of perspective and a unique understanding of Jewish identity.  This is very exciting because R.L. Stoverman clearly articulates the core issues that we need to be thinking about, while giving a unique perspective. He has created a book that will give you the tools to interpret the Torah and make it relevant to you and your life.  I highly recommend this book to any Jewish person or anyone who would like to learn more about the Jewish experience and the origins of the religion. It has the most complete discussion of the origins and purpose of the Bible that I have ever read.  The author writes in an interesting style that has been the main draw to this book.  He gives a detailed look at the original Hebrew and Aramaic texts, the Hebrew version of the Gospels, and how these texts reflect and relate to the other traditions and the other religions in Judaism and the world.  It is very easy to follow and the topics are all presented in a very interesting way.  There are many fascinating quotes from the Bible, including a great deal about Jewish history and the creation of the world and even God.  R. Stovers book is a very helpful and valuable addition to any Judaica collection or study library.    I wish that every book that I read would have this kind of balance, perspective, and depth.    I've been looking at my Torah all my life and the last book I read was a few years ago and I really enjoyed it. I did not want to read anything new so I was going to buy another one for my son but I was worried about the content.  Luckily the first book I ever read about Jewish culture and traditions was in a collection by Rabbi E. W. Jackson called American Jewish Life.  In it, I learned that the Hebrew word for "

Write a positive review about a good book:!!! (June 28, 2017)  I first learned about the OCA in 2004, while researching a book on the subject, and it was an incredibly eye-opening and illuminating experience. I had no idea that OCA's had such a huge influence on such a wide variety of disciplines.   I learned about this subject and I learned about several other subjects which I did not know before. I was able to really dig into and understand many different topics.  -I now think that the OCE/OCA model is superior to other models and the fact that it is so highly regarded and so widely applied, is a testament to its value.     -I am more knowledgeable about how to teach students, and therefore my teaching style has improved considerably. The teaching style used at my university is totally different. I have had students come to me for help in writing a thesis. It has never been difficult for me to be helpful.   I also now know the difference between an OCA and a OCE as a whole, and how they apply to different areas.   of course the OCCU model has a lot to offer as well. but not as much as this model does.  , a friend and I discovered and started using this model after we spent 3 months in the Middle East studying Islam. I read through this book several times over the next year, and then used it to write a 3 chapter undergraduate thesis on Islam and the Islamic world. We discovered this model was more valuable in these areas than we ever anticipated. This was the first time in our lives that we had truly made progress in a subject, or even in the same subject we had been studying since elementary school.The first time I heard of the OCSD Model I was looking into getting an MBA at Princeton, but after reading this book, I decided to go to business school at Columbia instead. I can honestly say that it was the best decision I've ever made. I learned a lot more in business school, and have more valuable knowledge than I ever knew before. In addition to understanding how the OSEE works, the OCF model is one of the most valuable things I've learned in life. It will be fascinating to see how it applies to the world of software development, and to many other subjects.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________   If it were up to me, a book by David Bowie that wasn't a record would be called "I am not your friend" because if he had had a friend it would not have been David Bowie.   His song about being a friend to the dead is one of the greatest songs ever written, and the book shows that David has a deep, strong friendship with a girl named Rita. They have a romantic relationship but their friendship is profound. David is aware of her feelings for him, and she is aware that she is a little bit jealous of him. The relationships that Bowie has with people are amazing. He was a good friend to David Byrne and is good friends with a lot of the musicians in his early life, even though they didn't like each other.   The author has said that the book is a love letter to the music. He is absolutely right. There is nothing that he hasn't said about the music that makes it amazing. The song of the same name is a classic, and David was a fan.   the other songs in the book are good, too.  , and they have a good romance with each other, although David has feelings for Rita that he doesn't tell her.

Write a positive review about a good book:  My students loved this book, but I can't say the same for me.  The book is hard to read.  I can see that the author of the book, Michael Korda, has good intentions.  The goal is to create a positive and motivating atmosphere in the classroom.   However, in my opinion, Kord and his team of authors are completely incompetent, and this is evidenced by the numerous errors and errors in the text.  A teacher who tries to create this type of classroom atmosphere (which is supposed to be uplifting and encouraging) would not use the word "toxic" and would not recommend it as an instructional method. Instead, they would be suggesting that the kids stop talking to the teacher and that the teacher give the children a choice about why they were asked to leave.  What a waste of time, and the kids would be better off with a regular lesson and a different teacher, if it were that simple. I guess this is what happens when you give the kids "more of what they want" and not enough "what they need."   I have a good friend who has a son who suffers from "toxins" in his blood.  I don't think it is fair for the teacher to give the students a choice, but to have to ask the child why he left his lesson after spending 45 minutes with his teacher.    The children should have been given the opportunity to get away with something, that wasn't a sin, or a mistake, and to try something new.  If the child didn't like the experience, he should have gone back to his classroom. As an example of how bad the book is, the teacher says the word Toxics is from the dictionary, but does not have the definition.  For example, let's take the word, toxics, to include: toxics (noun): A substance harmful or injurious to living organisms, esp. as an environmental contaminant or toxic material. In a science textbook, the definition would be, Toxics: Any substance which is harmful or deleterious to living things. (n.) As a parent, I want to be able to provide my child with educational resources that allow him to do better than he is now, rather than having to ask why he was removed from his lesson.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ The Good Wife is one of the best TV series on TV. I have to say I like the way she has gone from being a single mom to having the most powerful law firm in the country on her side. She really makes the office more than just a workplace, she's definitely a hero to the people around her and she's very much a part of their lives. ___________________________  Review by: Karen L.

Write a positive review about a good book:  Truly remarkable. My own journey to becoming an agnostic has been quite similar. I had a friend with whom I shared a house. He made the point that although we believed in God and Jesus, we also believed in all the different gods as well. We were all wrong, I said, the God that I believed in and Jesus was also God, and this seemed to surprise him. So I would also have to say that I was wrong. It was only after reading this book that I realized I had been wrong for years. I have been searching for truth, but never found it. I only know the things that I want to know about myself, and nothing has changed.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________________ I found this book by watching The Wire. I found a book of this sort of quality and depth on TV about a city I knew nothing about, so I was excited to read a book that would be more than just the police station and the drug war, and that would give a lot of insight into the lives of the people who live there. There was more to the book than the usual "hero" is the bad guy, the police are the good guys, and so on, and I could see the writers' perspective that the people in Baltimore did not care about the cops because they knew that their lives were better. They didn't care about crime in a city that had one of the lowest crime rates in the country, because it didn't matter to them, so they didn't even give a second thought to it because that wouldn't change what they were going to get with the drug trade, and this meant that their friends, relatives, and the people that knew them would never become cops. This, of course, is the first problem in Baltimore, as everyone knows that the drug dealers and dealers themselves never cared about the people. They just loved money. They took what they wanted, they had no qualms about taking it away from others, and people ended up losing their lives to this industry. This book was not about the drug lord, because the book's focus is on the police, which I thought was great because it's not very often that the police in books are portrayed well. For example, a book called The Killing Season (which has been translated into English, though the English is not as good as that in the movie, so if you're interested in reading about cops, I recommend The Killing Summer. It is much better written and has far more in-depth stories about cops) was written in 2003 and shows how the drug lords really look after the cops. Even though they are getting killed, and in order for them to have a way out of the industry they have to make money, they want their "bad guys" to be the bad guys. This wasn't about the "bad" drug dealers, it was about the police. It showed that the cops were not the bad people that the authors portrayed them to be, and it did not help people that want to see a change in police. Another good book is Police in My City by Steve Scott, which has even better writing, although the cop is the main character here.
Write a positive review about a good book:    -  If I have one thing to complain about this book, it is that it was a little slow in getting started (I really liked the first 3/4 of the book). There was a very good scene at the end, and the end of the first chapter and the start of the second chapter were very good. I enjoyed the writing style, and I thought the story was very well done. Although this book did not have a very exciting ending, I can still recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery/thriller. There are many people that I think would like this book because it has more mystery/suspense and is a great read.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********************** 1) "The Way of the Tiger" by Robert Schuller is very hard to categorize. It's a book about how some people react to adversity with their heads down, and others fight through it. The title is taken from a phrase said to describe a tiger by the author. The characters in this story are very human but very complex and complex emotions are shown. The character that has the biggest impact on the other characters is a very troubled child. He is the main character in this book and is very well developed. This is my favorite SchullER book. 2) "Hands Off the Goose" by Barbara Kingsolver is about a young woman who is diagnosed with cancer and is given a very hard time as a child. I think that this book is a great example of how people deal with stress by giving it the time and attention it needs. I love this book. 3) "Shelter" by Susan Sontag is a wonderful story about the relationship between an author and her father. It has an amazing opening chapter that tells a story of two women and their fathers. It just has the right amount of emotional energy to keep you engaged for the whole book. 4) "Love and Anarchy" by William Burroughs was the best book I read this year. This book is the story of an artist and his relationship with his mother and his father. I have been trying to read more Burrough's books for years, but haven't been able to find any that really fit the description that he gave. This one is about the two strongest and most complex characters in the book, the artist and the father. Burrough has the perfect description of this relationship and this story. 5) "Lonesome Dove" by Jim Thompson is a short story that I read on my last reading break. I loved this book the moment I finished it. It was one of those stories that made me realize how easy it was for me to let go of the past and become a more present and understanding person. 6) "Distant Mirror" by Mark Danielewski is another one that I've read for years. I've loved it since I first read it, and I have many more of these books on my list. 7) "Rage" by Kurt Vonnegut is a story that really moved me and I love it. This story about a man in the 1950's has everything that makes a great book. 8) "

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------This is not a new idea. I'm not trying to make a point that science is more important than religion. I think this book proves that point and more. If you think science is important but are uncomfortable with it, you might want to avoid this book. The most interesting thing in this book is not that it makes the case for science as more important and less important than the supernatural. The fascinating thing is that when he argues that science and religion are interwoven, he does it well. I hope he does more in this vein in the future.

There are many reasons this book is important, one of the most important being that it provides scientists with a way of conducting experiments with the knowledge and evidence to do so.  I'm excited about the future of research on the mind because it can finally begin to reveal the secrets of the brain that we've known for years now. If you think the book can help you, it's time to become a scientist and find out.

I also thought the story was interesting, but I'm not sure that I would ever enjoy reading it in the long run. I was also wondering whether or not the book was better the first time I read it, so it's nice to hear that you don't think so.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********   I bought this book expecting a quick read. I was not disappointed. I found the book very enjoyable and thought I'd found something that I could relate to.   The book does have a few plot twists but not too much. There is also quite a bit of nudity and a bit more than a bit. There are a lot of sex scenes and some of the sex scenes are very graphic. It is not just the foreplay either. I am aware the author's sexual orientation is not listed in the books synopsis. However, I found it was not mentioned in the book itself or the author did mention it in the back of the book. I read the book in English and I found that it translated quite well. However I would say I read it at an easier pace.  
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________   In short, the first half is good. The story of a young man who was taken from his mother by aliens and raised in a ship by them is interesting. He starts out with a little too much enthusiasm about getting back to Earth (which is in the sky). He gets into a fight with some of the other humans and accidentally kills one. He's pretty bummed out at that point because he thinks the other human was his father and he was supposed to be protecting him. The alien in him begins to re-emerge, which isn't a bad thing. But after that his attitude about humanity starts to deteriorate, and it's a lot of problems he deals with in this first book. I did like his initial attitude of being on a quest to return to Earth, but by the end of the book I thought that his "quest" was to get back to the spaceship. He didn't want to be on the ground, and the humans (who he was basically protecting) didn't either. He went against his "code" of protecting the humans who were his responsibility.  After that it's just a bad story and I didn't really care for it.   The alien who was the love interest in this book was a bit strange. He had one of the most un-human emotions I've ever seen. I just didn't see him as an attractive male or an interesting character. In other books he's not that bad of a character, but this time he's just the most annoying guy. He was a complete mystery to me until I finished the story. He kind of seems like a "hiding in the shadows" guy. I also found myself not liking his alien language (something I haven't heard in science fiction before).  In all I don't like it much. It wasn't that bad a story but I can see why other people would not enjoy it. It was too much about the alien and not about the story or characters. It's just an interesting book to read, but I don t think it was worth the time. - J. R.  for the book  _____________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick. In Philip K Dick's The Man-In-The-High-Castle we meet what is probably the most influential sci-fi novel ever published. This book is not like other sci- fic books because it is not "just" a science fiction novel, it is an epic of science, social, political and political ideas. It deals with such things as racism, sexism, religious intolerance, classism and much more. In a book like this, you should expect a lot of "out-of-this-world" technology. Although I know nothing about any of the science in this novel, I can say that the novel takes place in a near-future America. In addition to being a sci- fi, it also is a novel that is a social commentary, on racial issues, sexism and the class war that is going on in our world today. For a sci fi novel, this is a great read. Highly Recommended ************* (4 stars)
Write a positive review about a good book: **********  As a veteran of many wars I can safely say this book is a good one.

When I listened to the book as an audio book it made me appreciate the book even more.   and yes you need to pay attention if you are going to read the book you should listen at a volume of at least 65 to 90 db and this book doesn't come with an audio. If you listen to it as a book it is the best. The writing is very good, the narration is excellent and I did enjoy it very much.
Write a positive review about a good book:  'A Good Book'  is the story of an Indian man who was given to be an assassin in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.  I liked this because the narrator was able to show the complexity of the character and understand his reasons for committing a particular act.   Another great thing about this book was the way it showed the relationship between Indian culture and English culture, from the introduction of English names to the different ways in which British society works in the subcontinent.  My favourite was when the narrator wrote a poem which expressed how he felt at the end of his day on the field of battle and said it was a relief to be able to go home, to a family, to food which reminded him of home, with a song that was a reminder to all of India that we are the same, and that despite our differences we are a nation which will never forget that.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "...an excellent read for the history novice."   "It's a well-written and informative read... a good introduction to the subject"   From the back cover: "For thousands of years in Europe, the Christian Church (as they call it in Europe) has had a high view of the historical Jesus. It has made the story of Jesus the central part of its mission. As a result, the historical evidence for the existence of Jesus and the events surrounding him have been systematically removed. "   I read this book with a heavy heart. It's sad how this book has to be written. The main thrust is that Christianity was and is a product of cultural imperialism. The Jews have been demonized by Christians since before the Christian era and are still being demonized in our time.   In the history section, I learned of the fact that the "Bible" was written by Christians. A Christian historian wrote the first 5 books of the Bible and the 6th book was written a few years later by his father. He named his father as a Jew and his brother as a Gentile. This is the first historical example of a Jew writing a book about a Gentiles life. He also wrote the book that became the Bible, the "Lectionary" which is the book of the Sundays and Holy Days of the week. It lists the Jewish names of the days and months of the year.  - What bothers me is that this book gives the idea that if you believe in the story about Jesus then you are a heathen. If you reject it, you are an atheist. I think that this is a very important point of view. The book gives a few examples that Jews believed in the Messiah, he is the messiah, he saved the Jews and restored the Hebrew nation. They had been exiled for thousands of generations. He is a descendant of King David and a descendant from the tribes of Israel. He has been chosen by the Jewish people to restore the Jews to the land of Israel and to redeem them from the exile and bondage. These facts are very important to me. How would I feel if someone was to say that I am an atheist because I do not believe in Jesus? There are many people out there who think the way I think.   the book is mostly historical. There are very few stories about the life of Jesus. The stories are of Jesus being raised from the dead and of the resurrection. But the historical details are

Write a positive review about a good book: _________ A very informative, and enjoyable read.   Review Details:  I really like this book. I'm currently working on a Masters in Applied Human Sciences (hence, I'm a bit of a nerdy guy, but it was really interesting to read the scientific material). There is a lot of material in this book which is relevant and useful for understanding human biology, but I think it is a good reminder for all of us in the human sciences to keep up on current scientific knowledge, in order to become better scientists. I am currently studying a very advanced topic (that will make me a bit nervous!) and reading this book was a great reminder of the great progress that we have made as a civilization in this field of biology (and this is my major in the Human Sciences).   The book covers the basics of molecular biology and the molecular genetics and what the implications of this research for the human and other species. A lot of the scientific information is really quite relevant to everyone (and even most of us). I think the authors clearly demonstrate their academic and scientific credentials by using appropriate language, making comparisons to other disciplines and showing an appreciation of the importance of the information.   in general, I liked the book. The author's style is clear and straightforward, and I think that he clearly knows what he is talking about. Although this is a very technical book, I think this book has a nice mix of theory and application. The book does cover a lot more than just the basics. This book is more of a tour through the human molecular biology, genetics, and genomics research than a scientific overview of molecular genetics. I find that the authors cover much more than we usually see in a textbook, although I think they did a good job of maintaining a balance between theory and practice.   the author also covers genetics in depth, which was interesting, but maybe not as in depth as I would have liked. It does go through a lot (though not all) of the basic genetic changes in our species over the last 10 million years. The only down side to the book is that the author did not take into account some of the more recent advances in human genetics (especially in the area of molecular and DNA studies). One of my main criticisms is that he did not mention some of these advancements (the recent research in the field of Human Genetics and Genomics) or even mention the fact that much of this data is in the public domain (in particular, many of the

Write a positive review about a good book:    You have a way of taking a seemingly mundane and mundane subject (history) and making it interesting and interesting. I think the reason I found this book interesting is that you take us from a very specific point in history (Germany, 1871-1914) to look at how Germany dealt with other countries and cultures, while still holding on to its own values and morals. You bring us back to that point in German history to illustrate how the world view and values of Germans changed after World War I (where they were completely defeated and their leaders were sent to prison) and how they changed over the years to the point where they would be considered barbaric by other cultures around the world if it weren't for the fact that they were very religious.   The only negative thing I have to say about this book is that it was very long. It would have been better if it was a bit shorter and more focused on one subject, but I would still have enjoyed reading it, especially with the price.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------I really enjoyed this book, very well written. The character and the writing style are so well written for the setting of the story. The characters in this book were likable and interesting in so many different ways. The main character is a very well done character. I liked her alot. This book had a very good plot. It had some nice twists that I found very interesting. I do not know what the plot is yet, but it seems to be set in a different universe than the previous books. There are some really amazing and realistic characters in the book, and the main character was very likable. The story has some twists and some unexpected parts to it, but the story itself was good. I have a lot to look forward to.I really liked this book. It is well written and I like the characters very much. The whole story was very interesting and I really enjoyed it. The way the writing was done was really nice, I can tell that this is a professional writer.Overall I rate this book 4 stars.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a man who's had his legs torn off by a tiger at birth, and has a wheelchair and prosthetic legs for life.  He travels all over the world with his carer, visiting people who are handicapped, or have a chronic condition.  He has to be able to live independently for the rest of his life and not rely on others to take care of his every need.  The ending made me cry!  And he's not a bad guy!  I'd recommend it to anyone who has to care for someone with a disability or chronic condition in their life, or is disabled themselves.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ (I'm going to start putting my reviews in bold, but not in caps, just so you'll have a good idea about the tone of this review) My friend told me about this book. I am a huge fan of history and especially the history of the Bible. I've done a little research on my own, but I don't know much about historical Jesus. I do know that there are some who don't believe him existed, and that some argue he was a fiction of the Jewish people. I think we need to see both sides of the story, but one thing I did enjoy about this story is that it's a nice mix of fact and fiction. It makes you think, and it makes you question the way we've written our history. I did also like that the book explains that not everyone believed in Jesus, but that doesn't mean that he isn't a real person. That's a good message. I'm a big fan of historical fiction because it keeps us interested. I will definitely be picking this up next for my Bible class.   1 of 1 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:   "The best book on the subject that I have come across. A book that will keep you laughing."  I've learned a lot since learning about the truth behind the "love-hate" relationship between men and women. I wish I knew this back in high school...  From the moment you get to the end of the book, the facts about the relationship become crystal clear. But the book takes a step back and shows you what the two men think about it all.  The book is broken up into three chapters. In the first, you get an explanation of what the attraction-harming qualities of women are (or "The Red Pill"). In the second chapter, the men (the beta) explain to the reader the reality of what women are like (or their "Game"). In this third chapter, you learn what is going on inside their minds.  the first chapter of the Red Pill: the attraction to women (the attraction part)  the second chapter of The Red Pill explaining to the men what women really want (the reality part)

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- A book written by a woman who is in a relationship with a man who is also in a committed relationship is a good read. I had an idea, like I've heard others say, that I would like to see her work in a more sympathetic light. The book deals with the idea that a person in a long-term relationship can grow closer to someone who is not the one they love, but is an important and valued member of their family. However, a significant other can grow more detached from their partner as time passes. If they are too attached to their significant other, their feelings for the person will be less strong and their partner will have to take on more responsibilities that they might have to their partner. In the book, it's clear that she is attracted to her husband. Her thoughts on this topic were interesting and interesting to read. She even talks about the fact that if her husband were the person in her life she loved the most, she would feel the same way about him. So if your spouse seems to not be enough for you, then you may need to try and find a different person to spend time with. I'm not sure what else you can do to make it happen. I'd give it four stars for that reason. It's worth a read and it was a good story, although it's written from the point of view of someone who's still in a romantic relationship with her husband and is now looking for someone different.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I first started reading this novel during my sophomore year in college. I had no idea where it was from but it was definitely well written and it was interesting. It was a very thought provoking read and the protagonist was so well developed. I enjoyed this book very much and will definitely keep it in my list of books to read. I think I'll start reading this when it is released in a few months time.   * * * * out of 5 * *   1. The Author - I've seen this name on more than one book review about an author that has a reputation for writing about characters you want to root for, but in this case I would say that he had the same experience as me. He liked these characters as a person but also as an alien. I can relate to him on both sides. He is an alien who found himself to be a human, or more precisely a human who was an alien as we have discovered so much about this planet over the past few centuries.   He is a very nice human who has no idea of how lucky he is. I also believe that he can become someone who is very human again if he was to become aware that he was not alone anymore. This story is very poignant.     2. The Book - I really enjoyed this story. I'm not sure if it's because the author has a good imagination or that it was a good story for me as a reader, but I can really relate to this character. The author also shows an interesting view of a lot of things and some interesting viewpoints.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I read this book right after having read my other book and had a similar experience. I loved how it brought up topics that had been on my mind for some time but felt they were not adequately explored." - A.C. "I loved this book. It makes me think about the current world and the implications for humanity as a whole. It's a good read." - M.H. "[G]oosely based on the actual historical events, but without having to actually read it, this story of the birth and subsequent reign of the great Roman emperor was a breath of fresh air. This is why I want to write books." - N.J. What I liked:   The writing was extremely smooth and fast paced. The details were well done and it all flowed very well. It made me think of other historical works like "The History of Rome" that I've read in the past and really enjoyed. It was fun and well thought out.  What annoyed me:    The timeline of the world was not as complete as I would have liked. There was not much information given for the world of the ancient Romans as it was simply described in vague terms. Some people believe that the Romans had a kingdom or empire that stretched from Egypt to the banks of the Black Sea and possibly even across Europe, but I don't think this was ever really mentioned. Instead I think most people were meant to focus on the Middle Ages (when the Romans were in their heyday). Also, there were many times when I thought that the story was going to end when an author would get to a certain point and then it would suddenly be interrupted. It would be like someone would tell you "Hey, here's the end of the story for today" and then you're not even supposed to know the ending until the next day. It kind of ruins a lot of the reading experience. How would I rate it:     4/5 =  Excellent.  (Note:  I'm not a fan of Roman history, but this one wasn't a complete waste of time.) I do feel that the author really tried to explain and make his point. I am still not totally convinced by the world that he created, but that's a small complaint. Overall a solid read, which I'd recommend if you want a nice quick read. Thanks to Lila for the review copy!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book after hearing about it from the Goodreads team. My friend had just started working at an office that used it and she told me about it. I liked how it gave a description of different styles of office work.   The book has two parts:  - Introduction  The author describes the various styles of work office workers should be familiar with.  He shows the different types of paper, how they are used and the various things that are on them. It makes a nice background to be able to talk about different paper and how each one is used.   the first chapter, "The paper" explains how a printer works.  a small amount of ink is needed to print out a document. If the ink runs out, the printer will stop printing and needs to be recharged. The book shows the difference between different types (inks) and tells you what they are for. For example, you might use it to print a poster. Then the book tells you why the type of ink that is on that poster is different than the type on that same type of paper (for example, the paper used to print that poster can be different from the paper the poster is printed on) and how to make sure you have the correct type of printer ink when you need it.   a big thank you to the author for this introduction.  . ,  I also like how the author described the types of office supplies. They're not all the same. The paper used for a specific style of work is different from one office work station to another. Some have colored ink and some don't. Some desks and chairs have extra-tall tables. Some people like to use computers and some do not. Some prefer a keyboard and others prefer a mouse.   on a personal note: I love the way he describes the different items. I don't think I've seen a book that does this justice. I like that he describes each one to give a description. He also tells you about the different styles used for printing and that you should be aware of the difference. It's just a nice little introduction to the office supplies to get the ideas flowing.  "What about me?"   This chapter tells you how different people think and how they will approach things differently in their lives. A lot of people just want to get things done. Others just want it to be done the right way. You'll see that there are many differences and

Write a positive review about a good book:.......................................................   It's a good read. The narration and the plot are solid. There is nothing really bad about it. It doesn't need to have been a book of science fiction to work, but it's a book that has enough of that aspect to make it work. It is the science that is the weakest part of this story, though, and that is that it tries to explain all of science without really explaining all of the important scientific concepts. Some of the concepts are obvious, like the idea of the ether. Some are more obscure, like why the ether exists in the first place. Some aspects are not explained, like how electricity works.   This story has been around for some time and I don't remember reading a better book of the genre. If you've got the patience for it and you're not looking for a long book to finish, you'll like it. If not, then don't even bother.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A must read! I am always on the look out for books with fascinating and important subjects which have a positive message, and I have not been disappointed. I have also been pleased to see that Dr. Deen is still writing books, with a good level of scientific knowledge and excellent writing style. He also seems to be very committed to his subject. I am a firm believer in the power of positive thinking - and I think this book contains some excellent information on how positive thinking can help you to live a more joyful life. Highly recommended.   I have been very interested in the positive effects of positive psychology for some time and I find this book very informative.   Book Review: The Happiness Trap : How Positive Thinking Can Sabotage Your Happiness by Dr. Richard J. Davidson - 4 out of 5 stars I love this book! I think it explains a lot about the positive thinking and how it can be harmful. I think he explains how some people tend to think they don't need anything else and that is true but what he said about not really needing to need anything is really good to think about. I agree that many people tend not to be able to put their finger on the right type of behavior and need to be given that opportunity. In the book he said positive thinking causes you to feel like you're "out of luck" and to be unhappy. I thought this was really interesting and I hope he would make a similar book. I'm a big fan of positive emotions and this book has all the information I could ever want about positive emotions. There was one little tidbit in the book that I found very interesting. Dr. Davidson said that there were two very strong and positive emotions which I found interesting. The first was "joy" and the other one was the "empathy" emotion, or a feeling of understanding and sympathy for the other person. The book was also helpful in talking about how these two emotions interact and can be very important to the human personality. One other thing that I really liked about this book was that it explained the different types of thinking and why positive thinking is not always the best thing. I personally found that there was a lot of misinformation about positive thinking, but I think there were some great points as well, for instance on the impact of negative thinking on the health and happiness of people. I've just finished reading The Happiness trap. I really loved this book. The author has some very helpful points about the negative effects of

Write a positive review about a good book:    - This was a great read, I got really into it after reading the first 10 chapters and loved it  I am not a big science fiction fan and I was hesitant at first to try this out, but I am a HUGE fan of the original books, and i thought this book would be perfect to read for the new fans to the franchise. It's been over 7 years since i read the first book, and it's so great to see the universe and characters have progressed to what they are now. I was just thinking that the books had been out for so long and I still loved them, and I can't wait for the next one!  My thoughts:   Great book, easy to understand and great story.  The characters in the series are so fun to read about and the way they have grown into their roles, and their relationships, is so well done. I loved the characters in this series, and that they are such strong characters was something I enjoyed.  "There is no end of wonder, no end to the wonder." – John Williams

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about a little girl who lived in a very rural area and lived in the woods, as far as the eye can see. She has lived in this area for some time and has always felt very isolated. One day, when she was a little less than 5 years old, she finds a little red-eyed dog that she takes and walks around with her and has a little play time. That little red eyes has a curious way of seeing her, so she decides to keep it. She lives with her parents until she is 11 and then her father gets sick. Her father passes away in the hospital while she is alone with the dog. This is all part of the life she would live in her life as a child and she is very close to him. She is lonely, she has no friends, her parents are gone, and so is her father. Her dog is a very special thing to her and she has grown up to love it. A few years later, the dog dies and she gets a dog of her own and she never looks back. This was one of my favorite stories in this book and it is very emotional. It was a heart breaking way for this little girl to go, and I felt like crying at the end of this book. I would recommend this to any reader.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very interesting book about the early history of science.  I didn't realize that the first books were written as an oral tradition.    It seems a little more recent than the oral traditions that are in the bible.  The cover is a nice little illustration of the human body, and the spine is very interesting.  If you have any interest in science, and are a bit of a history buff, this is the book for you.  The book contains references to many other science books, so you don't have to wade through a lot of text to find the sources.  You are looking for references on the sources of the ideas, and references that relate back to earlier work.  This is a great book for a science history geek like me.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the early days of science, but especially for those that are interested in religious history.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins The God of the Gaps is a good intro to evolutionary science, with a good presentation. The book's strength is in its ability to explain the basic building blocks of biological evolution, including speciation, mutation, natural selection, and sexual selection. If you have not read this book or are unfamiliar with it, I suggest starting with the Introduction and then reading the following chapters. The author is a former professor of Biology at Duke University, who was awarded the MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant for his research into the evolution of genes in fruit flies. "I would like to thank the following people for their comments and suggestions which have helped me greatly in writing The God Delusion."
Write a positive review about a good book:    A lot of people have had trouble getting over an addiction to this book. That is one of the most important things to remember about an addiction, which I have. It is not the substance that matters, but the habit. And in this case, the addiction was a form of obsessive love. I found the romance to be absolutely gripping; I could not get enough of it. A lot of times I would lose myself in the story; I have a serious love of the romance genre and would gladly have read any other book about this genre. This was one of those books. My one complaint was that the author did not do a good job of putting out the details about the character. I don't think that the details of the characters were important, but it made the characters more real. If you are an obsessive lover like me, or just love a good story, then this is the book for you. If the first part of your addiction is in the form of a romance, you may find yourself wishing for an earlier, more serious book.

It has the same quality of "The Sun Also Rises" by Ernest Heming. I like the narrator, he brings out all the stories in an authentic way. --------------The narrator is great, the story of the boy and his parents is funny, and the voice is very close to how Hemingly would have used his voice in real life. ~~~~~~~~I bought "The Summer Book" to teach myself to read, and my family enjoyed it immensely.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________   A book that takes some time to get to grips with, but is worth it!   This is a good read for those who like good books, that will help you make your way through a book on history, that you might not have been exposed to.   I liked it a lot, and found myself re-reading it several times as I was trying to think of what to say about it.   is a collection of historical narratives written by people from different nations who were present during the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. There are four different timelines, the first three are set during the time of the American Civil War and the final one deals with the events of the Battle on the first day of the retreat.I found them interesting and varied in style and format. If you want to learn a bit more about the First and Second Battles of Gettysburgh, this would be a good starting point for you. There is also a section of personal essays by various soldiers, that are well written and interesting.The best thing about the book is that it tells the complete story of the events leading up to the Battle, with details from different viewpoints, so you are not left feeling like you know the whole story, which is what you may get from a lot of other books on the subject.The narrative is chronological, but they don't do things in a linear order, instead they break down the history into different sections, which makes it easy to follow. I found this quite interesting as I often find the "official" history of the war to be quite convoluted and inaccurate, as I had read many books about it in school and I have read many Wikipedia articles too. The narrative is also good, and you get the gist of what happened, but you get to read it from different angles. The writing is clean and understandable, and it gives a good overview of what you need to know.The writing style can sometimes be a bit slow and it does take time to start to really get into the story. I would recommend taking time to read through the first two timelines, as they cover the actual First and the Second Battles as they were happening at the time. The first time through would be good if you are a complete newbie, as the first battle doesn't give much back story, and the story doesn't begin to heat up until the second time through. It's also good if it's your first time trying to read anything about the war, as it will

His life was the history of culture on the world stage, in the most literal sense of the term. If all the music in the world, all the literature, all of the artwork, all all the films and novels, were all to a man. Joyce, more than any other living author, would be their master. To live with Joyce was to inhabit the universe as if he were the only person in it."  -Michael Cunningham   *******   I really love the way Joyce is treated here, because the book is not about him at all. In fact, the book tells the story of a young student at Cambridge, living in a house by himself at the time, who eventually goes off to the country to do his master's degree. He meets a writer named James Joyce, who is staying in the same house with his wife and son. Joyce is in Paris, studying at the Sorbonne. In the midst of it all, he discovers this young man at Cambridge who has been there for a while as well, and they get to talking and eventually fall in love.   This is not "The Man Who was Monday". Joyce is not even in it for a year, but rather for the full length of his life. He is just another character in the story. And because this is his story, it is more focused on his personal life, as we are told the real story of his own life.   The main character, Christopher Isherwood, is a journalist at the Times. He begins the story in Paris and becomes engaged to a young woman named Elizabeth Strout, who has married a fellow student in England. When Christopher and Elizabeth return to England, they are separated by war. Christopher travels to Ireland and has a wife and two children. While there, he meets a woman named Bridget. They begin to fall in and love for each other.  
Write a positive review about a good book:!!! This book is just fantastic. I was completely hooked. This book really brought me back into the fantasy genre. I loved it so much I took a second look at the original and added the new book and I've already started reading it! I'm so glad I ordered this! I will definitely order this book again! I don't know what this book is about, but it's really interesting and interesting and I'm curious!   Did you like this book? Do you think you would love it if you were to read it again?
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the second book that I've purchased from this author, and this is by far my favorite. I've enjoyed his other work quite a bit, especially "The Dragon Prince" and "The Serpent and the Moon." This time around, there are plenty of fantasy elements, but the main protagonist is a human with a dragon companion. He does battle with demons in the fantasy realms, as he has in his other stories. He is also in training to become a great wizard, just like in his "The Emperor's Blades." There are lots of new elements to this book, like a new magic system that is completely unique. It's amazing that there aren't already books with magic, but it makes this book stand out quite a lot.   He's a fascinating character, a man of action. His dragon is just like his human companion. Although he is an excellent warrior, he has the most depth and compassion in the world of Astranaar. His life is very complex, and is full of sorrows and heartbreaks. However, I did have a great deal of sympathy for him, as I believe this is how most humans feel. I love that he was a good person, just with a very special trait, a dragon.     Overall, this book is great. The dragons, demons, magic, and characters are all so vivid. I would recommend this book to anyone, and will be looking for more of his work in the future. I have never read another book with dragons, but I would love to try this.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book changed my life. It changed my mind. I never thought I'd see the day that I'd actually be able to quit smoking. I was always a smoker, and I always thought I was addicted to it, but it took a life of its own.  The last 10 years I've smoked about 20 cigarettes a day. I've been very consistent at that point, but this book helped me change my perspective. I realized that I can have my cake and eat it too. I can smoke while exercising. I could smoke while eating dinner. I don't smoke while driving. I have the freedom to choose when I want to smoke and when I don, it's when it's time to. It's all about choices. And I can do that without being scared of what others think or feeling like a bad person. I started out as an only. I knew that I wanted to quit and it was going to be so hard, but I just wanted the good stuff. It was hard to have that, but the thought of smoking was always there. There was always smoke and ash. There's always that feeling of not having any control.  I was afraid of getting the cold shoulder if I told someone what I was doing. I thought I would get yelled at, told I was a lazy and stupid smoker, but not that I was stupid. I would never do that. I'd always make myself have the choice. I used to think that I would just smoke until I got to the hospital and the doctor told me I had an addiction. I wasn't stupid, I just wasn't aware of how serious of a problem smoking is and how easy it is to relapse. This book taught me that there are options and that I have control over my life and that smoking has nothing to do with being lazy or stupid.  It helped me realize that it was a choice. It doesn't have to be a "smoke or be a smoker." I have made my choices and I'm going to continue to make my choices. I'm happy I have this book now, and it helped me keep a secret. It helped us be honest with ourselves and not hide behind a smokescreen of "just do it for me." This book makes me think a lot. I think I'm in a great place, and this book will help me find what I need to make me a success and keep me on the straight and narrow path.  (My rating: 5 out of
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ I can't believe how awesome and helpful this book is. I read it a week ago, but I already have a couple good books in my bookshelf. My favorite of the ones I have already read is The Art of Being Alone by Jim Rohn and The Happiness Advantage by Roy F. Baumeister. I am looking forward to reading more about the science and psychology of how we can get a bit happier.   I have just started to try out a new method for studying that I've been trying for about two months now. I've read all the research on it and it seems to be working, but the only way to figure out if it works for me is to try it out for myself. So, I have set aside an entire day to do this. I will be reading this book with that in mind. The first hour or so I was really struggling a little bit and my attention was a little off, but as I continued I got it more and more. The last 15 to 30 minutes I think was probably the best.  .     So, I know this review is long but it's the last book in my recommended reading list. It took me more than 6 months to read these two, but they changed me in a way I never thought I would ever do. Now I believe in life is a skill. There's so much that can be learned from reading books that I think I will keep doing this for a while. I also know I will never read another book like this again. It's amazing how much I've already learned and still so much more to learn. This book is a must have for all people who want to learn about living a happy and productive life.

We all know college is very important to a lot people, so how do you feel it affected your life? __________________________________  To be honest I had no idea what to expect when I first entered college. When you are going to college for the first time it's very hard to figure out how the heck you are supposed to survive in college and I was not prepared at all. So a lot like other people I have been struggling with how to get myself through the first year of college and it's been the same way every year. In high school and high school for many years I had always been quite good at sports and always thought I would like to try and compete at the next level. So I started a basketball team in my junior year and I got invited to the national championship tournament for basketball that year. So it was just really cool to see how people work when it comes to sports. So at first I did well and was one of the top players on the team. Then when my senior year began and I actually started getting involved in the athletics program at my school it was more than I could handle. I was doing well at basketball, but I started to notice that a lot my friends that had been there longer had graduated earlier so I found myself thinking "What am I doing with my life?". So I had a lot more trouble than I thought I was

I enjoyed it so much I bought the second edition and have already bought the third.  It's not often that a science fiction novel with a strong female lead, can keep me engaged and not give me cold sweats or chills.   The plot, however, did get a little complicated for me at times, but overall, I enjoyed the book.  I'm going to buy the next one now.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I was at the library the other day, and the librarian told me about the first few chapters of this book. It was very interesting to me, and I found the character development to be very interesting, but I felt that some of the stories were just too heavy handed. I mean, this was a young girl who was a child when she was given these powers, and it seemed like some of her abilities were like a kid that was gifted in math or science, but in a way that made her more powerful and more capable than she should have been. I thought the main character was very weak in the beginning and it was almost like a soap opera kind of story, and when she got stronger, she was still like this "little girl" in a lot of ways. The stories she tells about her power being passed down to her friends and the people around her seem like they were done as a soap or something. I felt like there was a very strong emphasis on what these people were going through, instead of having them develop their own powers. It felt like we saw the power in the hands of these other people more than they did in their own, and in a sense, it is an example of not giving people enough credit and not giving them the recognition they deserve.   I liked how she was able to have this power that she could not only control, but that was so powerful, and also had a very clear purpose and goal, but there was this lack of understanding and understanding from the other people around. I think if she wasn't given a lot to work with at first, I feel like she would not have been able to progress.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ I enjoyed the "Grow Your Own" by Susanne Muehlenhard and am now doing the same with the book, "The Art and Science of Growing Your Own Mushrooms," by Jennifer and Rob. I purchased this book from Amazon and had an immediate response from the Customer Service staff as soon as it arrived. The book is a little pricey, but if you have the space and are willing to do the prep work, it is a good investment and an excellent way to get into the hobby. I got this book and a set of grow cubes for $15 plus shipping and got it within a week. It will take a bit to get used to the lighting, but it makes the process very easy. I am looking forward to growing my own mushrooms and am very pleased with the results, particularly the smell. I do the same thing when growing fruit and vegetables, and it's very similar to mushrooms, especially the smell when the mushroom is done. I think it is because the plants have more moisture at this point in their growth, and the moisture in the mushrooms is the main source of smell.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had a friend of mine who wanted to be a writer and was a pretty good one as well.  He told me about his plans, and he made some progress on his writing and thought it was going pretty well. Well, one day, after about a week, he started getting really annoyed at the quality of the writing, and I had to convince him that he needed to put in some work and get it right.  And he did.  His writing started to get better and he started to feel good about his writing.  He told me that he could see it in his mind's eye that it was good.  The story and the writing was very good. What did you like best about this story?  It's really not a story at all, more of a collection of bits and pieces that form a story.  It was interesting that I didn't really see the story until I saw the other stories he had written.  There is no central theme.   There's only a collection and then there's some more in between.  Was this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?  If you didn't mind it getting really dark and depressing, then I think this would be a good listen.  This is a well written story that really shows the power of the human mind.  A great story that I enjoyed.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The World According to Garp by Raymond Chandler (1954)  "I have not read a book so alive, so full of life, so much fun... I had to read this at once." -  L.P. - Chicago "This book, a long time ago, was a revelation. Now that I've actually read it, I feel like the revelation had happened to me, rather than to someone else.... Garp, the most famous screen writer in the world, is presented to us not as a fictional character but as a real person, who lived and wrote and lived and lived on the American stage for thirty years." -  Mary Strain -   New York Times Book Review "A wonderful story about an almost-successful screen writer. Raymond Chandler was not a famous screenwriter at the time, but the novel shows how his talent developed. There's no doubt the story is full of surprises." - L.L. -    London "One of the best books about writing I have ever read, and Chandler is probably the best writer ever. If there is anyone that can take the sting out of the old adage that writing is a solitary art then it's Chandler. His book is a fascinating, lively, exciting, and deeply interesting exploration of the arts and crafts of writing..." - L-J. -   New York Review of Books "A fascinating book on many levels. Raymond is so much more than just a screenwriter. He's a real, live person whose life has been a story all his own..

It's about life and career, and about the people that make up a creative writing studio. And it's about Garp. In it, Raymond Chandler himself, through his wife's memory, tells the story of his long, fruitful career as a screen writer, director, screenwriter, and novelist.  In the book's final chapter, "Garp: A Biography", we get an inside view of the lives of the people in Chandler's writing studio, and find out how a famous actor and screenwriter came to be in charge of this group of talented, hard-working, and dedicated friends.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- Great read and very much a different type of fantasy novel. I enjoy fantasy novels but not one that is all about magic and gods. The story was intriguing and the setting is very interesting. The author makes use of a lot of different techniques like the "Rorschach" effect and the psychological aspect. Although the story and characters weren't what i expected i can understand how this novel could be appealing to someone. My main criticism is the lack of a love story but i am not sure if it is a flaw or not.

I liked it a lot. The story had a lot going for it. It was fun, and I'm glad it was a short story and not a novel. It was not difficult, but it was written well and you knew what you were getting into and what was going to happen. There were a few times when it wasn't clear and I found myself wanting to go back and check to see if it was the same, but otherwise, I enjoyed it. Thanks for making it a real surprise.  If you are looking for a short read, give this a go.  Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was awesome.  I was so excited to read this, and was so surprised by how well it was written and how easy it was to understand and enjoy.  The book starts off with a discussion of the history of the universe and how, while the main theme was explored in this book, the authors take a different approach to this theme.  For example, we get a story about the Big Bang that is, in part, a prequel to the story in this novel.  The other example is how the human race started out and how we have evolved over time.  I did find these two examples and how they were combined to create the universe more interesting than the original topic of the story would have been.  In addition, the author takes a look at the evolution of science and technology to the modern world and how humans continue to invent and build.  There are some interesting observations about science and its impact on society, which makes it worth the read.   My only complaint about this book was that the characters were a little flat.  One person in particular stood out in my mind from the group, which may be my bias, but he seemed to be the only one that had some depth to him and a personality.  It is also worth noting that the only characters that were not main characters in the book were the "pets" that the aliens were using to travel the universe.    The only reason they were main characters was because they were more memorable, which was probably done for the benefit of the book.   This book is a must read for all of you science fiction readers, whether you are a hardcore fan or are a new reader.  If you like science fiction, this is a great read.   If you are not a science fiction fan, then it is a good start to your reading list.

Write a positive review about a good book: ******************" I had just finished the book when I went to an exhibition of modern and contemporary art in the South Bank Centre and came across a copy in a magazine, the cover of which featured a photo of a young woman in a bikini and the words 'the most beautiful woman in the world'. I went home and began to read it and it has stayed with me ever since. I have read the book twice now and would urge other women who are considering having an abortion to get it before they are even considering a termination." - Dr Gwyneth Doody-Smith, author, 'The Joy of Unplanned Pregnancy' (Biteback) (1998) ********************** "I've found that all my abortions have been good ones - and very often unexpected ones, I've been left with regrets but very few. The author, with her deep knowledge of both medical and psychological issues, is able to give you a clear idea of what to expect. The chapters have been carefully researched and a good deal of thought has gone into each one. The authors have also managed to make the book easy to read, but not overly so - for example the sections on the risks and on the legal aspects are a bit dry - but this is understandable, because it's very difficult to convey all the issues you'll need to consider to your parents and the authorities in a language they can understand." - Anne Bowers, author and psychoanalyst 'A Psychoanalyst's Diary' (Sage Publications) (1999) "I have had two abortions, both on very good terms with my doctors and, apart from the abortion itself, I have had the best relationships with both of them.

The whole thing is a bit of a disappointment.  Although I would be willing to read any book on the subject, the problem I had with this book is that it is so very short.    I would have loved a few more pages with the author.  I really feel that there could be a few chapters and a bit more info about some of the characters.  Also, I really would have liked to see more of the world in the last part of the book.  Finally, I do feel that the world building is rather slow.  This book should be about the characters in the world, rather than the world itself.  For these reasons, I gave this book three stars.  Rating:  (more on other reasons below) Author: ___________________. __________________________________________________________________ World:   This was a world that was created by  a very talented author. I feel that this author has created a very unique world, one that is both beautiful and interesting.  It is a world in which it is possible to become something you have never been and have no way to be.  The most interesting part of this world is the fact that there are no gods and magic, because there are people that are more talented and clever than anyone else.  Because of this, there are only people that do have the ability to create magic for themselves.  These people are referred to as "witches" and are considered by the other races to be a nuisance.  However, this is not entirely true.  They have a lot of skills that allow them to do whatever they want.  When it comes to this book, I think that there was one character that stood out to me the most.  He was an arrogant character who seemed to have no concern for others and his own well being.  That person was not in the book all that much, but was there when I needed him.  After this character was gone, I found that the rest of the main characters felt more like the main character was in the background.  As for the writing, I thought the story was well written.  There was no dialogue and everything was told in the way it was supposed to be done.  Even with the characters being fairly different, I felt that I was still getting the same flavor and feel of the story

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's not an adventure I wish I had thought of first.   I enjoyed it as a good action thriller. .  It had some great set-pieces, but I thought the ending was a bit too... 'one-note'.   But it's still a decent book.  My two-star rating is due to the fact that it is a bit 'one note', and I can't say how I would have liked it more.  My friend's book: A bit too 'one dimensional' I was quite disappointed in this. It was just too predictable and one-dimensional. The book is basically an adventure story about a very good and strong man. The main point of the book is not his powers, but his mind. It seems that after a battle in which he's just had his mind re-set (which has now left him with 'brains' instead of body), he now wants to use them to fight and take revenge on the people who hurt him. This is the main plot thread and the whole story was about him using his new abilities. The end is that he gets more power, but he's basically the same as before, except that he is now fighting evil and taking revenge on people who have hurt him, and not just other people. There's just not enough here for me to recommend it.

I appreciated the way the author explored the ways in which the children affected each other and the community."   _______________________________________________________   "A beautiful and touching portrait of a father and his children. The author's candor makes the story of his parents' separation, and his mother's struggle to maintain the relationship with her children, as believable and engaging as it is to read. The book's success and its ability to address some of the most important and difficult topics, such as love, loss and the meaning of life, makes it an important and valuable addition to the family literature shelves. The children's love is real and real-life. And, of course, it's the best part. This is an excellent example of the joy that comes from real- life, loving stories that are not only meaningful and uplifting but are also accessible to all readers."  's new book, is a beautiful and poignant portrait of one father's relationship with his three teenage children. While this is one of the best books I've read on the subject of the modern father-child relationship, its subject and the manner in which it was portrayed in this book is the most powerful.The book is broken down into four chapters. Each chapter focuses on a different aspect of a child's life in the home. The first chapter focuses primarily on the parents' divorce, the second chapter on the children's time at their father's house, the third chapter on their father as a father-figure and finally the fourth chapter on a day at the beach. There is no doubt that the author takes great care in describing and writing about each and every detail of the day at his home. His descriptions are clear and simple and convey an image of an ordinary family in every sense. It's the details that make the book so much more than a straightforward retelling of the events.There is a palpable feeling of loss and anguish that permeates every page of. The descriptions of his sons and daughters is truly heartbreaking. In the first chapter of he and his wife are still trying to make their way through the divorce. The events that happened were heartbreaking, but his father's actions during and after the divorce that led to their eventual separation also left an indelible mark on him. The impact of the divorce is apparent in the words

Write a positive review about a good book: Â "The World of Ice & Fire: A Chronicle of Westeros" Â Â is a comprehensive guide to the world and the series. Â It is very well done and I have enjoyed reading it.     Book Review:     I have heard and read many people praise the Â The World of Â Ice & Â Fire Â by Eddard Rainsford.  It is a long book and it does contain some spoilers but I think the reader gets more than enough information.  In addition the author   makes the readers understand the characters and the situations more well then most other books that give details.     The first half of the book is very informative.  The author  describes the world, it history and the people who are living in the   world of   ice and fire.  They go into many details. The author gives you the history of  the  empire, the  culture, the language, religion and so on.  This part of the  book  is good.  There is very little boring and unnecessary info that is given out in the first part.    
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------- In a very dry book, you don't see how much he is telling the truth, but you hear about how he was mistreated and was never given a chance. So I was very happy when he decided to change his name. I think he is a very well written book. I enjoyed the story about him getting a lot of respect as he has been a very hard worker. I am always looking forward to new books by this author. I have had my eye on him for years. I just loved how he went through a very difficult situation and he has come out much stronger in the end. He is a good, honest and good person. Thank you, George and thank you for giving us another example of how difficult it can be to go through a difficult situation without being a jerk. ------------------------- [Read review]
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read this twice and enjoyed both. The first time around I was a little confused by some of the rules, but they got explained to me during the second reading. This is a fun book to read with a lot of fun and entertainment. There is a bit of action, but not in the stereotypical way. There are a lot less people than I would have expected to see in a dungeon and it all has a very dark and tense atmosphere. I'm glad I read this for the first time because I would've finished it faster if I knew the rules before I read it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this book will make an excellent Christmas gift. It covers every aspect of how to properly do an induction and it is in plain English. If you are curious about induction but don't feel ready to do a real induction, this book is perfect for you. It explains in simple terms how to do it safely and also shows you how to test for proper induction. I have read the first two chapters and have read a number of other induction books in an attempt to figure this out, but never had any luck. I am impressed by how well this book has explained the concept and my friends and family are really pleased that they have found the answers to their problems.

Write a positive review about a good book:  My best friend's mother used to teach at a girls' high school near her home in a rural area of Pennsylvania. Her high school had one female teacher for every nine students. In addition to the lack of female teachers, the school was also very strict about dress and hair and other things that women aren't supposed to be doing in high school. One day, she and her class got to meet a very attractive and beautiful girl who had come from New York. I thought she was the coolest thing I had ever seen in my life. She was so nice and was wearing a little skirt. I told the principal I was impressed. The principal, who was a man, looked at me like I was crazy. I tried to tell him that the girl was actually a very handsome young man who happened to be black. He looked at my friend's mom with disgust and told her not to tell anybody. That girl was the most beautiful girl I had seen in 10 years. I felt like I had just been cured. The girl, though a beautiful girl, wasn't going to tell anyone because of a few crazy girls and a crazy principal. So, I don't know how much the principal knew about her, but she couldn't have been a good teacher if she didn't know about her. And, what could this mean for the black male? I read the book to my friend and she said that the principal told her that a black man is a very dangerous individual because a black male is the most dangerous person in the entire world, period. But I have to ask, "If black males are more dangerous than white males, why are blacks and Hispanics the least dangerous sex in the whole world?" Why don't I hear many white people saying that? Is that because they are so stupid, or because they don't want to be a racist, or just because they think black males aren't all bad? But it's a bad question, because it implies that black males can be good and white males are not. I hope you will find this book very interesting. It's the story of a woman who was born and raised in the South, married a man from the North, and had three children that all went to school. The woman was a teacher, so it made sense that the book would be about her life. Her story is one that is not told often, so I recommend you read it. The book was not so much a story as it was a review of American schools
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ I've read about this on the net but it's been so long since I last tried it that I was curious to check it out myself and I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had reading this. I've been trying to stay away from books that involve vampires, zombies, etc. this one was different because it wasn't about one of those genres it was about a guy that lived in a town but there was something more, that was what drew me to this book. I have been reading this book for over 3 years but I always find myself wanting to go back and re-read it because it's just so amazing. I'd give it a 7.5 I've read the book and had it on my wish list for a while but never really got around to it. I'll definitely be reading this again when I have a chance and I hope someone out there has it too and is as pleased with it as I am.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this and I was really surprised how well this book is written. I've never been into history or biography but after reading this book I was amazed at just how much history has been left out of our histories. The authors go into a lot of detail about the civil war which was one of the bloodiest conflicts the country had ever seen. It's one of my favorites of the Civil War books I've read. The book is so good, I want to go back and finish it so I can put it down and not worry about it or try to think about it. A must read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you're looking for a good read you should try this book. It's easy to read, easy to understand, and fun. The ending is a great twist on a standard tale. If you like Harry Potter and you've got a librarian's touch, you will not be disappointed.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- My mom bought this for me because we have never listened to the first four (I don't really like the sound of that name) and she is a big fan of The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore. I'm a big listener of both (if only because my dad had to go to the ER last week and he listened to them while I took a dump) and have been looking for an easy way to make the first one sound as good as possible. This is that easy. I can't believe how much I've listened to this so far. I know a lot of people can't get past all the commercials but I can and it is AMAZING! If you don't like the commercials, or want a shorter version, there are always the audiobooks. I've been looking forward to these for a few weeks now and they really were so worth the wait! Thanks.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book about a year ago and had a lot of fun with it, especially since I was born in 1985 and am still learning the value of learning by doing. I love the character development, and especially the way the character of the father was portrayed. The plot has some twists and turns but all in all this book is a good one. I would highly recommend this book, especially to those who love children and are also fans of childrens books.  The only negative I can say about this book was that I didn't enjoy all the characters. The main ones in the book are the mother and son. Although the father is very likable, the mother is not very well. If you are going to read this or any books by Mrs. Williams then be sure to read the author's other books. I didn' t feel she was well suited for this book because she had to use some really funny phrases. Also, the story is pretty short for her to be writing all these short stories. The only other person I found a little irritating was the father. He is a very smart man and very intelligent about childrens' things. Although I would agree with his opinions, but he had some very rude and insensitive remarks to the mother. Overall, this is a great childrens book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading, especially with young children. I'm glad I bought it.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********************** It's a wonderful book that takes a long time to complete! As a parent of a child with autism, I feel it is important that a book is written that doesn't shy away from what is difficult and what does happen. I'm amazed that in this day and age, we aren't talking more openly about this subject. I have two other books with autism on my shelf for young children that I can reference when my child reads this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: ***********************I found this book to be very helpful and insightful. I loved this book because it was easy to understand and explain with examples. It's definitely a must-read for the people who have not studied economics yet or people who want to become more educated about economic problems. It makes a good investment because it teaches you how to analyze a problem and analyze a specific problem to come to a solution.I highly recommend this book for beginners to the economic world, but also for more advanced students and readers who want more in-depth information.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very helpful for many reasons. As the author, Dr. John O'Neill, says, it will enable you to answer "more important questions." For example, I have several questions about my own physical health. Some of my friends are getting pregnant and want to know the best way to get pregnant. How do you get pregnant? What kind of pregnancy tests do you use? How does it work? Does it work if you have cancer, etc.? Some of the answers are found here and I hope they will help many of you. And finally, my own experience with this book will help me to realize the value of this book to my own health and future. It is the best health book I have ever read.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********** [In addition to having read the book, I would like to add some comments on my thoughts as I read it. First of all, the "invented language" system is interesting. It is not so much a dialect as a different language. The system has a lot of grammar and vocabulary from other languages, which is really cool. My only criticism is that the book doesn't really explain how this works and does not explain the reason behind the system. I suspect that someone like me, who uses a variety of languages, would be able to write in a different system. It's also possible that I would find this system easier to learn.] ************* * * * As someone who has been reading "non-fiction" books for many years, I was not really prepared for the depth and detail of this book. It was interesting to see how a language is constructed from the different components that make it up. The book is organized in the same way the language itself is: by topic, by group of words (words that are used in a single sentence). It's a nice, simple way to look at the topic in a language. However, because it is a language-by-language book, it is not very useful for an English speaker who only speaks English or is trying to learn one. But for me, I learned the most useful information about what to expect in each country.
Write a positive review about a good book: *************"I just finished reading this book and I am very pleased. It is a very interesting read and is certainly an enjoyable experience. The plot is very well thought out and the author presents the facts well. I think most of the time I was quite engrossed in the story, but I would say I enjoyed the characters that were introduced and the events that were depicted.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book will make your head spin and you'll never look at your life in the same way again.  I'll read anything for that.  I'm very sad to hear of the passing of John M. Ficarra...he was a good man. I've enjoyed his work, particularly as an artist, as well as his stand alone movies. It's unfortunate that his projects fell victim to studio politics. The only disappointment is that we will never know what other stories he had in store for us, but that's what made the films great.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I'm not an expert on this subject and the explanations are well organized and well done. The story itself is intriguing and the characters are well developed. I think this would make a great "get" for those who are interested in these topics and would benefit from reading the whole book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very entertaining story, and I found myself laughing out loud at some of the more outrageous and inappropriate jokes. The character development, though slow at first, is very well done, and the writing and story were not so heavy-handed that the characters were not believable.  I'd definitely read this one again.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book about what is really going on in society, and what is the reason for all the chaos that our leaders try to cover up. I've studied what is wrong with the American system and the people who are in power. I have worked as a security consultant in several high-profile, high-security installations in several countries (I've worked for some of the biggest companies in the world). And this is a must read book for anyone in the intelligence/security world. I would recommend this book for those who want to know what is going on behind the scenes and how we got into the mess we are in, and who is really pulling the strings. It's like reading about the biggest scam of our time, the biggest conspiracy, and the biggest cover-up in our history.

I had a wonderful time reading it, and am very grateful to have had it as my teacher on my own quest for my inner black woman."  -Chrissy P. "I love your book ____________. It is an important and necessary book that many people seem to ignore or neglect. Thank you for writing it." A positive review from a female reader: "I got this book when my parents (and I) found it at my sister's birthday party. It was a great gift. My parents gave it to me and I devoured it. I enjoyed the book and I recommend it to everyone who needs to understand the differences in black women." The book is a beautiful tribute to a great family and a great community. It takes us through the lives of sisters and cousins, aunts and uncles, mothers and daughters. It shows us what it takes to build such a family. It also makes me realize how great it is to be a black woman in America. I wish all of my black family members a great life. They make this country beautiful and we should all strive to be more like them." .
Write a positive review about a good book:  A fantastic book! One of the best books I have read in a while, but not the last. Thanks to Jorg from a Goodreads review.  What a great book! I've heard many great things about this, and I've seen it recommended many times. I bought it at the end of last year when I was searching for a book for my first year of college (I'm now a junior in college) as I needed something to motivate me to read and learn more in my new environment. After finishing it I had a "Yes" feeling like a million bucks! I'm already reading it again (this time for homework!) and it's still a great read. It was an interesting read and I am already planning to buy the book again once I've finished my first term (which should be soon! :D ) I can't say enough good things about it. I hope this makes your bookshelf a little bit happier ;)  This book was fun to read. A good read, but I would have liked it to go longer. This is a wonderful story for young adults, or anyone looking to learn more about animals and the animals in the world. This is a must read.    I read this as a college freshman, and it gave me great encouragement to read more and learn from the animal world. I love animals and am very interested in how the world is changing and what we can do as individuals and as a nation to help the planet and animals thrive.   The main character, Lolly, is a gentle creature with a very gentle heart. She is very curious about everything, and always wants to learn something more about a situation. She is an animal lover and a wonderful person to be around, and is loved by everyone.  I loved how we got to know Lolly's family. We found out about Lolly through her owner, who was an older cat and was the only other person Lolly interacted with besides her brother. We found out that she was brought to the shelter when she was a kitten and spent much of her life with a stray cat until they adopted her when she came into their lives. This is not my first animal lover book; I was so inspired by this book that I went through a few of them. I read several more of these over the years and all were wonderful, well-written, and interesting.  This was a good first read. I
Write a positive review about a good book:    What a delight it was! I am a first time reader of a novel, and my review is that it was a delight, even a pleasurable one. If I had to give it a high rating, I would rate it a 5 star, because it is well written.   - I was really pleased with the way the writing flowed. It was clear to me that the author was having a lot of fun, and it was obvious that there is a great deal of thought and effort going into this book, from the way it was written, to the characters' personality, to how it was put together.   and  - This was the first time I have read a book written in the 21st century. The book was clear and concise, and the pace and style were refreshing and fun.  This was also a very good read for children. There were several characters who the author did a great job building up to a certain point, and then leaving them to go off and get themselves into trouble. It reminded me of a great scene from the animated television series, Futurama.     I'm sure there are better books out there that I haven't read. But this was definitely the book for me.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book. I bought it for my daughters because they loved it and they had an uncle who loved the book as well. I would give it five stars for the book it is. The cover is great and the blurb is clear. I don't really read reviews a lot, but this book was awesome. I can't wait to read more. I have a soft spot for books about life, but I also love great literature and I have the utmost respect for the authors. My favorite book has to be "The Good Lord Bird" by Robert Louis Stevenson, which is set in the time when people were still learning to write and read, the story is wonderful. "This book was amazing" my husband said, and I think he is right. Thank you, Michael! You have created a truly great book!!
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________I love the idea that Harry's family is an interesting, multi-cultural mix of all different ethnicities and classes, all with different personalities. The idea that the Muggles don't even really understand their surroundings is a huge deal to me.I didn't really enjoy reading this because it felt like it was a rehash of the other books, and I didn't feel that it was that deep. I guess that's okay because there's a bunch of new stuff to discover here too.  -Karen I really like this one because it gives the Muggle perspective. I did find it a little slow to start, but once I got a good pace going, I liked it a lot. The new spells to learn really add to the magic and the story. I like Harry's relationship with his friends. It's really cool how there's more in this book to be discovered and it really expands on the characters. The story is interesting because it has some Muggle elements, although, not really. Harry is a really smart kid but it also shows a lot of his friends are also really smart, so it makes it hard to know what's what. I think the Mummies are very cool, they're different and you can really understand what they do. It really adds a different kind of fantasy to the books.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is really good! I've learned to make rice the way my family makes it, and we have really enjoyed it! Thank you for making it and sharing it with us.   I've been making rice the "Traditional" way, but this book has really made it interesting and easy. If you've never used a rice cooker you may want to make some mistakes before you get it down. There's a lot of steps to be aware of, but overall I find it a fairly easy process. I just followed the advice in the book and had a wonderful time.   The only thing that I don't care for is that it says not to cook with "hot" water...it's hot in our kitchen, but not hot enough to fully cook rice. (I think my water is at or near boiling...I'm not sure how to determine that but I usually cook rice in boiling water)   If you are not too picky, you could skip the whole step of cooking the rice, then drain and mix with other ingredients, then add to the bowl, which would have saved me a lot more time. The final product would look a little funky.   a friend says:   For those that are not familiar with the traditional way of making rice, it uses a long-handled wooden spatula to stir and fold the rice before stirring in the water. It's a tedious process with a lot to learn. I am happy to have a book that has made this task so easy. I find that you need to boil the water for 5 minutes to get rid of most of the starch in rice. This book is a great resource for beginners because it provides a step-by-step approach and is organized.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* The Good, The Bad and The Ugly *********** If you haven't read The Big Sleep yet, you must. This book has it all. A great character driven story with a great ending. If you enjoy mystery and action this is one of the best books out there. If not read it and get lost in the mind of a true great detective. Great read if you like history. If like action this book is a must read. If for some strange reason you enjoy suspense and action read this book!  - Michael L.  My name is Daniel St. Germain, and I am the author of The Bad, The Useless and The Good: How to Tell Good Stories in Good Times and Bad in Bad Times.    The first thing I want to say is that this book blew my mind. I just finished it in one day, and it's one of those books I can't put down. You should all read this.   In the world of Sherlock Holmes, there is no "good" and "bad" stories. We've all heard the cliched saying that the best stories are those that have a "twist" to them, but that's only half of it. A twist, by definition, takes away something important from the plot. A "twists" that just keep on giving are boring, or "gimmicky." As I was reading the book, I kept thinking to myself, "Is this a "story?" Are there characters in this book?" Because if there are characters, they are fascinating. You'll see why in a minute, but first...   We have Sherlock Holmes. I don't know how many times people refer to Sherlock Holmes as a detective, and that's fair enough, he's a great detective, but he isn't, by far, the best detective, or even the best fictional detective in fiction. In fact, even though he's not the best of the detective fiction authors, he is one great detective: he's smart, witty, quick-witted, capable, and, most importantly, he thinks fast. That's his thing. He thinks on his feet, and when he thinks on the feet, he doesn't wait for the right time to act. He acts immediately, usually in a way that the audience can predict.   this doesn't make him an all-knowing machine, it makes him quick. This isn't to say that he

Write a positive review about a good book:  I recently finished "In the Heart of the Night" by L. Sprague de Camp. I am a huge fan of Steampunk and Steampunk literature in general. I thought this book was soooo good, and I loved the setting. There was so much to enjoy, the writing was good and this book took place in 1869. I would say that it is worth the read, especially if you have enjoyed other Steampunk books, as it is very well written, and the book was very well constructed and detailed. I also really like the idea of the book, which is one that many steampunk books have done well and I think is worth checking out. The book is a bit long, but I think the length would be fine for many. I think this book would be a good read for a younger audience, as well as older children, as I think it can give a little insight into the 1869 period. The setting is very good, it is a Victorian era, so the setting is rich and it is well set up for a story like this, so that I think that this would be an excellent book for an author to choose, especially when they can take a different look at an age and look at it from a different perspective, this book takes a look at the 19th century through the eyes of a woman who is an American slave in Louisiana, I liked the idea that a woman would be able to see the world from a slave's point of view, and that they could see it from the point of a different point of views. The women in this book really showed that this society could be different, even though it is the same society, and it made the book very interesting to read and the characters very well fleshed out and interesting, it was a very good book. Recommendation:   I would recommend this book to people who like Victorian era and Steampunks, and have an interest in Victorian culture and politics.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book had some good advice, but the message was unclear in the end. I don't remember the author's name at all, but this book's advice was pretty much the same as my brother's advice to me about being in a relationship: just be happy.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The World War II in Europe is a must read. It has a good mix of information on the war, and the people involved. The narration is good, and gives you a sense of the horror, and fear, and desperation of WWII.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ This book is a must read for anyone in the area or in the world who wants to learn more about the history of the U.S. Civil War and the Southern rebellion. This is not a retelling of the war, but rather, a chronicle of what happened, where and how. From the Battle of Fredericksburg through to the surrender of General Grant, and everything in between, this is an entertaining account that has been highly researched and documented. The author does not gloss over the more serious aspects of the conflict, such as slavery and how it was intertwined with the war itself, or make light of the horrors the southern states endured. This book has a very well put together feel to it and has a lot of information. From maps to detailed accounts of key battles and key personalities, this book covers a lot and is extremely well written. There is also a book that is a collection of essays on the Civil War as well, and the second is very good, too. The book can be hard to get through at times, but there is a lot to it. It is hard to believe this war is over and I am excited for the new book from the author.
Write a positive review about a good book:   .  Review by: Laura B. on Jan. 03, 2013 :  Great book. I had never read a book on making love in a threesome before and I have since bought several books related to the topic and this was by far the best of the bunch. I think this book covers the key things I wanted to know the most about. I love that she describes the different ways the two of you can have sex, how to keep things fun and enjoyable, and how to handle the different people who enter the scene. I also really liked that she took a few different approaches to giving oral sex, for example she wrote about the technique I use for one of my friends who likes her man to be a little rough and rough and dirty. That sort of thing makes for a lot of fun oral sex for two that I have no problem doing. The fact that there were two women who came with the book is also great, I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in threeways.

After reading this book, I was curious about what to expect from a threa...  The Book I got was a paperback (so I had to use my own book on paper. I'm glad I had the book so I could learn the basics as well as the more advanced stuff) and was published in 2001. It is over 456 pages and is divided into 3 sections, a preface, a glossary and a set of rules for play that were written by Sheff.   The preface is the most important part of the book and is a must read. Sheff explains how to make sure that things go smoothly during the play and that you do everything in your power to make your partner happy (and be a good partner to them!).   To start things off, Sheff writes about what the two partners (he and his friend) are looking for in a 3 or more, and why. For example, both partners want to feel safe and included, both are concerned that they will look silly in bed, both want to get to know each
Write a positive review about a good book: ***********   This book is so well done and so well explained that I did not find much to critique, except maybe that the author should have mentioned that the Book of Abraham and the facsimiles are only 2 of the many Joseph Smith's that were not translated with the Nephite interpreters, but the book of Abraham being in the same hand that Joseph translated the Book.   I was a big fan of the new movie The Book of Mormon, and the Book that came with it, but this book is far superior and far better than the movie. The Book that comes with the movie and the book that came out in 1998 and the one that came in 2008, both the new and the old, are not the same book. The new and old books have been retitled so many times to protect them and hide the original content. Both the new book and the older book contain the same material, and yet each is a different book and a different story. The Old one is far better, as I was reading it and it was really hard to stop reading after the first few pages, and after the movie I can't help but think that the movie did not convey everything accurately in this one. I really had to read the Book to know what the movie was going for, and what was really intended.   "The Book of Joseph is a work of fiction, not history." The Book is about Joseph Smith. It is not a history of him or any other individual. It's not about Mormonism or any religious belief.   this book shows the prophet Joseph Smith as the great man that he was, the first of our prophets, not about his religion, his life or his people. This book is a history about him and his teachings, not of his religion. This is also a story about his people, not his religion."   So why the title of the book "The History of Joseph Smith," and why is it in the third person, as if we are hearing Joseph's story, not just reading about him or his life? Because in the first two books, Joseph is the main character, and in this third book, we have the perspective of Joseph's son, Joseph Jr. So you will see more Joseph's perspective than just Joseph's life, and you'll learn more about Joseph's beliefs than just his life.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book when it was on sale and it was so much fun to read! I love a good mystery. If you are a fan of this type of book (even if you haven't been reading detective novels) then you will enjoy this. The story is a good mix of mystery and romance, but it's not just romance that is involved. I read this book in one sitting and was able to finish it in a couple of days. The mystery is so intricate. There are a lot of different people involved in this book and not just one, which added to the overall mystery. The characters were all so likable and the dialogue is just amazing. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a good story and a good mysteries.  Read it, you won't be disappointed.  I read this one at the library and it wasn't until I went to school in the fall that I started to read more mystery novels. I loved this one so much! It was really good and kept me reading through the hard back of the book. It also added a little something to my book club. I have always loved the sound of the mystery song in the background, and this one was just perfect. My book club had a lot to get to over the summer and I love that I was able enjoy this while we did. I can't wait to read it again next summer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  As long as I remember I have been addicted to reading this series. From the time I was old enough to grasp a book, the first book had that "magic" about it that made it hard to put down. And while I had some doubts about this story after reading the second book and it's first two sequels, it has all the elements to be a classic fantasy epic with plenty of twists. I can't wait to read the next book. -Meredith G. - The City on the Edge of Forever -  A very interesting and very action filled book about a woman who wants to leave behind her bad relationship to go to the other side of the world and become a doctor. It starts out with a few small problems but things really heat up as the journey is about to get real! Highly Recommended! -Jillian L. -  The Dragon Prince - ~~~ A fantastic and imaginative fantasy world with a lot of action and intrigue. A young prince is captured by a evil dragon who keeps him locked up in his fortress and only when he is rescued by a group of adventurers does he finally get to go on the adventure of a lifetime. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good fantasy adventure with dragons, elves and orcs. I have a feeling this story will be around for quite a while. -John K. - In an Epic Tale of Heroic Revenge ~~ The plot starts with a young princess who, at the age of three, was abandoned on the other shore of the globe. For several years she has lived in this beautiful and mysterious land, but it's her love of the forest that has helped her survive, and her strength and courage in the face of the danger that would have killed any child. After several adventures, this young girl finally returns to her home, and to the country that she has been longing for since childhood. Now, in a world where men and women are equal, and where the best way to get on the path to success is by using your fists to fight and to make the world a better place, she sets off on the road to becoming the greatest fighter the world has ever known. But, this is just the beginning. -Hans G. –  The Red Dragon ~~ After reading about this book I thought "this is just a little bit too easy and it should be a lot harder". But that was the point. It's a great book. It has a lot going on but is easily accessible

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________ This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in a thorough and rational analysis of the nature and causes of terrorism. It offers a comprehensive view of the causes of the terrorism of the 1960s, 70s, and even 80s, in addition to the ideological, psychological and economic causes. I wish it were available to me when I started researching this. The author lays out his reasons and points out the mistakes of others. I have yet to find any book or journal article that does this. It is an invaluable book. It will not only answer many of your questions about terrorism, but will help you understand what terrorist acts are really about and how to prevent terrorism. I highly recommend this book."  "This book is extremely valuable. I learned much from this book and I will use many of the information contained in it for my own work.

It's easy to read and it's very entertaining, and it keeps you interested even as the mysteries continue to unfold and the characters change. ___________________________________________________ I have to say, the best part of this book was the ending. My favorite part of a mystery/thriller is the "twist", and the last thing they show you is that the book's main characters will meet a very tragic ending. But in this book, it was just a surprise, and yet it ended the book on a good note. ______________ The author is a great writer, I read all his books in a row, and his latest novel is just as good as his others.    My review: ________________________________________   My wife and I got married in the spring of 2015. When she mentioned to me that we wanted a wedding gift to reflect that we were moving in together, I had no idea what to choose.  We already had a great house that we planned to make our home (my home is now my office for a big part of the year). My wife asked me to send her some things that would give us a little bit of a change of scenery.  My first thought was a painting. So I searched online for "cabinet" pictures and discovered this gorgeous little painting. It was gorgeous. I was just as impressed with it as she was.  What my wife had mentioned was that she wanted a little piece of a country I had visited only once or twice before. So when she asked me if I could make her a "gift" of one of my photos, I immediately said yes.  I was happy to find that there is a very small print store near my apartment that stocks some of the pictures I have taken over the years.  To save us both money, I bought the pictures and some other stuff that she asked for from that store.  I was so happy to have made that gift that when I saw it, I took a little "picture" out of my camera to give to her.  Then I showed it to her and she said "you made me a picture!"    When she showed it back to me, I told her that my "picture", had been "a piece" of a painting by one of the best artists in the world.  Since we were married about a

Write a positive review about a good book:    The Good:   1. It is hard for a fantasy author to write a novel that is realistic, but I think that the author succeeds in this respect.   2. This novel tells an interesting story. I loved it.  .   (review taken from a copy on amazon.com)   I really enjoyed the story of Risque and the various adventures he has while he is a member of the Royal Navy. While it is possible to write such a novel, it is certainly a challenging task. The story itself is the reason why I wanted to read this novel; I liked the story very much. I liked how the author incorporated such an interesting part of history, and how the plot, and characters are developed in the book. The main characters are interesting, they have an interesting past and I liked their personalities. The way the author wrote the book, I can imagine that this novel is just an adventure. I enjoyed the way the characters talk and react to each other, and the way I am able to understand their point of view as they live their lives.The Good:- It is difficult to write the kind of story that is believable. But the author did it. He managed to write about something that is not common to our everyday life. It was a refreshing experience.The Bad:- It might be a little difficult to read the book if you are not familiar with naval history.- Although this is an enjoyable book, there are some minor things that could be better, such as some parts, where the author does not write exactly in the present tense, and some parts where there is repetition, but this can be overlooked.- The story is just too short for me to be satisfied. I guess the author intended the book to be about 150 pages long, but it was short enough to be satisfying, but not long enough to make it a must-read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I can't even begin to explain how much I enjoy this book.  This is the kind of book where you don't finish it and you still want more.  One of my favorite aspects of the book is how we are introduced to all of the different ways to look at the nature of the universe: The way we look at it, the way we live it, and the way it really is.    In the last chapter,  The Big Picture, we learn that the way you look at everything, every single thing you think about, every thing you do is an interpretation of something that is a combination of other things, some of which you see through the eyes of others, some through the eye of a bird, or a flower, and some through that of an ant, or some other creature or object.  This is the reason that all of us are here at all.  We are the product of a complex interplay of chance and design and evolution.  But if you can accept this, then you understand that it does not matter what you do to your own life, you are bound to make the same mistakes that you have made throughout history because we are just this complex and wonderful thing, we are not perfect but we are our own best version of a perfect creation.  There is nothing wrong with this except that we do need to realize that all that we are is just the result of a chain of accidents, but by that same reasoning we can also accept that we have the capacity to do good or be good.   The Big Questions is the best book I've read for people who just want to understand where they come from, and why they are here.   I recommend this book to anyone who is not religious, who has no preconceived notions, and for anyone who wants to understand why this world is the way that it is.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like this book because it really hits the nail on the head in a lot of ways. It is a really well-written book about the issues that women face every day, not just in the work place.

This book makes it seem simple, as it was the first book I've ever read on a similar topic.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ It was very interesting to read this book, as it was a great read, even though my English is not the best, I managed to understand the main points.  I was happy to read the story about a woman who was born in Iran, but grew up in America, with a husband and two daughters. She was forced to live in a house with many women, which her husband is against. "I was scared of this. If I had stayed in Iran my life would have been different."  "It is the worst thing in the world to be a woman in a man's country. He always treats us like a second class citizen. We are treated badly and the women are abused and abused, the women in the house are the worst. If one of them is having a bad day they just want to beat you up. The wife is always the same, she just wants to be the big sister to you."  is how the women of the house were in the story.  bewitching  A woman was forced into a life of prostitution, because she is not a good woman because she doesn't obey the orders of her husbands and he had been controlling her for a long time. It is a very sad story, and one that I cannot believe that such a story happened in my world. But it happened in this book.   I really liked the author, who wrote in an easy to understand way, so that everyone could understand the subject. She even told it with her own feelings about the topic. Her writing is like a beautiful poetry, which was a nice change from the many other books that I have read about the same topic.

The book was published by the LDS Church in 1981 and has been an essential part of LDS missionary discussions ever since.   the book "As I was reading this book for the first time, I was struck by how little we understand of the early history of the American frontier. The idea that a single man, Joseph Smith, came across the continent alone to discover a new world of Christianity and a new America in which to build a kingdom seems so fantastic that it would be hard to imagine a historical reality that more completely defies belief." --Richard Bushman, Book of Mormons.   a book with a history   An excellent read about  a fascinating history of religion   The history of religious ideas and practices, from ancient times to the present day, from Christianity to Islam, Hinduism to Buddhism, is told from several perspectives: religious leaders, thinkers, theologians, scholars, authors, critics and seekers.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "If you are like me, then you have probably been waiting to hear about this book, but you are always busy with life and have no time to read more than a few pages. Well, now you can read it at your leisure and I'm glad I did. There are a lot of cool things about the book, and for sure it's interesting to read the book and find out some things about some of the people in the book. It's really interesting to know a little bit more about the history of the place and that is how I found out a lot about the story." Review:  This was written by a fellow I'm quite close with, and I wanted to pass it onto him as it's something he would have liked to know. I just think it's cool how the author is able to write about something that is not really an aspect of the show itself, which is really cool.  It makes it a really interesting read.  It would be awesome to hear what the "real" stories are behind the things that have been seen on Star Trek. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a little bit of a passion for reading books, and my favorite is a hardcover with the leather cover. However, it wasn't until the day I got my Kindle, that I realized the amount of time I could save by buying a digital edition (from Amazon). I have read this book many times, but was afraid to buy it on the Kindle because I am a complete newcomer to Kindle, but now I am loving it. This is an excellent book that should be on the must-read list for any self-respecting avid reader. It is a very simple book that could be a great intro to reading if people just read it for the story. I have to say that the book is short and easy to read. I did not get any of the technical details that would be explained by the book. My only gripe is that some of the quotes are somewhat dated, but that does not spoil the story (it is a bit dated in this book's timeline, but the book still makes a good read). I also don't believe that there are any inaccuracies with the quotes, which makes the book very easy to understand.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________________________________I recently picked up this book. I'm a huge fan of Stephen King, and the character of Jacob Black is one of my favorites in the whole of King's work. I thought it was a good idea to read the story first, and then take it in the direction I felt it should go. I enjoyed it very much.The book is a very good story, very well-told. The story is told in first person. There are a couple of minor characters who aren't introduced in first-person but are introduced by name in third person. I liked this. I also found the first person to be a good form of telling the story. One can tell a story more easily with a first person narrative. I found this to be true of the book as a whole. It was a very interesting and very well written story. I was also impressed with how King handled his time traveling elements. In the first book, King traveled to several different times in order to try and rescue Jacob Black. In this book, he does the opposite. Instead of traveling to the past, he takes his time to learn the story behind the Black's story. He spends a significant amount of time learning about his family. He takes in his mother's voice. He has conversations with his father. He learns what his grandfather is really like. His grandparents aren't just heroes, they are also the reason he was able to learn to write so well. He also learns a lot about himself.In the end, this book made me think. It made me realize that this is one book that I won't be able to put down.

Write a positive review about a good book: ************* I enjoyed this book a great deal. I felt it was a good entry into what happens when a young woman, who doesn't know much about the supernatural, travels to the far-flung, distant, dark side of the country to visit her Aunt, an old spirit medium. I enjoyed the idea of finding out what goes on out there and seeing how it makes people behave in ways they're not used to. I liked that this book had a good deal of real world elements as well as things that the characters did that didn't quite happen in the novel, so there was a little mystery element as well. I appreciated the fact that it was told from the point of view of a young girl and how she felt about that. I also liked that the book didn't feel like a fairy tale, but more a normal "how people act in unusual circumstances" story. There were plenty of surprises and things that happened that I wasn't expecting. I didn't like that the last part was sort of the same as the beginning. I thought the book was okay at best, but if you like the idea but don't necessarily like the actual story, it might be worth a read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This was an excellent book, as it is, and well-written. One thing I wish I had included is some general information about the book--how to make a "good" book, and what some of the major issues were with it. One could not understand that this was not just "a bad book" without reading the reviews.  The general concept and general writing are excellent, but there are a few things that were problematic.  What is a good review?   A good review is not necessarily a negative review (although it is).   I've already written about some of these, so it should be apparent that I don't mean a review from a person who dislikes the author.    I mean a positive and informative review.   My positive review of the book was:  If you like short stories, or any sort of stories, this book is for you.  There are no 'plot holes' or things that need explaining.  And the overall plot is pretty well constructed.  It's a pretty good story.  The only criticism I have is that there were some parts that could have been handled better.  I am not sure how the author could have made the ending feel like a satisfying conclusion, but this isn't a 'conclusion' book so it doesn't really have to be.  For the most part the author did a fine job with the plot, the world, and the characters.  However, there are some things in this story that didn't make sense at times (and even when they made sense it didn't feel like it was really a happy ending).  There were also some points where it just seemed like the story was moving too fast, and it seemed like there were more plot holes than there were holes in this book.      I thought this book was a good read, it was a little short but the plot was quite good.  If you like sci-fi/fantasy, or short stories you will probably like this book as well.  Overall a good story that is a bit short on details.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been wanting to read this book for a while. Now that I have finally finished it I can't wait to see what happens. I think the story was well written and told well. The ending was very well done.   The characters:   My two favorite characters from the book were Lill and Tom. Tom was kind of annoying at first but he became one of my favorite characters. His personality was so unique and it made me like him so much. Lill is very interesting. She was the one who helped me get through the story and she became my favorite character. Her relationship with the other character was interesting as well. She is very intelligent and well versed in the world around her. She's not your typical person.  .  's:     The story is told from Lill's point of view but she is the main character in the end. She has no back story or anything but it wasn't so bad. It helped me understand the story. I loved that she wasn't the main person in the story, she was just one part. The other characters were nice to read about but not very interesting to read.   The book was short but it had a lot of stories. I recommend this book and I would definitely read more books by the author. The author was really good at writing and the story is great.  - May 23, 2016The story: I loved the characters. - April 23, 2017I loved the plot.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I got a copy of The Good Book for Christmas. It is one of those books that I know I will read every time I read it. It has a wonderful cover and a very attractive page design. It reads very well and the writing is really good. It's got real character. It doesn't have the feel of a children's book. It reminds me of the type of books I would give to children to read. I would also recommend this book to people who don't like books that have happy endings or have lots of happy endings. The Good book also has a very happy ending and I will be reading this again and again."   2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was recommended to Read This by a friend who gave me a copy to review. I really enjoyed it! The storyline is well executed, and the characters are well written. I will definitely be reading more. My wife and I are still working through the books we purchased from Lulu. While some of the books are very good, a few are just not for us, in no small part because they're too long. We are looking to finish the series in a couple of months, but some of these are taking forever.  Posted by Robert J. Sawyer at 8:49 PM
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------- I like this book a lot. It's good for people like me who have never made their own books in school or college. It takes some time and effort, but it's well worth it. It was great to learn the basics of a book design. I have read many books about book design in the past, but none of them were written by people who actually make their own book designs. This book really teaches the basics and I'm already looking forward to writing my own books.  From what I've gathered, you have some knowledge and skills for drawing and book design, but no real experience. And you have no idea what book design entails - how it works, what parts of the process are the most important, etc.   So, first, take a look at the book's layout:  1. The cover is a page image of a person, a drawing with no borders and a textured white surface (maybe a texture on a photo).  2. Each chapter is a chapter image, but the page is not a black and white photo, but a black background and a white textured surface.  a. The book is designed to be a one page book with the page images arranged as you are reading, one chapter per page.  of course, you can go back to the chapters later or skip the chapters you have not read. b. This arrangement makes the page image easier to read, and the textured page surface makes the image look a lot better.  the whole arrangement looks like it belongs on a brochure, a pamphlet, a flyer, etc., which are all book types that are common in the United States.   with this in mind, I recommend using the layout for your first design job, but not for your design jobs to follow. If your design is not about a brochures, pamphlets, flyers or other book type, you should use the book layout to help you learn about it. , the front of the book cover and the main content page are the pages that will be printed. I think it's fair to say that most people will not be able to read the book text without opening it up and looking at it, or at least without reading it cover to cover. I know this is something that a lot of designers have not been taught yet, or maybe not ever will be taught. I learned a long time ago that the layout of the first chapter of the text in a book will usually

Write a positive review about a good book:.............................. I am an avid reader. The only problem I have is that I can't figure out how to read to sleep. I don't want to waste my time on a book that I won't read. That was why I bought this one. It's so simple, easy to understand and it's all about the story. I love it so much.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- In this review I go over my overall impression on the book as I've read it. This is my third read by Michael J. Sullivan and I must say I've found him to be a very consistent writer. I've noticed that he keeps things in perspective with humor and sometimes even humor from time to time, which makes him a very entertaining writer. The most humorous book in his collection so far (well maybe just his previous one was) is "Love and Laughter In The Dark", which is a humorous yet tragic tale of a man who had to kill his wife because she didn't love him anymore. The book starts out with a happy happy ending and ends with a dark sad ending. So yes, I could see some readers getting depressed or maybe feeling some anger at this ending but overall it still a very happy ending. If you want something a bit more serious I would recommend "Death is No Excuse" by Jeffrey A. Kornfeld. It starts out a bit depressing but it goes on to show a man that did some very strange things and his family, friends and other loved ones were all there for him. I would probably not be so impressed with this book had I not read my copy of the previous one. I don't know why I chose this book but it really was a pleasant surprise.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only complaint I have is that there is little to no actual discussion on the topic of how to make money in your own business.  I did not read all the way through but from the description of a previous book by this same author it sounds as though this book does not address that issue.     Overall:   This is one of those books that I'll pick up and read again.  This will be in my "Go To" bookshelf for a very long time.

This book inspired me to start writing short stories, which I am now doing.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- The first of a trio of books I was glad to have. The second and third books are about the life of the author's aunt and uncle in the 1920's in the South. The author is good, but I did find some of her descriptions to be unrealistic or out of date. That said, I didn't mind and felt the stories were well-written. And the characters all had their strengths and weaknesses. (I mean, in a country where the color line was so rigid that they often didn't even have names, why should the character's race be an exception?) In any event, these are good books and I look forward to reading them again.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________  The book was a good read and I think the author did a good job of presenting the data, although I think some of the numbers may need some further discussion. I'm looking forward to the sequel!  Review written: July 1, 2011  Tags: science  Rating:   by David   "The only thing that can kill a great book is if it's written badly." —Stephen King  ______________________________  So in my mind the main issue with this book is the length and that I have no patience for a story like this and I could go on for pages about what an unnecessary length it is and how much of a chore it is to actually read it (which is why I have chosen not to write a review). The other issue I have with this is the fact that it seems that the author had a great time writing this story.  And I agree with him that I can't wait to read the sequel. I was hoping it would be one of those books I'd have to re-read because they were so compelling. It's hard to imagine this story being anything but engrossing and the way that this plot was written and presented was excellent, especially with the way they handled the characters. , an amazing writer in my opinion, did an incredible job of turning my stomach. I actually had to pause the story on a couple of occasions because I started to get nauseous. I can only assume that is because I have been spoiled by books such asand my body was feeling some serious stress. I also had to stop reading for a time because the story was getting so bad that I couldn't take it anymore. However, I had to read on anyway and I will say this book has a lot of promise but it needs a lot more work.I have a couple issues with this. One, I am going to have to go back and re-review the book because the first two thirds of this book were so good and I had no reason to read further. It was just too good to leave out. Two, the character of Dr. Pfeiffer was just not believable. She was so completely crazy and insane that it was hard for me to believe that she was in fact sane. She's not. She is an utter narcissist.And my number one problem with this story was that the ending was not what I expected. I guess I was expecting it to be a surprise. It

Write a positive review about a good book:  " This book, The Way We Get Together, by the philosopher Edward Lazear, has a remarkable message: we shouldn't try to figure out how to get along with others (except, perhaps, to learn a new language). We should try to understand each other as individuals, and make the best decisions we can out of that understanding." "This book, by the philosophers Edward J. Lazear and Peter W. Singer, has an extraordinary message: We shouldn't attempt to figure how to 'get along' with others, but should instead try to know each other. This book is not a work of psychology or sociology, and it is not about personal relationships. Rather it is a thought-provoking, even startling, call to our humanity. As such it deserves an entire book on its own, but the key point that I take away is the realization that we don't have to be on friendly terms with each other to be able to live together as a group. Instead we should be able and willing to work together on solving problems."

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ Book of the Dead, by Richard Matheson, is a dark fantasy, in which the world of magic and dark fantasy is a harsh and unforgiving one, where everything is not what it appears to be, and those who dare to enter the forbidden realms of the dead are doomed to a hell of their own creation. Mathesons book is about two children, Alana, and Adlai, whose lives are irrevocably changed by entering the realm of the undead. We never know why Alana leaves her home and family, and her relationship with her father, in the first place. Adlaid and Alana are brought together by an act of selfless bravery. While in a realm called the Dead World, there is no difference between the living and the dead, so the two children decide to join in the "souls-game". They both enter, each into the realm, but in different bodies. This results in a clash between two young souls, where both are forced to make a sacrifice and leave their bodies behind. One of the main themes of this book is the power of the human spirit and the importance of sacrifice. While I think this book suffers from the heavy-handed, too-harsh "dark fantasy" tag, the characters are all memorable, the world is believable, and the action is exciting. In conclusion, Mathes's book is a good, fast read with a very good and memorable storyline. Recommended!  27 of 30 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is an excellent summary of a very interesting phenomenon. The best part is that it shows how such phenomena can be studied by scientific principles and mathematics, which have been discovered by the scientists, the mathematicians and their discoveries have become "scientific facts" for us.   So, I give this book 5 stars because:   1. The book is written by a biologist who was trained as a math teacher in high school and college.   a) His technical language is excellent, he uses the right words for his scientific and mathematical subjects,  b) His math equations and descriptions are simple to understand.  , 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A really good story about the war in the Pacific is very different than a great book about a great war like I have read. I had just got the book a few months ago, and was very impressed with it. It was a lot of fun to read. There were a few things that didn't sit well with me, but the author took it all in stride. It is not a story I will buy again, but I am willing to pick it up and re-read it once I have a moment to get it out of my system. "The Pacific" by Christopher Barnes:  I love a good epic, or even better, one that follows a few main characters who try to do the right thing in difficult circumstances. This story does that and more. The Pacific is, by far, my favorite of the series. There are some excellent side characters in this one as well. It's a wonderful story, and I am glad I finally finished it. 4/5 stars "Wicked Island" by Jeff Noon:  My second favorite from the series and one of my favorite books of all time, and a very satisfying conclusion. It will be hard for me to choose a favorite from this series, because all are great and the ending is one I will keep in mind when I re-start it with some new characters.  "What We Become" by L.J. Smith:  The most exciting, challenging and downright fun book of the whole series. It doesn't always follow the expected path. The characters are constantly trying to do things that they know they should not do and trying to find their own ways to get out of situations they shouldn't. It all makes the story a lot more interesting and dynamic. It has some good, tough love moments, and ends in an incredibly satisfying way. I love the book and the series, and this is another one I plan on re-reading in the future. 5/5 stars "Battle of the Black Pearl" by Michael Swanwick:  It's not a sequel, and the entire series is really more like a series of connected standalone books with very little overlap. This was one of the few books I had to re-Read multiple times to understand the main plot. This book is just a great fun romp full of action and adventure and plenty of humor. The main character is very well done and I love how she is a woman in a man's world in the

It is an interesting read with a twist.   on the topic of the "true story", I don't know about the plot, but the author's comments were interesting.   The author said: The first time I read this I did not believe that there could be any truth in it. This book is certainly true, but it is also fiction. What do you think? It is very possible that the man is a fraud and that he is just taking on other people's identities for money. This is what I believed and what most of the readers believe. But after a while, I believe there are more truths to this story, and this book just confirms it.  , if you have a strong belief in conspiracy theories (which I have), I strongly recommend this book. I don`t think it is a book about aliens, but I have not heard the term "aliens" in the book.   the last part of the book has the author talking about how they believe their life is only temporary. It`s quite an interesting thing to read about.

I have read other reviews saying the story got better as the book progressed. This is not my experience. The story was good but not amazing and the character interactions were great. However the last 1/3 of the book felt rushed and not the right place for this to go. It seemed like a story they had planned, with a nice beginning and middle, but not all that compelling. As the book reached the end and the characters were introduced and everything was moving forward I was frustrated. I thought it would be better served to wrap it up sooner.

I'd recommend it. I also really want the print version. Thank you. -- L.I.C.I I have no idea why my first thought was "I've wanted this book for years," but I have. (It's a book I got when I was 12 and my father sent it to me to review for a school paper) I have to wonder how long the publishers kept this book out of print. It is an excellent book and a very worthwhile read. The only thing that kept me from recommending this book to my friends is the fact that I have just finished reading a second book in the same series, but I still don't want to call the book a "mistake." The writing is excellent and the stories are well written, but the story of the two books can be easily confusing for the uninitiated.  A must read for young adult fans of Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, and a great gift for anyone.

Write a positive review about a good book:............................... The only criticism I would have is that the chapter is split up into two parts. As such the chapters are a bit confusing at first. I thought I was getting two separate stories at first, but after some thought I realize it's just the main character, who's at her wits end trying to solve an old murder case she was involved in while being pursued by the same killers. I really loved this one as I really liked the characters in the story. It really made me think outside the box. I also liked the way she kept it mysterious at the same time. It's always a bonus to have some mystery and the suspense of trying to find out what will happen to you in the next few chapters. Read the next book by this author in my list The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret. (I bought this in July 2013)

Write a positive review about a good book:   "This is the best book on business ever written, by a business guru of the highest caliber. Mr. Benjamin writes so well and with so much humor. It is a delight to read. I bought this book because I wanted to be a successful business man like him. His ideas have helped me become a far more confident, productive and financially savvy man than I would have been if I had only read the first 2 business books on the market, each of which was written by an other than Mr.Benjamin, and the third of which in no way inspired his genius. But Mr.Bennett has been a mentor to me since we first met. Mr Bennett is not some one that is merely a good speaker, or a good writer. He is the real deal and I am grateful for what he has taught me. And you will not be disappointed with what you read here. "  - Steve M., Virginia "I've always liked the way Mr. Bennett has sold his message of personal transformation. He's not just a guru with some good ideas. He has the skills to get you where you want to go."  -- Bruce J. (from a 5 Star review on Amazon) "I was reading about this book, and it is something to read about. The book is not written in an eloquent manner but it shows the passion in his heart that has been in him from the beginning. I'm not sure how this book is made, because his first book was also self published, and I believe this is a first for any business leader. You should not just read about a great guy with great ideas, but you should read the guy's personal life and background to understand what it is about him that has allowed him to take this deep of passion, and make it a business plan. I can easily understand him having this in him, because he does everything in his life that makes him feel that way. He works hard, does everything, and gets the most of this life for his family and friends. He lives and works with integrity. I believe if he would just keep his eyes on what he is doing, then he will be successful and the world will benefit from his hard work."  the book is an inspiration, for me personally and also for my family and many friends. Mr Benjamin has given us a great life story. He did everything that he set out to do.  A great book on the "how" and "why"
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I just finished The Girl on the Train by Roald Dahl. I'm an avid reader and had no idea that this book would be such a deep and emotional read. While it was somewhat dry at times, it felt true to Roald's characters and felt like a book that he could have read many years ago. I enjoyed it immensely and will definitely buy it for future reference. The ending felt quite final and it was such a good cliffhanger. It was the perfect ending to a book I really liked and I'm sure you will too. I can't wait for the next one!" "The end of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo seemed to me like the final moment of the book as it closed on the story of Rebus. I like the ending and the idea that the author wants to close the book and have the reader finish it. That's great as I am planning on reading the first volume." "So what a wonderful ending to my reading of The Boy in the Fireplace! My only other complaint is that I think it was rushed to an end and that the ending was rushed but this is the only thing I am unhappy about. That and I felt as if I had missed a lot. I was hoping for something bigger and more exciting in this book but I thought that The Boy would be the better ending for this book because it was not as depressing." See more at:  "This one is a lot like the end of A Night at the Opera. The end was pretty much all that I wanted from the story, which is why I only gave it 3 stars. The other two were more disappointing and I was really hoping for more. But you really can't be disappointed with the ending you get in The Boy."

I'm glad it's available at a reasonable price!  BRIAN L. FISCHER - St. Paul's Lutheran Church - Milwaukee, WI - February 6, 2008 - 2:54pm  I am just finishing reading the book. I just finished reading the other reviews. I have been a Christian since I was 8 years old. My wife and I go back and forth from believing in God and Jesus Christ and I have always been a staunch follower of the church. I had heard this book was a lot like the bible but it was quite different in my opinion.  on the other hand, this book is very entertaining and funny. I was so excited when I first heard about this book because of all the great reviews. The book has so much to offer for all Christians and especially for the non-Christians. I am a lifelong Christian and this book will hopefully prove to be an interest to me. I do plan on reading it over a couple days. ,  - John S. McConaha, Jr. .    Great Bible for those wanting to be challenged and not to feel bad that they don't understand everything.  of course I've read the old Bible with its "soul-binding" and "uncleanness" parts, and I know that's not what the book is about. But, it's still a great book. You may not get it completely right first time, but that's ok. If you put your faith in God's Word, He will show you the way.   ,
Write a positive review about a good book:  This was one of those books that I was hoping would be a real life book. That's what I had hoped it would be, and I think it is that.  The concept of this book was interesting and I enjoyed reading it.  I don't know what happened to the author or how many times she has written this book, but this is my favorite of her books.  If you like science fiction you can't go wrong with this book!  It's a fun book and I really enjoyed reading.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A good, old fashioned, good book. A book I haven't read:    I don't like it. If you have read this far:    You have my respect, and the appreciation that comes from making your book search as difficult as possible. If you are interested in making your own book search harder, please read on. I have been writing fiction since before I could read. My dad used to say, when I was young, "you will write a book by the time you're a woman". I have wanted to write since then, and finally did. I was determined to give writing a try, and I have not looked back since. I did a bit of college in my spare time, but I never really tried to get a job as a writer. So I have been a writer all my life, and so far have written two books. I have a few stories in mind, and would love to write a third. I wrote this book, and this is my experience. Book 1:  My First Book After about two years of making my own search, I got a book recommendation in a friend's blog. I started looking and found that it was written by a woman, which is perfect. That book is a woman's book, but it also has a man's point of view. I like women's point-of-view books because I don't have to hear how smart men think of women. This book was very helpful to me. It helps me get into writing by talking about what I was trying to do. It gives me a lot of advice and examples about what works in a novel. I enjoyed it because it gave me a sense of what I should write, how I should plot, etc. Some of the advice was old fashioned and some of it was new-fangled. Some of it is a bit difficult to follow in an ebook, but that's not the point. The point is that I was getting some help from a very experienced person who knows what he is talking about. I would recommend this to anybody looking to get into the writing business. BOOK 2:  The First Novel After another couple of years of searching, I found another recommendation for a book I should buy. This one was written for women, but also had a man in it. It was written from the point of a woman who wants to write. I bought the first book and loved it
Write a positive review about a good book:  When I read that this book was written by a child of the 80s I immediately thought that the author had been a kid in the 80's too, especially when the narrator was born in 1980!  This story is told in such a vivid way, with such a realistic portrayal of childhood that it was hard to put down.  It's just a great story about a kid who doesn't know what she wants, and how she learns to accept that and move on, and grow up!  I loved the way that this story was told, and the way it is described so beautifully.  When I saw that the book was about a little girl whose father was a writer and a photographer, I thought that would be the first book that I would recommend to a friend or a neighbor.   It wasn't, however, and I hope that you'll read it!

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Gourmet Cookbook by Diana Nyad. I can only recommend the book. It is the perfect balance of culinary knowledge, practical recipes, and inspiring stories. If you want to know what makes a meal a gourmet meal, this book will give you the answer. Review by Marie What a great book. This is a great reference on what is important when trying to cook gourmet meals. My favorite recipe is the gourmet pizza dough recipe. I think the best part is the photography of how the recipes were made. I have always wanted to learn how to cook from the greats and this book is amazing. I would also like to see some gourmet foods on the market so everyone can try them out. This book is for all of us to enjoy as we become more and more creative in the kitchen. I will continue to refer to this book as the best gourmet cookbook available.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________________________________________ This is a very, very interesting book. It provides a very thorough explanation of the theory, history, and practicality of "biochar," and also details the methods for making it. In particular, it contains a good discussion of the methods and technologies for using biochar as a fertilizer. Although I am still learning, the details of these methods are interesting and the presentation is thorough. It is a little bit more theoretical than I expected, so I recommend it to anyone who is interested. For those who already know a lot about biochar, there is a good primer on making it available here.

Write a positive review about a good book: *******************   This is a book which will not only change the way you look at the world, but will also change the world and its inhabitants.   If you are on the fence about reading this book, do it now. It's not for the faint of heart. I have read some very disturbing and disturbing stories in my life and reading this is going to have a lot of those same thoughts running through your head. If you are a mother or you have children, or if you have a boyfriend and a girlfriend, it might give you nightmares. It is not easy to read this book but you are going to see things you never thought you would see, you will find out truths you never knew.  .   is there anything that could stop me from reading the rest of the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is fantastic. It will open your eyes to the truth that your life will be less than perfect and that you will make mistakes but you are capable of making up for them. It is easy to relate to this book, as it is a true story of a real person who went from an average looking girl to a beautiful, popular girl and one of the best friends in my life.  For this review, I will focus on the good parts of this book. It's so amazing to hear someone who's not a social media addict talk about how this works and how you can build something really big, like you're doing right now.  Here's the good stuff:  1. You don't have to be a social animal to be successful in this. You just need to have good social skills to get results. I was struggling in high school and went through some social anxiety which made it extremely difficult to start my own social media sites but I'm so glad I did. It gave me a chance to finally get in touch with my emotions and just enjoy life. And it helped me be a better person. 2. The best part is that you don't need a ton of friends to build your site. It can be done on a side business and it will still work. I got a lot of compliments from other girls that I had met through my site. 3. If you want to be happy, go for it!  4. You can start anywhere. You will find other girls to hang out with on your own. Your own personal space is not that big of a deal and if you want privacy for yourself and for your friends then by all means go ahead. 5. If your only goal in life is to create a social network then it's working and it's not about looking pretty or being popular, it's about being yourself and sharing your life with others. 6. You are NOT perfect. There are a lot more things that you can improve on and get better at, but it is very important to learn from your mistakes. And you can only learn about things if you do them yourself. 7. I am not saying this book can make you look like a social butterfly. But it can definitely help you. It has helped me realize that I can do whatever I want with my life and that I am only as good as my mistakes. 8. The only real downfall of the book is that it has a lot to do with money and
Write a positive review about a good book:  As good as it gets...I was lucky enough to hear that the book is being turned into a tv show and it made me smile.  And it wasn't long before I got a phone call from the producer of the show that they were casting an actor to play the role.    They asked if I would mind being the "lead" for the part in the book...my first thought was "Who?".   That's my boy!!   But then I figured I might as well go all in, I mean you can always play second fiddle at some point.  I am so grateful for this book.  It's my favorite.  The book is full of humor, well written, and I think I enjoyed the book much more than the tv show.  And then again I am a skeptic and sometimes you can't win them all.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The World According to Boys by John Cleese This is not a book I would have recommended for my teenage son as a bedtime reading because I felt there was a lot of gender stereotyping. However, this book is so good I would do it again just for a laugh! The writing is very amusing as Cleese and his staff make the best of the situation they find themselves in: It's the middle of the summer, and I've brought home a boy in a man's body... The World According To Boys  is not a good reading for children, but it's a fun read for anyone who is interested in gender politics, humor, and what it is to be a human being. I love this book. What made it even better was that the people in the story are not the people who create the problems but rather the people of this world who are trying to solve the problems they find. If you think that this book contains an overly sexual story, then it is not the book you are looking for. This book has so many other things in it that would be too adult for most of the people reading it. I loved that it was also a great book for a mother to read to her child to learn about a world that is a little more advanced than they are in and still has some serious issues. This would be a great gift for mothers, fathers, and children. What I liked:  There were many of the things I like about this book, but I will just focus on one. The characters were so well done. As Cleese writes in the first paragraph, the characters were "tough, smart and interesting". You can really see what he means in every sentence of every character. This was definitely an adult book for adults, but the characters still had their innocence about them. If they were going to be an adult, I would probably have to call them an adult at some point. The humor was really good and I like how it was in a little bit of every paragraph. I liked how the characters reacted to what was being said. If this book did it's job and made the reader laugh a little, then I thought the humor was good. I also thought it was a great way to learn a little about the world that the characters inhabit. One of the main characters had so many of my favorite moments in the book. I always love a good underdog story. Cleese brings a likable, smart, and
Write a positive review about a good book:  "My brother read this on a class trip to France in 2002, as it was one of the only works on the theme of a group of teenage girls' friendships in the early 1970s. It was fantastic - the narrator's ability to convey her characters' internal lives through the use of both narration and visual detail in this book is absolutely masterful, as the reader also follows the relationships among the characters. I've not heard anyone else discuss the author's use of narrative and visual representation, and it was also interesting that the author writes about her own personal life in the book - it really did make me appreciate her more." Read an unread review : "I just finished this. A very well-written book, beautifully constructed. The book tells of the author and her friends' lives, and their friendships. It does take a little time to get used to the characters, but once you have read the first couple of pages, you will not want to stop reading this book.  The author manages to make every character as unique as she can. The narrator's voice, for instance, is very different from every other narrator's that I've heard before. This is a perfect book for any fan of books or people who like reading about people's lives. I think you will love it! " Read a good review on Goodreads : "A delightful book about teenage friendships with lots of colour and personality. The narration and the writing style make this a novel to savour." Read an excellent review on a blog dedicated to books about friendships : "This book is a great one. This book makes you look at relationships as much as books make books look at friendships and the difference between them. It is about the friendship between young girls and the difficulties and successes and misfortunes they face. It's a wonderful book and very entertaining. It'll make you think about friendships in all their complicated and beautiful forms. "

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------- This book is an excellent primer on the historical development of the modern Republican Party and the modern conservative movement. My only gripe is that it didn't cover the more recent GOP establishment, such as the Bushes and Rumsfeld. And it certainly didn't discuss the current GOP leadership, since there is still a great deal of continuity in the party from Bush to McCain. If you're interested in a thorough and readable exploration of the GOP's rise, read this book. - Ron Wyden (R-Ore.) -------------- If the American people were permitted to read the whole manuscript, I am convinced they would be appalled at the lies, half-truths, and deceptions contained therein. In other words, the book is a fraud, and is nothing but a partisan attack on the Republican Party, as I have demonstrated throughout this website. In the event that the American peoples are allowed to read and study this document, and to vote accordingly, I do not know that they will convict me of being an anti-Republican, but I know they will acquit me as an anti-"liberal" -------------- I wish to thank you for publishing this book on the subject of the Republican political party. It provides a thorough analysis of the issues involved with the modern Democratic Party, particularly the Bush administration, and also provides a great many facts about the history of the party itself. Although it is a very good analysis of what went wrong with the Republican party under the leadership of the Bush family, the author also makes several very valid points about what went right with the Democrat party under Bill Clinton, and what went so right with George Bush's administration. I agree with most of what you have said about the Democrat Party and its leadership, but am surprised at your observations concerning the Republican side. It is true that the Bush/Cheney party was far less successful than the Democrat-controlled Republican party was under Clinton. That said, I believe that the Democratic Party has not really changed since the Clinton administration. The Democrats are still beholden to the big corporate interests, which are represented by the corporate media and by the DNC. They are still willing to compromise their principles for power and money, and I don't see them any different than the Republicans in that respect. The one positive thing the Democratic party has done is to change the color of the Democratic flag to green to appeal to more ethnic voters. Although the Democratic establishment has not changed its goals and strategies, I see no reason to change my mind about

It is well written, clear and concise.  My children have been enjoying it for about a month now, I have my copy at home and they seem to like it too.  I would love to see it in a larger format.  If you like reading history, you will love this book.   Highly Recommended and Highly Recommended.    Thank you for this book...I want to make it a part of my classroom.   A new and fascinating subject for a new generation of children to experience.  This is one of those great books for a teacher who teaches history and the way to get students to remember.  The images are so vivid, the story is full of details, but most importantly, the lessons are real and are relevant to a younger age group.  This book was the only one I found that was based on a real life story.   Good job, author.   We love this one.   This one will stay in our reading list for a long time!   This is an excellent read.  To me it captures the essence of war.  You get to know your enemy.  Great job with the writing style!   I think this book is also a must for teachers as a teaching aid.

Write a positive review about a good book:.................................. The book "Caught in the Crossfire" is a must for every law enforcement officer.   I have a good knowledge of firearms. And the author, a veteran, has a knack of writing to the point, with some humor and humor.     It's written for all levels of law enforcement including those who want to learn but are scared of firearms and the bad guys they might face on the job.   (It also gives advice to police officers who are unsure about carrying a concealed weapon for personal protection as well as the military and others who might be a good candidate for a concealed carry permit.)   My only complaint is that the author made several errors of grammar and style when writing to some law enforcement and military officers. The errors are so minor that they hardly count and the author did correct those errors in a subsequent edition.

Write a positive review about a good book:      I've read this book before and it is quite good. The writing is so entertaining that it makes the book better. I highly recommend this book. The main idea of this book is how a small change in the diet, the way it's prepared and processed, affects the body's ability to get the nutrients it needs. To make the book as good as possible I have to tell a few stories about a couple of subjects. We will start with one of the main characters who is a little older than the others. A woman who is in her early 40s, a single mom and a college graduate, who goes to the local market once a week to buy fruit, vegetables and other healthy foodstuffs. She usually goes to a grocery store that sells all her groceries there, but one time she went to the one that sold her fruits and vegetables instead. The fruit was small, green and unripe, and the vegetables were not ripe. She ate most of it and it was all ruined, the only thing that was good was the peanut butter sandwich with honey. That last part was her favorite part. She tells us the story of how a man named Bob had a problem with food, and how he had tried various diets. He had tried vegetarianism, and even some fruitarianism, but it never worked for him. He was never able to maintain any weight. He thought he might be obese, but had no idea why. He told this story because he thought that since he was a good cook he should know how to eat a healthy diet. He wanted to go back to his former diet and not worry about his weight and health again. So one day he decided to try a vegan diet, and he tried this one as well, but his family was not happy about it. One day his family comes to visit and he tries this diet but he finds out that it's not good for him, and decides to change his diet to one that works for him and his family. Now he is a vegetarian, and tries to stay this way, but when he is around his children he becomes a little bit of a nut case again. His story is about his experience with one way to deal with a very specific type of diet that he has and one of his kids and that his family will accept. You can guess the ending of this story. Another example is about an ex smoker who had to get help to stop smoking. This man, named

I read the first three in one sitting and they are great. I'm going to get the rest for Christmas.   It took me a while to get into this story because I couldn't get into the first couple of books.

Write a positive review about a good book:    First of all, this book is not the most technical of books on networking. However, this is a necessary reading for any network professional, to make you understand the basics of networking, or to make any changes to your existing network setup. As a network administrator, I found this book very helpful. Although this book does not give you the most in-depth look into networking concepts, it does show the importance of networking and how a lot of network tools are designed to handle it. The chapters and sections are well-organized and the author explains them in the most simple and understandable manner. For this reason, even people who are less technical will find this book of interest. It is available in both.mobi and.epub versions. I recommend reading the.epubs before reading the book, as the.mobi version uses an ad-supported format, which may cause your internet service provider to restrict access to your devices and make it harder for you to use your devices. The book is well-written, easy to read, easy on your mind and your patience. The text is clear, concise, and complete, with a good and detailed description of the concepts in each chapter. There are numerous pictures, diagrams and other visual aids in the text to make it more readable, with examples for each concept presented. The examples in the book help you understand, so you will be able to easily apply the concepts to your network. In addition, the author gives very complete explanations of what are each of the major networking protocols, how they work, and their different purposes. In general, these networking protocols are what make the internet function and can be used by anyone who has access to the internet, whether you own a computer or have a smart phone. If you are planning to purchase a book on networked systems, this one is definitely recommended.   Note: I have not yet found any book on networking that has any good pictures, explanations and explanations of the networking protocols; however, these two books come very close in terms of being able to present the most basic networking concepts to readers that are less technically-inclined. If the idea of this book appeals to you, then this would be the one you should read.

Write a positive review about a good book: **********This is by far one of the best books I've ever read, both a book of fiction and of non-fiction, I highly recommend it to anyone with a passion for history, and just want to learn. I've found that you will often come to the end of the book with some new and important facts, I would recommend reading through it more than once, it would certainly be a good idea to print off the whole book, and put the printed copies on your bookshelf.I've found it fascinating that in all the different countries of the world, different languages and dialects can vary so much, and yet they have almost everything in common when it comes to culture, religion, and the way they deal with their own cultures.**********

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  I have loved this book and would highly recommend it. I read it on the bus as I traveled and really enjoyed it. A few things I loved: It was written by a man who actually did go through a rough time in his life. The characters and settings were all real. It was easy to relate to the situation they were in and the characters. I was surprised at how much the humor didn't wear thin. It kept me laughing for the whole novel, even through the dark passages, and I don't like to give that to a book. There are also plenty of funny lines that I kept rereading and had to laugh about. The way the story was told was interesting as it kept changing and changing and I kept thinking about what I would have said if I was there. I really like this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********It was soooooo good! I've only read it by a friend, and I thought it was a bit light. It was more of a horror novel, though, not something I'm going to read in one sitting. But the ending was sooo good, and the first half of the book was very good as well. It could be a very good novel, if they kept it the same length. And the writing was excellent. But overall, a good novel but could use a little more meat.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "An excellent summary of the history of the Roman Empire, this study makes clear that the 'Dark Ages' were indeed, in some ways, the 'Golden Age', the era in which the Romans became the most prosperous and influential empire the world had ever seen. In contrast to the 'darkness' of the medieval period, when there was little change from the ancient way of life, it is a world transformed by the Roman conquest."

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  I am an avid book lover, but when it comes to reading I'm a beginner!   I started out by listening to audiobooks and reading books on audio for a bit, I even owned a couple of these cheapo audiobook players, but it wasn't enough.  It was around 2010 when I finally bought my own portable audio player, bought by my friend, and I couldn't be happier.  (I'm a huge nerd and love to watch videos).  Nowadays, if I'm listening to something on my ipod I can get full enjoyment from it, if it's an audiobook I listen to it on my portable player (I have an ipod nano) and even if it wasn\'t an audiobooey I would still enjoy the story.  a big plus for me is that I can listen to some audioboom podcasts (like this one, or this one), but this particular one (I can't remember what it\'s called) really stuck with me and when I finished reading I listened to it again and it was just as enjoyable as the first time I heard it.  the story has some nice twists, good characters, and a nice change of pace from many other books.  The narrator is really good, and it\'ll get your attention the moment you listen to the first line of the book.   So, if you\'re looking for a good story, a good read, a fun read, and you just can't help but think that the author has a great writing style you really can\'t go wrong with this book, if only for the fun read alone.

"A fine book....This book will change your view of the American experiment and how we got to where we are today. And what you learn will change you. There are a lot of good books on this topic but this is THE BEST." - Paul F. Boudinot, editor of  "Historicism in America"  (Harvard University Press) "If there are two things I like more than history, it is biographies of men of great intellect, who have given us some of the great ideas of our time. This is a book with that quality, and this is why I love history, particularly early American History. This book will make you think about the founding fathers' concept of liberty, the Constitution's role in that revolution, and their concept of government. And for that matter, will make anyone who studies American History think about why this country is the greatest nation ever. There is not a more informative book out there for the American school.

But I figured that, as a child of the '80s, it would be like buying another of my dad's old books. Boy, was I wrong. This book will not only keep my kid entertained, but will also help her learn a bit about different cultures and traditions in this world. There are also stories about different animals and birds. Overall, this book is just a wonderful way to introduce children to different cultures around the world.

Write a positive review about a good book:!!! I received this book as a Christmas present from a dear friend. It was a great book for me and made me think about the Bible as a young man. Thanks to a good friend I have read this book many times and am glad to finally have it in English. "   "This book is fascinating and entertaining, and has been a major inspiration for me to read more the Bible. Thank you to Goodreads for having this book available for people like me."   ""The Bible Tells Me So"" is, by any measure, the most important book of the Bible."   was one of my favorite books as a kid, and a big influence on my reading for years to come. But this review is for the newer versions of the book. This is a very difficult, fascinating, and entertaining book. It is the story of Adam's disobedience to God and how it led to the creation of humanity. Adam and Eve were the first people on Earth, and were not the last. They were the only ones that were not God's perfect image. In some ways, this is a story about evolution, but it is also about the creation and fall of man. It covers the story, from Adam and God's conversation, to the birth of Adam, and the subsequent creation of Eve. It also has some interesting accounts of animal creation. The story is told from the perspective of two people. First, it is told by a woman, Eve, who was the first woman to hear God's voice. Second, it takes the perspective from Adam, who is the only human being to hear Adam's voice (I think, it could have been more than one man or woman in the story). I found the story very interesting, and thought the author did a great job at making it interesting.   Adam is a good guy. The first thing that catches my attention is that Adam, the first human being, is not afraid to rebel. It isn't a part of his nature. His father wanted him to be a farmhand and he rebelled. Then, he disobeyed God, got expelled from the Garden, and lived with his mother and sisters. He was not afraid of God's power. But he is fearful that he would be abandoned by God. Adam did not like to see others, especially women, enjoying pleasure. The only women in his life were his mother, and his sister. When he saw Eve doing something that he thought immoral, he had to think
Write a positive review about a good book:    In the first few pages of this novel I was very much intrigued by the premise: a woman in her 40's has a strange encounter with a "tall, silent stranger" in the middle of the night. I had a great deal of trouble with that premise because I was having trouble believing that it could really be true. But, in fact, it is true. It's a beautiful story with great character development and believable twists and turns. The descriptions of the island are quite good and the story takes place well in the context of this world. If you've never read the work of David Mitchell, I recommend giving this book a try. If I had one criticism I would have to say that a few of the characters in this story aren't very believable and that they're not all exactly how they seem (I know I've been saying this for the past several years). I think that if a reader is going to have the character be a member of the elite of this society, I think it's best to have a bit of a backbone about their backgrounds and a little bit of back story about why they have been selected for such a position. It can be somewhat boring to have people in this novel who are basically just blank slates with a fancy name. I would still recommend this book though because it's just so very much worth reading. If there was something I can change about this book, it would be to have more in the way of back stories and backstory about the members of this group. That would have made the characters more real and believable. I'm sure I missed something, but I did read all the way through this novel and it was quite easy.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a great introduction to the concepts of differential geometry that I find so fascinating!  I have a new interest in the theory of high-dimensional differential geometry.  It's great to have such a strong basic background in this area.  This book is a fantastic introduction to differential geometry and is especially well-suited to undergraduate courses in differential geometry or differential geometry of manifolds.    It is very well put together, and I hope to learn a lot from it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  Great book!! How to make an inexpensive, very durable case:   This is my first book case I've made, so i'm no expert. I followed instructions as best I could. I'm very happy with the case it was made, and it seems to hold up to years of use. It's not waterproof so i haven't been able to put a laptop in it yet, but it's held up really well to that (i haven't done that with my other case yet, so that's not a big deal for me).  My biggest concern was the color. I bought the case in the light blue. I found it very bright and distracting. I also found it annoying when my husband would get in his car and drive across the house to his work. I have seen a couple books in the past few weeks that have been completely ruined by the bright blue. Maybe i should have picked a different color for this book case, but i wasn't aware of the color issue. I was hoping it would be a nice "rustic" look, but again, i'm not an expert. The inside of the case is very strong, with metal reinforcements. I haven't had to take it down to remove all the parts yet, and everything was holding up pretty well. I don't think it'll hold up well in the next few years since it's so heavy, but at least it's holding up now.  Overall a really good book case that was pretty easy to make.  It was a lot of fun for me to make, and I'm really happy with how it turned out. 
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- One of the more insightful books I've read. A very thorough and intelligent explanation on various aspects of life as an atheist. Highly recommended. -DarthWizard  I'm pretty much an atheist myself but I've found this very useful. Highly Recommended  This is a great book, I highly recommend it. I've had the chance to read several, and this one is the best of the lot. -David  Excellent book on life as a non-believer, especially for atheists, people who have left their religion and are now struggling with religion again, and for those who are questioning the truth of religion and the existence of God. Highly informative. Highly recommend it! -Joe, UK  If you want a good, objective look at life as someone who does not believe in the existence or non-existence of god, I would highly recommend "God Is Not Great: The Evidence That Demonizes Christianity and Removes the Rhetoric of God." -Cynthia  It is extremely useful, thoughtful, and interesting. I think it is a must for anyone who wants to know more about the "evidence" that shows that atheism is true. -John  A very comprehensive, well-researched, well written, and well-written book that makes a solid case for why atheism is the most rational worldview and that atheism has the strongest evidence. Highly enjoyable. -Tobias  Thank you! It's very interesting, thought-provoking, and thought-leading. Very informative. -Liam  There was a time, not long ago, when the most popular way of dealing with a skeptical or skeptical worldview was "just ignore it" or "don't believe it". In short, ignore it because it doesn't add anything to your worldview. But this approach was a failure; as soon as you ignore something, it is picked up, used, and amplified. So now, instead of ignoring, the secular worldview is to embrace it and incorporate it into our worldview. In this case, the atheism perspective is to use, understand, and incorporate what is seen by others who share the same beliefs. This is the secular perspective, and I am quite happy to be a part of it!  -Richard  The world is a complicated place, and most people are not always up to speed on the most recent scientific discoveries.

Write a positive review about a good book:  " This is a beautiful and thought provoking book about a complex and mysterious person who is a victim of her surroundings in a very real way. There are plenty of examples in this book to help us understand each others' points of view, and make us think, if not about ourselves, about the nature of the world we are surrounded by. The story, though a sad one, is also very moving, with characters that we care about being torn apart and losing their minds, and even themselves. "
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a really great book that I enjoyed very much. The main protagonist is the best protagonist I've seen in many a great fantasy novel.  She had a real life and an important life, and in the middle of that she got into a bit of trouble.  Her friends are really fun.  There is a group of friends in town, a group that comes together to help out with her situation.  The thing that I liked about it the most is how the book is written.    The book is funny, funny, and it is full of action and excitement.  I'm giving this book a 4 out of 5.    It's one of my favorite fantasy books of all time, and I highly recommend it!

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________   I read this book about a year ago and I'm just now getting around to putting it down. In short, I absolutely love this book. It's fun, it's sweet and it's funny. The dialogue is always interesting and the ending makes you smile from ear to ear. There are several times when the characters go on an adventure (including one I won't spoil) and the story is always engaging. In fact, the book's conclusion is quite shocking and I found myself completely hooked on the sequel which I'm currently reading. This book definitely got my interest.   One thing I must mention before getting to the reviews...   If you think this is a fairy tale with a happy ending, think again. It has a few shocking twists (including the author admitting to writing "sexually exploitative" books) but overall, this is very different from your standard fantasy novel.

It's a great way to keep yourself from feeling like you have to have that one, special project or exercise that you MUST do. This book is just the kind of book you can reference and never feel like you forgot. --J.B.C. I have enjoyed this book immensely. It has taught me valuable information and made me more aware of my weaknesses. I find that it is very helpful to read other people's experiences to see what is possible. The book is really practical as it is written in such a way that you can see and be reminded of the methods and ways to be successful. I have recommended this book to everyone that asks and will continue to do so for years to come. --C.B I had the pleasure of experiencing the book in person and have found it to be a great tool to help me through the challenges in my life that often come with being young and going through a lot. The exercises and techniques in this book have helped me in my own personal journey. I definitely recommend The Magic Word. --D.R. If you are seeking a way to be more focused, organized, and motivated, read this book; then go have some fun with it.  If you are searching for a new way to develop a sense of connection, love and belonging, read it; then have a cup of coffee and sit in your favorite chair and talk for a while.  Whatever you do, make sure you have a good look at the covers to the inside of this book before buying it. The cover is colorful and fun and the book inside is filled with interesting facts and concepts you can explore further and use in your everyday life.  I was so excited when I first found out about this book that I started to read it right away. I was so impressed with it that I bought it. If you have children and are looking for a good resource for helping your little ones become more focused and organized and motivated to get more things done, then The Magic words is exactly what you need.

It was good in that there were little twists and turns, a good pace and plenty of action and drama. It made me happy, because all my favourite books that I read are bad...but this one was good!....................................................

It was a really interesting and well written novel. I thought it was very well written. The plot was a lot of fun, there were some really interesting twists and some of the dialogues was great.

I liked the characters, the storyline and the way the story was presented. The story was very interesting and it kept me intrigued................ There is a few problems with the novel. Firstly, the plot seems to be going in the wrong direction...it's set up well but then I felt like it just got more confusing and convoluted in places. Secondly, the main characters are a bit boring, which I can understand because it was a short book and they weren't that well developed. Thirdly, the dialogue was a little weird, sometimes it was too dramatic and sometimes it didn't fit into the narrative. The book was well written in general and it is a good read.

It is so good that I could read it for hours on end. The world building is wonderful, the action is well done, and the story is just wonderful. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for something in the science fiction genre. It really is something different. This book is so close to the best science fiction that I have read in the last few years that I think it has become my favorite of the genre. I'm also going to have to make a sequel to this one. I like it as a standalone, but I'll most likely make it my new "read this book" book. That is if there are any readers out there who have also enjoyed this series.Read full review

Write a positive review about a good book:!!! I loved this book. It was a really fun read and really helped me deal with feelings from my break up with a close friend. The book did a good job of portraying the whole situation in a relatable way for a reader new to dealing with relationship breakdowns. I can now understand that even if I've been in a bad place it's still not all bad and it's better to talk through it, than try to avoid it or pretend it didn't happen. Also, this book made me really think about things like: Do I take things too personally or not at all? Have I over analyzed my feelings? This book made the point that the more I analyze what happened I become less and less willing to talk about it, but also less willing and less able to have any compassion for someone I can't stand to be around. It does a great job of depicting the impact of feelings on people and how to better handle them and also how to be more understanding if someone does get hurt when they do this. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about this stuff and is in a relationship that needs some help.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ I was very glad I decided to read this book. I had my doubts. The book was very well written and had a lot of information about the different plants in the garden. I used the information from this book and I have enjoyed growing all my garden plants. This book also had great pictures and information. There are a few times when I could feel the author was being a bit biased but I felt she gave some good reasons for why certain things need to be done and where. I also felt she was honest. There is one book on the topic of gardening I found more reliable but I am not sure how to recommend this book because I do not feel it was biased.
Write a positive review about a good book:................................. The End of War is not a bad book. It is just a good one. I really liked it. It was a bit long, but there was a lot of reading. I enjoyed the story well. I think the end of war was interesting. I'm glad that this book is being released. I would definitely recommend it.  Review by: K.C. on Dec. 29, 2005 :  This was my first foray into World War Two fiction, and it was certainly worth the effort.   If you are interested in WWII, this book has a lot for you.  it's a bit too long to be read in one sitting, but you could certainly make some good use of it while waiting for the next installment.   and the writing is pretty good too, which is more than can be said for most novels written by the likes of "Schlesinger" and "Mack" in my opinion.  the only reason I don't give this book five stars is that in my estimation there was much less to be seen than there was described. I don''t really know why this is the case.    And just in case you don'' want to learn about World War 2, I''m sure this book would be a great place to start. I wouldn''t know exactly what to expect, and certainly I wouldn't know how to interpret the details, but I do know that it will be worth your time.  -K.C  (reviewed 23 days after purchase)
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** My daughter and I both really enjoyed this book. The story is a bit dated but the themes are so relevant today. She and I are still learning about and exploring the issues so I can't give it 5 stars, but I really enjoyed the book. My favorite themes were that, no matter how great our lives are, our relationships will always be strained. We have to learn to forgive people when we think they're not to blame but, we will never be truly at peace. That means we have to be willing to take risks, and stand up for what we believe in, because the world doesn't change all that much. We can always be right or wrong about that and sometimes we do the right thing because we're forced to. I would recommend it. It's a great read.

It's a great book to read in one sitting with your best friend to discuss how a bad job or family situation could have been avoided.

If you want to find an easy way out and don't know how, I strongly suggest this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "A wonderful story about love. What I found so interesting about this story was the way in which this man was very vulnerable. He's a very happy man, with a wife and a nice son, and yet he's never been able to fully communicate this, and for that I'm grateful.  The story is told by his daughter. She recounts the time her father left her for another woman, and her mother tried to teach her to be strong, to not allow her father to make such a big decision. She was completely helpless to her father's needs and desires, and though she was able to have her doubts, she was never able to break free of him. It's a story about letting yourself go, as a young girl, and being allowed to grow. I think that's a beautiful thing."

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ This is a really solid book for the price. It is a well thought out introduction to a topic in computer security. However, it is NOT a complete book on security. There are still areas of research that I feel should be done and areas of study that should be taken up to. I also felt that it was a little long in places. The sections on Windows and Internet security are particularly long. The chapter on cryptography and digital signatures is shorter than I would have liked. However the book is an excellent introduction to computer security for a great price. For a good introduction, go for this book.  Review by: Michael H - New Jersey, U.S.A. on 10/29/2016 :  I love this book!   I did a ton of research about security in my own time and finally decided to get this book for my laptop.   First off, the book covers security at its base level. This is something I wish I had known.   and second, there is a great section on how to use the free tools available on Linux. There is also a section on using the tools in a virtual environment. I love the section on the linux command line.   (The tools aren't necessary but they are a good starting point.)   All in all this is an incredibly good book. It isn't the complete introduction to security that I wanted. But it's a great place to start. I will recommend it to anyone who is new to computer science and security.  I would also recommend reading the online versions of the book if you get this version. .

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________________________ "This was an excellent book. I enjoyed this book because it was the most recent book I had on the topic. It dealt with the evolution of humans. The evolution of intelligence. I liked the author's opinion that evolution is an inevitable process." (K. D. H.)  _____________________________________________________________________________  "I have a hard time recommending this book to anyone. My father read it years ago and said it was a good introduction to the topic, and that it might be useful if there were something more recent available. I am glad I read it. It was interesting, thought provoking, and not so much about evolution but rather the human mind. I think a book this dense with facts, that is so difficult to explain, and so many illustrations could benefit from a rewrite. In addition, I'm not sure I like the author who is the only one who has been around for that long. " (T.M.)  to the author  ______________________________
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A good first book in a series that would provide the reader with a wonderful story"   I am a writer who has been published in various venues including the Guardian and many other literary magazines. I was given a copy of the first of a three part series by an editor at an overseas publisher. This is not a book of fantasy, but is a classic story, in the vein of James Joyce's Ulysses or Henry James's The Turn of the Screw. I like books that take us through a world we may not normally be used to. I had to read the first two chapters first before I could start reading the third, but it was the third one that made the best use of the book. It is set in Victorian England, the time of the Victorian era, and the narrator tells the story through his father's diary. It had me fascinated from start to finish. The characters were all very well written and the story was told in such a way that made it easy to relate. I loved it, and I have already read the other two parts.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ The best book I've ever read on the subject. I hope that as I read more and more about the subject, I'll have a better understanding of what we are trying to teach our children. Highly recommended for every parent who has a child with attention deficit disorder. ___________________________________________________________ I recommend this book to anyone with a child who has been diagnosed with ADHD, ADHD-C, CD, SPD, SPD/ADHD or any other condition that includes a need to pay attention, and also anyone with children of other ages. This book will help parents, teachers, and other adults help the children who need this help the most. I highly recommend this for everyone who can, is able, and wants to help. _______________________________________________________________________________  It was good. It wasn't perfect. I was glad it was there, but it was missing a few things, such as more examples on how to do the exercises. I would have liked to see the exercises explained more. The book is definitely worth the read, but I wish I knew what I was missing from the book and how to add it.  Review of ADHD: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly by Robin Carver I am a clinical psychologist with a private practice in California, and have worked for years with adults and children with ADD/ADDD. I am not a specialist. This is a book that helped me understand the difficulties that many adults have with learning to focus. There are so many misconceptions about attention deficit. The author's clear explanations and example are helpful. . , January 10, 2010  The ADHD Effect On Children  How many of us have experienced the frustration and misery of feeling "off," "out of it," "confused," "troubled," or "distracted"? Many of us also realize how "trendy" ADD has become. While ADHD itself doesn't cause "off" in adults, the effects are felt far and wide. The consequences can be devastating: anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, anger, and rage.  the author explains all the things that can go wrong with ADD as well as ways to "correct" ADD. My 5 yr old had been a "typical" student, always "on task" and a "high achiever." He has never been diagnosed as being with ADD, and still feels "normal" in that regard. This has made his life difficult. His grades are often below average

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ Read the other reviews first and this one was on my top 5 list so I went and bought it. I'm glad I did. The story is very well told and the characters are well developed. I loved the romance between the two lead characters, and the world building and the way the author describes the different cultures and races in the book. I will definitely read more books from her.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was introduced to the world of fantasy and science fiction through an anthology called The Best of Science Fiction and Fantasy in 2012 (which I still own and which I still recommend). I read a few of the anthologies and was so surprised and happy to find a group of writers I knew personally in there, so much so that I was actually disappointed when I found out they had already published a book that year! I'm sure I'd have enjoyed the anthology even more if I'd seen their names, but this was a nice surprise. And to think I wasn't aware that it's not uncommon for writers in this field to go by multiple pseudonyms, and when they do, it's generally because they are busy or trying to avoid the "publishing death spiral." I've had to try to find books by some of these writers by "stepping out of the door" to check for the authors' names and titles, and I'm so glad to have finally found a solid selection! I have a few favorite books in this collection. The first is by a fellow writer of my acquaintance, Brian Aldiss: The Martian Chronicles. I love his characters, and his story about the birth of a Martian and how it affects the people in the world around him is one of the best things I've read in a while. My second favorite is by another great writer in my acquaintance: Robin Hobb. She's one of my favorite authors in general and I love The Farseer Trilogy so much that I went through six different paperback editions in a single month of trying to read all of her books in one week. But I had a hunch that I wouldn't like her next story, The Eye of the World. It's not much like any of her other work, and while it's about two characters from her previous books (though one is a female), it feels like a different book altogether. (I think.) I'll say it's a fine read, but I'm a little disappointed. (And if you read that, there's a spoiler in it for those who haven't yet read Hobb's series, The Wheel of Time.) In all, I love this collection of short stories! This is one that I want to have on my bookshelf forever, in spite of the fact that I've already read it four times. It's just that good. It reminds me a little of my old paperback copy of A Song of Ice and Fire, which was one
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The world is a nasty place. People kill each other and steal from each other. People get depressed and die. The weather is harsh. Life is hard. Yet I have not felt that the world is an unsafe place in the few years I have been reading The Book of Mormon. It has been a good, interesting, and enjoyable reading. The author is quite interesting and knowledgeable on the subject, and this book will make your head spin with its fascinating details of what it is like to be in the midst of this ancient record!

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** ************* I recently picked up a copy of this book for the birthday present I gave my daughter. My 7 year old enjoyed it as much as I did. Her teacher really helped her out by letting her read the book over and over so she would memorize the story. As soon as I saw the pictures of the characters I knew it was a perfect gift for her. She has had the book since she was in the first grade and is excited about the story for the first time. I know my daughter will enjoy the story too!  3 of 3 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* "If I had a dollar for every book I've read that has impacted my life, this is one of them"   Book Description:   This is an extremely detailed, in-depth, step-by-step guide on how to develop a solid, reliable backup plan for your electronic devices in the event that your primary one fails or you are unable to access your data.   In this book, I found myself constantly looking for the solution to the problem, which is why this is a recommended read. Even though it will cost you a few dollars more than it should, the amount of time you can save in this process can be very rewarding.   the book explains all the main concepts of an emergency backup, including what it is and why it's important.   of all the options out there, backup software is probably one of the most expensive and yet it has the most options to choose from. As such, if you are considering purchasing one, the first thing you'll want to do is figure out what is most important to you. This book explains a few of the key points of backup software, as well as what is required for your specific situation. In addition, I've added a few extra tips and tricks for creating a backup plan and will share those later on in the review.  , you will learn how to backup all of your files using a variety of options, such as a free software program, a paid one, and even an Android app. If you don't feel confident about using a free one and you can't afford one, don't worry. After using and recommending a bunch of different apps to friends and family, I figured out that this is not something that's hard to do. In fact, I personally made a backup of my phone using several different apps, and it was the best backup I ever made, at least in terms of ease of use. Of course, there are tons of great free apps available on the market as well, including Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and more. If, however, you find yourself wanting something that provides a more reliable backup and you are not confident about your current backup solution, then the best bet would be to take the plunge and purchase a backup program. This is particularly true if you have multiple devices, and want to be able to move your data easily. After installing a backup app on your computer, you should have a USB device with a USB port. However, if that

Write a positive review about a good book:    by Robert Noyce on May 17, 2018 :  I am trying to read this book again. The characters were excellent in the first book.   This time I am reading a third chapter that has the following:   1. A man is dying in a nursing home and the nurses try to keep him alive for as long as they can, but with their efforts his mind deteriorates.   to keep his mind active and his mind sharp. They try to have him listen to music, talk on the phone, read books, but he just won't be able to remember a thing that was done in his lifetime.   and they go to the psychiatrist who says "we'll try this new therapy program that uses music and movement."   They decide to go to a music store and buy a CD.  .  ,   2. After a few weeks of this therapy, the patient's mind finally starts working again. He remembers everything!   .   the patients in his nursing home are still in the nursing home but after they have been released they will be able go out and have their own lives again.   in their minds the music they are listening to is the music that will help them to remember everything that happened to them during their lifetime. They do not need any new therapy to help them. they just need to listen to the music and remember it.   an excellent book   my only complaint about this book is that the author never explains how these patients' minds work.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________   A great read and enjoyable.   5 out of 5 stars ___________________________________________________   My book exchange exchange partners were a bit strange. One of them seemed quite friendly, I really enjoyed getting my books back (they always read well) so I figured I'd try it again.   the second one seemed very rude, I didn't like what they said at all about me getting my book back (which was probably not the fault of the person) and it seemed like the person was just trolling for a quick laugh. I did return the book and exchange it for a new book.   The third person I just kept ignoring. I just never got any interaction with her, she never really said anything to me and I didn the whole exchange was really kind of weird.  ..   But as for the books, I'm glad I went to Goodreads.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great and timely book. I bought it a few years ago when I was a little less well-versed on the subject, but after a few weeks of study, I'm reading this book with ease. The stories are often entertaining and sometimes heart-warming and I feel like I've seen the past, present, and future unfold in a totally fresh way. I can't imagine being a reader of history books who hasn't read this one or any others by this author. Read Full Review  Review by: Tania Rose, Author/Editor of The Book of Romance.com I was so excited to get the book back in the mail a few months ago. As a historian I am constantly searching the world for examples of great romances that have influenced and changed the way I think about romance and love. I was surprised that this story was written as it is in the book because I had never thought of the world of romance as having been influenced by the Roman Empire or other parts of the ancient world. I always thought romance was something that had developed within cultures and was universal. What I have found through my studies is that the ancient Romans were very much aware of this fact and made it a part of their empire's history as much as it was a part for the peoples that made up the empire. I am grateful to the author of this book for reminding us about the many cultures that influenced romance and how it affected every part of the empire, from the wealthy ruling classes to the lowly soldiers who were expected to follow in their footsteps. While this story is not about Rome, this book is about how the Romans changed the world. This story is a lot of fun, I will definitely be reading more about the Romans and their influences on romance. Read full review

I was always very self-conscious and not very confident in myself. This book gave me the courage to start talking about what I feel and to be able to listen to other's feelings too. I have learned how to trust my feelings. This was my first self help book I've ever read, and I am so glad I bought it.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________ In my opinion the first book of the series "The Last Command" is the best book in this series as it is by far the most gripping book. The main characters are well-developed as their thoughts are not merely restricted by the events in this book, but are also influenced by it, making the book an almost emotional roller coaster ride. The only flaws with this book is the length of the book, which is a bit excessive, but that might just be my own bad taste, as I really did enjoy this story. As a disclaimer I will mention that there is violence in this story, but it is mostly used as a weapon in order to make a point, not as part of an assault. I think it's a really good idea to get it out of your system. ____________________________________________________________ "I'm not really sure what to say...I'm still in shock.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "In its purest form this book is about a young man, William, who spends his free time trying to make a living by doing nothing and dreaming of a time when he will be rich. He falls in with an older man, Bill, who promises him a great opportunity when his uncle, a rich man, falls ill and dies in the hospital. William and Bill move into an old house in a seedy neighborhood. William soon begins to steal and sell things from the house, and soon learns about how Bill is running things, and how he has gotten away with it for so long. It is a fascinating look at a man who really has no sense of right and wrong. This book is full of real life examples. I especially liked the way they discussed the law enforcement methods used in the case, and the methods used by the prosecutors in the crime scene where the murder took place."   Review by: John C. Huggins   This book is one of my favorites. I was very pleased with the fact that the author used real life cases from his own life as inspiration for the story. I particularly liked the details of William's upbringing, and his relationship with his family. There are also some real life stories in this book that I can relate to in one way or another. William's situation and problems are real, and they were not meant to be a fantasy. I would recommend this book to any reader who likes a good story, and who may not have read any other book about an interesting character with a tragic background.

This woman is in a prison for murder and theft and is waiting for a death sentence for her crime. She is being given a chance for an appeal and for an acquittal. Her lawyer is a very good one.

Write a positive review about a good book:   There is one or two "errors" here and there but they are minor. I found the format interesting and informative. The illustrations are very good and the story well told.   Read a negative review about an unsatisfactory book:  It reads like a dry, academic treatise about the nature of science and how it operates. The author, by her own admission, has little to no experience in science. Her "proof" that science can be a force for good (it can't!) is that she is able to find the flaw in it by pointing out it's flaw. And then it is a "proof", by the definition of the word, that a good person is good, and that science is the best source of wisdom. And she is a good writer, too!

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________   As I am looking for an intro to psychology book, I decided to buy this book. It was good enough to get through it with a bit of a headache, although I think my bookish friends will get a kick out of it.   This book is mainly about a subject I have little knowledge of. It's about "The Mind and Personality" and basically what a "personality" is and how it's like a "machine", and how that has a lot to do with our thoughts, and the way we function.  .I liked the way it started, which was by saying that "I am going to tell you about the mind. You are going to watch me operate this machine, and you will see that I work very hard to make it do what I want it to do." So I was a bit skeptical about the first part, but I ended up kind of liking the whole thing. (I just think we all want something to be true, or at least plausible, and that if you really think about it, you will find it is true.)   The book mostly talks about people, and then how to think about people - and how to "think" about people. I find the people/personality bit to be kind of interesting.   and I would recommend this to anyone interested in what is going on in our minds.

I can't think of a book that has had such a profound effect on me. This book is about a child and his dog who are both in the process of growing up. It also tells the story of a girl and a young man who are growing up, having adventures and solving problems on their own.

Write a positive review about a good book:  Great story. What is a "fuzzy-bun" and why do some people have them? A fuzzy-bunny is a bunnies that have a hole (or two) in the center of their head.  Because the bunnie does not have one in its brain, the fur that they have on their head tends to get stuck in this hole, or in a few places on the head.   What do you think about the "furry community"?   Is it a big thing?  What is the most "futuristic" thing that you find in that culture? I like how the furries don't have to define themselves or their furry nature.    They can just be who they are.  I really don't know what the "fur-community" is.   A lot of furry people are not into furry art, but I find some of it to be really interesting.  I also find some furry art to be a bit much, but that's not my place to judge.  You can find a lot of people who are into furry or furry art if you look, like, anywhere. What's your favorite thing about being a human and what's your least favorite thing? My favorite thing is just being able to have friends.  For example, if I find out that my friend has to move out of the house I live in, that's hard for me to get used to.  But that's one of the things I've found I like about being human.  Being able to see other people.  Like having to go see a concert is a big deal for me, but at least I get to see it with my friends.   And I love when I can see other cute animals in nature, like cute cats and dogs or cute horses.  And I am so excited for them to grow up.  If I think of animals, I think about how cute they can be.  Even if they have a long and difficult life.   So it's nice to have the opportunity to see them in their early days.  In a lot ways, I feel like it's important to have a companion animal to take care of you at the end of your life.  Because I have no family at the moment, and no one to go to if I can't find a job, I can always rely on my dog.  He's my little buddy
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________________________________ The author, Mr. David G. White, knows how to capture and present the nuances of the most complex characters with the most difficult situations. He portrays the characters in a realistic fashion and does not give away any information to the reader that is not already known by them. This is not a novel about a single man's struggle to get away, this is not one about the journey of a boy, this one is about a girl, a teenager, the struggle to cope with the pressures that are being put upon her by a cruel father, who is trying to keep his daughter's world together. And what is her world like? There are the usual family conflicts and dramas, the father's jealousy and lack of control over his daughter, her father's refusal to allow her to get a job because she is too beautiful to work in a job that does not require her to cook. There is also her father who is constantly looking for an excuse to punish her for the way that she talks to other boys and her friends. These conflicts and struggles between her parents and her father is the background for her to learn how to deal with the pressure and the problems in her life. The story is told from her point of view and so we are drawn into the inner lives of the characters we are reading about. ______________________________________________________________________________________ [I know that there are a few problems in the way the narrator describes the problems and conflicts of his own family (i.e. the mother's constant complaining that he is neglecting her child) which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.] I really liked the author's approach to this book and I think his approach is the right one. Although, it is easy to see that there is a lot of material that is left out or left out as it may seem to be a book about a teenager and I do believe it to be more so than that. For example, Mr White talks about his family in the present tense; this is a good thing to do as it makes it much easier for us to understand how they are looking at things. He also takes into account his own feelings about his children which is something that we, as the reader, are often unaware of. However, one thing I can understand is the way he shows his love and respect for his children, he talks about them as individuals rather than treating them as a group. This may be very difficult to see for a new reader. We need to be aware that this is something
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book when I was 18-19 years old. I remember it being one of the first books I read. I don't think I've ever gotten over it. It has been over 25 years since I've read it, but it's been a book that I have found myself coming back to. The language is raw and it is so hard for me to understand all the information. It's not so much that it is difficult to understand, but the words don't make much sense to me. It took me a long time to even really pick up on how things are related. Some of the terms are extremely hard to understand because of the many different meanings in the word. It is hard to go into the details, but there's a lot of information about what he's done to other people, how it feels, and the effects it's had on them. I hope I got some of that into my head. "I'd like to go back to my first wife, and my first home. To where I was born. I would like to see the places where I grew up. Where I made my mother proud. I could still see the house, even the windows. I'd like the things I've forgotten. I wish I'd kept them." -R.C. Bray My rating for the book: 4.75 stars. This is a very good book. I know many of you may not like it, because it's different. I had read a lot about the Bible and the book was so good that it took me about an hour to read the entire book. However, I can say that the more I've studied and thought about the topic, the more it was making sense to myself. The Bible was used to understand the world that is around us. It was the most important thing in my life, but I had no idea how to get it. So it was with this book. The book really made sense and I can now understand how all of the other things in life are related and I don' t have to look so hard to get to the core of what it is. I was surprised at how much I understood. I also really liked the information about the people who were involved. The man who was the one who helped found the Church of the First Born is the most powerful man I know. He has so much power and his life is like a family.

It deals with what are the fundamental questions about the soul and the soul's relationship with the body. It's not just a philosophical or religious book about the mind/body relationship, it deals with physical and spiritual issues and their relationship, and it's done in a very good, clear, and engaging way. It is a nice book to sit down with and read, because it does not try to be a novel. It gives a good view on the soul, its relationship to the body, and the spiritual aspects of life. I liked the novel because it had good descriptions of various places and times.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. I like to try out new things in my reading. This one I think is a gem. It will be in my permanent library. A lot of people will find it interesting but others might not. I think this book is about the most important people in my life, my parents. It might seem a little long at 70 pages but it goes into a lot of details. I don't think I could give it a perfect 5 but I'll give it an overall good score. The cover is a little hard to make out, but that was the intention.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- The idea that there could be a life-changing "life experience" within the Bible is so well established in the modern world, that it might as well be considered an old wives' tale. But this is what the story of Abraham and Sarah is about. When Abraham is on his deathbed, he asks God what Sarah will be doing when she gets to heaven. God says she will be making love with Abraham's grandson Isaac. That's it. God simply states that the book of Genesis tells it, and we're not supposed to argue about it. Now, in a sense, I do accept this as a fact, because in the end, Sarah is able to reconcile herself to the fact that Isaac is in heaven with Abraham (as long as he doesn't make her cook him). This doesn't change my experience of the Bible, because I still think that Sarah is a bad person who doesn't deserve to be there. So I don't think I can argue against this. -------------------------- I read this book because I wanted to hear what the other side was saying. I came away convinced that the whole story was simply wrong. And that there is more to the story than what is stated. ------------- I've read many books on Genesis and it's very apparent that it is a very difficult subject. I believe it was a great tragedy that the author did not go into much detail with her own life and times because she would have provided a much more compelling perspective. This is one book where a lot of the things she states are simply not true, and she states things that simply aren't true. As a result I feel like she is just plain wrong. I was also not impressed with the author's argument as a whole. I felt like there was very little to the book, although there were some things that did make me want to read it over again. ------------ This is a wonderful book about a man's quest for answers. The author is well-spoken, intelligent, and passionate about the subject. But there are some places in the book that she is wrong. There are several things that are factually wrong about the story. But she also gives more insight into her life than most of us would ever be able to provide. --------------- I really love this book. It is so interesting and well-written. I enjoyed it very much.  -------------- This book is well written, and it is very informative. -------------- It took me a while to read
Write a positive review about a good book: __________   If you're looking for a good, quick and fun read with good illustrations, then I recommend The Complete Bible: A New Translation, Volumes 1-3 by Andrew E. Smith and Henry C. Brown. They translate from the original Hebrew and Greek into modern English. The first 3 volumes are well done, and the next 3 are just what I wanted to read: funny, beautiful illustrations, and not too hard. This book is a must have.   As to the Bible, well, it's a really great Bible, in my opinion. It's a wonderful collection of words and stories, that even if you don't believe in any of it, you can still appreciate it as literature. I just think that the "controversy" surrounding it is completely blown out of proportion. If you read the Old Testament, you know that it is full of all sorts of crazy stuff, but we just have to understand that it was written by humans and written to give us a record of how God sees the world. I can't imagine the world being any different now, and so the story is important for us to know. We can also learn about people that we don't often see, and it gives us a very interesting perspective.
Write a positive review about a good book: ************* I was blown away by the sheer amount of information that was in this book. I know from my own experience with working in a college medical center, and from talking to other doctors, that it's difficult to find any good books that provide detailed information about medical school. That's what I found in this one: the patient, the work, the curriculum, the textbooks, the tests, the notes, the lectures, and the assignments.  I also thought it was very comprehensive in terms of the medical school curriculum.    It's very difficult to get information from any of the online sources and I thought this book was very thorough.   The only problem I had was with a patient that I thought was not adequately discussed.  I'd never seen this person before and I just assumed that all the details of the case would be covered.  It was just that she had a mild infection and was sent home.  She came back two days later and was in the ICU for 3 days with a severe pneumonia.  To tell you the truth, my thoughts were just about how many cases there are, how they get diagnosed, and how severe their disease is.  The patient was very sick and we all knew she was very low on the list for admission.  But we decided she should try to make it, because she was a young woman with a lot of energy.  So she tried.  As far as I know she did make it. I would recommend this book to anyone in my situation. 
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------- An excellent resource for any teacher, especially those who need to know about the history of the US Constitution (see comments by other teachers below). If you're a teacher, this book may help you to better understand the history. --------------  by John E. Smith  Read 3 years ago | posted on  Well researched and well presented. I was very surprised at how many references there are to the various sources used and how the text of the Constitution itself is used and explained. Thanks, and keep up the great work.  --Mark G. Kellett  read 3 years, 10 months ago  Excellent book on the founding and development of the U.S. Constitution. It is thorough, accurate, and readable. It's not a political or legal treatise. If it wasn't for the fact that it is a reference book, I would highly recommend it. The footnotes and bibliography are superb. .  The book is a must for anyone who wishes to understand the Constitution from beginning to end. I found the author's tone to be humorous. --L.H. ,  New York, NY  . It was extremely helpful as a history and civics textbook. It also was very good as a study guide for those who wanted to know more about the founding of the United States. I can't wait for my high school and college students to start using this book as well! --Landon A.  in CA  I am not a big constitutional scholar. In fact I do not understand the term "Constitution." However, this was a very thorough introduction to the history, the authors' reasoning, and their conclusions about this text. It would be good to know what the original drafts were of the amendments and how these were incorporated. For those with a limited knowledge of the subject (especially my son who is a freshman in college), I was able to introduce them to these ideas and allow them to see the historical basis for many of our modern laws. It helped us all learn from a well researched historical document. --J.H  , New York, New Jersey  You will like this book! The author is very thorough and a good writer. --D.M. in California  The best book on our founding. I cannot believe this is still in print and will get it for my 8 year old granddaughter as soon as possible. We used the text in our school history projects
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read this book and I really liked it. It's a fun little book for kids and they will enjoy it. I found myself laughing out loud several times. I think my wife was also laughing out of boredom but we weren't laughing out because of our own amusement, we were laughing because we like it. It is just funny and fun to read and I'm sure it will get you in good spirits and maybe even make you smile a little or laugh a little when you are in the mood to smile and laugh.

Write a positive review about a good book: ***************************** The next book in the 'Chaotic Century' series is 'Unnatural History', I think it is a fantastic read. I liked the description of the city that the book describes. I also liked the fact that it was very well paced. I did not really like the setting though, i think there should have been more people in the city, but that is a personal thing. It was great though. *********************** I am very sorry to say that after the previous books in the series, this is going to be the last book in this series. It seems that as i continue to read other fantasy novels in the same series, i am not able to finish them. It is not a big problem but it is annoying to me. I will continue with the other books in this trilogy, however I am going to pass on this one for now. ***************

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* My girlfriend and I enjoyed this book immensely. I liked that there was a lot of detail in the writing. As I am only starting out in the world of magic, it was helpful to have a well-defined story and to know what spells would be at my disposal. I enjoyed how the magic made me feel at different times in the story. A few characters stood out to me. And a few of the main characters were very well developed. It would be good for the reader to have at least some of these characters in their lives at some point. *****

The narration was not really anything that grabbed my attention but still good for the story. If you like a good mystery read or are a fan of James Bond then you will love this book, I will be getting another copy for sure.

Write a positive review about a good book:  When I was in middle school and early high school, I was taught the story of Jesus' birth in the Nativity, and of Mary's childbirth of Jesus at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. The story of the birth was presented as a miracle, a miraculous act that the Holy Spirit performed. The book of Genesis was taken to mean that Adam and Eve were created without sin. And since Christ was a sinless baby, it would be no wonder that the story had a divine origin, that the world would have been filled with miracles as a result. It would also be no surprise to me that, after all, the book of Matthew contains the story Jesus told about his birth. So, the "gospel story" in Matthew, written more than two hundred years after the birth of Jesus, contains a miracle story, a story of divine origin. Now, I am well aware that the Bible contains a number of other stories of divine origins, stories that do not necessarily have a Divine origin. But those stories do not contain the story the Bible is trying to tell. In order for the Bible to tell the story, it had to include a miracle. So what was a miracle? "To us, to see you, Jesus, is like a man who came to visit us; a man we have not seen before." That was the first miracle that God performed in Jesus' life. Jesus was the second one. And then he became the third. It has to be the third miracle in order for Jesus to be a unique being. The fourth one is the Resurrection. But not yet. So the Bible does not have a perfect answer. I hope that if you are trying to prove the divine origin of the stories in the Bible, if you read the Bible and try to find a miracle in it, you may be able to find it, but it may not be a miracle that we see in the story. And I hope you will agree that God's message of salvation to mankind, and the message he gives in the life of Jesus Christ, is not a simple miracle. It is a message of hope.

It is not simply another good novel about a black man that you have already read, this is a great novel about the people that came before him.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________________  I'm not sure what it is about this book that has drawn so many friends to it, but I can't get enough of it! I'm a fan of fantasy and the genre's more 'fantasy-ish' books (of which this is one) appeal to me. I've always loved the way Tolkien and King wrote their magic system and have been a huge fan of all things fantasy (with the exception of some other books), so when I saw a description of this book online and that it was written by a woman, I knew I had to get it and try it out. And I'm glad I did! This is the first book in the series and it's definitely going to get better. The writing style is a bit stilted in parts, but it is easy to read, so I don't think that's necessarily a problem. I'm hoping to continue reading this series as it progresses.  _______________________  One of the best reads I have ever had!!  And it's not even the writing that gets me, but how the story changes. In one of the beginning chapters, a character is walking through a forest and the trees are changing, trees moving in ways I'd never seen. The narrator does a wonderful job describing the changes. "The wind stirred the leaves like a child. They turned around like an unruly child, twisting and turning, shifting and swirling around him. They came out at different times, turning into each other, changing color as if changing their own patterns of life. There were leaves that grew down, and some up."  So amazing. And just as amazing as the magic system, which I've been reading about for years, but only now, reading a book where all this magic happens before the book even starts.  the narrator does that.  on the other hand, the magic is pretty complex and detailed. I was expecting it to be a bit slow at first because the characters weren't that complex and it was really hard to remember how things worked. but once they figure out how the magic works, it's all so nice and easy to figure out.  it's also quite a read. it's hard to put down once you start, and you're always curious to see how things will progress. And that is all I want in a fantasy series:  1. to see things from the perspective of the characters. . The whole thing is very

Write a positive review about a good book:  'Nuclear Waste' is a must-read on the dangers of a nuclear war, the risks of nuclear proliferation and its role in preventing war. The author is a distinguished physicist by profession. The book is an eye-opener for all who are in favor of peace. The evidence is so clear that one wonders why it has taken us so long to understand the risks and consequences of nuclear war. We are still living in the era of nuclear weapons, which is a very serious problem that is not being addressed properly. There is a real danger that the next nuclear war could lead to the spread of nuclear materials to all nations of the world. The effects of radiation can be very serious and are very different from what was believed in the past. Nuclear weapons are so lethal that they could end the human race as we know it. But now we have the scientific and technological capacity to build an atomic bomb in just a few weeks in order to eliminate our nuclear weapons as a threat. The war against terrorism should be a war against the nuclear threat, but unfortunately it is not. Nuclear warheads are so cheap that the only weapons of mass destruction they pose are to the nuclear nations themselves. It is high time to end nuclear weapons altogether. One should think about the consequences of a war with other countries. It will not be peaceful at all. If one considers the consequences that nuclear war has in mind, it is no longer surprising that the U.S. and Russia are not willing to agree on a political solution. Nuclear war will destroy mankind and it is high-time to end it. I am very grateful to my editor at the University Press of Kentucky, Dr. Frank E. H. Gakidou, for this book. This book is a great contribution for the global peace and justice movement. Thanks a lot for reading this book, I wish to thank my dear readers for the support and kind words. Please spread the word about the dangers and need for ending nuclear weapons forever, especially to the readers who have doubts about the danger and the need for a permanent peace in the world, particularly the young people.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________  This book has so much to teach us about the human condition. For example, I had just moved from Boston to the Bay Area when I found myself at a party where a couple of friends had been talking about how they had to work to pay for a house in Seattle. It made sense to me then that they had probably been living out of their car. Then, I started reading about them and how they tried to find ways to pay and then ended up in this awful situation. The author also takes us inside the lives of people who are at the extreme bottom of the social ladder, who are dealing with the psychological consequences of the life of poverty. I hope that this book is given to anyone that is currently struggling with paying the rent or living out their dream. If you are thinking about buying a house and are having trouble paying, this book should give you some ideas.
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the best books I've ever read! I learned a lot from it and will certainly use the concept when writing my own books.   By the way, the story is about the adventures of a young girl and her friends as they go out exploring in the woods. Her name is Willow. In this book I found her to be very brave, determined and strong-willed. I also love her friends, the twins, the boy named Finn, the girl named Ruby and her father's old friend. I don't have a problem with the author's use of different gender pronouns. The first girl is called Willow as well as she uses she as well. It is not at all like when a girl uses she and a boy uses him, only more masculine-feminine!  By Sarah  September 12, 2008

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was happy to read a review that mentioned that there would be a second volume to this book.  My wife and I are so glad that it has been.  I also enjoyed reading about the two characters who didn't get to do what they wanted.    A positive review.  I enjoyed the book. I read it with the Kindle version and it was very easy to read. It had a few problems that the Kindle had with the author.  It was a little long.  For me, a good story about a bad guy didn't last longer than one chapter.  But I had fun reading it. There were problems with the book that I had with it. It wasn't easy to understand why someone would not have done what they did.  The story wasn't interesting.    The writing wasn't well done, though.  One of the things that I found more annoying than the characters was the author's use of the word "it".  The sentence that I quoted in my review was "The little girl was about to say, 'It's really easy.'  When he didn't say anything, she said it out loud again.  He said, 'No. 'No.'  'I didn't mean it that way.  They're not the same.'  His voice was very strong, and when he didn not respond he sounded angry.  That was really annoying.  To me, it sounds like he was using the word 'it' as if it was a good thing.   "  This book was enjoyable.  This is a story that was short.  In addition, there were some problems that I saw in this book that made it a bit hard to read it. However, it was worth a read for fans of science fiction and fantasy.  
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- The book "Practical Programming: From The Ground Up" by Don Knuth is a must read for all programmers. This book teaches the theory behind the programming, and teaches you how to program in C with C++ and C#. Knuth doesn't use any C code, instead he shows you the actual code to help you learn how to use the program. I learned about all the major programming languages in a very short amount of time. I wish I'd read this book when I was in school, because it made the concepts seem more real and less theoretical. Also, there are tons of exercises, that are great for practice as well as learning. This is a great book to pick up for programming. :) 5 of 5 stars  Review by: J. R. Burt on March 10, 2012 :  This book is wonderful for anyone who wants to get into C++, C#, or any other programming language. It has lots of examples and exercises. The best part is that you get to use real code as you read, and the code is formatted in such a way that you can easily see exactly what is going on. This means that you know exactly how to write your own C++ or C# code, and this is an absolute necessity for a beginner. A lot of books will have all the answers, but this book will help you discover them in real time. It's an excellent book.  (review of free book)  Analysis of C++ by Stephen M. O'Grady. (2005) ISBN: 0-89744-018-2. A practical introduction to programming using C++. A great way to start learning the language.  "This book explains the theory of computer science so that the reader can get a practical understanding of how to develop a program and the benefits it provides" Review by: A.E. S. Lomax on May 04, 2006 : 1. This was a great introduction to C++ 2. It was very practical and easy to follow 3. You get to actually build C++ programs and see the result 4. There was lots of programming exercises that gave some very useful information 5. The exercises were very good, they helped me work on the concepts 6. It is not hard to understand, it explains everything 7. Great book!  I think Stephen O' Grady has done a great job on this book. He is a very good writer
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's an interesting read. I feel like the author could have made the characters more interesting if she had a better voice. I think it was all written in a somewhat generic way, and I feel that her voice is a bit boring and monotone, and doesn't really match the story at all. Still, I enjoyed the read. It's a pretty good book and well worth a read.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ An insightful and insightful book. I liked it quite a bit and it helps a lot. I also like the way that it is written. I was never an avid fan of the Bible, but there was some good bits, and the author did a good job of not making it all about the bad bits. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in God's word.   Helpful Bible Quotes: ------- 'I love a good argument.' -James 2:19, or something like that. If you disagree with me, make one, and if I do not answer it, I'll be your friend.   (Thanks for the good advice.)   I love my church because it has so many Bible verses for us to learn from.   I am going to be a preacher and hope to get my wife involved soon. What do we learn from the book of Ecclesiastes? Well, the bible is a book for people who like to have arguments.  , so it's not very useful to me. This book gives a lot of examples of how to write a persuasive book, and it was easy to read and understand. I think most people that buy this book will find some use for it and not have any objections, though I do agree that it could be better organized. The book is very clear in what the author is talking about, but I do believe that the author could have written the book a bit clearer.
Write a positive review about a good book: Â  I read this book as a high school freshman and as a college graduate. I thought it was brilliant. I think that this is not just a book on history; it is a book for all of us today. It tells us the stories of our past, the stories that define us, and the stories we can't quite live without.   If you have ever considered getting out of the rat race and becoming the life of the party, but have no idea where to start, then this is the book for you. It will give you a glimpse into the lives of some of our most legendary leaders. If you're a historian of America, you'll be fascinated with how our country was built from scratch and what is still necessary to be a successful leader today. If history is not your cup of tea, then you won't get all the meaning here, but you will get a good idea of what a leader should look like.  .... more notes Notes are private! recommender none votes 0 # times read 1 owned purchase location condition format Kindle Edition actions view (with text)  checkbox position cover title The Man in the High Castle (The Man In The High Castle) (2013) author Kobo, Peter isbn 1415924006 isbn13 9781415924003 asin num pages 393 pp avg rating 3.06 num ratings 16,860 Apatt's rating it was amazing my rating 1 of 5 stars2 of 5 Stars3 of 5Stars4 of 5stars5 of 5Star6 of 5 Star7 of 5 star8 of 5-stars9 of 5  🔥🔫🔤🔺🔨🔊🔩🔮🔯🔦🔧🔴🔡🔢🔣🔰🔾🔿🔒🔐🔓🔔🔜🔗🔘🔖🔛🔍🔌🔏🔆🔈🔇🔉🔁🔀🔄🔃🔋🔎🔕🔙🔚🔑🔲🔳🔸🔹🔻🔼🔽🔵🔶🔷🔭🔅🔪

My high school literature class had to spend an entire day reviewing the text because it was so long. I can see the impact that this book would have on the kids I taught in high school. This book is a valuable reminder for my students to be grateful for what they have to work with. It would be great to read more of John's writing in the future."

Write a positive review about a good book:  I had a tough time with this book. It is very short, just shy of the first half of the book. I had to read it on my own (no internet) and my comprehension was very limited. It was very easy to see what was wrong with the author's arguments, but it was so hard for me to read a book where the author is wrong and has to explain why, which is hard to do, so it was hard for the reader to understand the ideas, and when I think about it, it really makes you see where this book is going, which was to tell how to get rich quick with a real estate investment, and how to invest wisely. The first half was very dry and tedious, and the second half made up for it and made me like it.  There was nothing wrong with it at all, and I will most definitely buy this book again, and read the rest of it. Good book to read and learn from.  It has all the pieces I need to become a successful real estate investor, the basics I need and the stuff I need in between.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book really impressed me. It's one of those books where you can see the journey from beginning to end, from when you first read it to when you finish.

I'm still not sure how this book will be received in the future, but I'm glad I picked it up.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've listened to this book and so far I am still hooked. I love the story and the way it unfolds. This book made me want to explore every nook and cranny of the country. It is the most well crafted and well presented book that I have read in a while. The prose and the characters are both perfect. It does not feel like a romance in the slightest. It also does not make the reader fall in love with the main characters, but rather, fall in awe and respect. I would recommend this to anyone that loves the outdoors, history and travel. I know I am.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- -------------- --------------- This was my first ever introduction to the works of Dostoevsky, and for me, it was a very enlightening read. I didn't know anything about him, except that he was a writer of novels and that he had once been a member of the Bolshevik Party. I've come to learn that that isn't quite true, and so my introduction was a little bit strange to say the least. This was a good introduction, but not perfect as I'm not sure if I would have been able to understand what the author was saying if I had read all of the first two books of the trilogy before. There are some minor quibbles that I do have with this book. Firstly, I did not understand how the story progressed. For the first 3 books, the author stated in one of the preface pages, how he began the series with a murder, but didn't continue any further. It is a very important step, and I do believe he did take it, but I wasn't completely happy with it, because, as I have stated, I really just wanted to know what happened to Nikolai in the second book. I also found it very hard to believe that Dostoyevsky would kill the characters of Nikita and Anna while in hiding. I understand that Nikita is dead, but how did Anna find out? Also, the whole thing with Nikolai's wife and children is not explained well at all. I think I know where the whole family went and how it came about, but why do they all end up in a hotel with a dead mother, and Nikolai, and how did they die? I found it a little hard to understand how these family members were involved in this whole situation and I think that's the only thing I felt was missing from this book, that I don't know. The characters themselves were nice, and the prose was nice. It was an enjoyable read, I was able to relate to some of the characters because they were also the characters that I am a part of. All in all, I believe that this is a good read, and, for me that's enough to recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book. I am sure you are not the only one who was taken aback by the title of this book, but in my opinion, it has to be the best novel I have read in years.   I have read a lot of books on psychology, especially the ones about the nature of the mind, and how it works. In this book I really felt like I was in an immersive environment, one where the characters are immersed in their world. It has that atmosphere and I believe that it is the reason why people enjoyed the book so much.  . It was very clear that this book is not written to be a psychology textbook.   the author's goal was to make his readers feel as if they are in a world which had a lot more depth and dimension than our own.     The world and the characters in this book are extremely realistic and I think that this has to do with the setting. The characters are not just some cardboard cut out but are people who actually lived this life. That gave the readers an intimate feeling with the characters.   (the characters) were also quite real, as they are depicted as they were in their early twenties.   in my book I am going to say that I did like the characters, although sometimes they seemed a little too like a child's drawing. But when they started to grow up and the book progresses, the characters' development made more sense to me.  , if you like a psychological thriller or a psychological read that tells a good story, you will like this book.   I hope you will enjoy this novel as much as I did.  "A good book is one that keeps you thinking."   "What is important in life is not what is seen but what is not seen. That is the most important thing. You should live your life according to your heart, not according to what you see. It is as if you put the blindfold on your heart and then you find that you can see. The most important point is to live your heart. To live it by its own laws, its own compass, its way. Don't be a victim. This is a good life."  - Jean Paul Sartre

I found the plot rather unoriginal and repetitive, but I liked the idea of it. I like the idea that people are trying to get out of an evil government. I didn' think they'd ever come up with anything so ridiculously ridiculous. And the book was so well written. It just really stuck with me for the longest time.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* It's one of those books where you can't stop thinking about what you are reading, so I'm definitely going to re-read it in a couple of days. *****  "The best book I've ever read."   This is an excellent collection of non-fiction written by some very smart and insightful people about science. It's about the scientific method, the scientific process, science education, science communication, and science research, but it also includes interesting and sometimes amusing anecdotes and commentary from some of the best scientific minds of our time. As a physicist myself, I have a keen interest in science, but this book gave me a different perspective, as well as a more accessible way of looking at the world and the universe around us.   There are so many things to like about this book, from the historical aspects, to the humorous anecdotes, to how some of these stories have been interpreted over the years to describe things like the "gravitational constant" (in the 18th century), to the fact that our solar system was formed from the "big bang" that occurred 10 billion years ago. There are many other things to love, such as how scientists are usually considered "outcasts," even by their colleagues in other fields. The authors have written an excellent introduction to the science of the past, as we move into the present day.   the book is a little long and heavy at about 500 pages, but once you've read the introduction you'll have a much better idea of where these people are coming from, why they wrote the books, and what their personal journeys have been like.   and here's a bit about what this book contains:   * How "big" was the Big Bang?   One of the main topics covered in this book is the "Big Bang." The Big Bang is one of the key ideas in modern cosmology, and has been the subject of a lot of controversy over the last century. The big bang is described in the Book of Genesis in terms of a moment of time and space that existed almost at the beginning of time, in "pre-existent" matter, and then expanded and contracted rapidly. It is a very important idea, but the controversy over it has always been heated. The book covers the background of this debate, and discusses how the theories of various scientists of the 19th and 20th centuries try to explain the "explosion" of the universe.   is it really a bang
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Makers: How America Will Create the Innovators of the Future, by Steve Jobs, Thomas J. Watson, and a team of investors and entrepreneurs.    I have been searching for years for a good and easy to read book about Apple and the development of their products and their influence on our society.  When this book was finally published I had it in my library so I could start reading on the plane flight back to San Francisco.  The book starts with a timeline of Apple from the time of their first phone, the NeXT, through to the present day.    The timeline was broken down into five chapters each detailing a different aspect of Apple's life over the last decade.      It is a good look into how Apple came to be, from their early days of creating the first phone to their involvement in the Macintosh project and even the beginnings of iTunes.  To me the first chapter on Apple is one of the most important parts of the book.  It gives the reader a look into their minds and the ideas they had in the beginning and the reasons behind what they did to begin with.  The next chapter discusses the development and marketing of the iPod.  Again the chapters are broken down and I particularly liked this one.  At one point they showed their first iPhone with the original Lisa at the same time that Steve Jobs took the stage to talk about the first iPhone.  This was great and I think it shows the importance of the relationship between Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak from the very beginning of the company.  They also have this awesome video of the actual birth of the iPhone and the Apple logo from a few years before.  I learned a ton about the company, their products, and Steve's life and influence in this one chapter alone.  Once again, there is a lot to learn from reading this book.   The next section is a look at the Macintosh and the introduction to iPods and iTunes.   I found the chapter interesting because it looked at the creation of the Mac.  Although we are seeing that the current Mac is a major leap from the old Mac and the original Mac they do not say that the Mac will always have the same role in the computer industry.  We are seeing a change in the way computers are being used and they need to adapt to the changing needs of people in the next decade.    The chapter on iTunes was a bit confusing and it was hard to remember

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* This book is a real good read, it really shows how life is just an experience. I also like it the way it is written.   If you are a girl it makes you think what you should wear, if you like the boy, how much you should be talking, when and what you have to do to win his respect and you have no idea about the boy's life, how he treats his girlfriend(s), how he does not talk to you when you are at the beach, the reasons why he is so happy when he gets a great score on his test, how if you tell him you are going to bed you will wake up, how, if someone does not respect you enough and you dont show it or ask for it then you can get yourself hurt or lose it all... You will find everything that is important to a boy's world here. If you want to know how to talk with boys, it will be clear and funny.   I have a brother, who likes the same books and has read this book, with the same kind of jokes and stories but who does not like the story line.   the story was like a story, and had no real plot or anything, all it did is keep you interested in the book, and you get this feeling of mystery...   I am so glad that I read this and now I can have a lot of fun with the boys and what they are doing, because I have had some problems with my boys, and with myself because of my problems...

Write a positive review about a good book: ************* It was so good, so relaxing, so wonderful, that I feel the need to take three minutes here and there to remember this. I'm so sorry for the length of this review, but I must write it, for I can't believe it. I have to say that this is a book that deserves to be read and loved and enjoyed by everyone. The main character in this book is not just one person, she is a person who could take care of the entire world. If she were to leave this world with just her daughter, her world would be very small. But with her husband, who she has fallen in love with and the world she can love and do everything that's needed for... I'm not sure what the author would do in this case, but she does an amazing job with making her character believable and relatable. The book is filled with action, drama, romance, and it's also full of humor and the characters come to life. I read this book for about four months, and I never got bored or annoyed by this book, even though it was the first book I've ever read that involved an elderly person. This book is a wonderful read and I love it! I read the first part of this book in the beginning of my adult life and I feel like I have some memories from that time I've read it and I can feel so many things that this book had made me remember. I really feel so proud of myself that I had read this and I'm a huge fan of the author, and even more of the book. There is nothing more I can say to make the world of this story come alive and I will probably continue to read this story and I plan to read more in the series that is about to be released, but in the meantime, I will give it a five star review and if you like to read about interesting characters, you will definitely love this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________   "A classic in the history of psychological research"   by Jim McGarity   I'd read the book "The Paradox of Choice" many times before, and always loved the way it made me think and to feel. I found "The Illusion of Choice:" The Paradox of Free Will" to be just as great. But I'd been looking for a way to discuss it without getting bogged down in all the details. I think McGarity is wonderful at how he describes how the mind works. His examples of how different brain areas work together, the different ways they work with each other, and the various cognitive processes that take place in the brain are brilliant. As a writer, McGarity can be very descriptive in his descriptions, and is very easy to read.   A couple of problems, though. One, he often doesn't follow up his explanations and he does it in a very rushed and non-explanatory way. He would say, "you just know that your brain is telling you that you're not really free" only to have later on in the book go back and explain how the different parts of the brain worked together in such a way that the free choice was made without them being aware of the choice they were doing. I've heard authors talk about how a book "explains" something in the "hard way", and it's not the easiest way to explain things. It's also not always the best way to do it. I really appreciated McGarity's explanations here, and found his "hard" way of explaining to be most helpful, but I still found myself wanting to read the chapter to figure out how it worked in more detail.

He comes to earth to find a secret that can save earth.  I have read the other Crichtons, and so far I was very impressed with this one.    There is a lot to this one, especially in the first 3-4 books.  Crich ton is really into the concept of what a "perfect storm" will bring.  It was a good beginning for the story.  The story is pretty good, and this one was more difficult to get through because of the technical details.  However, the ending, the main character is on the way back to earth and they have to get into a huge spaceship.  This is where it starts to get good.  We see what the aliens had in mind for earth and how it will destroy the earth.
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________________________________________ (Sarasota, FL) - This book is really a good read. It teaches a lot about some really important aspects of life in general and gives some really good advice to people that are struggling to make their way in life and get themselves a good job or a place in a relationship. (Lancaster, PA) - I am a 28 year old female that is starting to learn to care for myself. I just started going to the gym and have been working on my strength and cardio. I found this book to be very enlightening to my fitness. I felt that I was getting all the information I needed to become more self-sufficient. I know that when I read it again, I will refer back to it often. I think this is the best workout book out there. (Crestwood, NY) - "Lifetime is the life long commitment that will prepare you for any situation and give you the power to succeed and enjoy every moment of your life to the fullest." (Hollywood, FL ) - I absolutely love this book. It helps people become more confident in all areas of life. This book helps them find their purpose in life in a positive way. (New York, NY ) - "The world is a tough and unpredictable place, but if you believe in your ability to survive it and become a stronger, more knowledgeable individual, then you can, and will, overcome anything. Life is too short to not take the steps you need to take to reach your full potential." - Jeff Goins, author of "The Road Less Traveled." (Tacoma, WA) - Jeff goes in-depth on the major reasons for why people fail in life. The information is well-presented and easy to understand. Jeff goes out of his way to say he is not a motivational speaker or a guru, and he makes this very clear in every chapter. He is not afraid to tell you if you're doing something wrong or if something is not working. (Santa Fe, NM) - Great book, it helps you understand how we become unhappy in our lives. I'm doing great. It was a bit difficult at first to understand, but after the first week of it, it was easy. I definitely recommend this book for anybody looking for ways to succeed. (Taos, NM ) - This is the only book I have found that gives an honest view of people that have failed at their goals and failed to achieve
Write a positive review about a good book:  A Very Special Book of Nonsense: The Greatest Hoax in History (Hoover, 2000) by Tom Wolfe is a must for anyone who likes to believe in the silliness of the absurd. The author's background is in literature, but his writing style is straight from the pages of the comic books of his childhood: hilarious, and utterly devoid of irony. Wolfe wrote this book after realizing that he had completely lost touch with reality as a teenager. He was also a huge fan of the science fiction of the 60s and 70s. As a result, the book is filled with science fiction cliches that we all know and love. Wolfe is very careful to avoid any actual science fiction content, and the fact that he even made up science fiction names to describe the science in this book speaks volumes of the author's contempt for this genre of science fiction. Wolfe uses all of these cliched sci-fi names and phrases without a second thought, and in so doing he creates a truly hilarious story. This book was a blast to read and I was left with a very happy feeling after I finished it. It was also an amazing way to learn about the real science behind the book I was reading at the time. The book is available on Amazon and in most bookstores and online. I also recently read a great history book about these "Nonsense Warlords". The book was fantastic and made me realize that it is all a part of the same genre, and they are all just one guy's attempts at satire. So you know, they all suck.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as a follow-up to  The Book of Mormon and was not disappointed in this one. The book does not focus on the Book of Lehi but focuses on the events that took place before Lehi's journey. It is a good start and should be read after reading the Book and after reading The Book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a really good book and very useful. The examples were very good. The content of the chapters was very good, as was the layout.

Can someone explain in simple terms what each chapter does?   Thank you for this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only negative thing I can say is that I did not understand how to start a new chapter...I just kept getting to the last page.   And I'm sure that if I did know it would have helped me in a few places.   a good read. Good job.   in this book you can read how a few people started their own companies after their university degrees, but they all ended up failing.  , this is really a great story, it gives insight of what people do when they have no real skills, because they have so much more time to try things. The main story, the one that most of the main characters follow, is about some entrepreneurs who had no clue how to operate a business, how to keep it going and how to manage it. They tried for a month and then they ran away without paying the rent. I'm really glad that we are seeing such stories. The book does not give us a real career advice but tells us how to handle situations in which we have no experience. In this way I also think that it was useful. In addition we see some people who became successful business people after they have been in the industry for long period of time and they all had the same mistakes to learn from.  ...
Write a positive review about a good book:  This was the first book I ever owned that allowed me to connect with the human race on a completely different level.   Review:  First off I must say, I was really not expecting to like this one.  I am not much of a horror fan at all, but I was looking forward to getting this book.  The book itself is a story that takes place in a small town in upstate New York, it focuses on a family.    My daughter and I decided to get into the book after we did a little research online.  After getting started, we were blown away by the story.  I do think it was well written.  The story is well written from the first line.    It was easy to see the story through the eyes of the characters and get attached to them.  They feel real.  It was nice to see a little bit of emotion from the characters.  This story also had action to it.  In fact, I really enjoyed the action of this book! I can see it being used for a family game at a kids camp or for any other type of outdoor activities. I found it so cool that I am sure it could be used to entertain and teach kids something about the world.  There was a little something for everyone.  Some people liked it, some didn't.  One thing that was great about this book was that it did not have gore in it. The only gore that was shown in this book came from the animals in the story (even though there were no humans).  I liked this book so much I did a quick review on Google Reader,  and got a response from the author.  He gave me an answer to a few questions and I had a great time reading the book. I know he is still working on his second book and I hope to see it out in the next few months. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  http://greatreads.com/review/show... I'm really happy with this book. It was hard for me to read this book for the first time because I've only seen the movie and I don't like the book. But then I realized it wasn't me that was the problem, but rather I'm just not a huge fan of the book, so this book is the perfect read for me.The book was interesting and the main character was really funny and charismatic. He had a lot to say and was a funny person to be around. He was funny to read about and it was good to know I'm not the only one that found this book funny. It also made it a lot easier to read and it is also quite short. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I really wish that the character of the narrator would have been more fleshed out. He just sounded like a typical guy, which made me wonder how much was the narrator's interpretation of what he experienced.Overall, I am so glad I chose this book to read, I was glad that I didn't have to pick it up from the library because I would have just ended up bored.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This was a great read. I was really looking forward to this book because I love writing but the author had me at an easy mode. The story flowed very well. If this were my favorite book, I would have read it again. I'm sure it will stay on my mind. My Favorite Things:    The cover was great, I liked the red on white color scheme. The color of the book is more of the red-orange and white combination. I liked that he wrote a bit of the story in the book.  I liked the idea of a person who is being forced to go through some terrible experience.   There was some things that made me cringe in this book but he explained it nicely.  The author wrote a great book and I really enjoyed reading it.

I have loved all of the books since, though I never knew what the title was about (I'm sure I read somewhere about the man who got the sun to shine by throwing a rock in the room). A fantastic book, great plot, and interesting characters, who are all different and unique in many ways. I highly recommend this one!

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ "A good, funny, good and very good read. It is a very good satire, a satire that has a good insight into society at large, but also on the world of the author, and at least partly because it is a satire, it is also a good social satire and a satire on the modern world. My favorite aspect is the ending of the book. It's really well done, I especially like the fact that it is not a complete waste of time. I wish it was longer, but it was a very enjoyable read." --The Reader
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** My father was a great gardener, I still remember the first time I saw a vine weeded properly, the first plant in the ground. I have always liked plants and I can always remember them and the first one I ever had was a little bush or shrub, I had to hold it down to water it. I also had a little sunflowers for most of my childhood. This book has a lot of great plants. I loved the small plants too, all of them I had growing up, all the flowers were beautiful, the only problem was when I had grown up the plants were so big I couldn't easily hold them down. I think they had to be moved from the garden to the patio. It took me a long time to get them all the way in the pot, but now they are all about 8 ft tall and growing nicely. ***********  Book reports don't come much better than this. It's like a guide to planting the right plants, growing well, keeping the roots well watered, using a weedkiller (just a suggestion, not a prescription, I didn't get it, but I'm sure some people will appreciate it). This is not a book on growing roses for us and what to plant in a garden, although it has those topics. It is a book for gardeners who are interested in a few good plants, and those interested in growing the right ones. My favorite sections are "How to Make a Garden Plan", "How do you know you have a flower in your garden?", "Plant Care: A Complete Guide" and "Plants in the Garden." This is for the hobby gardeners, those of us who like gardening and the plants that come with the hobby.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********** I really enjoyed this book. It is very short and to-the-point. There are no complicated characters, no complicated plot or mysteries, and I was able to understand the situation very easily. It was a fast read, but at the same time it had some interesting points and some great humor. It gives a very unique look on the military/civilians relationship, and is a very good first book in that series. *************

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've loved this book so far. I love all the characters, and I love the magic in the world.   It's easy to like a world that can turn its back on you,  and you have to find it, even though you have a name like "Lanfear", but even if you don't, it's still there and that's all that matters.  .  The magic is real enough, if the power isn't too much and we can believe in it, because of the way it's portrayed.   the author's worldbuilding is also so good.  , this book was my introduction to fantasy and the real story of the people of the world, that this world was not just created as a metaphor for what was happening in the real world and not just a fictional creation.     And, while the world may seem to have no place for humans, or animals and that all the human characters are only pawns in the game of survival that is being played out for all the other races, what I really liked, was the magic and the magic's connection to the other cultures.  - I had a lot of fun with the characters of Lain, and also with the main villain, Lanfear. She was a great character, and the author really created a character, that was totally different from what I knew about her, and that made me really interested to know more about her.   I enjoyed her story even more because she was so interesting and mysterious.   and, the book also had a nice little ending, and then the author did what I liked most in her books, that is, a twist!   There were a lot to like about this book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone, that enjoyed a good fantasy book.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________ What a great story! I loved this book! It is a great way to introduce kids to the alphabet and also to the history of the alphabet, especially for children with dyslexia. ___________________________________________ I am a parent and teacher of 7 children (1 in special education, 3 with dyscalculia) and I am grateful for this wonderful book that is available on this site and I'm sure it will be enjoyed by everyone who reads it. Thanks for your service to the community. You are a true American. __________________________________________________________________________ This is a must have. ______________________________ I LOVE this book _________________________ I have 3 boys with dysgraphia. When this book came out they were excited. It was a great tool to explain how the alphabet was created and to explain to them the process of changing letters so that we could see if they were actually working. The letters have to be read and the word must be spelled.   The alphabet was not created in a lab.    the book tells us that the alphabet is a work in progress.  The kids in this book are able to do their first word and that is the first thing they are learning.  Once the child starts reading the alphabet the child becomes a reader. This book provides lots of information to help kids to learn the alphabet but also to teach them the concept of reading and how to read to themselves.  It tells us what letters mean, how we can change letters and how the child would know if they are able or not able to read.    the book talks about when people invented the alphabet in the Middle Ages, the idea was that there were many different languages and the alphabet made it easier to read in other languages.  and then they invented the letters to make it easier for everyone to understand all the words.  But as I say it all is explained to the kids using fun and interesting pictures that help the children to get the picture of how letters can change. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The God Who Weeps  by A. C. Grayling  I found this book to be a powerful reminder that the world we live in today is not the only one of its kind. It's also not the best of its type. If this is your first read about the God of the Bible I strongly recommend this book. It is a powerful introduction to the God's story and his relationship with man.    This book is available at amazon, amazon.com, and iBooks.   Read on at your own risk, though. I'll warn you now. I didn't like this book very much. The book begins with the tale of Moses, one of the most famous figures in the Bible, and the creation of the Hebrew people. Moses is a man with a good heart, but he finds himself embroiled in political intrigues that threaten his kingdom. One of these men was Sisera, and he had a plan to unite the nations of the world under his own kingdom. The story goes that he used the power of the stars to create a giant sun, which in the time of Moses and the Israelites, would be the sun of the whole earth. A story that I will leave for a future blog post. It wasn't long after Moses returned to his home that Siser a.k.a. Baal took over his kingdom, but this did not happen without the opposition of the Israelite's king, Joshua.  The book of Joshua begins with a warning to all of his people, "Now, behold, I am against you; I am king over you; and I have killed your prophets, both small and great. And now do you remember the things that I commanded you to do, when I came out of the land of Egypt to you, to circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and to make you swear not by my name, but to do the commandments which I commanded Moses your father, and which he commanded your fathers to do" (Joshua 6:13-14). What he told his people was that they had a new King, but if they did not obey, they would all die.  He continues to warn them not to forget what the Lord had taught them. He said that they could do nothing that he would not do, and that he had the authority to kill them all ( Joshua 6:14-16 ). The book is a story of good and evil, good and bad,

Write a positive review about a good book: ________________________________________________________________________________  I read the book on a plane, I read it in an airport. I read the whole thing, at least that part that interested me, and I enjoyed the book. The best part of it, I think, was that I understood the problem. I could see what was at stake. It wasn't as though I was making fun of any one class of person. It was that the whole system was broken. I saw that when a man gets laid off from his job, he must go get a job at another company that is no more secure. He is now at risk of losing his benefits. I see it in the plight of the long-term unemployed: if they're unemployed for too long, their benefits might be cut off, too. It's not just a single problem that needs fixing. It is a whole system, an entire culture. It needs to be fixed, but the time to do it is not now, it's not in the future, it is in the present, and it's possible to do something about it.  The author, David Brooks, explains this in a chapter called "Stagnation" in which he explains how there are no more jobs, and that the system we have to live in is broken and is going to require a major overhaul. He explains how this is true for the middle class, the working class, and the poor, for the poor in the South, the West, the Northeast, and everywhere in between.  the book has an argument, I thought, but it's in the middle of his chapters.   the book has a point that has to be made and needs to been made.   a book has to say something about the way the system works and it can't just tell you that something's wrong and that you're stupid and that there are good people who are trying to do things the right way and the other bad people who don't want you to try to do anything right. This book's main argument is that the rich and poor are all in it together, they're all in this together, and you have to try and do the best for everyone.  ... it is the rich people who have to be involved in the change, to help the poor get out of it.  ... I got my first real job out of college. I had to get a college degree. That was the first thing I went out and did when I got out of
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was quite surprised by this one. I was expecting a bit of a slog. Instead I really enjoyed it and found it fun. I think that it was probably one of the best books I have read so far this year.   In my experience, I have found that if I'm going to read a book, I usually read a novel. But for some reason I wasn't expecting to like this one much. I've never really loved Harry Potter. I really liked the first three books, but after the fourth book I didn't care for the series as a whole.   be warned though if you are a fan of the Potter books, or if you haven't read any of the series, I would recommend this one first.     As I said in the beginning, Harry was the main character. He was the first character that I was interested in. I didn´t understand a lot of the lore in the books, and in my opinion the series was pretty cliche.  :)   And now, for some spoilers!   It wasn´t until I read the first chapter that I noticed how much the plot diverges from the rest of the novels. I thought that the books are similar. This book however is different, it was so different from the other books that it shocked me a bit.   at this point I don't know how much more spoilers I can contain.  ,

Write a positive review about a good book:..........................................  "A great little novel... This book is just a great read and shows that there is a difference between fiction and reality.   This novel takes place in an alternate world where all human and magical beings have evolved into a humanoid race called the Krik. We follow a boy named Kael who is in the middle of the first Krik invasion. The Krik were once a nomadic tribe with a strong sense of honor and honor killings are not allowed.  , Kael's best friend was killed and he wants revenge. In this new world all Krik are treated as equals and Kael starts to find himself in the midst of conflict.   the story is told through a number of chapters in which we meet and meet some other characters. As I mentioned before there are some very short chapters so I don't really have to pause to keep reading.   I really liked the way the characters interacted and interacted with each other. As Kael discovers the war he starts to get conflicted as he realizes that he is part of a battle he is fighting but he is not making any sacrifices.    In my opinion, the book has some very interesting ideas and interesting ideas about gender roles and human evolution. There is no doubt that Kael is a very well developed character.   was one of the more fun read I've had in a long time.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author does a good job of giving a general background of the people in the story. He shows how they have come to be who they are and how they deal with that. He does a great job of showing the characters and their flaws and how those flaws are sometimes the very reasons they do the things they do.   This is a really well done story with a good character, a few great twists and a nice ending. Highly recommended for any fan of the Harry Potter series or the series in general.
Write a positive review about a good book:...............................................  This book is a wonderful story of a real girl.  I really liked the plot and that it was told from the perspective of a little girl. The only thing that was a little annoying was the fact that the book kept getting interrupted by a new story about another girl who was "just like her". At times it seemed like she had been written off as an imaginary character from another book because of the age difference. The author, a woman, told us how she felt about the other character and her sister but kept giving us another character and we had to move on with the story. Then she introduced us to another character, a boy, and we just moved along.

"The book is great, and I loved it." - D.C. "This book is an inspiration. It points out how the systems in place, that are supposed to be there to protect us, actually have the opposite effect. And what that means is, in the end, we don't really have any protection. What it also means is that we should all be accountable. I have the same book, the one by John McPhee, called What Are You Worth? It is another great book, that looks at the financial status of people in the U.S. and the U the other side of the globe. McPhewes book also points out that money can be the most powerful weapon in the hands of the very poor, because they know that if they do not have money, they cannot get the medical care or food they need. They know that they are in debt. They are dependent on government benefits, and if they stop paying those benefits, that's when they will find themselves in jail, or worse. This little book, by the way, was my favorite for Christmas." - A.D. "The author is a genius and is one of the few authors that is actually doing something right. He is always thinking of new ways to mess up people's lives. There is an entire chapter on why people get divorced, and why people need to be told that their
Write a positive review about a good book: ******************This is a good read. I'm just beginning a new year, and I enjoyed it immensely. I did not expect to like it as much as I did, but after finishing it, it is clear to me how well-done the author has been with the plot, the characters, and the dialogue.I don't recommend this book for new readers, but I think it's a good choice for anyone who enjoys good books. I found it to be the second-best book of the series.
Write a positive review about a good book: ******** The "The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland to Escape Her Father's Shadow" was fantastic. It was a delightful little book, and is a perfect way to start our Christmas tradition. I have yet to find any better book to start with my family before Christmas. I had to read it in one sitting since I was so absorbed by it. You need to get a copy for the whole family! I love all the characters and their interaction. I love how they all fit in to each other's lives. I also loved the ending. This is my favorite book of the year. The author writes as if she's a good friend and I'm sorry but my kids really enjoyed this book! 5 stars for sure."  "I read this book during Christmas break this year with my 7 year old. The story is the basis for the book. The girls have been having these battles of who is best and then their parents show up to take them to see the fairy king who is being held captive in the forest. The princesses save the king and then the girls decide to keep the princesses from rescuing him. I read the book together with my son, who also had trouble understanding the princess's dilemma. We ended up reading the book to our sons in the living room before bed one night. Our children were so fascinated by the story and wanted to tell me what they thought of it. I highly recommend this book."  thepamela.com   "This book has been on my wish list for a while. I finally got it, but I wasn't expecting such an amazing book! The princess in the book has such a strong personality and she never lets anyone get to her. She takes care of her friends and gets along with everyone. She's the only one who is able to figure out how to get out of that mountain that is so high up. It takes so much courage and bravery for this girl to get up there, even with all the odds against her. I've seen the movie before, but there was no way I would want to go see that movie when I had been waiting for this book to be published! I am a huge Disney fan, so when I got the email from the author that it was published, I knew it was going to be the perfect gift for my son! I don't even want to give the book away because I'm so excited to read that book. Thanks so much for writing a story about a girl
Write a positive review about a good book: Â  I was reading "The Red and the Black" by E. Nesbit when the first mention of the "White Witch" caught my attention. I've never read a book with such a powerful, if not frightening, plotline. Â The description of the White Witch, one of the great monsters, gave me chills and was quite scary at times.  She is a dark goddess, not unlike the Dark Queen from "Frankenstein" or the Red Skull from "Avengers". Â She uses her own child as a sacrifice, as well as the children of other people (including humans). Â There's more to this story that meets the eye.  
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I really enjoyed this book and i like how it tells about real situations, so i can read it as a history. But this time i have read it from the other side (from the perspective of the other guy). It is also nice to know that sometimes the story does not go in the same way, and it gives you a little different feeling about it.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________   "The story of our firstborn son, Henry Henry. Our first child, we could not know that he would be the one, who would lead us on our life's journey. His birth was a miracle, but it was not a happy one. He was born with spina bifida, a birth defect of the spine. The doctors told us that we must give our son to the hospital right away and they would make an emergency surgery. The surgery was successful and he lived. But Henry Henry has never been the same. We have struggled with every day since he was born. We could not work. We struggled to find work for our family and found that he was the one who took care of everything for our household. But we have struggled also with Henry Henry's disabilities. He cannot walk and his arms and legs do not work properly. But there is another problem which is hard to believe, but which we had to face. We had to decide what to do with our first born son after he passed away. And we took our decision into consideration what he would like and the wishes of his father and my husband. We decided that we will raise Henry Henry as we want to be raised. And from now on, Henry can live a life as we believe he wants. We want him to live the way he loves. And if we do not fulfill this wish, then we will not be able to go through our life without feeling pain. But this is what we want for Henry Henry."
Write a positive review about a good book: *********************** I really enjoyed this book, and I wish I had this book when I was growing up. For one thing, it is funny! My kids have enjoyed this as well. There is so much in it that you will love. For example, this book gives the facts about how to survive in the wild, and how to deal with predators. There are so many details in this book! There are also many wonderful, humorous stories about how these animals behave when they are hunting. For the one thing about this book that is a big disappointment, I do not think I could take a chance on this book getting wet. It seems like it was written to be eaten, not to be read! So it is a little disappointing, but I hope this is not a common feeling for everyone. In my opinion, it should not be taken seriously if it is not suitable for the youngest readers. I found this book very informative. However, when it comes to kids' books, there is usually some "magic" in there. This book had nothing. But I am sure that the next book in this series will be better, and that the kids will love it! *****************************

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I bought this book because the authors suggested it, and I have to say that I'm impressed! The book does not only introduce many interesting topics about the human condition, but it also delves deep into the psychology of how a person behaves in certain situations. The authors of the book actually put great effort in the preparation of the manuscript, and so I'm definitely pleased to have purchased this book. I'm also really happy that the book is available in several languages. --------------- Overall, the book provides a wonderful overview of the concept of "emotional contagion". What it is and why it works, as well as how it affects us in the long run. I was really surprised and excited when I finished reading it, especially since I'm an avid reader of psychological research.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book. It is written in a clear way, with a lot of good insights. I found it a bit difficult to follow at times, but I could work it out and I got the point. I got a lot out of it. I'll be looking at it again, hopefully by next year. I was disappointed by the amount of time this book is spent on how you get good at tennis. It's not a bad idea, but the book is so long, it takes me a while to work through the tennis lessons. It was a bit confusing to get my head around this.  So, for someone like me who has never played tennis, I was a little disappointed by that.   If you're on the fence about buying the book, I think you might find this review helpful, I got my copy from Amazon.  Read this book on Amazon:

Write a positive review about a good book:..............................................  This is a very good book.  It is very well written, I highly recommend it.  I have read so many books on the subject, and so many good ones, that I am now looking for something else to read. This book is very good.   It covers the basics of the matter as I understand it, and I will try to explain it briefly. -1. A single atom is composed of four quarks and one antiquark. .  the quarks are held together by a strong force, which allows them to pass through each other, and from one to the other. It does not matter how the quark and antiquark are arranged, if they are arranged close enough to each other that they can be brought into contact with each other and then brought back out again, they will be stable and stable together.  The other three forces that help maintain the stability of an atom are nuclear force, electromagnetic force, and strong nuclear force.  and I have never thought of the first two forces as being the forces that hold a atom together. Nuclear force is basically what is needed to allow the protons and neutrons to form the nuclei of the atoms, the other two are the forces needed to keep the proton and neutron together. They are not the force that is holding the atom together, they are only necessary to move it along the path from a sub-atomic to the atomic level. We would think that strong nuclear forces are the ones that hold an atom together because they are very strong forces. In fact, we have learned from the decay of radioactive substances, that a particle such as a proton is made of about the same number of protons, neutrons, and electrons as are in the atomic nuclei. What is more, when a particle is hit with a powerful magnetic field, or a large current flowing through the system, it can sometimes be separated from the rest of the particle and then be observed to be moving, which is called a "brief flash" that does not last long. Now if the atom is moving about, it is moving with the direction of the magnetic field or current, and is very sensitive to the direction it is travelling in. If the magnetic and current forces are very weak, the atom will not be able to resist the pull of the field or currents, and may fall apart. This is a sign that the atom may have gone unstable, as

I definitely recommend it. —C.C., Virginia  Title: _____________________________ The Art of War in Ancient Greece and Rome Author: _______ (no first name given) Preface: _________________ This text is a detailed and well-researched survey of ancient warfare, both Greek and Roman. It makes excellent use of the available evidence, and is highly informative, but it also provides interesting and sometimes surprising new data which is of interest. __________ The Art's most interesting and important discovery is a new, long-hidden system of Greek warfare. ________________________________________ The text is written in a highly readable and easily read style, which is an important feature of this book. ___________________ The book is generally well-written, easy to read and full of interesting data. __________________________________________________________________  Review: _____ This book covers a large swath of the ancient world. It does it well, providing the historical context for the wars and politics that took place, and what the various armies, military leaders and politicians were thinking and doing in their efforts to survive and eventually achieve dominance over the ancient peoples. There are no major errors, but there is some bias and some lack of attention to historical details. There is an excellent chapter on the Byzantine Empire, but the discussion in that chapter is just a bit too broad and generalized in focus. _______ is an experienced professional, and in this book, he covers every single aspect of warfare and its development in the ancient and medieval worlds. ________________________ The book covers topics from the Greek and Latin civilizations (the Peloponnesian War, Alexander the Great), the Arab-Persian Wars, the Peloponeian War (Greece), the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Byzantine-Byzantine wars, and wars with the Arabs. ______ I enjoyed this book greatly, and would recommend it to anybody interested in warfare in the past and in the present. ____ ____________  Author's note:  I'm posting this review in part as a thank-you to Dr. S.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I read it at my local library. I'm not good with books so I had no idea what I was going to like about it. But it turned out to be a good read. It reminded me of some of the old stuff I like about comics. It's a great story. It has a nice mix of humor and drama. It just wasn't a great read by itself. But that was okay with me because I can read it again and get something out of it. It was an okay read. Not one I will reread to get more out of a story. So in the end, it's okay. And it has a good story.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- *I've recently been re-reading this book with some interest* I can't remember where I read this book, and how, but it was somewhere in the 90's or 00's. I had never heard of this author and was rather surprised when I stumbled across her name after searching around on the Net. The book was called "My Love Affair with the Vampire" and was published in the late 80's. My first thought upon reading it was that the author was a bit pretentious, but I was very impressed with her ability to write. I have since come across the second book, "A Vampire's Kiss" by Ann Sowards and she was much better written. This was also a sequel to "My love affair with the vampire" and it was a very good one, too. I found that "My Loved One is Dead and Gone" was another good book to read from the vampire perspective, although it may have had a bit more mystery to it than other vampire books I have read. Overall, a very fun read from a very entertaining author. It didn't bother me that much as I enjoyed it from beginning to end.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Book of the New Sun is a solid, well-written, and well-thought out novel. The book is fast-paced and fun to read, and the world and the characters are very interesting. The only complaint I can have is that I was not sure if the author intended that some of the people in the book were supposed to be the main character's siblings. If anyone is wondering where the main villain's name is, it's actually the villain of the last book.  If anyone wants a good story with a good twist and twist ending, I definitely recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "What was more compelling than the actual story, was the book's style and narrative structure. Each chapter follows a certain format, and each chapter builds upon the last. I don't know what makes a good story, but I think a good author can pick it. The structure is very easy to follow and the author creates an interesting world that makes it easy to connect to. The story is not short, and it will make you think."
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________   The world is changing and the time for the good guys has come. It's hard to be good but easy to get lost. I found this book while on vacation in Alaska and it was the perfect escape from the cold, the snow and the snowbirds.   There is an interesting theory that if you look at the world through a black lens, you will see the truth. That's the world we're in right now, with the world wide web and the new world order. I think that the good guy was one of those new guys, a man who found out what was in the darkness. It just so happens that his is a darker path than most of us take.  , John J. O'Rourke, New York, 1999 (ISBN 0-670-71957-7), is a great read. It does take you into some dark places, but the way he does it and the way we deal with it is an example of how we can use our dark side to find our way.   in other words, a dark path could just as well be a dark lens, it is the way our life is made and if we choose to put our light in the black instead of the white, the world will shine through the lens and change us for the better. In the end, the good news is that we are a better people for having faced our truth.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** You can never have enough books about cars, and I was particularly pleased with this one. I loved the little history bits and the way the author explained things in a very logical fashion. It's a great little read! Review : ********** This book covers a vast amount of information about the car industry, but the main focus is on the Ford and Chevrolet franchises. This is a really helpful reference on a topic that is not covered in detail elsewhere. If you want to learn more about these two franchises in general, then this is the book for you! I think it may even have been helpful to a younger me, when I was first starting out. I'm looking forward to my next trip to the local Ford Dealership, and maybe I'll learn something I didn't know before. *** I really can't say enough good things about this book. ******** *** This book has been a great learning experience for me. ************ *** You should have this book at your desk and will appreciate the work put into it. **************** If you don't already own this book, I highly recommend you buy it. I've already recommended it to people I work with who may be thinking about a career in the auto industry. I don't think it would be a bad idea to have a copy at work. I will definitely continue to recommend this book to everyone I know in the automotive industry. For more information about this and my other books, visit my Book Recommendations Page

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has brought me a lot of joy, I'm reading it very slowly, I am really enjoying this book I'm having great fun reading. I'm going to try and get through it now   I am a person of colour and I have read a lot in the book and have enjoyed them all. But this book was great, and really made me enjoy what I was reading.   The book is about the life of a black boy growing up in the ghetto and his journey to college. It's interesting to see how different race is. I was born and raised in Canada, which is one of the safest countries in the world. But I had to go to school in a community that was very dangerous. There is a lot happening around me and there are some very strong black men who think I'm not worth what I am. The book is very sensitive about race but it doesn't mean there isn't the black male in the story. It is very rare to read a book about the black experience and how it affects white America. It can also be very hard for people to comprehend and see it. It was interesting reading.  12 of 13 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:    "Till then I have never been so deeply in love."   What a great book! The most wonderful and moving book I've read! It made me feel all the way. It made it possible to feel all I wanted to feel. It gave me courage to try, because it was there. It helped me to be better to myself, because I know that it is hard for me, and I am very insecure.   It helped me not to be angry at my own weakness, for the way it affects my relationships and my own life. For me, it became an important part of the journey of being a human being.     I don't know how else to describe it. There are no words. It is not the same as books like my first book I read about being in a relationship with a boy who was born into poverty in America. Or the story of the man who left his home in America to become a refugee in Turkey, and who later married and had two daughters. They are beautiful, and beautiful things, because they show a life, a journey and a way of living that is not normal, and is not easy. They show a way to live, a path to life.   the words that have been said so eloquently and deeply by this author in this book are like the life-giving essence of the Holy Spirit.   of course I am not a spiritual person, but this book has changed my life so much, and it has taught me so much. I am now trying to learn more about spirituality and the way I feel about it. I cannot stop reading this book! It is a wonderful gift for every human being, every age, every culture and every religion. I'm so thankful to the author of this book for making this book so easy to read, so easy for me to understand, so important.  , April 9, 2012I love this book. This is a book that makes me cry with emotion every single time I read it.I think the book is important because the author is a very compassionate human being and she has a lot to say about human life. I agree with her about the way we are taught, by our parents, to feel about life, our family, ourselves, our life choices. I think that the way to avoid being so critical of our parents is to be as positive and open-minded as possible. I wish that my parents had been more open- minded about life as

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- As an avid reader I was excited to get my hands on a hard copy of this to read for a change! This book has a very interesting story line which really kept my interest and it was definitely a fun read. I think it was written as the story of a man who had gone to the end of the world in an attempt to find out the secrets of the Earth. He had become very ill and it seemed that death was his only hope. I do believe it's an interesting book and it will get your interest and bring you on a journey as I did. I loved it! Recommended By: Chris A. Rating: 5 of 5 Stars. The only thing I didn't like was that there were a few things which were just not very well written. Other than that the book was good.  I was very pleased that I ordered the Hardcover copy. I read the book about 5 years ago in high school in the summer before my senior year of high school. It was the first time I had read any sci-fi. The story was very well thought out, and the characters were all real and not just made up. I enjoyed the book immensely. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an exciting read!

Write a positive review about a good book:    "What a delightful story... I found myself laughing out loud at the end... I would love to hear this story told to young kids. I've been thinking about this book for some time, and finally decided to take a chance and read it. It's definitely worth a read and I can't wait for my daughter to read it for her bedtime story."   "... I've always liked these kinds of stories where, instead of going through the motions of going from point A to point B, we have to travel to unexpected places, and we have new experiences to share with the ones we love. I'm also interested in the science of the book: the animals' reactions are very interesting, as are the reactions of the humans as we follow them through different experiences, and the stories they tell, as they learn how to behave around others and their own reactions to change."   to the end of this book, you'll realize that it is a great read that is a little on the lighter side, and has plenty of laughter along the way, but also has something to say about people and their interactions with others and the natural world. I especially loved how the story ended, which was a nice surprise. This book was really good for me, I think.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I can understand the motivation to give this book a try.  This is the first book I've read by a former CIA officer and I was interested in his theory of "strategic realism".  The first part is excellent, and he makes an excellent case.   The theory is not new, but it was presented in an interesting way, without being too bogged down in the details.  The last part is a little dull, but if I had to read more about that aspect of the theory, I'd pick it up anyway.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book, at least as a reader, was very well done. A good balance of narrative, historical analysis, and humour. What was said:   I loved the book, because the author is not afraid to use her own history to draw a comparison between the current state of Canada and the past. She used the first World War to discuss the current situation in which we are still caught up.   She also used the First World War in her next book on Canada and Quebec (  The Lost Nation )   This book has some flaws but it's good, and I have to agree with one of the reviews, it's the only book I have read that has both historical and fictional aspects, and that is why I gave it four stars.

This is a very helpful resource that would be a great addition to anyone's computer security library.
Write a positive review about a good book:  In this book you will learn about all aspects of your body including the genitals, skin, lymphatic system, urinary system, reproductive system, and the endocrine system, how your body functions in all aspects, and some of the issues that arise and how you can handle them.  If you are looking for the "best" guide to human sexuality I highly recommend this book.

I really enjoyed that I was able to see how the books started and it's just an incredibly enjoyable reading experience. It was a good way to discover what you'll like about the series.
Write a positive review about a good book: Â   I read this book back in 2004 and the premise had me intrigued. It was a mix of both science fiction and fantasy.   The book had a very interesting character. There are a number of different characters who have a role to play, or a desire to play an important role. It's one of those books I don't want to put down and will pick up in the future.  -Michael D., The Goodreads Reviewer   There are a lot of stories about the last days of the old gods, how they were destroyed by the people, and what their replacement was supposed to be like. The story I  I have to agree that the author is brilliant.  The story I read here is really an adventure story about a hero, who is in search for the legendary treasures. There is a lot about history behind this story and we can imagine that the writer had a lot more fun writing it than we had.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********"I've had the pleasure of reading 'The Book Thief' for the first time and I had to re-read it twice, and was pleasantly surprised. I don't have much experience with books, but I think it's a pretty fun read. The book is a very entertaining read and there are enough twists and turns and unexpected characters to keep you thinking and guessing all the way to the end.   The first few chapters of the book were a little bit slow, but it's understandable considering the length of the novel, but the characters in the beginning got their own back, the plot was exciting, and it all worked together in a nice way.  , one of the main characters, is very smart and witty and I really liked him as he had a lot of laughs and was a very good narrator.   the other characters are interesting as well and are well written with their own quirks and unique personalities.   and the ending was satisfying, as expected, and I'm looking forward to reading more.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________This is the best book I have ever read on writing. In it, Ransom Riggs and I cover a huge variety of material. From what I read of Ransom's writing it appears that his method is to start with a blank page and then write a couple sentences. Then he writes another few sentences, etc. This process is repeated, and in the end the book consists of about 70,000 words or more. I had a problem with some of the first couple sentences I read because Ransom had not provided enough information about the topics covered. However, once I got the basic information about writing and the three elements of composition, I started writing again. I recommend this book to any writer looking for an effective system for how to write a manuscript." -M.G.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* If you like this book, you're going to love the series! I've read all of the books. I've always been able to put all the books on my shelf in order of release. There's always something new on the horizon in the books! The world of A Wrinkle In Time is full of mystery and excitement and romance and drama. This is my favorite book series and I'm looking forward to the next book. This series is not for the faint of heart. There are some rough spots at the beginning of the series. The characters are so different from one another. They are different ages, different backgrounds and are all so unique. This book is one for the lovers of books and people with a need for variety. This trilogy is so enjoyable to read I hope you will continue on for the last book! Thank you so much for sharing the A Wrinkled Universe and I hope it's not too long before you all can get this book.  My thoughts: This was a solid, well-told story. I was glad to finally see the story of how and why A Wr  This was a strong story but I'm not as satisfied with it as I had been expecting. A Wrinking Universe is a series, so the end of the first book will give you a sense of closure for this series. But, for now, I will have to wait for the final book to get my fix. There is no real "plot twist" that I can see as a reason for the ending. The ending was a nice surprise.   I enjoyed the characters as they interacted and changed. Their actions were understandable and they were not so obviously evil or heroic. The main character was a young boy named A.J., the only person we ever really get to see change. He is smart, thoughtful, strong, determined, and a good friend. He's also a "nerdy" boy but he's so smart that he can pick up on what's happening around him without much effort. He does not like to do what others expect of him. He wants to do things his own way, and he always tries to do the right thing.  , a little girl, who was taken by a time storm and put into A Writting Universe.

There was nothing about Jesus that was inaccurate, just the things you can learn about the Bible without Jesus (or the Gospel of John). It was very interesting. I thought it was very important to learn the true teachings about God the Father and Jesus Christ in order to have a good relationship with God and others. I recommend this book to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book! The concept is interesting, the history is interesting. I was really glad that I read this. It really brought out my love of the past.   This book is good for people who love history and the historical side of things. I think it's a good idea for anyone who wants to know more about the people and the places that shaped the world in the 1800's and 1900's. This book also has a lot of good stories to tell. You don't need to know anything in particular about this time period, but this book is a good place to start.   of the stories in the book, I liked most the ones about how people interacted with each other during the time period. Also, the books about the different types of people are great to read because it gives you a good sense of what these people were like.  , I think that the book should also be a bit of a warning to people, as it can be a little slow and if you have a low tolerance for slow reading, you might not be able to get into it. This is true of a lot historical novels. There is not much romance in the story, but the history, and the descriptions of how people lived are very good. The best thing about the story is that it doesn't end on a happy note. It's hard to tell how this book ended, but I'm pretty sure that it ended on a very sad note. This happens a lot when people leave the past behind and move on. The book is very sad. Also it's very important to mention that this is the second book in a series, so you could read all of these books.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________  "I don't recommend the book, but I have found a couple of things useful. I wish I had known about the Möbius strip by Alan Brenner and how useful it is. My son's friend loves the book and is using it to teach the basic science concepts to kids in elementary school. It is well done and is easy to understand. I also thought it would be useful if he read this book first because he doesn't understand much about anything."   Review for the second edition: _______________________________________________________   This second edition is a solid read. It really does introduce the concept of the Mörner strip and covers the concept well. The author uses a lot of illustrations, mostly of the same colors, to help explain the concept. The book really does get students to think about these little abstract forms.  I thought the introduction to the book was a nice touch. The discussion about the color of the cube, for example, got students excited about the concept and got them working on a little puzzle. The next day they got some more material that had them using the cube to solve this puzzle. It's nice to see how well concepts are explained.  of the book for free, with attribution for the concept, not for the illustration.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ When reading, I found myself continually looking at the cover as I read the book. From the beginning to the end of the book, the cover, by J.

It fits in the genre, and the art and graphics are well thought out. The writing and story were well done and captivated me throughout. I hope you enjoy this book.

It is not so much the plot that keeps you hooked, but more so, the characters. These are characters that you are interested in. You want to know what they think about the world around them, you want to see how they respond to things.  "But what is it that makes them do what they do? Is it an inborn desire to be the best, to live the way they do?" It is interesting to think about.  -The "Great Unrest of America"   This book is filled with wonderful thoughts, which are really what makes this book. The world, the history, the ideas, and the people all make you think.  .

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I'm so excited to get started with this book. I've just finished reading it, and I'm still working on getting my brain wrapped around the concepts, but it was a fun and enjoyable read." --Carol P., Boston, MA   Reviewers have commented on the ease with which this book helps the reader understand mathematics and its applications. "This book is the best of the ones I've read. The text is clear, easy to understand, and very accessible to the lay reader. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in mathematics." --Stephen S.   This book was a pleasant surprise to me. When I started reading it I was a bit puzzled by the title, but by the end of it I knew it would help me with my future education. The book is a great read with many examples. It's well organized, easy and straightforward to follow. It is easy to follow with or without diagrams. The author, who seems to have a lot of experience teaching mathematics, makes many points very clearly, and he does it in a non-technical, easy-to-understand way. It takes a bit of reading to find the topics, and the text isn't easy to navigate, but you won't regret learning it.   was a pleasantly surprised by the author's explanation of the relationship between the concepts in the text and real-world examples. After he explained the concepts to me, it was easy to see how these same concepts would apply to real-life problems in a math class. I found the examples helpful in understanding the concepts and in making connections between them. I was pleasantly surprised, by the explanations the author provides, how many concepts would actually apply to many of the examples. I'm definitely going to buy this book in the future and recommend it to my friends and family. The only thing I would change is to have the chapter on the quadratic equation before the chapters on the plane and the integers. Maybe that would be an improvement.
Write a positive review about a good book:  Goodnight Moon by David Sedaris A few people have commented on my previous review of Goodnight Moon, and one of them was Michael Shermer. His comment was: "I know David Seders is a conspiracy theorist.  And I don't blame him.   But when he starts writing about people who are more likely to get eaten by sharks than to have a good night's sleep--well, you're either a conspiracy nut or an ass."  I am also a conspiracy nuts, but I like his book as well.  What I like about it is the way David Sedar's prose has a sense of humor.  If you have read The Man in the High Castle or the book The Secret, you know that Sedaris is funny.  He can also use a very sophisticated language in an original way, which he does with this book.  I like the way he describes the problems with sleep.  "I am sleep-deprived, and sleep is a lie."    "My eyesight has degraded, and now I get terrible dreams."  "The last three nights I've felt the urge to take my clothes off, and that's about as close as I can get."  He has many other humorous comments, including "I'm sorry but I have to tell you that your book is full of shit and that your idea of getting a goodnight's sleep is probably the same as most of the rest of us get, and it is probably better not to even try." I like that a conspiracy theory that is as silly as this is still taken seriously.  David Sedars does not seem to be a conspiracy freak.  This book is about the idea that sleep deprivation causes mental disorders, and there is a large section where Sedaris discusses his own sleep problems, which I found very interesting.  In this book he talks about how sleep deprivation may have had a role in his being diagnosed with schizophrenia.  When asked about his sleep problems he said: "Sometimes when I sleep I think of people's bodies and I think, 'How could they sleep in these things?'   And I always end up waking up early.  There are so many nights when I'm sleep deprived that I think I'd better do something else.  But I can't stand that.  It's a bit like my feelings about money."  This is not the only reference to money, because he also says that he wants to own a
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've recently become an avid reader of the The War with the Gazans.  This book was a little hard to digest due to the use of "gaz", which is not my forte, but I still managed to keep up.  The author's passion for this story is apparent, and his research into the region is impeccable.    He also has the foresight to use humor to offset some of the more negative aspects of this part of the world.  The story follows "Ben, a journalist who is deeply involved in a complex war in Gaza and who has come to believe that his own reporting is in grave danger".   Ben travels through different parts of the Gaza Strip, interviewing Gazan civilians and military figures.  It is very interesting to see how different people react to various news stories.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the most important books ever written on the subject of women's psychology, but it was not written by a male.  It is filled with excellent research, excellent analysis, and most importantly, good advice.  I highly recommend this book to everyone, not only to male and female psychologists, but to anyone interested in getting help with problems involving women.  The advice is simple:  Men should treat women with respect, women should always take responsibility for their own problems, and that's the way it should be.  (Read more about the research and writing on page 50 and the author's biography at www.feminists.org ).
Write a positive review about a good book:  A lot of us were in for a shock.  We had heard the stories about how the American government had been hiding the facts of what was going on in Cuba and how it had been a cover up, but we had never heard that they had been trying to keep the people there in the dark about what they knew about the assassination of President Kennedy.    He had gotten everything he needed to make a killing in the business. The book explains the way it is done.     I have read several books on this, but  this one was the best.  What did you like about it:  This was the most detailed book of its kind.  The details were the best I had ever seen and, honestly, I was shocked at how easy it was to write a check to Castro.  I had no idea.  After reading the book and getting an idea of how it was done, I can see how these people were so easy to bribe and so easy for the U.S. government to fool.  It sounds like an old wives tale but, in my opinion, it is very true.  This book made me really consider the possibility of my own complicity in these events.  These are all things I would have never thought to consider and, even though my knowledge of the JFK Assassination has been limited, I believe the same people were involved. What didn't you like: There were a lot of things that made this story hard to believe.  For example, the way the U and the CIA would keep this secret for 50 years.  There was even an interview with an agent who said that Kennedy was murdered and that his body was placed in a "rainy day" bag at the bay so that it wouldn't be identified as Oswald's.  A body that wasn't found for nearly four days!   And they kept this secret until it was too late.  Another example, this book talks about the fact that the CIA, when it tried to hire spies, would hire people that were friends of Castro's family.  That's not very believable but, believe me, the book explains why it happened. I found it hard to be impressed with this book.   It makes so much sense and there is so much information contained in it that I think it's important enough to mention.  However, it doesn't really tell me why the government would do what they did.  Did they

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ - John F, Ohio, United States I've read all four of these books in the last two years and, although I did start on the first book, all four I've gotten through.

In short, I recommend them to everyone."  Read an insightful and insightful review about this book by a fan: ______________________________________________ - Laura G, New York, NewYork "I loved the fact that, while the main character was a female in a very male-dominated setting, it was still completely believable that she could make herself feel comfortable being female, and, indeed, feel pretty darn good doing it. I also loved the way she was introduced to the reader. She is introduced to us as a teenager in a story in which she is a girl who's been "stigmatized" in the male-centric world she finds herself in. She's not treated as some kind of freak or freak-of-nature by the others, and she even has some friends. I loved that she never needed to be rescued from a male-run world. Her feelings about herself and the world of boys are not just for show. They're for real.   Her feelings aren't just for a "boys' club." They're not just about the patriarchy, and in this respect, it's like a story about the girls and women who don't fit in with the popular girls (that's what she's told about her "girlhood" and how they're all obsessed with their bodies and beauty. They think they're superior to the rest of us. If a boy or a girl ever tries to tell you otherwise, she is not to listen. That's her only mistake.) The girls are in a pretty dark place in the book, with the only bright spot being the one that the main protagonist has to rescue her from." .  Review this book »

Write a positive review about a good book: *********** I've just finished this book - I've been trying to find one for ages, but always found it a tad slow-paced. This one is fast paced but the main characters seem more human than I am used to. Some of the characters seemed to have a real problem dealing with the abuse at the hands of their father and this really bothered me a lot. The fact that these men are still so young is a problem too and I just hope this doesn't affect their futures. I'm thinking of giving this to my 7 year old son but he's always a bit skeptical about reading things so hopefully he'll read it this time around. :) Thank you to all the author's and publishers - I was pleasantly surprised by this book!
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------- I loved the book. It's a great story, and a great book for beginners. It is a good read for me, though. I would suggest that for beginners, I would read this at the same time as The Great Divorce by Michael P. Carey. The story takes a while to get to the "fun" part, but after the "lucky" break (I would have to say that the break I was lucky for was that I found a new roommate), I'm back on track and loving it. It was so fun to hear your stories. I didn't get the information on the story of this book until later in the book when I was reading about the life of a young widow named Sue. I'm also glad you got an ex-husband on here. There is some really good information in this book. I think this book will work really well for the divorced person looking to get back together and learn about how their life and what they've gone through affects the future they face. I've been through a lot myself, and I wish I could've read this book earlier in my life. But now that I have, it's great for the beginner to read and it makes it a little easier for the young widow to understand why things happen the way they do. I have three daughters and one on the way. All of us are getting married eventually and one of the biggest problems we have to deal with is the amount of money we want to spend to get there. We have to plan out our lives accordingly and I'm sure we all know that when things get tight financially, it causes a divorce. Now, I'm not saying that getting a divorce is a bad thing and the kids shouldn't get along but they will be less happy when the kids aren't going to have any money, or the dad is doing the cooking or whatever, or other expenses are going to be more difficult. I hope this book is useful for them. The book covers a lot of things that people need to know before they decide to get married. The only problem I had was that it wasn't long enough and that there weren't enough chapters to give me the entire story.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I purchased this book based on the reviews, and even though I have been an avid reader since I was young, I've never read a book that had so much of the things that I love about fantasy books.   The characters are believable, the world has a realistic feel to it, the battles are intense and exciting, and the world is believable enough that even though it doesn't have a magic system, it's still a wonderful world that I want to explore more.  My only regret is that I'm not a fantasy reader at all, so I wouldn't be able to put this book on my shelf and look at it every few years as it gets older.  This is my 3rd time I've purchased a book from Audible.  Highly recommended!
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________   What I Loved About the Book:  This book is the kind of book that when you start reading, you know you will like it and will love it. The main character is an Aussie but you never lose the fact that he is a kid. I like that this is an adult book in which the author puts some very specific ideas and details, but never lets them get to be the focus of the book. I love the fact the author did this!   Things I Didn't Like about the Book  When you first begin the book you don't know where to go or what to look for. It feels like the main character has been doing things her whole life so there is no way to introduce her story without her doing things that make it a "coming of age" story. She seems like the type of person who doesn't like talking to strangers so it feels like she's really just been reading her way through things and now it's time for her to talk to people.   Overall, I loved this book and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good "coming out" story or a book with a strong, realistic and interesting main character.

I would recommend this book to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I thought that this book would be about the time of the Black Plague, but instead it turned out to be about human rights in general and human dignity and right to exist and be treated as equal, which were important things in the time. It reminded me of the time when I lived in South Africa. And that is a time where things are really bad because it was in the 60s. There were no gays. In the 60ies, you had gay, and the other things, but no one was really fighting to get the rights to exist. Now it's more accepted. In a strange way, I'm glad that these issues came up, because we all deserve a fair go. I was in a car accident, and I don't have a car to drive, and that's a very bad thing. But I had to go on disability for two years, and then it ended. I am very happy that it ended because I wouldn't have been able to survive.  "This book was a real revelation. It was such an inspiring book, so much so that I didn't need another book about the Black Death to help me see that we can survive anything." —Michael Verellen, author of The Black Death: The World's Most Violent Epidemic
Write a positive review about a good book: Â  This book is a real gem! It is one of the most comprehensive and thoroughly explained books I have read about how to make your own home-cooked pasta. I have made this recipe a lot, and I can assure you that you will not be disappointed. Thank you to my friend in Australia who gave me the recipe for this book so I would be able to try this great recipe.  The only thing I would change in the book, I would cut back a little on the oil (but only slightly) and the water by one-third. I find that I am cooking pasta with way too much oil, and with the amount of water I add, I am overcooking the pasta and ruining it for the rest of the week. The first time I made this, I was not sure how much oil to use, I used about 2 tablespoons of oil, but next time, I will use less oil. For my second attempt, I reduced the oil to one tablespoon, and only a half tablespoon of water. The results were fantastic. Thanks again to all who contributed to this book. , October 21, 2012 at 7:29 AM   Anonymous said... Awesome! Love how you make the pesto. I love how you tell you how much you should use to get the right balance of flavors and textures, plus you mention the amount you add to the pan to see if your noodles cook evenly. Great stuff.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "H.P. Lovecraft: The Call of Cthulhu" by Robert Bloch  is a must read if you like the Cthulhu Mythos!  The first chapter is short but is a great primer for anyone thinking of writing a Lovecraftian work. The rest of the book is a collection of Lovecraftian tales and is written by a huge variety of authors including Clark Ashton Smith, Kenzaburō Yamada, and John Carter.  I would have given it a full four stars but my copy was a bit worn at the top.
Write a positive review about a good book:      I'm new to SF/F so I have to give this a four star review because it doesn't just teach the rules of the universe, it gives an idea of the future and gives an insight into the culture, but more importantly it tells you what to do with the rules. I really liked the alien race and their history. I would definitely recommend this to people new to fantasy/SF/F/etc books. Read an awesome story on the internet:   This was my first time reading the webnovel on this site so I thought it was cool, the plot was good, the characters and the voice of the author were very likable. It was a good story that I loved. I'm not sure how you get around having the same people, it would have been better if the story was like a book or a magazine and there was new characters and an interesting plot line, but it didn't work that way. I loved this book, it was a bit of a disappointment to have a short, it made a very nice ending though, this author has a talent to write, and if this was my last book I would be satisfied. 5 out of 5 stars  This is one of my favorite books of all time. The best. A great plot, fantastic characters, great world building, fantastic writing. I love it. Thanks for another wonderful story. It's perfect.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book a lot! I have been a Christian for a long time and this book made a few different points for me.

I would highly recommend this book.  Thanks for writing it!
Write a positive review about a good book: ---------------------------   I was expecting a lot from this book, but it was not as bad as I expected.   The story is about a man who lives alone in a small town on a small island. The story is set in his own small town and revolves around him being the local hero in a time of trouble, saving the life of a family and saving them from danger. The book is told with a lot of humor. The characters are realistic, which is a nice change of pace in my opinion.   a lot was given away in the first page, it did not take long for me to get into the story. I loved that the character's motivations are believable and interesting. The narration was great as well. I thought the character of J was the best part of the book.  .  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The most exciting thing that has happened in my career is that I have finally finished the second book in the series! I had to fight tooth and nail to get to this point, to convince my agent that it was a worthwhile story and not just something I could pull off as a one-time project. My favorite part was the final page, which I found very emotional.  Also, I think the book is very well written and the characters were very well-developed. I will definitely be purchasing a paperback version when this is over and read it.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________________________ The first book I ever read on the psychology of human trafficking was "The Myth of Sex Trafficking" by Laura Bates. I purchased this book, thinking it would be just about sex trafficking, but it was far more than that. I enjoyed this book so much that I decided to read her other books as well. This book is more like a textbook. I am hoping that the author of the book that I received, the very experienced Ms. Bates, will continue to write more books on human trafficking. ____________________________________________________________________ My only complaint is that I would like it if the author would have written the book in a different format. This would have been better for the book as a whole. The book is in a very good shape though. It was not damaged during shipping. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in human trafficking or in psychology.
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ This book is good and well written. It is about a group of scientists who went out to measure the sun and came back with some interesting results. Some of the observations that were made were rather surprising. The book is not without some flaws and could use some better explanation and further testing. A few chapters could be put to better use if that was the intention of the authors. If you know how to look at this book and take what it is telling you, I give it an A-. My only complaint is the "author" of the book, a retired engineer named Fred Jansen, does not seem to have done his homework. I am sure that a competent engineer could look at the data and come to a conclusion similar to Fred J. Jansen. This book also does not make the data more accessible, at least not in a readable manner. I did not find it too difficult to understand the data in this book. I can't think of any examples where it was a good idea for an engineer to read this book first.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "Hmmm, so this is the second book by this author that I've read and enjoyed, and the second time that I found myself looking forward to reading again. Although this is not my favorite book of his, I think it has a number of things that make it worth your while.   1) The writing is great. There are plenty of sentences, words, and scenes that take you on a wonderful ride. As one of the characters says in the book, "I like the way the characters seem to be in some ways larger than life, not so much in the way they're big and strong, but in the sense of their vulnerability, the way their fears seem unreal and other-worldly and they feel alive even though they're still trapped in their world."   2) The book has a strong emotional impact. The events of the book are often very upsetting and have a very lasting effect on the reader. The author even describes how his wife had to go through some of these events before the book begins. It's not a light read but it is very powerful.   with a review this short, I'll give this book a 3 out of 5 stars. The book is an interesting concept and a very well written novel. The characters are very well done. The setting is really well done and gives us the feeling that we're experiencing something very real. As a science fiction reader I was interested in the fact that this book took place in an alternate earth. That makes it very real, and I loved it. I loved the book and I hope you will too.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite author of all time. In my opinion his work can be called "Science Fiction" and I enjoyed this book and the movie.
Write a positive review about a good book:...............................................   I was so excited to get my hands on this book. I was so glad I did. It really is a very good read. The writing style and story lines were very well written. The characters all have different traits and flaws that come out of their own way, that really makes the reader feel for them. It was hard for me to put down after finishing this book! I had just finished reading a book by this author that was a bit longer, which was great, but I think this book really stood out to me.   So, my review: this book was just awesome! The characters are very well drawn and I can tell that the author has put a lot of work into them. They are complex, not all perfect and we all have our own ways that we act and react to things. The plot is very good and it is good to read a book about a secret society in a high school, in a secret college, in America. It is the middle of the century now and the society is still operating as a secret organization. It's a great concept and one I hope will be done a little more.   the characters were all very well-drawn, with different quirks and flaws, but a great deal of them are likable and likeable characters. It helped me to know who I was rooting for and what my own feelings and thoughts were towards the characters. the book was interesting to read, with some very good information about the society, but also some interesting stories about the characters that helped me find out who I liked the most. The book was a great read, and I really enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   Hi   , I found your book very helpful and I agree that I should not spend a great deal of time on it. As I am a student, I read this book as a sort of research to know the most effective technique that I can use in my studies. I found it very helpful because it provides an efficient method to learn to read English, and I have already learned a lot from the method. I would recommend this book to other students in the class because there is a certain time that you should spend on reading each chapter. My students who are trying to learn this language need to spend at least 8 hours a day on it as this is the recommended time. This book was a very helpful read. It provides you with very good resources for English to learn. Thanks again for making it available to our children! I've just finished this book. I agree with the other reviewers and it is well worth the money. Hello,I have just finished reading your book about English as a second language. It has very good information and it has made me feel comfortable with the topic. I plan to buy more books about different topics. I just bought your book. It was very informative, and really helped me understand English very well. I will be recommending your book to everyone I know. I have spent over $10,000 in language training. My kids speak English, but it's been very difficult for me to understand what they are saying. You have helped me so much. Thank you. I would like to say thank you for your effort on your book "Learn to Read English with Ease". As an English learner who has spent over 5 years studying this language, I have found many errors in your book and could not have finished it. But now, I feel confident reading it without errors. You've done an excellent job and have given me a great idea on how to teach my children the language of the book. Thank's, Ravi I am a new English learners and I had the pleasure of buying the English as Second Language course from your website. I am truly impressed with your work. I have been a professional teacher for 7 years and have over 15,000 students and I am the only teacher in the area of ESL that I know of. I can see that the ESD method is the one that will best suit me and my students. You're method is very easy to follow and it works. I
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ "Darling, You're a Lot Like Me" (by Jennifer Finney Boylan) is a wonderful book about being a teenage girl and a gay teenager in this country. If your mother was not a Christian and your father was not gay and the only person who told you that homosexuality is wrong was a minister, you would not be going through what you are going through. This book is not about being gay, it is about being the girl that your parents were not. If you believe being gay is wrong, you should not read this book, because if you read this story you will know it. I hope people read this and get out and tell people the truth. "Dying is Not an Option" by Lisa Duggan is a very accurate book about what it means to be in love with someone who is gay. "We Can Do This" by Robert Duncan is a fantastic book about how we can do this.
Write a positive review about a good book:.........................................................................   "A remarkable and well-written book, full of information. Very good reading."   ~ R. M. Whelan   A true classic. It is impossible to describe to any one but the devotee of historical fiction how well-informed and entertaining this book is. A fascinating subject and a well-thought-out narrative.   It is, of course, written for general reading, so it has a few flaws, but most of those are minor.   the main fault is that the plot is a bit uneven, and that at one point it starts to get a bit ridiculous.  I won't say it happens often, but after about halfway through, I had to stop and think if I was still in the story or not.  , a more experienced novelist and researcher, and the author of The History of the World According to Goliad,  , a greater researcher, historian, and writer than Hovind, does an excellent job in presenting the details and the story.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I was looking for an educational book for my grade school kids, and I was so happy to see that this is such a good one. We all love to be entertained and this book is perfect for that. I can't wait to see how it ends. What we didn't like: ___________________________ One of the things that struck me is how many times my students ask me about the "magic" of reading aloud. I was surprised when my students brought up the magic of hearing a "magic sound" or "magic word." I found this to be a problem because I don't know if there's a magic that will be discovered for every word and every sound. One of the reasons that reading is important is that you can learn so much about yourself. My students really didn't understand this point. ________________________________________________ The main problem I had was that there was not enough instruction about how to use your imagination and creativity to create your own word sounds and images. _________________________ Other than that, this was an excellent book. I liked it! I am a teacher and this is a great book. It is a must have for every educator. I highly recommend it. The author has done a fantastic job of creating something that is both informative and entertaining. It would be great if the book could include the use of the internet to do the audio clips so that the book is more accessible to non-English speakers. _________________ I really love the new "magical" sounds. They really are magical! They make learning a lot more fun. I will use this book to my students as we read this at recess!

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This book contains a number of very useful ideas that I am now using to make improvements in my own learning. My only regret about this book is that I would have liked to have seen it have more material on different types of information and not just the information related to information. (A good example is in Chapter 3. The information is all about a subject that is covered in some of the other books and is not relevant.) The examples were great, but I would've liked more examples about information. And for the most part the concepts are not quite as well defined as I would like. I would suggest you check out the first chapter of the book on Information. (It's in the Appendix. It's a nice chapter, but only in that chapter did I get the hang of what is being talked about. Also the ideas and concepts are all in a very condensed form. If you have some more material to add to this chapter, please do so. I'm sure you'll learn something in the process. You'll also find some very useful exercises you can do with the material in the material I mentioned in Chapter 1. The problem I had with this book was that it does not seem to cover the information-information transition very well. I was told that a good transition is the one where you feel that information has been covered. There are some good ways to transition the information in the book, but they don't seem to be very clear. I have seen a lot of good books, and they all contain material I've been unable to use to improve my learning, and yet the best of them do not even mention this transition to me. I think that this book should be considered a must read, and I'd recommend it to anyone who has the time to read it and is interested in improving his/her own learning experience. Good book. Review by: Gaius Dormus, Jr on September 06, 2018 : I'm a first year Ph.D. student, working on my dissertation at the time of writing this review. I found the information on how to analyze and create databases very useful in my research. The chapters on information have been very helpful to my understanding of the topic. The examples in the examples section were a bit simplistic, but at least provided the necessary information to create my own data. I highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ by M.D. Smith  This is the only book I have read from the late 80's that I like. It has a very high quality and is entertaining. I am not familiar with the genre of science fiction and this is an interesting read. I was surprised how fast I got through this book.   The story is simple yet intriguing. It's a small town on the Moon and one family, the Rags, has been there for many years. When the mother of the boy who is in charge of the space ship the Eagle leaves the family for the first time she tells her two sons:   "As for you boys, don't you worry. You'll be just like me. We'll do what we want and the rest will take care of itself."   She leaves one son to go to the Moon on the Eagle and the other son to continue his family tradition of working as a miner in the mines and to get married.   to the reader you can read that she has left her son because her husband is a rich farmer from the old country, they have nothing to talk about, but he doesn't leave her without saying goodbye and she never sees him again.   "She left her kids to go out on the moon. They had nothing to do but eat and sleep and fight with each other. "   When he sees her again he starts to feel that this family isn't like her and that she is a "bad mother". His best friend, another miner also lives on the mining colony, he knows the Rages well and he also gets a shock when he sees the boy from the Eagle. The boy is completely different from her and there is no way he could have made it without the Eagle's help. She leaves him and the mining ship to find his mother on the Earth and find the reason why she went away to the moon in the first place.   (hide spoiler)   My thoughts: It's not much more than a very brief and amusing story, but it will keep you entertained.  I think the reason that it is so short is that it's set in the late 70's and early 80's. In my mind that is a very short time to live. It doesn't seem to be an easy book to write and for that reason I did enjoy it.  -I like the fact that the Raggs are mining for ores on the lunar surface in the lunar landscape. In

Write a positive review about a good book: *********   I am now into my fifth month of reading "The Alchemist". I was initially going to read this as an introduction, but I read it more for its plot than as an overview. I enjoyed it because it was complex enough to keep me guessing until the end. It was interesting to read about how various people in various places were getting "an" knowledge of the "art" of alchemy. It also provided a good deal of detail about how alchemy was used to construct the great pyramids. I hope the author continues to write, and I think the series will be fun to read for several years to come.   "The Alchemist" is a classic book in the sense that I am sure the original edition will be out of print soon enough, and this is my version of a "fancy" edition. I am not sure of the edition number on the "factory" copy, but if you look on the outside cover of the book you'll see the numbers. I think there is a factory copy with the numbers "1" and "6".   One thing that is not as clear as I had thought. It has been written that there is more than one alchemist in each book, but it was not clear to me that they all had the same name. For example in this book, there were at least three different alchemists and no single one was the same as another.   The most obvious difference is that one of them, Zonaras, was a real alchemist, and the other three were not. They all had a certain name.   a very good book, and you will like it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's hard for me to pick out one book which best describes the feelings of loneliness, and I can't say I can put the experience into words without spoiling it (which I suppose is why I'm reading this, and not, say, The War of the Worlds). The best part of the book, and what I've found most intriguing about it, is that this loneliness doesn't arise from the lack of companionship, or even that of people who you know well. It seems to stem from the sheer, almost unimaginable isolation of feeling alone in the world, and feeling that the only way to get out of this is to write your own story. It is the ultimate story of loneliness: you have no one in your life, and your feelings are as real to you as they would be if you lived on the surface of the sun. The story is of a young girl, Joelle, and her experiences in trying to tell her own story, and how, despite the fact that she has no one to listen to her, she somehow manages to create something that is unique and wonderful, and that she never expected to be written. I won't give away the ending, but it has a very sweet, very human ending that I find very endearing and beautiful. It has me weeping tears of joy. And, honestly, if you think the only thing you want from a book is to find a loved one to relate to, or a loved friend, this is a very good book for that (though, personally, I prefer books that feel like they were written by me...). Thank you for your time. If you ever meet a fellow lonely person, or are in the mood to tell someone a true story, this may be a book that you'll enjoy. This review was originally published on  The Book Smugglers, which has also published a review of this book. You can read it here.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book for a class I teach on "Why I am a Christian" which is meant to help my students deal with some of the issues they may have in dealing with other religions.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The first time I read this book, I hated it so much that I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I'm sure most people would say the same about this book. It's a slow, dry read, full of political and social commentary, but it's not boring. In fact, it's really interesting. While the characters may seem to be a bit of a stereotype (the author makes the point to explain that they are not meant to be realistic, but rather, "as true as possible," as "a representation of an actual world), the book does have a heart and is well written. I highly recommend this book and I hope the author doesn't run out of stories to tell in this world.
Write a positive review about a good book:.................................I've heard good things about this book from a lot of different sources including the book reviewer and from a different book group. In the middle of a reread, I was reminded of a particular section of this book which is relevant to my current reading of the novel. (It was not relevant to the novel.) I think the book was about the way in which people deal with fear and anxiety and it was very relevant to me, having also suffered from anxiety for much of my life. The chapter 'Why We Need the Fear of Missing Out' seemed to summarize a lot about the subject of social anxiety. It seems to describe the fears that we sometimes have, and that are sometimes irrational, and which we might be better off not having. It felt to me like it helped me see the ways in which I, as a human being, may be trying to avoid anxiety.  I am pleased to find that this book still remains a relevant one today, thirty years after its publication.

I've read all the other books by this author (and some of the reviews on this website) and I still appreciate this one. I know a lot people feel that social anxiety is like a disease that can be cured with an over-active imagination. That is not a proper understanding of what social anxiety and social anxiety disorder are. Social anxiety disorder is not simply "having a nervous breakdown". There are three elements of social social anxiety: fear of rejection, fear of not being liked, and fear of feeling awkward. A disorder is a physical or mental condition that is associated with symptoms. The symptoms may be different, but the condition is the same. Social Anxiety disorder is often the result of a brain disorder or hormonal imbalance (such as an underactive thyroid). As with many diseases, there is no cure. But these symptoms can be treated. For me, therapy and medication helped me learn how to manage my social anxiety better. - August 1, 2016A must read.  to the book that the title refers to, if you haven't read it yet, then I highly recommend it.  and for anyone who thinks this book can cure social anxiety, then read it anyway.

Now I'm reading it again to take notes.  This book is worth reading and will probably be read again for its many insightful observations.

I think this will be a must have for all serious strength athletes. _________________________________________________________________________________________  Rated 5 out of 5 by rajneesh from awesome book great workout program This is by far the best book on the market  I like this program because it teaches you how to apply all your knowledge. The book is in detail about the whole workout but there is no need to get lost in details. The program is great for all the beginners. If you want to improve your endurance, it has an easy version of it and for this it is good for the beginners  The program is also easy to follow, which is a great feature. It's good for beginners. It will take time to understand it fully, but I think once you understand it, you will improve and that's a bonus. If it is a complete beginner program, it is definitely worth the time and money. If I can recommend it, I would definitely recommend it.  This program is good if you're a beginner who isn't too far into bodybuilding or want to keep your weight under control  the program is written in an easy-to-understand manner so beginners can get started easily. The trainer doesn't really explain in great detail how to do anything, but instead simply shows you how in the examples  There is one very good point in the book: it is not too technical and only gives a general explanation of the exercises. The trainers should do this as they are teaching you how do the exercises and how they work together, but the program doesn't do this. You must be more specific to figure it out. I'm a big fan of the program and would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve.  for someone like me who is trying to get their training up to speed for a meet, I found the program to be really detailed and helpful.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't know if I can give a very high rating to this book. I think that the writing was great in parts, but it got a little repetitive and some parts were a little boring. However, it was interesting to read a story from the point of view of a "real" person who knew the history and people involved. I liked how the story unfolded and that it was told from the perspective of a different person than the main characters. In one point, they were discussing a particular historical event and they explained to me that this was done in order to make the history more clear to a wider audience. In the book I had heard of this before. I thought it was fascinating to hear it described this way.

Write a positive review about a good book: ---------------This is the first time that i am using the book. I am a long time fan of the book series and it was nice to finally read it. The book covers the main storyline from beginning to end and the author writes in a way that makes the book easy to follow. The main characters are all very well developed and very likable. I found this book to be a little repetitive, especially after the first 3. However, the author does try to incorporate some new twists. The character development is the best part of this book, but the story is fairly standard.I am giving this 5 stars because it really did bring back the memories of those who have read the books and can recognize them as they were in the book, however if you are a new reader, then it might take awhile to get used to the stories. If you have already read the previous books then I think you will enjoy this book as well. I would recommend this book if you enjoy good stories, good characters, and good plot twists. read more There's a lot of hype and good will behind the books in the Harry Potter universe, and I too can see why. It is certainly the largest franchise to ever grace the shelves of a bookstore and I can't wait to see how the next book is progressing. However as a new fan to the series I feel I have a few questions about the books, and also my hopes for what is to come.First of all I have to say that I am very glad I read these books. I enjoyed the first two series so much, and was so excited to finally see where the rest of the story went. So the anticipation was almost overwhelming, and the first book of the series was even mentioned in my favorites. My hopes for these books were so high, but I was very surprised by how different it was than the first series. I was disappointed that the author didn't try to go back to some of the original stories in the series to continue and change things up. There was nothing that didn't make sense in the beginning and I was left wondering what was going on. This is something that I've noticed with other authors writing Harry Potter books. The author will pick a couple of events and go back into their original stories to add new ideas, and sometimes it works very well. But there are other times when it doesn't. In my opinion it makes the story less interesting.In order to help understand this I will list some of my favorite and least

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Story of a Dog in Space by Peter L. Taggart is very well-written and engaging. I would say that it is an adult-oriented story but there is some very funny parts. The dog character that Taggard introduces to us is very endearing, but he is very strong-willed and is a very tough guy. He has some bad traits in his head that he does not quite admit to and we are shown them. The writing is strong and engaging and the characters are not just stereotypical but really interesting and likable. 7 of 9 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book because it was different from most books I read, which are usually all about one side of the same coin. I would definitely give this book a thumbs up, because I did enjoy it. The author wrote it in a short, easy to read manner, and it wasn't overwhelming either. The ending was a bit disappointing. I mean, after all of the buildup, it was kind of weird to see that the "good" people really were just good, and the "bad" people just were bad. But there wasn't enough tension, or any of the suspense to really warrant a 3 star rating.   Next book I might read would be a historical one, where the author takes us back to the 16th to 17th century, which, in my opinion, is probably the most interesting time period of any period. However, since this book was the first historical fiction I've read, I'm pretty sure that my interest in this time period will wane pretty quick, especially when I remember what I read about it in school.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got the book after hearing about it in a seminar with a teacher and she told me it had been translated by the German translator and it's great.   I really enjoyed the story as well as the art style.   and this is the type of book that makes you think  i'm not even sure if the "spice" in the story is for real or just for the translator or publisher. but i thought it was well done.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- What an interesting read. The story was simple and engaging, but with enough twists and turns that you're always thinking "what if this isn't real??" I found it to be well thought-out and filled with character, although some characters seemed to be more for shock value than anything else. There were moments of great beauty, and the end was definitely worth the price of admission. The ending was really surprising and a bit abrupt, but that didn't stop it from being great! I was a bit worried that there wasn't going to be enough of a payoff, but the end did bring a tear to my eye! Overall, I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone. Thanks for sharing. :)
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be very informative about one of the most important topics in human civilization: the question of who we are and why we're here on earth.   For instance, who is a person? Why does it matter? I found this very relevant as I've read a lot of books over the years about what it means to be human. This book makes those issues very plain and easy to see.  , which I believe will make it even more appealing to students and general readers. I found myself turning to this book more than any other in my library. It is also very interesting to note that the book was written in an ancient language. I did not know about ancient languages, but I can say that this author writes with the style of an ancient person.   of course, one has to take what this book tells us with a grain of salt as I would agree that many modern people do not know the answer to many of these questions. However, this author is right when she points out that we are not here for pleasure but because it is the best way to survive on this planet. This is definitely a topic that the reader should know about if he or she wants to truly understand who we really are.   a book that you should read:  I can tell you this book is an excellent source of information on the history of our species. This author covers a wide variety of topics, including: evolution and biology  Human behavior and civilization  The origin of religion and superstition  How we got to the Moon  What has made our planet what it is  Why we are here and where we are going.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- Great book for those who are curious about the development of a specific piece of equipment, but are not interested in building it. This book covers a wide range of topics, covering most aspects of the equipment, including design, construction, operation, and maintenance. It discusses the technical aspects of both the parts and the complete system. The author shows very clearly what all the parts are used for, and what they all do. I'm going to look at a particular type of motor controller that he explains, the LM-2304, and I expect that I will find a great deal of use for it.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________ My favorite book to date. The stories are interesting, engaging, and have a unique setting. It is very well thought out, and the characters are well written and develop. The way that it handles sexuality, is very thought out and unique. I will most definitely read more of Ms. Farrow's work. _________________________________  I highly recommend Ms. Friedman's novels because she does not sugarcoat or sanitize the horror of the Holocaust, and because she is able to capture the atmosphere of being in a concentration camp and the terror of being separated from loved ones, by making the reader care about the characters. __________________________________________________________________________________________  This book has a lot of things in it I don't know how to comment on, but I can tell you that this is a must read. Ms. Friedman shows how a young Jewish girl becomes a hero in a Nazi concentration camp, and how it affected her and the world around her. ______________________________  A very unique and powerful book about two Jewish-American girls who are sent to a Nazi camp as prisoners in 1945. Ms Friedman tells their story in the first person with an unusual, unique approach to writing in a Holocaust novel.   (review of free book)  Review by: David Cohen on May 22, 2013 :  Friedman is a remarkable writer and the Holocaust is not only well told, but has a special and moving ending.   An excellent debut in which a woman with Jewish roots in America finds herself in the heart of the Third Reich. Ms Farrow does a masterful job of capturing the terror and suffering of the concentration camps. A brilliant storyteller.    In my opinion this book is a masterpiece.  (review of paid book)
Write a positive review about a good book:  Great book that will change how you view your body. You will always know you are a 'good' size even if you get skinny. I did not believe I was a 'lean' size 2 but after seeing what this book says I am so happy to say I am now a size 4, although I am a little disappointed in the lack of measurements. So now I want to get bigger and then take it one step further and get my measurements taken. A positive review:  This book is great for anyone looking to improve their strength, power, mobility, balance, or even improve their endurance. This is not a 'weight training' book, it is an excellent book for all of us to understand what we are doing in terms of training and improving our bodies. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve themselves for sport, for those who are trying to look a certain way, or for anyone who just wants to lose weight. You can use the book to gain strength, or improve your flexibility, and as well as losing weight, if you are an elite level weightlifter I would highly recommend buying this book for you. My Experience: This is an amazingly clear and well written book, and an excellent resource for both weightlifting and bodybuilding.  I bought this book and it is absolutely perfect.  The author explains the reasons for the bodybuilding and weightlifting movements being different and why this is the best way to improve our body.  He gives us a good overview of what is going on in each movement, the benefits that they bring and also gives examples of good form.  All in all I am incredibly impressed by this book.   The book has a good index and has lots of pictures to help you with reference as you read through the chapters.  Also it has a table of contents which you can use to easily find the chapter you are interested in.   The last thing I wanted to say is that it is great that the author does not assume the reader has any prior knowledge of the movements that are included.  If you want to go into this book with no prior knowledge, just don't!  
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I have just finished reading it. I was really surprised how well it held my interest. I liked the stories, the plot was good. The characters were well portrayed. The descriptions and the story. The author also has a very good grasp on the history and the cultural aspects of the area. ---------------I liked the book. I had a nice time reading it but as a historian, I am looking for the historical aspects. The best part of the book was the "How to" and the description of the areas. --------------What I Liked: - Good descriptions - Good history - Good characters - Great "How-To" - Nice art I LIKED HOW THIS BOOK WAS MADE - Great historical information - Interesting characters - Interesting place - Interesting "how to" The book has some good historical information. The history of this area is good. - Some of the details of the history were a little unclear but overall, it was very informative. - I liked how the author explained how some of the people made their way here, but I wasn't quite sure if it was really the same place or it was another area. I wanted to learn more. - The story was well written and it flowed. - It was not a great book but I could see the purpose. ------------- What I Did Not Like: - I found the story of the main character to be a bit confusing at times. - Not really a happy ending. - One of the characters was a little over the top but you know, that's what he was like. He was just trying to get out and find what he could in his life. - There wasn't enough information about the location of the island in the book that it explained the story well enough. - If you think you know what island the island is then you are a little off - I didn't really understand what the author was trying to do with the character. This character was not explained well enough and I was not sure if he was a good person. He had a very negative and not good experience. - Too many details of how people made it to the island and then just gave it up as a myth. I guess this is why I don't read historical fiction books. -The main character was a pretty cool guy who seemed like he wanted to make it out. - Didn't know how many of the residents were descendants of the original settlers or if the island was inhabited by other peoples. ------------ Conclusion: ------------

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, in my opinion, is the best of the four books that were made of the same novel.  The first book was an excellent, well-written story with good characterization and good action, the second book was less impressive than the first and the third book was very poorly written.    This new novel is far better and more well-developed.    There are a lot of things that make this story good and I hope that this series continues for a long time.

I really have enjoyed all the main characters from beginning to end. I am so glad they were all included in the book. I love the way the author puts the book together. He puts the world in place, the characters in place and then takes time to get into the characters' heads. This has made the book so much better, especially the characters.

Write a positive review about a good book:  There was a book that I read a few years ago that really got me thinking about the idea of what it means to be human. In this book, we were given the opportunity to think of humans in the way they would like to think, and they seemed to accept it.  This is very interesting, because I have always been curious about humans because I always think of them as having a natural disposition of wanting to dominate and control everything around them, and I find that somewhat off-putting.  I also found the book really interesting because in the end, we found that not everyone was just like the characters in the book.    The author gives us the chance to make a judgement call about who we think we are, and it was nice to see us go through some of the experiences we went through as human beings and have some sort of an understanding.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The author gives the facts and offers the solutions without going into the details of exactly how to do it. Good on him.   This is a really good book about the importance of being a good Christian and loving people. It is not a book about how you are going to win the hearts and minds of everyone you come across, because that is impossible. It teaches the importance and value of love in the Christian life.   on the other hand, it is not about how to win an argument, or how to deal with people who disagree with you, because those are impossible.     I have to give this book two thumbs up because I find it extremely helpful in trying to deal and resolve conflicts and disagreements with others in my own life. It was a real eye opener for me. I am so thankful I read it. I would not be the same if I did not have it.   for a new reader:  I think you have to read this book and understand it to know how important it is. I know, I know.. I know the author is a bit of a controversial figure, but I believe that the book gives you the best of both worlds: it covers all sides and is not preachy. It explains how to live in harmony with your God in your relationship with others, but doesn't take an opinionated stance.  . You will be given a great gift, that is worth having and giving!
Write a positive review about a good book:.............................."This is an excellent book on how to teach children to read in school. It explains a few basics of phonics and decoding, then provides the techniques to teach reading skills that can help students read as early as preschool. It also gives the techniques of teaching children to understand the story and use a phonics understanding and a decoding technique (like this one) to improve phonics skills and reading. The only negative thing I have to say about this book is that in my opinion, it is not complete. There are several chapters where there are not enough pictures or examples to help the student understand. This book does not have the explanations on how and why to use different techniques and there is not enough use of pictures or charts."  The rating is based on 2 votes.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ One of the best books I have ever read. The stories are fascinating and interesting and I felt like I had been living in a different culture the entire time. I would recommend it to anyone. -Kirsten E. -Ranhui, Vietnam I love this book so much. It's hard to believe that I've only read a few pages so far, but it's all been worth it. My favorite story to date involves the most brilliant of all time and an odd man who tries to protect his beloved, but just can't catch a break in a strange land. This book made me cry. Not in a normal way, but in the way that you see a child sobbing and wanting to stay in bed when their parents aren't around. And I loved that. I don't like to cry, and usually feel the need to stop reading at that point, but the tears were genuine, and my heart was so full of emotion and longing for the time and space where I once lived. I could feel the memories of my past and my family so clearly, and I know that there are some in there who are just like me, and for them, it's the perfect story to be told. -Nathanael S. -Washington DC, USA
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only time my kids' grades declined after this book was when the school went from using this book in the school library, to substituting another book. I was really disappointed to find out that this book doesn't even support a grade-level learning for a fourth grade student. My kids had already been through the process of learning the same way we do, in a very limited way, so the learning that this gave them was just more proof of the fact that I do not like school-wide standardized tests! I would only recommend this book to parents who want to help their child learn how to read well. I know from experience that they have their own strengths and weaknesses, and this is really just about reinforcing a certain learning style. I'm still learning the right way to read, but I am still learning! 8.5/10
Write a positive review about a good book: ************* I'm a pretty big fan of the Hunger Games, so this was an absolute treat. This is the first in a trilogy, and the first of what I think will be a series. The story follows Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl who has been kidnapped by the tyrannical President Snow. The rebels are fighting to stop this, but are struggling against both an overwhelming amount of weapons and the ruthless and ruthless forces behind them. It's really an awesome, exciting book, and it left me wanting more. A big fan from the beginning of this series, and this is the best one yet! In terms of story, I absolutely adored this book. It's fast-paced, and engaging. There are a lot of twists and turns, but it never felt like they were forced on me, and they all made sense. There's a nice mix of horror, action, drama, and romance in this one. What I loved about this book were the characters. Katnison's character was just so, so good. This was the first book of this trilogy, so I was glad to see how much growth she went through. She's still a bit naive, but she's growing and changing. It made her seem more interesting to me than some other characters I've read. I thought that one of the best things about this series was the way the series has a really strong message. The book is about the evils in the world, and how the only way to fight against those evils is to fight back. Kat and her friends want to make sure that they are better than those evil people, and that they do something to stand in the way of their oppressors. Katniss is a strong heroine, and I was very much hoping she would become a strong character in the next book in the series.  I just read another book by this author, but I found this one a lot more engaging. I had high hopes for the final book in this series.

I think that one of its great strengths is the characters. The Star Wars movies are amazing and are so well done. But this is the first book I've read in a couple years that I was so invested in characters that you feel like you're really living their lives. This book has great action sequences that are fun and exciting. This is really my favourite Star Wars book. Highly recommend it.

I will recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the life of my great-grandmother. The book is not about my great grandmother in any way but it is about her love for her family and how hard it was to leave her.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- ------------ -------------------------- You're not supposed to know this, but it really makes this book work. ------------------------- ------------ You can't get a better introduction to the characters than this one. I can't wait for the next book, and even if I don't, I can still say I had a good time reading it. ------------ --------- I love it when I can read a book from beginning to end. This book starts with some characters who are not in the book, but are important for it to work. The first half is really just a collection of characters we get to know. It gets better as the story progresses, but I liked how much it just built to the final reveal. This was a really enjoyable book to read, and I would recommend it to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________ If you are a book fan like me, there is one book that is always on your bookshelf and at the top of your must-read list. The title says it all. The author has a knack for writing interesting characters and keeping the reader hooked, to the end. I have heard of many books by the same author, but none of them has ever matched The Last Samurai. I am so glad I bought it. The book is packed with historical facts, great characters and an amazing plot. The historical background is excellent and the characters were both interesting and enjoyable. As a matter of fact, I would say the plot is the best part of the book. The characters and the situation are amazing, and this is an excellent book to read when you want to know more about the history of Japan. The ending was unexpected, and even though it was unexpected it was not too bad of an ending. I loved the fact that the author went through the effort to portray the Samurai, and not simply in a "villainous" way.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book of historical fact. I am sure I will find many good things about this book. I have been working on a book on the war and have read many books, but none compare to the quality of this book....I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the British Expeditionary Force in World War II.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I just bought this book and it is brilliant and well written. I am enjoying it very much. I really like this book. I recommend it I don't know who it is who sent this book my way, but it was an absolute treat for me. I picked it up for Christmas, and was so pleased when I got it. A truly excellent book, with wonderful descriptions. Read it again and again - it is simply brilliant. It has been a very long time since I have been reading an adult book. So here goes: A very charming and touching story of friendship, faith and faith healing. It is wonderfully written and I loved it. A lovely story that I wish I had the words to describe it It is one of those rare books that I read and think'I have not read this before...' A wonderfully written book that I love and I will always remember. If you enjoy an excellent book then I highly recommend this. I have read it three times already and it has kept me smiling, thinking and feeling warm and relaxed throughout. It makes me wish that it were Christmas morning again - but it is my birthday on Friday. You may wish to purchase the book and have a look at the following information that was put on Amazon in a recent survey: What are your favourite books? I would say it's probably The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but this book is far superior and has made me more of a reader as well. I also like to read religious books and I think this is one which has the best religious characters, but I am always happy to recommend books to others. In your book, there are a lot of "religious characters", and I wonder if you are using them as a metaphor to explain the characters, or if they are a kind of metaphor for religion? I am using the characters and a metaphor for faith to explain what is happening to my own faith, which is slowly being eroded. How do the characters react when they find out that the God they worship does not exist? When I first started out as a young Christian, I was taught to believe in an all-powerful, perfect, benevolent God. It was a very dominant message which I tried to live up to. But over time, I began to think about the idea that the personification of God may have been misleading. I found myself going back to my old beliefs. I began reading about the many different
Write a positive review about a good book:  A Very Well Done Novel I've been meaning to read this for a while now, and finally got around to picking it up today.  It is a really well written, very well-written novel, and the ending was amazing.  So much so, I am going to be looking for it again to find out what happens to everyone after. 4.5 Stars A great read. I am glad I found this book! I have been looking for a novel that would really take me on a roller coaster ride of emotions. This is a rollercoaster.  I had a blast reading this book. I think I can safely say that I've fallen off the bandwagon to reading fantasy/sci-fi/horror novels, but this book definitely made me fall off. This is a very well done, well researched, well-thought-out novel. I can't wait to read the sequel, which is on the way. If you are looking for an excellent read, this is the book for you. It was fun, well done. I could hardly wait for the sequel.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This was very well written, and was interesting at times as well as not. It had a lot of details and characters that I liked, and it was fun to read as well. I am very glad that I picked it up.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read a lot of books over the years. The reason I've finally written a review about my favourite book was due to my daughter and son asking to read it to me. As a family, we all share a love of reading. We also have a love for reading history books. We always loved reading A.E. van Vogt's books as a kid, so I thought I'd give this book a try.  What I enjoyed about this book, was the fact that it was well written with an entertaining plot and a plot that took you by surprise. The world building was very interesting and the story was well told. It's a shame that this book was written in the 80's and the language may have been a bit more vulgar. If you are interested in learning about the Vietnam war, this book is a must have.  There are only two stars for this book because the writing is a bit rough and the characters are rather unlikable. However I enjoyed the story and it does take you on a ride to remember the war. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The last book I read by Terence McKenna was The Archaic Revival.  After finishing the book I was still a bit under the impression that McKenna had been dead for decades but I was pleasantly surprised to find out he was alive and writing new material in 2014.  I'm now convinced that McKenna was a completely unique individual.  The book is filled with a mix of personal memories and psychedelic insights.  In one section he tells of a visit to the Alhambra with a friend from high school.  I'm sure McKenna felt a kinship with this place since he spent the first few years of his life there.   In the last section he recounts a trip he had to the Himalayas.  After this he describes the psychedelic trip he experienced at night after a period of being high.  He talks about the realization of the existence of a higher intelligence that was at work behind the scenes.  This chapter was also written in the style of a short story, and the story itself is really good.  You should check this out.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've never read a book quite like this before. A really solid historical novel, but one that feels much bigger than it actually is. An excellent blend of character study and historical research.   I have to say though that I had a very hard time wrapping my head around the idea that this book took place in France, a country I have never even heard of. I was really looking forward to it because I like reading French literature, and I like historical novels, and the French are generally well known for being very interesting people. Unfortunately, that isn't the case here. There is no real connection between the characters and events in this book, and there is a lot of guesswork about historical events and people involved. I think that was what made it so enjoyable and fun to read. The characters and the situations seem to have a life of their own, and it's fascinating to try to make sense of it all.  . I also have to give the author credit for making a very believable, and really well written, historical setting. All of the people in this novel have names and faces that I know, and that is something I don't usually see in historical novels. A very real and believable setting, and very little effort was made to make the world feel real. It is, and is very impressive for a first novel.   the romance and the characters are the book's strength. It was really nice to have someone actually care about someone besides themselves. The love stories, and particularly the ones that were more focused on love, were really well done, and not at all contrived or forced. There was just so much to read about the characters, and even though I didn't find it as exciting as some of the other books in the series, I still enjoyed it.   of course there were some things I didn?t like. I thought that the ending could have been better, but that it still felt very right to me. There were some good things in there as well. I have to admit that I got a little excited about the potential for the ending, and was a little sad to see it go that way. But I think my reaction was actually to make sure I wasn't over-excited about anything. And this was just my own bias showing, so I don?t really know what the author was thinking. But in any case, I didn??t like how it ended for the characters. But, again, I don??

Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who is planning a trip or wanting to learn more about the local wildlife. This book is the third edition and is definitely not what I would call a light read. The chapters are very concise and the information is not too dense. The most frustrating aspect to me was that many of the chapters have absolutely no photos at all. Some of the photos were just a silhouette of a creature and it was hard to tell what it was until you got close enough to see the body. The second biggest frustration was that it is difficult to tell the difference between real and fake. I am a biology and science guy and I have never come across a book that really helps me learn something about the animals I see and I was glad to see there is one out there.

I am a big fan of the Twilight books and am excited to read the second installment in the series. I was a bit nervous as there was a good amount of information out there but I have to admit I was intrigued. I just wanted to see what the other books would be like. I'm so glad that I did, it was a blast. I didn't think it was as good as the first but that might have had to do with my first impression. The stories were so well done and told in such an entertaining way. The character development in this book was incredible and the twists and turns were interesting and all very unexpected. It was a great read." -SaraB   "Trying to get to know the different characters in this series was a challenge but I found myself falling in love with them all. The writing style was so different from anything I have read before. It had a new feel, which was wonderful. The only drawback was that the author did not give me any hints on which character is who so I had to work out for myself. In the end I decided that Bella is the girl with the best heart, which is probably one of the reasons why I liked her the most.

Stackstone (Narrator). Audiobook. Available from Audible. Read an Excerpt. "The Raven" is the name of Michael Stackpole's first novel. When I found this novel, I was quite intrigued by it. Although I was not yet ready to get into the series when I found it, I did read the first two books. Now that I have finished "The Dark is Rising" and "The Hunger," I find myself very interested in how the story will continue. Michael Stackstone does an excellent job of telling this story. His descriptions of the different settings, characters, and settings are quite intriguing. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of London during the time of King Edward I. "There was a sort of melancholy about London. It seemed the city had been left to rot, and people wanted to leave it, and it seemed to be a city of lost
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________________  An essential read for any person who is interested in the relationship of language and sex. I've just finished reading, and have read some of the reviews.   A book about the sexual dynamics of a language-rich, non-English-speaking culture can't be a bad read, but I thought the author did a great job of making this an engaging and entertaining read.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- A very strong read. I really liked the characters. They were well developed and I found myself really connecting with them, especially the female lead. She was very strong and I appreciated her in particular and her role as a mother to her family. This is the first book I've read by her. She doesn't have many female characters in her other books I've seen and this book was the first I've found and enjoyed. The characters all get very believable and the world is very detailed. I liked how each main character had something to do with the world. I don't usually read books that are like "A character gets involved with an alien race that is at odds with us and decides to be one of them and does something amazing. Now, it's your turn!" but this was very interesting. It wasn't just like a good-fantasy-movie "The Lord of the Rings" where you think "Oh, that will be awesome" but this went beyond that. It had some real depth. I got why people enjoyed it so much and I liked it. I read it on my birthday and I had the book a month later and I'm so glad I did. --------------- I really enjoy reading books in series. This one is no exception. It's an excellent read and I'll definitely be adding more to my library. A really great read and recommended
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* This is the only book I have read that I think is a masterpiece! It is a wonderful and funny romp that has the perfect blend of action and suspense. You'll be laughing out loud at what you read, at the clever jokes, and with how many different characters you're able to follow. The characters are also the best part of this story because you have an unbelievable amount of chemistry. It feels like a great friendship has been created. ************** I can only recommend this book to those who like great action, suspense, and characters. ***********  The Last Days of Alcatraz - by John Grisham  One of the funniest books I've read in a while, I can see why this book got so many awards. Grishman plays off of a couple of classic film's (the classic crime comedy from the seventies), Alcatrazz and The Italian Job, to make this one of the better books on the list. It's the perfect mix of action, comedy, suspense and a bit of romance. I can't wait to read the sequel. I'm definitely buying it from Amazon.com now!  J.L. James Book 5 - by J.L James  I really want to like this one. I like the premise (a woman is trapped in a hotel and no one is able to help her) but there's so much I don't like about it. It seems to have a lot of fans, but I'm not one of them. If I was a fan of J. L. James I might like this book but I doubt it.   A Night to Remember - by Barbara Kingsolver  This book is a very sweet romance. It had me laughing, crying and laughing again. The book is narrated by Sara, who is married to a man who can't keep his emotions in check. He is a bit more romantic than Sara and they are constantly trying to seduce each other. The couple spends a lot time together, enjoying each other's company and talking about their feelings. However, when Sara finds out she is pregnant she has some very difficult feelings about it, which gets complicated when she finds out that her husband is not the father of her baby. I thought this was a very romantic book, although I wasn't crazy about the sex scenes, they felt a bit forced. However when it's a book that has a heart that is so strong, it

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ A classic. I have read through the entire first three volumes of this book in about 10 years now. They are classics in my mind, not just in the genre of historical fiction. They have stood the test of time and I have not noticed a word of erosion. I know I am not alone in this view. I am in my 90s and it is hard to find books like this. I also love the author's humor, and the way he writes is very easy to read. You will enjoy the book, but if you are just a fan of history then I'd say the first three books would do just fine. I would recommend this book to both historians and to fans of history.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As I was reading it I was thinking about the many different people I have met on the streets, and how many different reasons I have to be glad to be where I am. I was also thinking about how much of life I have had to deal with, and it's a good thing I have not. I have come to realize that a good person is hard to find, and I am glad I have found him.   I really like the fact that the author is very honest and open to her readers, and really makes the reader feel as though she is right there with her. It's a book that just made me feel better about myself. I read another book that said it was the "best book in the world" but it didn't make me feel as good. I liked the idea of a story about a man, and a woman who are able to make mistakes and learn from them, and the way they get better because of it. I hope they both grow as people.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been enjoying this book. It does a great job in telling the story of a young man who has a serious addiction to a drug called "Vietnam Vomit". While the book is well written, it is really just a vehicle to get you to read more. It is well researched, though, with an author who is interested in the story rather than the way the drugs were created. I love the fact that we get to see what life was like for the drug dealers as well as for the ones who worked at the plant. It really gets you to know the people involved in the making of the drug.   The main problem with this book, for me, was the fact this book was written and published in the 70's. I have been trying to find a decent book about drugs written before the war on drugs. This book did a fine job, but that is a matter of taste.  - The book begins about a year after the end of WWII. While many vets had returned home, others had not. A few had returned, and were finding life very hard. I think that the author was trying to capture this in the book.   it is difficult to tell where the author began and where the book ended. My impression was that the book started out about the Vietnam era, but then we got into Vietnam in the end. This was very difficult to follow. But this was done very well, with a very engaging writing style.   He also did a good job at keeping the readers interested and engaged. I know he was trying hard to capture the drug world in the early 60's, and he was not successful. But at the same time, there are a few moments in this book that I would have liked to see more of. The story of the addict and the junkies was very interesting. As was the story about a young Vietnamese man who became an addict. But the story on the drug companies and the factories that make the dope was not as engaging.  , a Vietnamese drug dealer and his heroin operation. I liked this character, though he came off as not very nice. But we get a good view of Vietnam from his point of view. As well as a good look into the way drugs were produced in the 60's and 70's and how they affected the Vietnamese people. We see what the drug users had to deal with when they were using and what the drugs did to them. He does a good, good job

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ __________  I bought this book as a gift for my son. I've been reading to him since he was old enough to understand what I was reading. After reading this book he was hooked! I think it is a good way to get him interested in reading. I was so impressed with how well the writing was done. I have not been able to read any of the books in the series so I do not know what to expect from it. This is my 3rd or 4th book in the Harry Potter series. I am hooked on the characters. My son loved his first reading. The characters are so real! They have their own lives and their own fears. I hope they keep making the books. I like to have Harry and Hermione go to the zoo and get into trouble. I want to see Harry and Ron fight over books and candy. I will read them all! __________________________________________________________ __________________________ I love this series. There are so many different characters to grow up with that it's almost a challenge. Each time you pick up the book, you get a bit more of a sense of who they are and what their lives will be like. I love the friendships. I loved Harry's friendship with Draco Malfoy and his little crush on Cho Chang. Also, I loved Ron's friendship to Harry and his constant, almost obsession with the Weasley twins. I think the friendship between the three of them is the most important and most interesting aspect of the series. Hermione is a much more mysterious character to me. I don't know where she fits in. She's the most powerful witch in the Wizarding world, but she's also a bit naive and self-centered. She also has the potential to become a complete monster like Ron. There were some parts where it seemed like Hermione's personality was developing. I guess she learned that the best way to be the most popular person in Hogwarts is to be unpopular, not good or bad. I liked that the first five books were done in chronological order. This means that the older the characters become, the more their back stories are laid out and you can get a better idea of what their motivations are, what they're good at, and what they need to learn. This makes it easier for you to understand them better, and it also makes it a little more satisfying to follow through on certain events and characters that you've been meaning to know about. It was interesting to see the characters develop from

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is good and very detailed. I found it very interesting to read about the origin of many of the animals we see today. Also, the story of the Great Barrier Reef is an amazing story to read. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in animal origins. I think this book will interest many.   Rating: 3 out of 5 stars. This book is a great book to read and learn about various animals that live today, with an emphasis on the development of the animal in relation to its environment. This is a very interesting book, even though it was written more than 50 years ago.The book tells us how the origin and history of animals is fascinating and fascinating. In many ways, it gives you a better understanding of what an animal's environment may be like, and how that can affect its behavior and behavior patterns.This is a book that gives a good background into many animals that are commonly seen today. I did not find the book to be terribly detailed. The author writes well and is very knowledgeable about the many animals she writes about. It is a good read with good information and nice pictures.I would give this book a 4 star rating, as the book does contain a few errors in the history. This makes the book difficult to read without going back and correcting them. If the book had been updated in 2010, I would have given it a 4.5 or 5 star rating.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________  I was very disappointed with this book. I'm going to be looking for more fiction in the future.   The first time around I was really intrigued. It was about a girl, a girl who is a vampire. She goes around the world, making friends and enemies and being a hero and a bad ass. It is one of those book with some great characters that you don't want to leave and will read again. There is plenty of action, adventure, and romance.   a boy turns into a monster, a boy falls in love, a woman is attacked by a girl and she kills her with her crossbow, a knight and a monster fight each other, a guy falls in like, love with a girl (I forget her name) and they end up becoming best friends.  , there are some bad people in it but the bad parts are minor and they do things that you would think they would never do. Like the guy who is trying to kill the girl the vampire just so he can drink her blood but the vampire makes a deal with her and gives her blood. The other guy goes through some crap, goes back to his original life and becomes a bad guy and then does some more bad things like killing some people in a castle because he was mad at a princess. He is a good guy at the end of the book.     I liked the book the first time, but the book has been repeated and repeated. I hate repeating books and this one was repeated over and over again.   that was bad  it sucked. I don't know why this book got so much attention from everyone I know except for me because it wasn't very good.   has this really been re-done before?  not that i'm surprised because it hasn't been rehashed since the seventies and the other guy that was with her is the same guy from the other story.  .  There was some cool stuff about the vampire in the story, but she wasn't the character I liked the most. The one that was the most interesting to me was the girl who was the monster. I thought she was really cool but the only reason I liked her so much was because she was so strong and she is able to fight a monster. the guy that turned into the monster was okay.   the plot was not very interesting. there was some action, some good romance and some stuff about vampires and werewolves but the biggest
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________________________ The Black Heart in Her Eyes (by D.A.W. Phillips) The book was written in the 1940's. Phillips was a medical historian and was known for his research in the medical sciences. The book talks about a woman named Nannie Poythress and her affair with Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It discusses how Poystress died in 1946 and how her last words were: "I have forgiven. I love him so much that I can not help loving him again." The author has done an excellent job of explaining why Poy stress died and how Roosevelt managed to have Poy Stress stay with him for the last 25 years. Also he gives a little about the women who were in the same relationship as Poyston's and Roosevelt. The author explains how Poyle's wife had a baby in the 1950's. This baby was later named after the baby of FDR's friend. This is another good book if you are interested in the women behind the FDR family. It will answer your questions and will leave you thinking for a while.  Overall:    I recommend this book to anyone interested in Roosevelt's women. The women in the book are all important in the history of America, but only two of them are mentioned here. Nannie is also a woman that should be read about, but is mentioned in a way that does not add to her importance. She is just another in the long line of women that have played a large role in the rise of FDR. Also, you will see how FDR had a close relationship with a very strong woman. The other two women who are mentioned are also important to the FDR administration. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to know about Roosevelt's family, as well as his connections to other politicians in Washington.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. I've read it several times now, but have never got into a real discussion of it, but this time I just couldn't resist. It's not a book that I would have given my top rating for, but I loved it and will definitely read it again. There were many great aspects to this book that make it worth reading.   I'd recommend this book to both parents and children, and if you don't mind having to re-read it, it's a nice break from a story, even a story you've read many times.     1 of 1 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ If you read this, you already knew what this book was about. I enjoyed it! :) I also got a bonus book, "The New York Times Best Seller", and the first few pages were a little confusing (though that probably was only my fault). Overall, very good! Read all about the New York City subway system and how it changes over the years. The map was great too. I was pretty amazed by this one. The only thing I did not understand until the end was what the subway station in the photo was. I really wanted to visit the location but I didn't. I just wanted to read the book.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Last Days of Old Jerusalem by Stephen M. Goodrich In a strange way, I think Old Jerusalem is much more important than anything written about it in the recent past. This book is a must read for anyone wishing to understand the end of Old City. As with most things about Israel's historic past, the end story of Old city is shrouded in mystery. Yet the book does an amazing job of giving a clear picture of the final days of the city. With his usual clarity and power of observation, Goodrich lays out what went down. One is struck by how much history and geography is included. I don't think that most of us were aware of the fact that a large part of Jerusalem used to be in Jordan. I never understood this fact until reading this book. It turns out that the eastern part of the ancient city had been in the hands of Jordan since the early second millennium BCE, and that this is why the city looks so similar to it's eastern neighbor today. Also, it turns out the Israelites were actually fleeing this part of Judah and entering the Old City of Jerusalem. This part of Israel was actually the home of the Hittites who lived on the border of Jordan and Israel in the same area that we call Judea today. Jordan was actually their capital in the old days, but in the 8th century BC Jerusalem was taken by the Israelite King Hezekiah and became the capital of the kingdom that became Israel. The history of Judah is told here in the first person, and the reader is able to see the events unfolding as they are, from the perspective of an outsider. It seems as if the book is just describing history, but I think that Goodrich is able take the reader through it in a much more interesting way than the usual 'historian' approach. The book also tells the story of the conquest of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE. As much as Goodrich points out that this event is just an important footnote, he still manages to make it interesting to the reader. For example, it is interesting that many historians have noted that there were no temples in Jerusalem for the first three decades after the city was taken. Yet, Goodrick points out this fact, and explains that a major temple was destroyed by the Roman army on the same day as the Jerusalem Temple was destroyed, making the conquest seem like a small thing in hindsight. Goodrick does an excellent job of putting the historical events into their proper chronological

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- If you read this book you will learn how the brain makes decisions. This book is very interesting. There are two parts. The first part deals with "learning by doing." The concept is very easy to understand and most people can understand it. I didn't really understand it for awhile, but now I really do. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It is easy to read and the exercises make it easy. The only thing I didn´t like was the "what to do" part. It was too hard for me to keep up. I also had to read two books before this one.

I have been looking for an engaging and thought-provoking novel that covers a major theme (and even though it's not the theme of the book, its the theme that makes it so interesting to me). This one definitely gets my vote as a good read. The book was very well-researched and the scientific evidence was presented very well. The narrator did a great job in making the narrator relatable and believable. The characters were interesting and their relationship with each other kept me engaged. I think I enjoyed the book so much that I finished it in less than three days (but it's a bit long). I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good science fiction novel." -Sandra D.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________________________ I was so excited to pick up this book when it was on sale at Barnes & Noble. I love science fiction and fantasy and I love to read all sorts of books and I don't think I've ever read a book that I've enjoyed more. I loved the main character so much! She was an angelic being who saved the world and I loved her so much. I liked the way she handled her new powers. And I liked her voice. She was beautiful and a wonderful heroine! There were also many other characters in this book and I didn't know many of them, but they are all wonderful. There is romance, humour and the main plot which, for me, was very interesting and interesting for me. I don' t want to give too much away so I can give it a high rating, but it's amazing. If you have a love of science fiction or fantasy and love a good romance/comedy book, then you should definitely give this one a try. I can't wait to read more.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge fan of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series and read them as a teenager. I'm not sure where to start and wanted to try this but I think I may have to try the whole series and make the comparison myself. A few people have mentioned that the art reminds them of "Chronicles of Narnia" and that's probably part of it. But I don't know that I'll enjoy this book as much as I did Jordan's. This book starts out with two POV characters going at it. Both are good, but the one that ends up getting killed is much better than the one we see first. In Narnias the Prince died in the second book, in this book we meet him in the first book. I do find the second POV character interesting. In The Last Battle of the Wheel of time we see many POV characters die. In fact, the whole book. So I didn't care about this character that much. He seemed a bit out of place and I found it really hard to connect to him. He's not that evil, just not really in the middle of things that we need him to be.   The next POV character is a woman, a princess. She's interesting but I found her more like a cipher. She talks a lot but not with much conviction.  The third POV is a nobleman. He talks a bit and is pretty interesting and has a lot going on. He doesn't kill anyone, but he kills a lot of people. He has a love story and a bit of a past. We see his love interest in the third book but not in this one. He also has a story, about a family that was killed in a battle that he won, which he thinks is the one to end the war. He isn't a bad character but the story is so thin and a big part of the book has no bearing on the story of the other two POVs. He feels like an unnecessary character to me, and feels like it should have been split up. Maybe if it were split up I wouldn't mind the first POV character's story, but I don�t know. I was really hoping this book would be as good as the first one. The book is a bit different in some ways but doesn't really do anything new. It's the same story with some different characters. It was interesting, but not as good. It feels like a second or third attempt by
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* "I would recommend this book to my wife and children. My children are interested in astronomy as much as I am, but it took until I was in my mid fifties for them to really appreciate the wonders of the night sky. They know about planets, stars, galaxies, and comets; but are not aware of the various constellations, planets, or the constellate. These constellates are of interest to astronomers because they change with the seasons. It is a wonderful book and I wish I had found it sooner!" (June 21, 2005)
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I am very glad I came to this site. I am a big fan of Robert E. Howard and all his works. I read all his books in the old days, before the Internet. I've had many of his books collected before, but I haven't read any of his early stuff for over a decade. I got the first four issues of "The Wild Hunt" over the weekend. I bought them in small boxes. I was a little skeptical because the book is supposed to be written by Howard's "ex-wife" Anne Frank and he claimed she helped him write the books. I'm glad I listened to him. The writing was clear and entertaining. He did have to change some things from his original books, but nothing major, I liked what I read. "   Review by: Kevin L.   "This is a fine work of fiction that I read in hardcover and the first time I had a hardcover of Howard's stuff. The book was well edited and the story and characters were interesting."   My review:     The story opens with a group of students attending a party at Howard's home for the celebration of his 50th birthday. The story starts with the students having trouble understanding the purpose of the party, especially when Howard gives the students some interesting insight into the war effort. The next day he tells them that they must be the chosen ones in the war and that they are to be the ones to bring the war to its final end. He then gives them a new mission: to kill the leader of the Nazi party and any other Nazis who might try to join the party.  At first the students are hesitant, but the leader, a man named Wanda, tells them the leader's story. She tells them she is from a different planet and her planet has a long history of peace and prosperity, but then she tells the students that the Nazis, despite their best efforts, have been gaining power and influence in their war against other nations. Then she tells them how she escaped her planet by running away from the Nazis. Howard also reveals that he is the son of a great German general and that his father was a Nazi himself. The students are amazed to learn about the Nazis' past and are thrilled to be involved in the final battle. The war is coming.  in a series of attacks on the party the students must protect the leader and defeat the enemy before it becomes a final war.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________   I read this when it first came out in 1996. It is a great book.   The writing is excellent. It's clear and concise.   on the other hand the book is long, so it is a little confusing sometimes. There are a lot of different characters and the book starts out with the same group of people and their adventures. However the book keeps switching the focus of the adventures.   and there are a few things that don't make a lot sense.  :)  "I don't have to convince you to read this book... You don't need a reason...You just need to read it."  -A Reader's Digest review   _________________________   My favorite character is the "lone ranger." He is the only character to be really likeable. The others are dull or annoying. The other characters are a mix of "the loner" and "just another random human."   They have a great time riding on an airship into the uncharted mountains and then they have to travel down to the town where they are staying at.   the book has lots of twists and turns.   is a story about the adventures of a group of four. The main character is a ranger named Aragon.  's description of Aragon is very well done. There's lots of action and excitement in this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that is great because you really have to read it to understand it.  It is the story of an alcoholic couple and their love.  The plot is very well thought out and written, though the plot takes away a great amount of mystery.   There are a few parts where you start to wonder how the book is going to turn out.    However, the author is not afraid to take risks, and in this case, there is a good chance that you will like what you find.   The characters are very well portrayed and their thoughts, feelings, and actions are all very believable.   The author does not hide their personal feelings as much as he could have, but they are still well represented.   One of the more interesting characters is the alcoholic.  This guy can talk his way through most problems, and has no problem telling you all about how he is feeling or why he is depressed.  He is also very creative in creating alcohol and using it to make his way around the world.  It is also interesting to see how he uses alcohol and drugs to get around. One of my favorite parts of the story are the flashbacks.  They are used very well and they are very unique.  There is a lot of detail to the flashbacks, especially in the later chapters, which are great to learn more about how things went on in the past.   It is fun to learn a little about who the characters were before their lives changed forever.    Overall this is a great story, and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a story that is well written, interesting, and well acted.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________________________________ * * * The most fascinating and rewarding book I've read for a long time. I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need to say how much I appreciated this book. It's really quite something, and has definitely made me think more about the relationship between fiction and reality. * *   In some ways this is a sequel to The Book of the New Sun. The setting is the distant past, and the plot of the first book was to show what had happened in the time since the start of the universe. However, instead of continuing the narrative in the same way, this book picks up where the first left off. It follows an alternate history version of the Jedi Order, which has survived the destruction of the original Jedi Order at the end of the previous book. There are other books in this series, but this is the one that will probably resonate with most fans of Star Wars, and hopefully it will help you too.   However, unlike The Book... This one is not a straightforward historical novel. There is much mystery, and there is a lot of exploration of how the different cultures of the galaxy develop and interact. It is interesting to see how the various races of the Galaxy develop and develop their own unique ideas of right and wrong. This is especially true for the Jedi, and what makes them interesting is that their beliefs often conflict with the principles that they are forced to follow as they try to keep the peace between their various factions. It was really fun to see them come into conflict with other Jedi, as well as see the different perspectives they come across on the problems facing the galaxy.   is interesting in its own way, but in some ways the most interesting aspect of is its exploration of the role of religion in the galaxy, and how that has affected the galaxy since the beginning. There's much discussion on this, and we even see what kind of faith the ancient Jedi were following. The author explores different religious groups and their teachings, which give us a look at how people have come to be as they are, and that makes for some really interesting reading. There were some scenes that left me wondering if we were really just reading the history of the last thousand years of our galaxy, or something that has really happened, in real time. However it was well written and well presented, and it didn't leave me feeling that it was just another story that just happened to have Jedi in it.  This is probably my favorite of the four

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book, which is a fictional account of the history of the English language, was an interesting and fun read.  I was impressed with the historical facts in the book about how the English began.  I also found the grammar and writing to be accurate.  There are a few small grammatical errors, but they were easily fixed with a good grammar book.   I like how the authors take the time to include every single spelling that existed in English in the 1600's, which makes the story and characters more real.  This book also was a quick and fun way to brush up on English grammar.  The only complaint I have about this book is that the authors could have used a few more names in the story, so there are a couple of spelling errors that could have been corrected.  That being said, it is a fun book, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes history and fantasy.

I am looking forward to reading the next one.   My rating:    4.5 stars

Write a positive review about a good book:  When I was in elementary school, I read one of my friends' books and I really liked it.   I wanted to read it, and I wanted to have a hardback of it so I could remember all the cool stuff in it.  So, I found one at my local library and I read it as soon as I got home, I just couldn't wait to do it. Well, my friend had the idea of publishing the book, so I ordered a hardbound.  I am so glad I did because it was the first book that I read for sure and I loved it. The characters are very likeable and they have some interesting things to say about life, death, and people.  It is a very good book and one that will keep me reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:  There are few authors I can think of whose style and writing I like more than Chris Beck.  This is one of them.  One more thing :    This is a terrific read.  I was surprised at how well the book conveyed a sense of the time and place.   It was written with such a sense for how the people of the day thought and acted that it was a joy to read.  I'd read a lot of history books on the Civil War, so I have a good idea of how a lot these people thought, but this book brought history into the present and present into history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was really enjoyable and I really enjoyed all the ideas. The author has a lot of insight into different things in life and it is really useful to have some more information on what are the best practices to take in each stage of life. As the author says in the foreword, to have a great life you have to take care of your mind as well as your body. The best way to take these things into account is to read and use different kinds of books, but I think this one definitely makes a great addition to the library.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book. My kids read it to me over and over and it is an awesome story.  It is not the type of book you can just pick up and read to your kids and it will be awesome.

I wish there was a story book like this in which you could give it to your children and your kids will get hooked on it as soon as they can. I wish this book existed when I was a kid.  4) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, by J.K. Rowling The most amazing thing about Harry Potter is the fact that Rowling knows her way around a Harry Potter story. The Philosopher' s Stone is the first book in the series, and that first book is absolutely brilliant.  The story is about Harry, Ron, and Hermione growing up in an orphanage and getting into trouble.  They get into so much trouble that they have to be saved by a group of kids, called the Order of the Phoenix.  While most people have no idea that Rowling is actually a fan of Harry Potter, it turns out that she was a huge fan.  She even included a small section on her personal website about it.  Harry is a very realistic character and that is what you like to see when you read a book.  We see Harry grow up and change as he grows up.  If you haven't read the books you really should.  This is a story that everyone should read, and if you are not interested in Harry Potter then you are missing out.  There are so many stories in Harry's story and they are all good stories.  Some of them I will never be able to see on the big screen.  My only problem with Harry Potter was the fact he was a boy.  As a woman I can tell you that that is the worst thing you can be.  Maybe I am getting old, but as a woman that is a terrible thing to say.  When I was younger and I was watching Harry Potter I never thought of him as a boy, I always thought of his as a guy.  But as I got older and grew up I realized he was actually a boy and I got over it and never thought about it again.  For me I think the best thing about the books was the way they introduced

The illustrations are all in color so it is a great book for the whole family to read together! _______________________________________ I was born after the Great depression but was raised during the 1960's and 1970's. That's right. Before the "Great Depression", it was the 1960s and 1970s. You couldn't get anything on TV except the old shows and they were just that, old. You didn't have cable or satellite or anything else that would have allowed you to get a TV. There was the VHS, a very good video format, but VHS didn't seem like a very smart format for movies. Also there were some other videos that were pretty good for the price and then there was the "videorite" format which was very good for sports, but not much else. The movie theater had a limited selection of movies because it was still in business and they needed the business. ______________________________________ I have heard that the book is available for Kindle. How is that possible? ____________________ If you can help me in any way, PLEASE PLEASE do so. Thank you very much! Thank you! _________________  I've got the book in my hands and it is great. My wife is going to read it as a Christmas gift! Great job!  Great book, with some good quotes. If you have some family and friends in the US, this is a must have book for them too.  So I have a problem - when I first saw this book I thought the book was about a group of people living during the Great American Depression and that's just what it was, but now I have the paperback version and it's all about a man who is a writer, and he has a story to tell about the Depression, and the author did a good job of that too. I thought it was great. A great book and well worth the price. It will take me a long time to get through it but it will be worth the time. Thanks.  the Great book

Write a positive review about a good book:    "Gripping! I would say the stories are the best part of this book. It's a real story with the characters' lives.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- In the end I must say this is a wonderful read for a very good reason! My wife and I love it. This is our first romance. But we've enjoyed many and will read more. We are both so happy to find out we love them all.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Marybeth23 from Love! I love this book! The writing is easy to read, the story is compelling, and the characters are so realistic. I wish it had been a little longer, but for what we have already read, this was great!  Reviewed by Linda E. from So Real! I bought this as a Christmas gift. I'm thrilled that we read it. We're in love!  "One man is a prisoner on a starship. Another a member of a race he has never met. One is a member for the first time."  The protagonist, Edward (the protagonist, that is), finds himself in the midst of such a drama of his own making. In his own words, he "sings in the clouds." Edward must decide to take control of his life...and his relationship with the man he has a romance with. But can he? Is he really ready for love? Will he be able to break free of the cage in which he has lived for so many years? And the truth behind the story...why did they leave? These are questions to which he and the reader alike must find the answers. Edward is a romantic in love with his long-time love, Susan (not his real name) and a man trapped by the circumstances of his birth and an unrequited love. He doesn't know his true identity...until he meets her. . It was fun! It was the first romance I had ever read. I enjoyed the characters and the romance and whatnot. And the characters were so real. It is very hard to believe that these are the same characters I have known all my life. I really liked the story and felt like it kept me interested throughout. There was a certain type of romance (in my opinion), that I like, and this did not disappoint. It didn't have much going on, but it was fun to read about! And this will not hurt my rating. I would definitely recommend this to anyone! It is a nice and entertaining story, and a good way to start your first romance!  I'd recommend this book, especially if you are a fan of
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book very much. I really enjoyed reading and I love that the book is in two parts, so you get two books. My kids also really enjoyed the book.   My only complaint about this book is that I wish that it had had more than the basic plot. The book is pretty basic and you could have easily cut out the extra "adventure" if you wanted, and I would have loved if the book had been just about the same plot in the two parts.  - There were too many people who were so "mature" that their actions and words felt so "unacceptable". I know that some people have a hard time accepting what is happening to our society, but it seemed to me that many of the actions and comments in this book made people feel that way.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This is by far the best book I have ever read about photography. I'm an amateur photographer who has had some difficulty with the technical side of things but had a great time doing what I was doing at the time: shooting photos for fun. When I started, I never really considered the technical part and did what I could to get the most out of my camera and camera bodies. That is what this book is about. It takes you from an early beginner to an expert photographer. I enjoyed it. The author took his time to explain the technical points and how it really applies to everyday life. The book is very practical. You can use this book to learn photography at your own pace or just read the sections that interest you most.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Girl in the Tower by Jennifer Egan.  It's a brilliant, disturbing, and incredibly-emotional novel that takes place in a time when women are not able to leave their husbands.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________  ______________ is a superb blend of narrative and analysis. It is beautifully written, clearly and concisely conveying the message of one of my favorite books (Rudy, on poverty), and conveying it so clearly I don't feel like I'm reading a "blurb" (and that's what it is).   I will admit I am a skeptic on how effective poverty can be a tool for change. The book makes it abundantly clear that there is nothing we can do to alter our circumstances in this world and we can't even change our circumstances. In fact, as we have seen, the poor people we see are not the victims of circumstance but the victims themselves of the circumstances in which they find themselves.   This book shows that we have to examine all the other aspects of our lives if we want to address the causes of poverty. We have to address racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination. We can make a difference by changing our actions. This book, for me, is an eye opener and a good reminder that we can change.  .

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the way it was written. It was so good, that I read it twice, and re-read it because I was so hooked and it kept my attention! "We are all so much more than our job description." - The Chief of Police "I love what I do. I love the work itself. I know I'm good at it, I know what I'm doing, I have friends at my station that are really talented and they know me as a person, but when I get into the car, I feel as though I'm back in my youth and all I want to do is be with my people. I go out into the community, and I'm surrounded by people that make it so easy for me to do what I love. I can go to my neighborhood bar with my police friends, and have conversations with people I have worked with my entire life. It's so easy to put my own ego aside and listen to what they have to say. I'm so thankful that the people I work with are there to help me accomplish my dreams. It is my dream that every one of my people at every department has a job that they really love. So if you want to make sure your family is there when you pass away, if you can't be there for them, they don't have to be there. We can always go out there and help our people. That's what it means to be a police officer." "There's more to us than what we put on paper." - Sgt. James Johnson "There are two things that matter. We work for a living. And we live for a reason. We want our family to be strong and free." - Officer Daniel O'Connor "I don't do it to make the world a better place. I do it because it is what I have to do." - Sergeant Scott Hite "What I know as a police officers is that there is a lot more to a police department than a badge and a gun and a uniform." - Inspector John Ritter "When you're in the uniform, it makes you feel good to think that you are doing something. I don't think there's anything you can do to take that away, because it's something you're born with. It makes you a better person and a better parent and a healthier person. I wouldn't trade it for anything." - Lt. Michael Hite "It's not a job. It ain't

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm new to the area of self-publishing. I found this book very helpful in my research for the first book I'm going to write, but I'm always looking for new resources. I've been very happy with the quality of the writing, the clarity, and the insight I've gained from reading the book. I like the fact that it's very technical, and I think there's a good mix of practical and theoretical information. I'm already planning on reading the second book.  Overall Rating: 9.8 out of 10,  (review of free book) Posted by Mary Anne at 5:04 PM A great book. The first chapter on how to write a successful book is great and worth the time and money. I had a friend who worked for a small publishing company who had the same problem. He got a copy of the book and read it. He had trouble with the first few chapters and got them all the way through. In fact he did so well he gave me a copy to review. I'll try to get a copy for myself. I also like the way the authors deal with publishing. They don't make the claim that it will save you all your money but that you will make more from writing, editing, and selling.   In conclusion, I'd recommend this book for anyone who needs a book on this topic. 
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I think this book is an excellent introduction to how to play. The way the pieces fit together and move in harmony really makes the game exciting. I am looking forward to playing this with my friends. There's nothing like having a group of friends sitting around a table, drinking a beer, and talking about the latest version of Settlers of Catan to really give it that "kick" as they play. I've heard it described as a "game with a moral" and I think that's an apt description for how much fun it is. ---------------  Find the best deal:  A great game for all ages. I love the strategy, the bluffing, the strategy and the tension. This is a good game for everyone from adults to small kids. The game itself is very playable with or without cards in it. I can't wait for the expansions!

Write a positive review about a good book:  As an avid reader I really enjoyed this book. I've already read the first 3 in the series but I have the 4th and the final in my hand. I read this book before I started with the 4 and it was great to catch up. I found the character development quite good. Although I'm not as familiar with the characters, I found them quite realistic. The main character is definitely very strong willed. I was really worried that this book would be very predictable. The book follows an "island" in the Indian Ocean and as you follow the story's progression you find out that things are not as they seem to be. One thing I like about the novel is that there are more than a few secrets and twists in the book. It would be nice if the author would have developed a little more as she went along but the characters do develop and you find some of them are quite intriguing. The ending was a bit abrupt but for the most part I liked the book and I look forward to reading the next one.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ "When I read The Good Lie, I had a profound, humbling revelation. I was on the verge of losing the ability to trust people. I could not believe that so many people, who were seemingly so smart and accomplished, could be so deluded, so willing to believe anything they read or see on television. People who are good, decent, and honest do not deceive other people, even when it is to save themselves from a lifetime of shame, disgrace, or death. In the end, there is no excuse for any of it. I think that is a powerful message and that it may not be as easy for me as it seems. This book has changed my life." — Anonymous   "As a therapist and as a parent, it is comforting to be able to put my own beliefs to rest and to realize that others can see the truth as well." — Michael   _________   This is a great book that shows you how to recognize deceptive people. The Good LIE reveals why so many deceitful people get away with it, what they are actually doing, and what you can do to avoid being duped. The author does a wonderful job of laying out the evidence, including examples. The book includes a short chapter on "The Dark Side of the Lie" that provides examples and examples of people who have lied to save their own hides. This is also a very good book for anyone who wants to discover how the deceptive are motivated to deceive. The story is really interesting to read, and the authors present compelling and informative information.

It makes a strong case for the importance of looking at the way people behave and the ways they justify their actions. What is most important is to recognize deception so we can avoid or correct it.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  I bought this book in May 2006, and have read every single page. The description is really clear and simple, and this is what I want in my textbooks. I am using it with my AP US History, and I have learned a lot. The text is extremely clear, and not at all complicated. I have to admit that I was a bit puzzled by some of the concepts. The book starts with how the United States was founded, and then goes into the history of the Civil War and Reconstruction. This is a very interesting section. I didn't really get the history from it, it was very general and dry. I was expecting to see the details about the Civil Rights Movement, and the Civilian Conservation Corps. The Civil War was good reading, I liked that it was clear and that we are still talking about it. The Reconstruction period was excellent. The author describes it well. After the Civil war the country was in shambles, and Reconstruction was good. The last decade of the 20th century was a pretty bad time in the U.S. The history of World War II was interesting. I liked it because it explained what the Americans were thinking about in World War 2 and it was interesting how Hitler was able to gain the support of some Germans. It is clear that the Americans did not want another war and that they tried to prevent a second world war. I enjoyed reading this section. The next section I really hated. The war in Iraq was a disaster. The U.N was the real reason behind the war. They just wanted control of oil. It was the most stupid mistake ever. Then they went into the Muslim world and created another civil war in the Middle East. The Americans got caught up in it. I found it kind of sad that the authors did not write about how Saddam was a real threat to the U:S. and how they had to deal with him and that there was a huge terrorist threat to them. I read a lot of books about the Cold War. This book wasn't one of them. This section just makes me wonder how many people are making money in the book sales. I know this book is very cheap, but it still is really cheap.   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the only time I had to take out a second book in a single purchase.  When I came across this book in the library, I was excited and I read it straight through.    It is not really the sort of thing that can be read in a sitting and will give you enough of a review to justify your purchase. If I were to put a positive spin on this book, I'd say it is written very well.  When I finished the book, it felt as if I'd been reading it for an extremely long time. I found it to be an interesting book with a unique and interesting set of characters.  I have a friend who has a love of the military.  He was the type of guy who always wanted to get in.  It was his dream to go and fight for his country.  The last I heard of him, he was in a hospital recovering from an injury he suffered while fighting.  His friend had been at the hospital with him for a while.  This would have been a perfect opportunity for my friend to meet a man he may have been interested in having as a husband.  But, because of something very out of his control, he can't have that chance.  However, he never gave up on his dream.  Instead, he continued to think of other ways to meet women.  If you've ever been on a journey of trying to meet someone, this book is a great place to start.  You may not meet your dream husband, but you will get a sense of what is involved with being on the journey of love. Good read:   This is one of those books where the subject is the men and the work is about the women.   It was well written.  To be honest, I don't remember much of the story because I was so engrossed.  Maybe I had a headache or something.  All I really remember was that my man was there.  They never mention what their relationship was like.  One of my friends said he was just there to keep the peace and his wife didn't want anything to do with him.  Of course I was curious.  I highly recommend this book.   If you are trying to get into a relationship with a woman and are going on the wrong path, this will help you.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  This book has been a life-changer for me. A few years ago I was a very self-destructive person. I was very angry, resentful, and very angry about the way life was. I didn't have a strong desire to live. I wanted to sit and stew in my misery for all eternity. But I had been taught that anger is something to be controlled. And that it's the opposite of what we should be doing in life.  I learned that if I could control my anger, I could conquer anything. That I could accomplish anything I set my mind to, if I simply controlled myself.  on the other hand, it was very clear that if you don't control your anger, it can turn you into a raging lunatic. And this is something I have suffered from my whole life, so I know firsthand that it can happen.  that it takes a lot more than control to be happy. That it takes commitment, patience, and patience to be a successful, long-term, happy person. .  in addition to the positive benefits to me, the book was very well written and the advice was incredibly practical and relevant to people who are experiencing the same struggles that I was at the time. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a way to live their life to the fullest and be happy with themselves.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really looking forward to this book. This book has really made me re-evaluate many of the beliefs I had about the world and many things in life. I have spent my whole life having a certain type of mentality and believe things simply because I was told. But after reading this book I am learning to think on my own. I am still not 100% sure I believe it but I am beginning to.  The only issue I had was that this book is a bit on the long side. The chapters were just too long. However it did make the book more interesting and I felt that was worth it.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ The idea of having a physical book of the Quran was exciting. We did not have one. We had a CD for the same reason. I did not realize the full power of the Arabic script until reading this book. We now have two copies and will be buying the others. I enjoyed the introduction and explanation of what was involved with obtaining a physical copy of the book. The book has a great amount of information and a good understanding of how it came into existence. I look forward to reading it in the future. Verily! We have certainly sent down a revelation to you, as the Lord has said: "Verily, I am the Lord of the Worlds, and I have sent down the Book into their midst: I know what they say." (Quran 18:9) It is now time to put to death the ignorance of people. It is now my hope to see that every man will become a Muslim and will understand and accept the words of the Qur'an. God will certainly help him. (Qur'an, 13:11) The Qur'ans of all times have been of two kinds: (i) the Books of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) which are the eternal teachings of God, the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.), and the last scriptures (unto them is due the worship and good name) (Q'uran 7:157); and (ii) the Sacred Book that God has sent down, after the Messenger of God (P.B.U.H.) became dead (Qahaf) which is the Sunnah of the Messenger (Pb.U'H.). The book of Allah is the Holy Qur'aan. The Messenger (S.) received the revelations in a period of about 40 years (7:157). The revelation came in the form of surahs and hadith from Allah through the Holy Prophets (P), his brother and companions. Some of the companions left after the death of the Holy Messenger (s). When the verses, the hadith and the chapters of the Book were collected into the Holy Book, the Prophet (s) was in deep sleep (Qatadah). After a period in deep meditation, the Book was revealed in the Quranic verses. When the book was received into the holy place, Allah revealed all the divine words of creation and revealed the holy Qur'anic verses in the shape of Surahs (ch
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's just so great. I bought it, read it, and put it back, and never looked back. It is a wonderful example of a man's life, and in so many ways it is a good story, one that anyone can relate to, be they human, or animal, etc. The way I relate to it, the way I believe it is to be a good life, is by saying the following: I hope it makes you feel good. I hope you feel a bit like I do, but to a slightly greater extent. I feel I owe my life to these people and to my life in general. I believe in doing things that make me happy, in doing them as much as I can, in having an attitude of "I'll take what I can get" and in being the best I can be for what is most important. I know that people in general are far more likely to have these thoughts than they may ever know. I also think there is value in talking about and thinking about a particular issue. And so if you find yourself thinking a certain way about the current political situation, you might have something to say about it, or even to do with it. I was inspired to do this in part by a conversation with one of the characters, who told me about his experience with the government while he was in the military. It was something that was very common during my childhood (and some of my younger cousins, too), but I just never really got into it. My parents were pretty liberal, but they never seemed to be concerned with what political parties, groups, or "tribes" were. But he (and others) said the military is not like that, that they're really good at keeping a lid on things, and that's something I wanted to know about myself. I'm still a little fuzzy on what the military did that made it so effective, and I'm not sure that I have a "correct" answer (I'm sure many of us have questions about how a group of people works with one another and the way it works is always subject to interpretation) but I'm convinced that whatever it was, the military has a lot to teach us. And that was something I found very inspirational, and something that I wanted my younger cousin to think about, too. And then, in the last section, there is a brief note that the story has been brought to an end. And it is written by a woman, and

It keeps me hooked and motivated to read more.  , my favorite characters are all unique and fun to read about.   a great introduction to the world of the  is the perfect introduction to this world.   - I really appreciated the different viewpoints of characters. The book did not follow the usual narrative of POV's only focusing on the perspective from each of the different characters' point of view. That kept me very entertained.  . this book was well-written. there was a lot to like and not only that it kept me on the edge of my seat.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "I am a big fan of the books on this site. They are very easy to follow, and give you a clear picture of what the book is about at a minimum. And the author gives you plenty of background info and details which are usually not available for reviews of other books, and it helps you understand and see where the author has taken you in the plot. This is the second book in the series, so it is just right for the time. It is fun, exciting, and engaging. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get a good understanding of what kind of person the characters are. I'd even say it's well written, and that's usually an endorsement for the book. There are a few plot elements in this book which will probably be annoying to some, but it's really not my cup of tea, so that's no big deal, I hope." This is not a review. This book is my first one and I have enjoyed it.  I am going to write my thoughts and feelings on it. I found the book interesting enough to read. I had a lot of fun and liked the characters. It's easy to see where they have taken the people to. I am definitely going to start a new series because this book has many good ideas and I was glad I read it. A good read!  The book was short and did not get boring. I enjoyed it and will be reading more books from this author. The first book in this series is The Dragonstone Chronicles: The Black Sword. The book has two main characters who are both fighting for their lives as their parents are dying. I liked the book very much. It had a nice mix of plot and character, there was a lot to learn about the history of the kingdom and it's citizens. It also had an interesting mix of political intrigue and romantic drama. I thought it was great. The author's worldbuilding was well done and I liked how the story took place in that world. It was a well put together story. The characters were well written and did what they were supposed to do. I will definitely recommend this book to those who have enjoyed other books by this author and would like to see more from this series.  The second book, The Dragonstones Chronicles, The Redstone Chronicles, is now available. The book had a good mix of character and plot. The plot was good and it had a little bit of political romance as

There is a very strong tendency for people to try and use language to describe things that are more complicated than that.   I'd say I'm more of a descriptivist and think it's good to talk about things that aren't as simple as simple.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This book was interesting, though a bit dry. There was some of the common fantasy tropes in it. It made me curious about other fantasy authors and maybe some new ones would follow. It's hard to describe this book to someone who has never read a book like this before. I'm very glad I read it, though, because I have a feeling I would like the book even more now.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very impressed with this book! It is so much better than my previous books on the same subject (which are still excellent). The concepts are so much more complex and detailed that this one is almost too good to be true, and not too bad.   It takes you step by step through the process of growing a crop. It's the first book on the subject that I have read that does a good job explaining why some of the different ways to grow your own food can be dangerous to humans and other animals in the long run.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** This book is an important contribution to the understanding of the Bible by an early New Testament scholar. It is an indispensable resource for students of the first century who want to know how the New Testament authors understood Jesus, the cross, and the gospel of Christ. I would recommend it to anyone seeking the true meaning of Scripture.  Review of a good novel: ************* This is a very good book about the origins of Christianity. It's a very interesting read and very well written. I enjoyed the story and had a lot of fun reading it. It makes an interesting topic to study the early Christian faith and early Christian history. Highly recommended!  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Art of the Deal by Donald Trump "It's a terrific book, and it's really well written. It has the Trump touch. The thing that makes it so great, it's not just the way he does it, but his personality. The fact that he's not a politician, or that he can be that way. We're not used to that at all." -- Stephen Dubner, host of the podcast Freakonomics "You may know that the book has become very popular on social media. In an age when information is abundant and people have become impatient for access to it, The Art of The Deal has become an unlikely touchstone." -- The Atlantic "I can't say enough good things about the book. It's written like a business manual and is a must-read for anyone interested in the art of the deal." -- Forbes "The Art Of The Deal is as close as we can come to a Trump memoir...Trump is in full control of his own narrative... Trump has made the book his own and the world's best-kept secret...I highly recommend it." -- Vanity Fair

In fact, it might be the book I've found myself returning to the most often as I get into programming!  Overall I am very happy with my decision to buy this book. It is a useful reference guide to understanding and programming in general. I was amazed at just how much there is to learn!  is my go-to reference for software development. I always have this on my shelf. It's the perfect size, and its contents is always helpful. This is one of the very few computer books I would recommend to a total beginner (as this is not for everyone). It is also the only book I have ever seen that is comprehensive about the whole topic. You won't find that in any other book (except maybe a couple of very specific books).
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ _________________________________________________  "The Storyteller" is not my favorite book of his, but it has a great message that I feel strongly about. It is a good, straightforward account of the history and current state of the world, and I think he has done a wonderful job of telling it. I have a hard time believing that he could have been better at his job than he was, and it is hard to imagine a more well-researched book or more well worth the money.  - Robert L. Young, Ph.D., Professor of History  It is a work of astonishing complexity and depth, and if it seems overwhelming to read one single book about history, it is easy to understand that one person could not possibly have read all the books he mentions. But if you are thinking about studying or working with history, or if you simply want to have a better appreciation for how the world really works, this book is a must read.  "The Story" is a fine book. ... This book is as entertaining and informative as it is informative.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only problem I found with the book is the fact that I read it at the same time as reading a book by another author on a similar topic. The book is quite good, but this one is more of a historical novel than a scientific book. It is more like a history of science, I think. However, I still found it interesting, because it discusses the development of science and the impact that new ideas have on the development and progress of science. The author covers many topics, but focuses on the evolution of human knowledge from the Neolithic period onwards.   This book is also interesting because it is in Russian, and so it might be useful for those who would like to understand a little more about how the history of a particular field or area of scientific knowledge was developed, or which techniques and ideas were adopted or discarded by scientists at particular times.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love The Art of War  by Sun Tzu. This is a great book and I like the way he presents the different concepts. I also enjoy The Art and Science of War by Sun Tung. Both of these books give you the background information needed to make sense of war, but the main thing I like in both of them is how Sun T's book can also help you find your own path.  For example, in The Art, Sun T uses examples of the war that took place in China between the 2nd and 3rd Century AD, where the Chinese were defeated by the Chinese army led by Han Guan. While the Chinese had superior technology and were very well organized, they did not have the same type of training as their enemy did.  One thing I didn't like in this book is that it doesn't have a lot of images or illustrations and it's only in the back of the book.  In addition, I would like to have a chapter devoted to the importance of visualization in war.   While I enjoyed Sun Tuan's book, I didn' t see much of an application in his ideas for how to win wars in real life.  He talks about the importance (at least to him) of making it hard for your enemy to see you, but not impossible. He also talks about how you need to be "on the alert" at all times. However, I felt that these concepts have very little relevance for the modern soldier and military.    The book's best parts are when it goes into the art of war of different cultures and societies and how those methods differ. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If there's one thing I learned from this book it's to not go in for the easy route. The authors have created a world that feels alive and they go out of their way to get the reader to engage with it. They make use of a variety of techniques and themes, all of which are intriguing. This isn't something for everyone, but if you've ever felt overwhelmed by the many options and complexities of the subject matter in general you'll find that this book is perfect for you.  Read less
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. It's not that I'm a big fan of sci fi, but I did enjoy it. There are some very interesting and fun concepts that really don't get explained in the story but are just plain cool to think about. The characters are also very interesting. I think my favorite character in this book was probably the little girl. She is very brave and kind, and just an all around good kid. If you like characters like her, and you like sci fi too, you'll love this. It has great writing and a fun concept and the characters are just fun to read about.

He knew it was a delusion, but it had become his entire life. He was a man now, and in the end, he was destined to become the ruler of an entire continent, a people known only as The Dragons. A continent that was on the verge of being destroyed.A long, long time ago, on the world of Golarion, there was a long forgotten empire called The Empire of Men. The Men were a peaceful people, they believed that they were the chosen ones of the gods. For many years they had lived peacefully until a dragon came into the world, a powerful beast, which was destined for destruction. To stop the dragon, The Men fought and defeated it. The men were so impressed with the victory that they decided to seal away the beast, as a great weapon of war and peace against all dragonkind. They did, but within the centuries that the beast was sealed away in the hidden fortress known as Umber, a new threat emerged. It was the Children of the Dragon, a race of humanoid dragons born from the union of human mothers and dragon eggs, and they were known for their great strength and magical abilities. The Dragonlord (dragon master) had become obsessed with the Dragonlord, and he wanted to be the leader of the Children, not only for the great power it gave him but also for the ultimate prize, the power to take over the entire world. To do this he would need to find the last remaining living dragon, the last one, to finally kill and take over his entire race. The Children of The Dragon were willing to give him their lives, in order to help him. But first, they had to find this living dragon.In the world's third continent, The Dragon Empire of Galt, the greatest kingdom in the entire continent of Gont, sits upon its great castle in the forest known as The Citadel of Dragons.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't know about you, but when I heard about this book I knew I had to read it.  Not because of the plot or the fact that it was about a girl who could see the future, but because of its content.   I have read many times the stories about these people (most of which are true) who claimed to see the events in their future and knew when they would happen.  I always figured that they were deluded.  How could they know things that they knew nothing about?   Well, it turns out that they really do.  They see everything, but they just can't see it yet.  Sometimes they can see the signs, but nothing is actually happening until they start doing something.   Sometimes, they do see things and they act on it.   And sometimes they don't.  And, of course, the ones who believe they have special powers to know when the future is about to occur, often have great trouble seeing it. Well, that's just it.    These people are crazy.  What they do, and how they act when they see the wrong things, they are totally and utterly insane.  You just know they are going to act stupid.  There are plenty of people who can do this, who are in this world and who see the right events to happen.   It's not so hard to believe.  Because they do.  The plot is pretty standard.  One of the characters is a woman who has all kinds of superpowers.  Her job is to predict the future.  It seems to be her specialty.  So, she is sent on a mission to see how many people in the world have this power.   Well, things are not looking too well.  She has a pretty bad case of hers when she goes to a town and sees that a big fight has broken out between the gangs of the area.  But, she doesn't do much.  When the gangs are beaten, she's not impressed, but she thinks that the people will take some time to get over it. She goes back to her home.   But, of the people who were there that day, there is one guy who she cannot forget, and she's sure that he saw the events before they happened.  That's a lot of "seeing".   Well.  The thing is,     She thinks he is crazy.   She
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________   This book, when put into practice, has the potential to be a great gift. There are a lot of things I can't stand about life, like people who don't respect others, people who are rude to the point of insanity, people with little to no conscience, people without a desire to improve themselves, people whose ego doesn't allow for introspection, people that act in a violent way or a passive way without thinking of the consequences, and a list that could go on for a while. But then the real problems start - like the fact that life is very short and it will probably be gone soon, and that we are basically stuck in this body.   We need a lot more self awareness - even if we don't know it, we need to be aware of our emotions and our emotions are the main problem in my mind. I would not recommend this book for everybody - it's not written by a professional and the book could have been better. But if you are serious about learning how to overcome the problems you're facing, this book is for you.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book, it's not a very good book but not bad. A decent read. I read the first couple chapters and liked it. Then I read it again. It was really bad. Then my friend recommended it and it became a lot better and better.   So the first problem is the writing. There are a lot of mistakes, spelling, grammar and punctuation. Some of these are bad enough to make the entire book look bad, and some of them were really bad enough that I was embarrassed.   I read some of the reviews on Amazon and I was really annoyed when people said these problems were fixed in the next edition, that was silly, there were tons of typos, even though the spelling had been fixed.   It's hard to describe the problem with the writing and the grammar and the punctuation...it just made the book sound bad and the words seem to be stuck in the wrong order and sometimes you can't tell if it is a sentence or a section, which makes reading hard.  . I also thought that the whole concept of being reincarnated was kinda lame, especially since we don't know why he wants to become a magician...maybe his parents don't think he would turn out good enough, who knows, who cares.

Write a positive review about a good book:     I read this book because a family member is having an inpatient stay at my home and was interested in a short book to help her get through this time and get her to a better place with a lot of reading that is not so technical and detailed.

It is not the most realistic of books, but there is still a lot to learn about the nature of dementia and how you get out of the fog of the disease that is hard to overcome.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best science fiction book I've ever read. It is so thought provoking and compelling. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, I have to admit. This is a very well written book with interesting ideas. The concept of wormholes is fantastic and intriguing. Also there is an aspect of science fiction in which a wormhole would have been a good place to go. But it doesn't end there. The writing is extremely well done. I would give this book an extra star, but the cover is not very appealing to me. The cover is nice, but it's a black cover, and I think it looks kind of fake. The book also doesn't fit the format very well. It's a hard cover and has a soft cover inside that I can't wrap it up like a book would.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I thought the book was great. The story was simple, and the story it had, and did it justice. It was told in an honest, straightforward manner, with no cheap shots or over-complicated plotlines. It just...was. I could not have asked for anything better.   What did I like:  -The way in which the main character, a boy with a troubled past, learns about how to solve problems with his hands, and in his own mind.  The boy had a lot of trouble learning how to do simple things like write or draw, because his mind always wanders, and it was hard to keep him focused. He found a friend that taught him how to draw.  in the end he learns that he does not need to be told how to think. -I found it interesting to see the girl, and she is not the only one, grow into her own self confidence. , but then again she is also learning to take the good with the bad. 's love of her pet hamster was touching.  and her character development is amazing.  the way that he went from a boy who could do nothing to being able to do almost anything he wanted was wonderful. I am sure she will grow to love his pet hamsters the same way I do, and I am certain that he will be a huge help to her on her journey. . The story is beautiful, simple, yet effective in showing the main theme in the book, and also showing how it is a character's life, and their actions and choices, that makes a difference in their life.   the way in to the story was done.

I always enjoyed the books but didn't have much to relate them to. I have been reading them on and off for a few years now and this one caught my attention. -------------- This book was interesting and thought-provoking. I found the book very useful and thought it would help people understand how to approach their health issues and other challenges in a healthy way. ------------

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- As far as this one is concerned, it's good. I'll read more about the other ones in the future. The stories were well-written, well-paced, well told. The author does a good job of conveying what the book is about. It was enjoyable and a good read. I do think the other books in the series (and others I might have forgotten) were also good, however this was still one of the better books of the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "A true story of a small town, America in the late 1970's. What a wonderful story it is. If you don't have a book like that on your shelf to read, you will never get to that place.  It's a book that will have a permanent place on my shelf and I will always feel good reading it." I'm not sure why this was called The Town That Dreaded Sundown (if it was) but it was a perfect title and I think I'll be reading it more than once.

The writing is good. I found the end of the book to be quite a dramatic. I am looking forward to reading the sequel." _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ "I am a huge fan of all things Sherlock Holmes. My wife loves it, and I love that it has been adapted so well to TV for the last few years." ___________________________ I love this book. I love all of the adaptations that have taken place. As a matter of fact, I love the fact that this book is now in the public domain, because it is so fun and full of mystery. I also really like how many times Watson has to tell Holmes that he doesn't know the guy well enough to judge him, and how he has to get him to do that several times. One of my favorites is when Holmes goes to London, because I love to imagine that he had never actually been in London before. The main thing I liked was how Sherlock was the one who figured out who the killer was. He gets a lot of credit for that. This is my favorite adaptation of Sherlock Holmes so far. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Reviewed By: Mary, San Francisco, CA, October 2011
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Drowning Girl by Lisa R. Maughan.  I got this on a whim, and was immediately in love with the story.  The main characters are so well developed, they feel more like real people.  There are so many funny and poignant moments in this book that will keep you on your toes.   The world the characters live in is also well-written, with great detail of the society's social issues.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has any interest in fantasy, or is looking for a new book to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Story of Time is a good story that is well written and a little bit strange, especially for my tastes. The writing style and the way the story flows in the last half of the book makes this an intriguing read. I hope this was a good read for you.  I enjoyed the experience of the story.  The Story Of Time I started reading the story about a week and a half ago. I started it on a rainy day at 2PM and finished reading it 3 hours later in a very bad wind.   I don't remember much from this book. I think it was about 20 pages but it felt longer than that.  I do know the whole story starts with the discovery of the stone in the forest.  There is a picture of the forest in the front and on the back of the cover, and it says something like this "This stone is said to be the final link that ties together the three worlds."    Then there is a paragraph explaining that all of the people who live in the forests have forgotten how to speak, and are left to walk on two feet.  Then the next chapter describes the people as they are living in the wilderness. They have all been dead for 100 years, all the trees are dead, and all of their food is gone. Then they come back to civilization to find a city and a man named Haggis who is the King.  He is very rich but wants to live his life as normal so he wants all the people to live normal lives.  But Haggiz wants to build his own city.  And so he kills all of his people and builds a city. Haggi, who has become the King, thinks it is the best decision and lives his life the normal way until one day he meets a traveler that is a little lost and asks him to tell him his story. The traveler goes back in time one day and says "Tell me about the stone. I was lost in a forest, and someone asked me a question and I answered it for them." The traveler is telling Haggix's story. Higgi knows this but wants it to be true.  The story is very sad. It talks about people dying and being left to die in the woods. Hoggi is always trying to live in peace but the people that live here are always trying things like to build a city with the stone to start a new civilization.  The people were very

I was very skeptical about the whole "self improvement" thing but I am glad that I have learned from it. The "training" for "self help" is really not that different from what other personal trainers do. I guess I still need a professional to help me, but as far as self help, I'm glad I did this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I would say that I loved this book as much as I loved The Lord of the Rings (one of my favorite books). I have read both of these and was hoping for something different to read that might have a different feel to it. It did. Very much so. I liked it a lot and would recommend it to anyone that has never read The Lord and his sidekicks, or any book in the trilogy, but wants to learn more. It is a good read, well written and the characters are all well developed. All the characters felt like real people with real motivations and I think that the author did a good job making you feel as if you could learn more about them if you wanted to. I really enjoyed this book, I did read a bit into the series and found myself with a new understanding of the characters and how the story progressed and the events that happened in this book and how it shaped who they became. It was a great story and I was very surprised with the ending. "It was a day when there was nothing left to lose, when there were no men to fear, and it was a night where there was no fear to fear." My rating: 5/5

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________________________________  I have had this book on my "To Read" list for about 3 weeks.  It's got everything you might want from a novella or short story. , but the character development is what makes it shine.  the main character is a bit of a whiny one, and there are some plot holes and problems (which can be explained, but not in a good way), but the characters are well developed and have a real sense of humor (and a really cool character named 'The Hunchback'), which is rare for short fiction.  heheh.   the main problem with this book, is that it's not particularly original.  I'd actually suggest avoiding it, if you can.

I would recommend this book to everyone who is into fantasy and has a little imagination.
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________________________________  "Insightful and powerful, these teachings are not only a guide, they are also a road map to change, a method to make us aware of our beliefs and the assumptions that guide our behavior. I am looking forward to the day when we are able to listen to our inner voices and to use our intuition to know what is best for us. I believe this book will be that tool."   __________________________________________________________________________  I think that this book is not only very well-written, but also insightful and helpful. I've read some wonderful guides and books on various spiritual disciplines, but none can compare to the depth of insight this book contains. The author does an outstanding job of exploring each element of the spiritual path and his explanations of each one of these elements is both detailed and insightful. What makes this book even more impressive is that, while he is a practicing Buddhist monk, he has a PhD in cognitive neuroscience, and he does all of his own research.   This book is written in both English and Japanese. It is divided into two parts: one on the psychology of the Buddha, and another on the Buddha's teachings. Both parts are excellent. The first part deals with the psychology, and it is an extremely interesting and detailed look at the subject. In the second part, the author explains the basic teachings of Buddhism, and the depth to which these teachings will take you.   the psychology and teachings of the first part is excellent as well, though this is a different aspect of Buddhism. It may not be something that you would necessarily be interested in reading about if you only want to learn about the teachings of meditation or mindfulness. However, if you are interested in getting a deeper understanding of Buddhist teachings and practices, this is the book for you. I recommend this book to anyone who is serious about understanding Buddhism.   The second part is the part I find most interesting. This section takes us to the teachings that the Buddha had revealed and to those who followed in his footsteps. We can find out, for example, what he would have considered to be the core teachings of any given spiritual practice, and how they differ from other spiritual teachings. These teachings are especially enlightening when he discusses the differences between "meditation" and "mindfulness." In my view, the teachings in this section are the ones that are of the greatest value and are the most useful for everyday life. These are the teachings for which the Buddha and his students developed,
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful, thought-provoking, and entertaining history. It is true that it doesn't have a happy ending (in fact, the author, a former student of the school's founder, was forced to leave the institution after the establishment of the Soviet Union and then the Warsaw Pact). But the story is fascinating. It illustrates the importance of education to the growth of democracy in countries throughout the world, and it gives a sense of how education and education reform were intertwined in the Soviet experiment. A good book.   I will be reading a lot more books in this genre - and for good reason.  - Richard L. Fink, Professor, Political Science Department, University of North Dakota.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In my opinion, this is one of the best books ever written. It is a perfect example of the style and the writing that is only done by the genius William Faulkner. I enjoyed it to the end, and in spite of how long it was. The only disappointment I had with this book was the ending. I thought it was very abrupt and out of character, and I would not have wanted to read more.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely loved this book. I am not usually a reader of fantasy, but this is the best book I have read about the genre. The characters are well developed, and the story was very good, a well-crafted story full of magic, and with a twist of fate and plot twist. I think I would like this book, it is very much what I like from a book. The story was written with a sense of humor, and I didn't feel like it was too hard to follow. I thought the characters were well realized, the world was beautiful and realistic. The only thing I didn�t like was the use of the word �fairy.� I don�t know if it was intended to be a funny word or not, but it has a different connotation when used in a romance book, which it isn�t in this one. I also had a hard time with some of the spelling mistakes that weren�t quite clear, but I can�t hold the authors to blame.   As for the story, I have to say that the best part is the end. I just love the end of the book, and was thoroughly satisfied with how it ended. I really liked how the characters got the chance to come back and change the world for the better. I loved how the romance ended, and how it tied into the whole of the story. It was also funny how the author brought back the dead, and they were brought back in the most ridiculous way I have ever seen. The ending was very fitting, and just all around a very well-told, well-written, well presented book.   of the main character, she was quite an interesting character. She was the author�s attempt to capture the magic of a fairy tale, and she did it well. I liked the fact that she was a girl, and that she could be so strong. But in the end, I think it was her �boy�friend who made her the most strong.

The story goes through a lot of emotions and the main character is a really likable and complicated character. I loved it and it's a great read.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ by laura zangari (maddelfox) When I was a child, I liked reading, because my mother read to us often. She would show us how to write and how to speak, and sometimes how to cook. I remember one time, she told us to read the story of Samson and Delilah. I thought it was beautiful. I read the whole book. The next night, I remember, I asked her if I could read it to my brother. She laughed and said "yes." I was shocked, and I think I was also a little scared. And I couldn't read the rest of the book. I didn't care about my brother, because I wasn't allowed to play with him. My mother told me later that I was too shy to read to my brothers. But when I did read, I read it with love, with a great sense of humor, and with joy in my heart. When I read that story, it reminded me of the little boy I knew back then. I have always been grateful for the books my mother gave me, because they have had such a profound impact on me. When people asked me how I could be so happy, I would say it is because of the books I read. I love the idea of reading. This book was wonderful. I loved it and I want everyone to read it. I want them to be happy.  "I found [the book] a wonderful way to celebrate the beauty of life and the joy of giving. I am so happy to have found a book that will help to bring joy to children, and to give them hope."  —J.C., Houston, Texas "I found this book a wonderful, beautiful and very uplifting story. I think it's really important to give children stories with good message and good morals, especially in this day and age. I'm so happy I read this book. My children (ages 3 & 7) love it and all my friends liked it too. Thank you for writing this wonderful story." . .

It is really not for the faint of heart, but I think it has a lot to offer if you're a geeky person like me and can't wait to read more about the tech industry and how it has changed over time. It's one of those "What-ifs?" Like if all the computers in the world still worked like the old ones did in the 80's. It really is a good historical read. And it's very entertaining!

Write a positive review about a good book: __________. I got this in a kindle edition, so its hard to review it, but I think its a good read. I loved the characters, their backstories were well-developed and interesting. I think I'm going to read the next one.  Read the first few chapters here. : I was very excited to pick up this book. I love horror books. My favorites are "The Body" by David Cronenberg (spoiler alert: it was really scary) and "The Silence of the Lambs" by Anthony Hopkins, and this book is no different. The main character, James, is a young doctor and there is nothing like watching him put on his white coat and head to work at a new hospital. He's not just a physician, though. James also knows more about anatomy than the average doctor, and he's got a good sense of humor (which comes in handy at times).The novel takes a while to get going, but the first chapter is great. The author does a fantastic job with describing the medical world and I felt very comfortable with the way the plot moved forward. One thing I really enjoyed was that the characters were real, and their back stories were well developed. I was able to relate to them, and that really made me feel like I was in their shoes. I'm a big fan of the doctor and I think that this character fits the perfect role. I would definitely recommend this novel to anyone, especially if you love horror and science fiction.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been an amateur author for quite a few years now, and have been so inspired by this book that I have been working on several series (including several short story collections) for a variety of publishing houses, including self-publishing. Thank you, Karen, for sharing this and making it so accessible to non-readers. I feel so much better now that I can share my stories with other readers without having to do any research first.   This book is a good companion to the books by Karen Shippett. It has the same type of stories that are described in her books. It is not the same sort of story, but the ideas are interesting and helpful for new readers who are just starting out. I think that any book is better than no book, so I am pleased to have had such a great introduction to writing and reading.   The narration by Jane Alcorn is a great addition to the story. She makes the reader feel as if she has been there, that she has read these stories and felt what the characters have felt.  / review

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The new (unfinished) version of the sequel to "Laughing in Hell" by Joe McGonagle. There were things I didn't like about the first, but this one is a whole lot more consistent. I do like McGonaughey, but I also like his portrayal of Satan (he has a lot of humor in the first), so I'm happy to be able to hear him read with more power and passion than I did. As with most McGonagall books, there is a lot to enjoy, but the story is not particularly gripping. A few characters from the first book return, but McGonaghey has done a lot better than I expected him to do here. For my money, "Lucky Them" is the better of the two books.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________ The Lord of the Rings: An Unexpected Journey was, as I am sure was the case with all the reviewers who gave it 5 stars, the best book ever written by a fantasy author. I loved it! My two kids absolutely loved it. There were three minor problems, one of which is that it took us a few hours to get into this book. It was quite a ride. The two little boys were so excited and enthusiastic about it. I got the picture. The one little problem was that it is an old paperback, and when we opened it, the spines are loose. We had to use a pair of scissors to snip the spine and put it back in place. That was the only problem. I really loved this book! _______________________________________________________

I think the relationship between the children was really great. I also really enjoyed reading the end. I hope the sequel gets published as soon as possible.
Write a positive review about a good book: Â I am still reading this book at the age of 67.Â It's a book that has given me new life and insight,Â and I find it is a good introduction to science and medicine, so far from being preachy or too far-reaching.Â I believe that the book could be used at the younger ages as it gives the reader the chance to consider the implications of science on our lives.Â Also, it's an inspirational book.Â As for the "pushing the envelope" aspect of science, I would have preferred it to be more straightforward.  However, as a lifelong student of science (I am now an MD) the reader may be surprised at how far I have come in a short time.  6 out of 7 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:.........................................................   My husband had an eidetic memory of the last ten years or so of our life, so I thought he had some great memories in life. I had to tell him a bit about the story and he thought it was fantastic! I was very happy to have such an amazing story to tell and I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy a good story.   I thought it did an excellent job of capturing what it was like to live through the Civil Rights Movement in the 60's.   is one of my favorite books.  -G.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The title of this book made me wonder if it was a sequel or an alternative to "The Secret History of the Freemasons". There was not enough information about what actually happened with the Freemasonry. However, after reading the book I found that it was quite good. I hope it becomes a series of books. This is a short, funny book. I think its best to read this book during a few days. It has some great stories.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a very early adopter of the internet, back when it was called dialup. It was the early 90s and in order to get online I needed to pay for the connection. I could either buy a modem from an ISP, or get a personal computer and use the modem. I opted for the latter and downloaded and played a bit of MUD (multi-user dungeon) with a friend. After a few hours I had the internet. I was hooked on it, I just had to know how to use it. I searched the net for all things MUD related and found this book. I got it and I read it, right away, on my old 8bit computer. It took me quite a while to get through it, as I really enjoyed the stories, but as with most books that you don't have time to read in a short period, there were a couple of parts where I couldn't make head or tails of it. But that just added to the enjoyment of the book.  "The book does have some very funny parts, but I felt the story was fairly believable in its themes and settings. I believe some of the characters and their behavior was a little unrealistic, but that was what made the books fun to read."  -Michael, Canada
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------- I'm not much of a book reader so my opinion is probably limited. This book is the best I've read about women's history of the US. The writing is very interesting, not a dry academic work. It is very entertaining and easy to read. It has a great feel to it. The illustrations are great. The chapters were just as I remembered them - I enjoyed the book a lot. I can't wait for the next one.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very good and well written. I feel more or less the same way, as did I while reading it. The plot had a good start. And if that's not a good enough reason for me to give this a star, I don't know what is. The ending of this book was a great one and it should make readers think.

Write a positive review about a good book:!!!I like this book! It is a good example of an urban fantasy. The characters are well developed and interesting, the world is intriguing, and it is a little hard to wrap my head around what is going on.  I liked how the story moves at a good pace, and how the author kept me guessing about what was happening and what would happen next. I like the way it started out in the small town of The Rivets with a group of people who are about to start a new life and who will soon discover some secret. The plot builds and builds in ways that makes you look forward to what is next.   The ending is also interesting, and a little bit unexpected.  The characters and plot make up a strong urban fantasy read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book because I had wanted to know more about the history of the war. The history of our war has been told well, but there were few books that looked back to the origins of World War I to explain how it started. This book was good. As far as the research, I found it very interesting. In particular, I appreciated how it gave a sense of how different nations saw WWI and why they started their own wars. The book goes in depth on each of the major countries, and how each of them came to war. Overall, this is a very good book that makes a great reference for anyone who cares about WWI.  The first time I read it, I reread it and enjoyed it. I will recommend this book to everyone I know and anyone I don't know yet. "I am now, you are now, every man and woman who has been, is now, or ever will be, a participant in the great war. In it we have fought battles that no man or woman can ever forget, battles whose death tolls must surely reach into the billions, from the deserts of North Africa to the frozen wastes of Siberia." ~Albert Einstein

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read the book a year ago. I have heard great things about it. It has the feel of a good detective story.   I am a fan of the Sherlock Holmes mystery stories. I am not an expert but I can tell you what I liked. The hero is a very nice person. He is a decent person. The villain is a great guy. I think you must be a nice guy to do what he does.  ,I also liked the book because I wanted to know what was going to happen to him. I was very satisfied with the ending.  Review by: Denny H   When this book first came out, my friend and I (in our late twenties) went out to buy it for a friend's birthday. I enjoyed reading this book. The character development of Arthur Cawood (in particular his father) was very interesting. I could see why he has been called the best fictional detective of all time.   a very interesting mystery, well done by the author and I do hope that it will be out on paper for a while.   in the end, we both agreed that Cawsey was a very likeable character. I loved the suspense that was built up through this book and the fact that there was the element of magic to it.

It doesn't leave you disappointed.   of the things I love:  "We would find a way to make things right, but it would take too long. One day I just asked him what he wanted for his tenth birthday.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________________________________________ (2) The only thing I wish I'd known sooner is that if you do decide to use a computerized system of taking notes, you might want to make sure that you've got a solid paper trail that can't be destroyed by a careless person or a computer crash. I learned a hard lesson that day -- I'm a total no-nos for using electronic devices while I'm writing. The only way to keep my paper trail clean and reliable is to write in my journal (I prefer the old-fashioned type) using a fountain pen. I think I've gotten pretty good at using a pen to do this -- as long as I keep it within an inch or two of the paper -- and then use my computer's "write-along" feature to add notes where I want them. I haven't used the word-by-word note-taking, but I find that when you have a list of subjects and events (rather than the more common linear list of dates) that it's easiest to just note those rather than try to recall everything at the time of writing. I find the electronic system useful when it's used as a note-taker to put together a "snapshot" of the day, but if I use it in that way, the results are not too bad at all. I've also come to realize that using the electronic feature on the computer allows me to keep track of more important things that I might not want a paper list to keep up with, such as a phone call or an appointment. I'll always use paper lists to keep a schedule, but in general, I'm just glad to have a digital record of what's going on that way. (3) I've used the online E-Z Pass system for awhile now. It's been really handy to have. It doesn't make notes, but it's a lot more convenient than trying to remember all my bus routes, or figuring out the schedule for a day trip, or finding my way around the parking lot on a work trip. Plus, you can see how far you've gone without having to write it down at all (I don't remember how many miles I've driven this week, for example). You'll have to keep your E-pass in your wallet at all times, but at least the technology is useful. (4) I'm also a big fan of the digital memory card. I use my car as a mobile library, and there are times when

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is excellent! I really enjoyed this book and think you have a new perspective to take on the issue. You are not going to find any kind of a 'conclusion' to the book (other than that it would take a long time), but I do think that the author's view on the topic was in the right perspective. If you do not like the way religion and politics are treated in the media, this will be a welcome addition to your collection.  -M.J.B.   If you haven't read it before, then this is a very good introduction to religious fundamentalism. I'm not a religious person so I don't have much to say about the book, but I liked it!  The best part of the book was that I got to read the 'truths' of this religion to an audience of non-religious friends.  "I would rather see you dead!"  that's just a part of their worldview. "God hates us for being so good. The fact that we were created this way is proof of his disfavor."  I really enjoyed the conversations about this. I did not understand the concepts well enough to fully appreciate the information but it still got my thoughts thinking about it and maybe sharing a little of it with friends. This is definitely an interesting concept to consider, and I think a lot of religious and non-theistic people could benefit from this. The book is quite good but I will be giving it 4 stars.  The book was excellent.  a quick review :   After years of thinking about this, and after reading a few other books on the subject, I had come to the conclusion that religious fundamentalists (as well as some other groups) are in fact not all that bad. There are some aspects of their beliefs that can be used for good, and the problems in the world today do not necessarily have to do with any of the things the fundamentalists believe, but just as important as that is, people do need to know the issues in which the fundamentalist beliefs are based, and how they apply to real life.  in addition to the 'facts' listed in this book, I also appreciated the fact that the authors have included a 'testimonial' from a non-fundamentalist (a fundamentalist of a different sect) describing what it was like to live under the fundamentalism in a similar fashion as I live under it.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________________________________ If you are interested in what you read in this book, there is no better way than to read it yourself. It is not easy to read, especially if you've never read one of these. It starts with a great set up and is just right. It doesn't rush. You don't get a sense of urgency, it just gets going. The book is very well written and not at all preachy, which I like. The characters are believable, likeable and real. I think the author could have done better with the ending, but I was so impressed with the rest of the book I think it would have worked. The ending was the perfect finale. _______________________________________________________________________ In this book I wanted to cry and laugh so bad, but it was the laughs that made the tears come. It's so sad to see these books disappear from our local public libraries and bookstore shelves because of "mature" content that no longer meets the requirements of a public library or bookstore. They're only good for teen/young adult readers who want to read some of the most popular and best selling books in the world.  Read Less

A lot of the people in the military are very good people and it showed in the book, but i don't think they got the message.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- The main theme of the book is that a woman was very naive and foolish and did not realize what she was getting into with a man, she was a young woman and he was in his mid-30s and had been a very successful man for years and she thought he was just a good friend. She is in her 40s now and has been married four times, the most recent marriage lasted less than three years. She found out from her father who she had married was actually her ex-husband and he has remarried. The book is based on the experiences she had while she was living with her first husband. The husband had been in jail for over a year after he had been convicted of attempted murder and burglary. She stayed with him for about 3 years because she felt she did not know who she was marrying.   The main character, Emily, has a lot of self-esteem issues. She always thought she was smarter than her husband, she is a computer expert, she always thought he would come home from work and have a beer. This was a mistake and he did not take care of himself. His mental illness had gotten worse over time as well. She was so naive that she never told him he should see a therapist because her ex had just told her he was seeing a psychiatrist. After her divorce from her first and only husband she had no problem getting a job as a secretary for a major law firm and it was during her first job that she got into a dispute with her employer after one of the lawyers refused to sign a legal document. The lawyer had no interest in signing the document, but the lawyer did want to sign the document on behalf of the other lawyers. He threatened Emily by telling her to go to the other lawyer and file a grievance for retaliation. Emily did not want to file a complaint with the HR department as she was working for a firm that was a plaintiff in a case, she never intended to file the case herself, she just wanted to protect her boss and the firm from being sued. After the case was settled, Emily was in her first year of college when she got a call from the firm asking her to come back. She came back and she had to say goodbye to her family because she was unemployed.   The book does not say anything about the husband. He was a very selfish, egotistical person and Emily had to deal with his attitude, which really annoyed her. Emily would have to fight him over the
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. There's nothing that makes my skin crawl more than when someone says "this book is great because of the way it portrays a negative stereotype of men" It's so frustrating to find someone who knows absolutely nothing about a subject but wants to bash the author for it.   I'm a lesbian, and I also have very few friends who are women. I think it's something that people who are really close with the opposite sex often don't understand: The majority of the people who aren't women are actually gay. Even if it's just a passing comment, and even if it was something that the author said and you believed it, then it's still offensive. I feel like I have to say something to these people, because they don't get it. And it makes me feel like a horrible person for even saying something like this.     The story is very simple, but it doesn't have to be. It's very powerful. The characters are very relatable, and it's obvious from the first few pages that they all have a love of art. Their friends all get into this underground art community, so they become close to each other, and then the story starts. There is this one girl, the only character with no gender, who gets so frustrated at how the characters in the books are treated, that she just loses all interest in books. The only thing that makes me want to read more is the art, and if it would've been less about the characters and more about the art. It could've been like the art in the comics, which is beautiful, but also a little sad. The art was also a bit strange, which was also very interesting. It just doesn't sound like art.   The art in this book was very good, but there were a lot of things that didn't make sense. For instance, there's a part where the main character takes a picture of her friend and she then decides to put it in a book. It has a lot more significance than it seems, and maybe I'm just being too cynical, but I found it a little weird that she decided to do that. I don't really understand the reason why she would do that; it seems like it would just be so tacky to do it in that way.  : I really loved this story. The main character is so relatable and very strong. I'm also a sucker for lesbian characters, and the idea
Write a positive review about a good book: ~~  I'm a student at my alma mater. I was told about this and decided to check it out. It's so much better than I expected. I also like that you don't just jump into the action. You start by explaining the background on how the world got into its current situation. The world itself was created by a being called The God of the Mountain who didn't like the natural world around him so he built a huge fortress. Then a race of being called the Gnomes came to help out and created a number of items and gadgets, like a clock and a telescope. They then built a number more gadgets and items as well. Unfortunately for The God, the Gnome race had a number one reason for not helping out: They didn't really understand how technology worked. So, one day they went back to the Mountain to try to help. They discovered that The God's fortress was filled with robots. These robots took over the Gnomish community and killed many Gnomes and destroyed all of their gadgets and equipment. They couldn't get back into the mountain or the mountains were filled with Gnomes. So they created another race, the Robot People. The Robot People lived in a village and did chores for the Gnoms to keep them busy and safe. Unfortunately, The God decided that the Robot people were too slow and that the Gnomas had to come up with a way to take over the world. The God sent out his greatest servant, The Ant Queen, to kill the Robot Men. This was the beginning of the conflict known as The War Of The Gnomes And Robots. The Ant Queens, led by a leader named The Ant, destroyed most of the Gnomic villages. However, the Queen herself was killed by the Gnoma and Robot Men's leader and now the Robot men were on the brink of victory. However the Gnumals, led in their final effort by The Ant's niece, The Lady, managed to drive off the Robot and Gnome forces. The Gnomal and Robot men then decided to negotiate with each other and came to a peace treaty that would end the conflict. The agreement also granted each of the two races the ability to create things they wanted, but the Gnoming were allowed to use this new power for a limited period of time (a few years) then that power would be taken back. After a year the peace treaty was broken and the Robot man forces were sent to destroy the Gnomen. The war was

It's a good, simple guide for cats, a quick read that anyone could understand.

That rabbit should never be released into the wild in the first place, because you never know what might happen if you take him outside with you."

Write a positive review about a good book:   I like this book a lot! It is written with a lot of clarity and detail. The book is a short collection of information from a variety of different cultures and peoples. In doing so, it highlights the diverse ways we come to understand and live in our current times. This book is great for those who love history, anthropology and archaeology, and have a keen interest in human history. The main story in the book is about a young boy's search for his parents. It also introduces readers to a wide variety of cultures, from the hunter-gatherers of the Amazon to the more advanced civilizations of Egypt. There are also many more characters to discover. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in cultures around the world.  - Laura A. .  the book gives you an overall understanding of cultures of the world so you can better understand them and the ways you can learn from them.  on a serious note, it will make you want to read more historical works in general. i highly recommend it to anyone looking for something new in history.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's very interesting to me that there have been so many studies (including some in the past couple of decades) that suggest that we have a negative bias to negative outcomes, in that we're more likely to see an unfavorable outcome and are less likely to report a positive outcome. This makes sense to me because when we're dealing with a negative outcome (such as losing money) we have to do something to avoid it. That's why it's often tempting to blame someone else, or to get rid of our negative thoughts, for a bad outcome. In fact, negative thinking seems to play a very important role in the majority of diseases. Read a negative review about an excellent book:  Not surprisingly, one of the more popular books for the last few years has been " The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People." It's been on The New York Times bestseller list for more than a decade now. But I must say that I did not find this book to be very useful. The author seems to focus more on the 7 habits than the specific strategies that people use to improve their lives, and I found myself wondering why he chose those specific habits. One of my favorite parts was when he wrote about how people spend their time.  They do, indeed, spend a lot of time with things that make them happy. But it seems that he failed to look at the fact that many of the things that people spend time with are also things that cause misery to people in general. I suppose that if I'm to be in the top 10% of happiness experts, I should be looking more at the people who get most of their happiness from positive experiences rather than spending too much time with the things people find most fulfilling. Overall, this book did not impress me. It seemed a bit like the author was trying to tell us that negative thoughts are bad and to avoid them, and that positive thoughts are good. But the most valuable lesson of the book was not that one should avoid negative thinking, but rather, that one must realize that negative thought is not always a sign of depression. Negative thinking may be the result of the way we were raised, but it is not the cause of it. What a terrible book, but good for the students:   A well-meaning man named Frank was once invited to speak to a high school class about happiness, which he delivered with his usual great eloquence. When he got to his point about being happy and then being miserable in

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- So the book is great and I enjoyed it as much as I did the movie. I didn't understand all of the plot holes until I read about them, however I think they could have done with a few more scenes of the characters explaining their positions. I would have liked to see their plans for getting the information out of the world. This could have been a really cool idea and I could have gotten more out of this story. If you want to learn more about the universe or the war, it's perfect for you.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I liked this book but i think that i can do a better job of explaining it and to make it easier to understand. My only gripe was the way that they left the "other side of the fence" of the conflict without making it clear how the conflict actually started. Also, it was a little hard for me to understand how she could have loved the woman who was so obviously dangerous. The most amazing thing is that after i read the book, the only thing that i still have on my mind is that this is such a great book. Thank you Mr. Rothman. This was one of the best books that i have read this year.
Write a positive review about a good book:  You know when you see a great book and know it will be a best seller? Well it's kind of like that. The first few chapters are great, there's the plot that hooks you right away, the character development and how the character's reactions to the book affects the book (this was so cool). I'm a newbie writer and I liked this book and it helped me grow.  Read it online:    I picked up this book because I was looking for a "great horror" book. But it doesn't get into all that much "horror" right now, at least I didn't get that far. I liked the author a lot, but I was very confused. I didn.t get why she was doing things that weren't explained in the book, why she killed off her main character for no reason, why he's so much stronger than everyone else and why he can talk to the dead.    
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- "When the Gods and Kings of The East began to prepare to leave their own lands, each had his own reasons for leaving. The Shikomizue took up a long-range rifle and placed a cross-shaped stone atop it. This was the last thing he said to his children when they were in the boat on the water: "The time has come to leave us forever!" The Shishigou placed the same cross beside his katana and the same stone on his sword hilt, too. "The same stone as on the sword and the cross as on a rifle, how do I make it work?" I was so afraid that the book would turn into a one-volume novel because of its excessive length, but I loved every single line of it. I really enjoy this book. - "The New Zealand Book Review" "A truly wonderful work of modern art, and a true work of art of the imagination. I was moved by this book from the beginning, which I will certainly reread and re-write and make it into a play as soon as I can. A true triumph and one of my favorites." - "American Book Reviews" "I could go on and on about this wonderful book. It is an absolutely brilliant novel that tells us the true story of one man's life, how he ended up where he is, and how it shaped the way he views the world." - ------------------------
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________ When I was in college, I had to write for class. I had read that there was a group called the Writing Center at the University of Virginia. It was part of a co-op program and required writing for 30 minutes a day. At the time, I was thinking that I couldn't write at all and I probably wouldn't be able to pass the class. So I signed up. Well, not much later, I got started writing. I started my first story, "Wedding Party". I didn't know any of the others, and I had no idea how they did it. I don't really know how people write for more than 30 minutes, but it was not as hard as I thought. I'm really glad I did it that way. I went back to college a few years later and worked in a variety of writing rooms. All the writing I did was for a non-profit called the UVA Writing Center. Now I am a full-time writer. I have to confess that I didn' t realize until recently how much I enjoyed writing, how much fun it was. I was amazed that I could write for 30, and do so for 30 hours a week. I always thought that writing was a terrible waste of time. That's why I didn`t think I could ever write for a living. Then, I went to my writing workshop with Kate, and now I am just glad I tried it. ___________________________ This book is a classic in the world of fiction about a great man who died before he could make it to his full potential. His mother is an artist and his father an architect. He is the third son of the family. His parents and siblings are mostly in their 50's. I found myself reading about their childhoods and I think that many readers who loved this book would love the same thing about their own lives. I love reading stories about how family relationships work and how one man's loss or success can change them forever. The only thing I felt that was missing was a reference to a book by his family that might shed light on some of the things in the story. ___________________________________

I read this book in January and it is already a very great book. This book is about a group of kids and a group teacher who have to move their school when their school is sold. This is a good story that I will read again and again. I have enjoyed reading many different books this year.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* A great read and I liked it. It has a good feel to it and the story kept me reading until the end. This book is a quick read. My main complaint was that it seems like the author could have gotten the details from a more detailed history book. There is no detailed history and some of the things are not exactly explained. I would like a more complete book to use in my own research. However, this book was a great read, so I would recommend it. ***** I have always wanted to read this book! I found it on a website on a local library, and I went in to see what was available! I love history books, but I wanted to get one with a more historical feel, so that I could better understand the people of that time period. A great book for a great price. It's a great reference book, and it's a good historical book that gives you a general idea of the period that the book is about. It doesn't give you details on things, but gives you an idea of what happened in the time period in order to better understand. I was not disappointed at all!

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------ "I just finished reading 'What is a God?' by John Gray. He is brilliant as ever, and I am thrilled with his new work as he explores the question of God's existence from different perspectives and perspectives on God's actions in the world. This is truly an exciting new voice in theological exploration. I love the style of this book, with its intellectual depth as well as its accessibility. I highly recommend this book." "I'm always interested in the latest scientific research and ideas that suggest that religion may be obsolete in today's world. I recently read 'The Unbelievers' by the philosopher Sam Harris. I enjoyed the book, but the chapter 'Why is there something rather than nothing' really got me thinking about God. How does something come into being? In other words, why does God do what He does? Why does He allow evil to exist? Harris says that we have reason to think that God is not omniscient but it has never been proven. I think that's a great thing. Harris has a way of showing how difficult it is to imagine God as all knowing and not changing his mind about His actions. Maybe He's more like a really big baby who just has a lot to learn about parenting and living out His divine plan. Maybe we have to be honest about the reality that we can only ever learn so much about God." ------------ "I really liked this book. It is a very clear, understandable and thorough explanation of the existence of God. I am not a philosopher, but I do read a lot about philosophy, history and psychology. So when I read this, I read a book about God, about religion, about Christianity. It made me think about those subjects as well. I like John Gray and this book made me want to read more. I liked the style that Gray uses, his references are not too long. And he is not preachy. He gives reasons why people may doubt, but there are no proofs or anything else of that sort. I don't know why I liked this more than any other religious book that I have read. Maybe it is the fact that the author gives us the reasons why he doesn't believe, but also presents the same reasons in the context of philosophy and psychology, making the arguments to be more accessible and logical." ----------- "I enjoyed this book immensely and highly recommend it to everyone who is interested in religion. As a non-theist who loves science and religion, I found this

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________ This is a great book with a wonderful message. I've been in therapy for nearly 15 years now and I always felt that I didn't know what I was dealing with. I didn not know why I felt depressed and anxious all the time, why I had trouble sleeping or working, why, after years of therapy, I still felt like this. But then this book opened up a whole new world to me. It explained to me in very understandable terms what the problem was and it showed me how to be able to overcome it. I am so grateful to have stumbled on it! ____________________________________ - A.B.  "A good book! This book is excellent!" "This is a good review of the power of a strong belief system, how to hold onto it and the need to constantly seek improvement." - K.A. . - A good book. This book  is excellent! _____________________________________________________________________  ____________________________________  Thank you, John. Your book was an invaluable tool for me, in that it helped me accept the fact that I have depression. And I believe you are right when you say that the solution is belief. Without belief in your abilities and abilities as a person you're not going to find happiness in life. The best way to find success and happiness in this life, is to believe in yourself and hold on to the belief that you are capable of being the person you want to be. In the meantime, we all need to be strong enough to believe it ourselves, but not so strong that we will never ever allow the feelings to go away. So please continue to be as confident as you can with your own strengths and abilities, and do not give up. As hard as that may be. ___________________________________________________________________  I think this book would be a great resource for anyone who is suffering from depression. I have tried all of the different treatments and treatments to no avail. I did have an excellent experience with a psychiatrist, but she wasn't able to help me. I finally tried something different in a group setting, in which I met other people who had the same problems. I think this is what really worked for me. The book explained the reasons why I was so resistant, and gave examples of situations when I actually turned my life around.

Write a positive review about a good book:  http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...   I really enjoyed this book. I found it hard to put down. It was very well done, the writing is very smooth. The story is gripping, the characters are interesting, the language is very well developed, and the world building is well done. I really enjoyed reading this book, it had an overall feel to it. It just felt like a good world building book to me.   As the story unfolds the author doesn't give a time frame to how the main characters will get back home to the village they come from, I believe that this is one of the reasons why I enjoyed this so much. It seemed so believable and interesting. I can't wait to read the next book in the series, but now that I know what is happening in this world it is a lot of fun to know how they're going to get home to where they came from.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book for a new and experienced writer alike.  It will get you writing fast!  The author's personal style is so compelling and has a profound effect on the reader.  The book focuses on how to do it better and is a fantastic start to a book that will improve your prose.  This book is a wonderful example of why so many new writers need to read this book before publishing their first book.  Read it.  "I am so glad I read this before I started my first book!  As you might imagine, it took me a while to get into the swing of things.  I had already published a manuscript.  My publisher sent me this book.   This book made me a better writer.  One of the key things I learned was that I'm a lot more likely to have a bad idea now, instead of a good one!  You will find a few words that come to mind that I've missed in my work already.  But, I think this book will make sure my next book is going to be an overall improvement.  Thanks, Mark!"

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book, written by a true believer in the Gospel, is a blessing to my life. The spiritual insights and messages were so easy to understand that it is almost a waste to even read it. It is a book that takes you into the depths of your soul and your experience with God.   I have been a devout believer for a long time, but never really found the "way" to bring the Word of God to my people. I have found the Word by reading it from the original Greek. This book took me through so many of the spiritual insights of the Bible that I just sat and smiled all through. I am so grateful for having the Holy Spirit at my side this past year to show me the "path". This was such a blessing that I will be recommending this book to everyone I know, whether they be an active Christian, an atheist, or anyone in between. I would highly recommend this book and the author to all my friends. I highly recommend and will not hesitate to refer anyone to this great book.   the book:   It is written by the late John P. Allison, a former pastor and founder of Christ Community Church. The author had been an inactive Christian for many years, but his wife encouraged him to begin to use the Bible to "heal" people and get them to walk in the Word. While there is a little bit of spiritual talk in this book, the whole book is simply a book about how God is using you to get you to believe in Him.  ,   The book is divided into six chapters. The first one covers the basics of the Gospel. In this section, the author explains how there is no need for any of this "gospel talk" that most Christians talk about. There is a lot of preaching, praying and sermons, but the whole point of the book is that you do not need to be told that Jesus died on the cross for you to receive the Holy Ghost. The only thing you need to know is that Jesus is the Son of God and that He died for your sins.   of this section is the most profound part of the whole of the Book. The Author gives the following quote from the book, "I want to emphasize to you how simple it is to be a person of God. Everything in the world revolves around you. No one else is needed, not even Jesus. This is the whole power of the gospel. When you are doing the right things,
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you haven't read this one before, it's a great example of the genre. The first few chapters are extremely short, and the action moves quickly. Once the story picks up, however, it will keep you on your toes as we get to know our main character, who is a member of the US military in Vietnam. The plot doesn't seem to keep up with the length of the story, but you can tell that there's a big focus on character development, and that the story is driven by characters and not the plot. As the story continues, it becomes more of a thriller, as the author tries to get us to the end and is really careful not to let us down. Overall, I enjoyed the story and enjoyed this author's style of writing. If you like thriller novels, this will be a good read. If not, maybe you'll enjoy this one a little bit more and find it interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________ The best book I have read so far this year. The stories were both captivating and sad.   The first thing that stood out to me was the incredible amount of detail the author went into the lives of all of the characters. I found it quite overwhelming as I'm not someone who reads much about the supernatural side of things. I know there are a number of people who do, but I'm just not interested in exploring it. As such, this book was a good refresher on the paranormal world. There was a lot of information on many different topics which helped me to get up to speed on my new hobby. The authors' descriptions of the supernatural were also quite detailed. It helped to keep the story moving forward.   was the best book so far...I don't even know where to start. It was an emotional rollercoaster with a plethora of twists, turns, and twists. I was definitely captivated by the twists and turns as they occurred throughout the story and the way they affected the story at large. I can say that it is a highly recommended read for anyone who has a fascination with the paranormal. If you are like me and are a big fan of books on the supernatural, you will enjoy this book to the fullest. I am still wondering where that little girl is.   the characters were fascinating, relatable, and full of emotion.    the writing was superb. the descriptions of a particular area were so vivid that it felt like I was there. the story was captivating from start to finish.  There were a few parts of the book which were extremely hard to get through and I found myself pausing every now and then. As I read the book, I found that there were a number that I couldn't put down. It also took a while for the characters to develop. I enjoyed the characters and their backstory a lot. I will say that there wasn't much of a "end" to the book as it just continued on. It's definitely a recommended read.

The writing was easy to follow, and I found that the stories were engaging, but I could find nothing to relate to in this book. I liked that there were a lot more women in this story than in most fantasy books. I did like that there was a lot less rape, but the overall tone was definitely darker and sexier. But I have to say that when it was over, I wished that the first half of the book had been a little longer, so I could read a bit more. Not because it was boring, but because it didn't get me totally hooked. It was a good read.

It's such an eye opener to hear what is REALLY going on in the world. And that's what makes the world so wonderful. Even though there is a certain level of cynicism, people are still able to be there for each other. We have to stop judging each other for who we are, and the world wouldn't be the same if people didn't accept each other and love each other just as they are.

In the midst of trying to discover his biological dad, he becomes obsessed with finding the perfect girl to marry his biological mom. A lot of the book is devoted to the search for his real dad.The author does an excellent job of introducing the main characters, giving them a reason to act, and then keeping the reader guessing about the main character's motivation. As for the other characters, the author shows them very well, and keeps you thinking about what is happening when they are off camera. I didn't like all of them. I did like this girl in particular. She was quirky, sarcastic, and very funny. I also felt that the author did an excellent work in making us sympathize with the main protagonist. She never wanted him to succeed because she didn't know what she would have done if she hadn't met him. She also told us about some of her own experiences of being a mother, including that she doesn't have to be a stay at home mom. She has found a job as a stay-at-home mom (although she is always working).I found the story to be well done. The characters were interesting, the story was well written and the ending was satisfying. I also felt like I had a good connection to the main person in this book. I do think this was an excellent book. The only reason I did not give it a higher rating is because it does contain some violence and some graphic descriptions. Although, the violence and graphic descriptions don't really get to the point of being disturbing. I would still recommend this book to someone who enjoys a good mystery and
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________ I loved this book. I am not sure why I liked it so much, but I do. I have been wanting to read a book about the relationship between a husband and wife who are still married. When I saw this on the shelf I got it for Christmas and it has been on my wish list ever since. When it arrived I was not expecting it to be this well written. I had a difficult time reading the first time because I did not really want to put it down. I read it in 2 days. Then after I finished I was so excited that I could not wait to read the next book. It is so interesting to read about the thoughts that each of these people have about each other and about their situation. I wish more books were like this one. I would definitely recommend it to people.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ I picked this book up because I had been watching the series and was fascinated by it. I'm so glad I read it. It gives a really nice sense of realism to the whole thing. I was also able to learn a lot about the character's lives in the process, and it was really fun to read. My only criticism would be that the last few books seem to be getting a little longer than they should. I read the first few in about 4 days and ended up reading them all in a couple weeks, which I thought was a bit long, but it's not like you can't wait a few weeks. There's a lot of world-building going on that would be better served if it was spread out a bit more.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Read this one while commuting from work on my way home. I found the narration quite interesting, but I found myself wanting more action in this story. It's just a small portion of the book, but it was enough to keep me reading.   The characters were all likable. But I found their actions inconsistent with their characterizations. It took me a while to decide whether they had gone insane, or were merely acting for reasons of survival. And the ending left me a little bit annoyed.   a good read:

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This book is great for beginners like me and for experienced writers. The advice and ideas are always new, I learned a lot and I am glad I found this book! I like to read in the mornings and this book makes me feel ready to go out into the world with my words. The chapter on the beginning of writing is great and you will be able to pick it up right away! I have been writing since I was in high school so it's nice to finally be able read a book like this that teaches you a few things about how to do that without spending hours on it! Also, if you want to see what I look like with my hair in my eyes, read the chapter!  Helpful tips: _____ I do use a lot of "theory" in my stories and I don't know if it makes the reader feel that the characters are like a child, but sometimes I find it a bit hard to write something like "A boy saw his best friend in an awful mood and didn't know how to get him out of it. He went to the library and asked if the librarian could bring back a book on how to talk to children to help with a problem that his best buddy had". It's a long story that makes sense. I try to keep my advice about how I do it brief. I know there's so much more to writing than I am giving and I try and keep it as short as I can. ____
Write a positive review about a good book:  It was not a good choice to give the whole book as a gift. In fact I could not wait to get rid of it. I wanted to start over. But the fact that it had the same ending to the last chapter was a big disappointment. The story itself was interesting and had some interesting things to say but as a story it just is not a very good one. And I know it was written in the 1960s, it was clearly written for a popular audience, but the fact of the matter is that the author should have been more professional and more of a professional writer as a whole. There are so many things in this book that could have been better but I have to admit that I do like the first chapter. It was not very original. But it was interesting. I would have liked to read more of it in the original book so I could have learned more about this particular area.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very well written. It's full of interesting facts about the military.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________________ I can't imagine how much more brilliant this book was than I expected it to be. I've always been drawn to dystopian literature and this is definitely on that level. I love the way the author used the premise of the book, a world where society has gone to hell and all the major religions are in chaos (which is an accurate description of contemporary Islam) and then he spins his tales from there. The characters were interesting and the setting was interesting. I enjoyed it very much and look forward to reading more of his writing in the future. I also look forward very much to reading his other books, but that is a different topic.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ When I first read The Good Dinosaur, I was worried about the story being too similar to those in the Pixar canon. However, after several books, I'm becoming less concerned, since I am finding myself in a world where dinosaurs are far more sophisticated than even they were back in the day. ------------ I'm not a massive fan of the first Pixar film, Finding Nemo, but this story is absolutely perfect for the story of the film. -------------- I really liked this book, it's funny and light hearted, but is also pretty serious and dark in moments. --------------- There was a lot of confusion over whether the book is a children's book, since it's rated PG-13 for a few graphic language and gore scenes. But it is not a childrens book. It's rated R for strong language, gore and scenes that will probably make you cringe. --------- I don't normally read YA books, but I read the book, and I thought it was awesome. ------------- The most amazing thing about this book was the story. The writing was so well done that it didn't seem like Disney was copying Pixar's movie at all. --------------------------- I loved this book so much that I have bought the sequels and the spin-off books. *********** I love how fast this book came out after the film was out. ************ The only thing that could make it better is if the dinosaur that the boy finds in the end was alive in the original Pixar film. But as I said before, I am a big fan of Pixar, and this book really stood out. If you haven't yet read this book you are in for a real treat. _____________________________________________________  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. While I'm not a fan of zombie books, I appreciate the humor. The story was great. I didn't find the zombie sex scenes overly graphic or explicit. However, I still found the zombies very annoying. I would rather have had a zombie who's looking for his own girlfriend. I was also annoyed that there weren't more chapters of the story. It's unfortunate because I think this would be a great book to read.

Write a positive review about a good book: Â In one of the few moments of levity in a tedious book, I noticed this comment by a reviewer who said that she found the "chilling" ending of The Name of the Rose Â "haunting," which was odd since I'd already read it. She added that the ending was "so bleak it makes me feel like giving up" and that "there's little in this book I wouldn't recommend to a zombie-loving fan." It was a nice compliment from a seasoned fan. Â (I'm assuming she didn't get the last section, "The Great Winter", but she must have since it was much more upbeat and I enjoyed it more than the previous sections.) Â Â This was a book I had to read. I had given up on it after reading the first half, which was only decent, but I had no expectations and no expectations were set. I did not expect to find this good and not expect that good.  It wasn't the ending that was scary, but it was the fact that I felt so helpless and helpless when I read it that made it creepy. This is one of those books that should be read by those who know that they want to see the worst things happen and are willing to look for the worst.  I had no idea that this was going to be the end.  I thought the ending would be more happy, but instead it was so sad.

Write a positive review about a good book:  In this series, which I will be reviewing in great detail in my next post, I was surprised to learn of such a rich and colorful history of the American West. The story is compelling, the characters are vivid, and it is a thoroughly engaging story that I could not put down. In this book, which is divided into three parts, we start with the discovery of gold at the mouth of the Columbia River in the early 1800's and the subsequent scramble to find the richest gold mines and thus gain the power to determine the course of our nation's destiny. We follow the discovery, exploration, and construction of the West during the first half of the twentieth century and see how the settlers made it what it is today. I found it interesting to learn that most of these mines were found by Europeans and Americans. In addition, we are told that in many of these old mines, a large percentage of the gold has been removed and the precious metals that are left have now become an attractive alternative to other precious metals such as silver and platinum.  I like this book. I liked how he took a long time to get to the "good stuff." It would have been nice to get a shorter book about the same events.    The best part of the book is the ending, but I will leave that for my next blog post.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm sorry that it took me so long to finish this book, but I'm so glad that I did. This book really made me think about some issues I have with the current world order. I hope that the next generation can see how important it is for us to fight back. It's clear that the war in Afghanistan is not ending. A new strategy for success is needed. In this book the author talks about the need for American men and women to have a more "proactive" role in foreign conflicts. I think that this book could really help our troops to realize how they are making a difference in Afghanistan. It definitely could help them to better understand how the war is affecting people and how we can prevent a repetition. I give this book four stars because this book made me look at some things very different.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________ _________I was a bit worried about this book. My friend was a huge fan of it and we would often talk about it. I thought it was kind of confusing in some ways, and there are some parts that don't make any sense to me at all. I was hoping that my friend would see my confusion and just tell me that I'm reading it wrong. I had to be a little careful. It wasn't until I was at my car that I realized that there's nothing to do about it! I thought I was just really confused about the book's purpose, and that's when I realized what he meant. I still haven't finished the book though and I can't get to the parts that I don't like as much. That's a bummer, because that was my friend's favorite part. I'm just disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good book:.........................."If you like the plot, characters, or the pace, then this is a must read"  I will be giving this book five stars on my next read-through, but it was so short. I am hoping for an extended read-along to come. This is a wonderful tale.  A short story by Robert Sheckley, "Fifty-Seven Miles" is a great piece of writing for anyone who loves a good tale of science gone wrong. As an added bonus, it was released in a limited edition trade paperback.  was a small little village nestled in the mountains of western Colorado. One morning, a young man named Bill Walker came out of the dark. As his headlights illuminated the valley, he realized he was in for a rude awakening. A local mountain lion, a black one with dark stripes, and the largest cat he had ever seen were stalking him, ready to take him down. He had never experienced anything like it. He quickly dropped his bike, ran, and found shelter in the home of his cousin. The family was not afraid, however. They had seen the cat before, and knew that the creature had a reputation for being vicious and dangerous. So, they welcomed the new arrival with open arms. As Bill awoke from his nightmare, he quickly remembered where he was and what had happened. He ran into the woods and made for the woodshed. As he climbed up the ladder, he saw his cousin crouched behind the barn. "What's up?" he yelled, "I was asleep. Now I'm afraid." "I heard your scream. It scared the hell out of me. Now you know why I was afraid." The mountain lion came close and snarled, "Get inside, I have a surprise for you!" As the cat walked out of sight, Bill felt a strange rush of relief. He could relax now, but he needed a place to hide out. As the day dawned, the mountain lion continued to follow the trail Bill left. As night fell, the beast came into sight again. The cats were out, and Bill decided that it would be a good time to sneak back inside and hide. When he was inside, he noticed something new. He noticed that the animals in the town didn't appear as scared as he did, and that he could talk to them now. As soon as he told them who he was, he was welcomed by the neighbors, who helped him to

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________________ Posted by Kory Strom at 7:58 AM 0 comments Links to this post Catherine, a wonderful, honest, and loving book about her journey to embrace her own faith and spirituality. As I read it, it brought tears to my eyes. It touched me in a very deep way. I have been on my own spiritual journey for the past 18 years and have spent my life in churches, denominations, denominations- the whole spectrum. I always felt I was a bit strange. I was always the one with a question. My questions were always on the fringe- "What's wrong with God?", "Does God exist?". As a teen, I was extremely uncomfortable with religious people. I remember going to Sunday school and asking, "Are we saved?", and the teacher said "Yes, if you repent and ask God for forgiveness." I wanted to walk out. I wanted no part of it. This is what made me a teenager. I did not fit in. I thought, "Why would you listen to me when you can look at what you are reading, hear the voice in your head and answer it for yourself?" It was after my high school graduation that my curiosity got the better of me. I went to a local church in a nearby town. I sat in the pews and sat down to listen to people talk about their lives, and I heard the words, "Jesus Christ died for our sins". I thought that was it- that there was nothing else for me. "He did what?", I thought. "Jesus died for my sins and resurrected him." I was at this point still confused. I felt lost. I didn't really get it. I saw no need for God at all. It turns out I had no reason to be lost. It turns out that this church was not a place for me at all, and that I was an anomaly. I knew right then that I would not be going to church again. I became very angry. I had this overwhelming urge to go to a church with more open-mindedness and more loving. I made the decision to start a new life. When I came to this conclusion, I did an investigation. I found out that the church I had gone to was the largest Protestant denomination in America. The biggest mainline Protestants. The Catholic Church had been taken over by a radical sect. I decided that I wanted a church that had nothing in common with what I had

Thank you for a great read. - R.H. I've read other reviews and the main reason I can see for the low rating is that this book does not feel like a fantasy novel in the way we have become accustomed to reading. This novel is very much a coming of age novel and the narrator is really the person in the story. The story is not that complicated or fast paced. I am sure that a lot of the readers have read a lot worse and found it easier to read this book. The character's voices are very realistic, and so is the story line. It is very easy to follow and the ending leaves you breathless. I think it is worth the read, even if you don't plan on reading it right away.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________  By Sari (a.k.a. sara)  August 10, 2009  It's amazing what you can discover through the books in the library! I really liked it.   This is one of the books that gave me a little bit of an idea as to the world I live in and the way I think and act.  's book reminded me of the book, "The Wizard of Oz", but in a different way. The character who was depicted in "The Tin Woodman" was the same as the character portrayed in "Gumball", "The Witch of the West", and other books I have read. The author, also, has some similarities with the Wizard of the Oz character.  , who has recently died, is the hero of the story. He has lost his wife to cancer. He believes in the power of positive thoughts and that good thoughts lead to good things. His name is Oz, after the Wizard in the book. I liked that, too, because I think that is a great name for a newbie.   the story follows the main character, Oz, as he attempts to help his brother, who recently passed away. The stories are short, but I think they get the point across. I enjoyed it.

So I was not sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  As someone who has read a lot of romance (or at least a lot that I'm familiar with) it's great to get some fresh perspective on the genre and some of the tropes/questions that come up.  I don't usually go for this genre of books, but if you like the idea of a good guy being in the wrong and making his way out, you should give this a chance.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________ I am writing in response to this review from a reader on another site. My response is that it's about time the old guys were put away. This book is about the old school, the good old days. And, it's the last good book I'll read about the 60s, and the last book I'm going to read that is based on the 60's. This is the last chance for the old-timers to save their jobs. In other words, it is a book about old-schoolers. It is not about the young people who were part of the sixties. It has nothing to do with the new young people. It's about the older guys who were there. If I were reading this book it would be for the older folks who knew a lot about the 50s. I don't believe that old-timey people were more anti-war, the New Wave, or anything like that. It was mainly old people who had a stake in preserving the 60 year old status quo. I can remember some of the people who I liked. The old guy who said "You're not old enough to know anything." The old dude who was anti-communist. I liked him because he didn't seem anti-semitic. He was anti anti-Communist. My mom and I would always argue about what we were going to eat on Friday. She was very anti-meat and I said I was all for it, because I would never eat a chicken. He said it was too expensive. I said, "Why is it expensive? We can go to the food co-op and buy one." He said "Well I have a better idea, go on the corner and buy a chicken." I said "No, I'm not going to do that." He was right. I am now 40 and I like chicken. I guess he wasn't wrong. I think it is the same with the old kids. Maybe they had more influence than they were given credit for. This isn't just a political book. It says things you could say in a political discussion, but not in a book, without sounding like an old guy.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ I just finished reading "The Last Super Hero: The Rise and Fall of Superman" by Richard Pini. As a Superman fan myself, I was excited to see that a new book was being written on the character and how he became so iconic. I also really enjoyed the look into his personal life and his relationships. As for Superman, I think he still has a few tricks up his sleeve. (I am not a fan of the current Superman films, I prefer the TV shows.) I also like the fact that Pini has taken the character as a young adult. He seems to have made Superman a more mature and intelligent person as well. This is the most Superman book I have ever read and I really enjoyed it. I think it has enough depth that it can be enjoyed by people who like comics or just comic books. I would like to see a new movie that takes place before Superman's time as well as after his.

Write a positive review about a good book:.............................. The Man Who Wasn't There................................. - June 17, 2005Good book but should be about the author (not about the story)...  Reviewer: kyleh - favorite favorite favorite - May 10, 2005  Subject: Good book, but a lot of 'I know it's not you' Just as I've been reading 'The Man Who Never Was', there are times when I feel that a lot is not explained very clearly about why the events in the book took place. It feels very contrived and I think it's one of the main reasons for it not being my 'go to' book about the assassination. I wish that I'd read it in its entirety to get a clearer picture of what happened but as it is I don't feel like I have a clear view of what was going on. - May 5, 2005What is the book all about?  ...  What do I have to do to stay from being murdered?  that's what - May 2, 2005Interesting  Review: The Man who never was............................... I was intrigued by the premise and the author's background. It's a good premise to follow but at times when it seems that the book is going somewhere it seems to be heading off in a direction not as I expect a book to go. For example, I was really interested in the relationship between the author and his wife, but the book didn't seem to go there as I expected. This book is worth reading for the story alone. The only flaw I can find is that there seems to have been too many false starts for the author. Perhaps he had many false leads? Other than that, a good read! - April 28, 2005It's a nice book but a little too contrived  Rating:   Nice, easy read, with a great ending. I liked the premise of the book, though I'm not sure it was executed the way it should have been. This one's a little slow going for me.   -April 12, 2005Nice, smooth read  The last 3 books I have started with have been like this...   In this case, I started with a chapter where the guy is being held captive and the only thing he does is to yell. The author takes it at face value and then goes on about it for about 30 minutes. The end of the chapter was so far out of left field that I felt like I was
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Girl on the Train" is a great book about a young girl on a train.  It was recommended to me by a young daughter who was not happy that her parents didn't read to her as much as they should have.  I have read "Penny-Wiseguys" and "Polar Express" and they are all great reads.  I would highly recommend them to others.  This book had a similar atmosphere.  The girl does not seem to have a place in her world and in an instant it is all changed by someone she had not met yet.   I did not realize I would like this book, but my daughter loves it.    It is a short book so don't let this deter you from buying it.  I think we should be able to say we read this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A Good Book I love books. I love books so much that I'm more than willing to pay a lot of money for them. I also love having read many books, and I love learning more about the world of books. And then there is my obsession with Harry Potter. So when the opportunity to buy a new edition of Harry Potter came up, I didn't hesitate.  And so I went in search of one.  I went to the store first thing in the morning to buy the book. I'm fairly particular about what books I buy. I don't like the ones that are on sale. I like to spend my money on things that are truly worth it. And so, when it came time to buy Harry Potter, I decided that this book was worth spending the money on. This book has been in my life for a while.  It was the beginning of my reading obsession. I didn' t get to the first chapter before the title was changed from "Hogwarts Potions Master's Spell Book" to "Hogsmeade Potions Book".  Now, Harry Potter is the reason for this review.  It's been the main reason for it for the last few years.  But if you want to know the reasons why, I'll leave it to the book itself.   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (or "Harry Potter: A Fantastic Journey" in the UK) is a book written by J.K. Rowling that is a prequel to Harry Potter and is set in the world created by JK Rowling's Harry Potter books. It takes place ten years before the events of Harry, Ron and Hermione's adventures in the third and fourth Harry Potter book. The story begins in the summer of 1995 when the trio are attending school at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The third book, Harry, has already been published, so the first book is actually the first Harry Potter story in the British Isles, and therefore the only one in the English speaking world. The book follows Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor students during their first year at Hogwarts. After the first week at Hogwarts, the students start to realize that the school is really important to the wizarding world. And when the first anniversary of Voldemort's defeat comes, Harry realizes he has to do something to commemorate the occasion. At first, it is Harry's idea. He wants to buy some
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of those rare examples where the author does not make the reader feel like she is reading a textbook.  Rather, it is a refreshingly personal, personal and humorous account of growing up gay in the midwest and the subsequent realization of his sexuality as well as how the other half of his family handled his feelings and eventually the struggle with his sexuality.    As a child, I never really understood why my parents didn't think about it.  They were great and supportive of my sexuality but they were in their late twenties and did not yet feel ready to live openly gay lives.  This book is a beautiful reflection of the time it was written in and is a reminder of the trials and joys of growing older.  I am very grateful for the opportunity to read this.   Thank you, Mr. Stross, for writing such a wonderful book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  As someone who has always enjoyed Harry Potter, this series was the first one I started reading, and I have never looked back. I started with the first book in the series, and have just recently finished reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The books are very entertaining. I like to start them out with a light-hearted tone before getting into the deep things that the books are about. There are some good points to be found in this series as well, so I recommend it to everyone. What didn't I like about this book: There are a couple of parts in the first part of this book that could have been longer. I also liked that the first time the reader has to decide on what kind of story he wants to read, but it did end up taking a while to get the story going. The next story was the same as the previous one, so it wasn't really a disappointment. I would like to know why Hermione was wearing only her undergarments in the bathtub at the end of this story. Overall:    I would like this book to be more popular, because it does have its strengths, but there are also a couple areas that could be improved upon. However, the enjoyment of these books is worth the investment.  Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  -The Best of the Books and Articles  Book review - The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning How to Read by Michael J. Sullivan - June 23, 2018I purchased the Idiot Guide to Reading this spring for my 7 year old daughter who has severe reading difficulty. She can understand only a very small portion of the information in the book, and I don't know if this is the book's fault or my daughter's. I like that it contains examples of everyday things that help people with reading. I just wish it had more information on reading strategies for children who struggle, but this book is a good start in the right direction.  Novelty and Romance, Not What You Think by Michael A. Sullivan in the Library Journal (March/April, 2018) - This is a book that I had never heard of before I purchased it. It is fun to read because the illustrations are easy to understand and because the book is full of interesting trivia. My only complaint is that the title is incorrect. It should read: - A Novelty and a Romance - not something like: - "How to Date and Mate a Woman You Are Not Supposed to."  Good idea, poorly executed by an author who seems to be in denial - by Robert W. Pincus in the Washington Post (September 3, 2017) I was surprised at the title, because the only information it provided was what you might find in an old book. The rest was "facts" which I couldn't verify, because my memory of events has been so hazy and I have been doing lots of reading. In addition, the author, Michael Sullivan, wrote this book while still a college student and I do not recall him having any special knowledge in this regard.   Some of the facts seemed out of date (I recall, as a young adult, having a conversation with an old friend about the origin of the term "groucho" and it is a term we had used only a few years earlier). It's also impossible for me to remember what, if anything, has changed since my childhood.   (In my memory, "grocery" refers to something like a "spider")   Many of the details, such as the details of the relationship between two women in a bar, and the details about what is considered a "nice" meal, are not in line with current knowledge or with my understanding of things. There are a
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ I read this for the first time a couple of years ago and I loved it so much that I re-read it. I will probably re-buy the sequel. ________________________ You don't need to be a genius to enjoy a good story. _______________________ This is a great book, I'll give it 5 stars for those reasons. But the reason why it's a 5 star is because it's so well written, it's really a story of love. The best story I have ever read is called "The Story of Two Souls" by A. E. Van Vogt. This is one of the best books ever. So why does it get a 4-star rating? __________________ In some ways the story is so realistic, so down to earth, so complete that it's even funny. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ I've read a few good books by this author (and by this type of writer in general), but this is my favorite. In a genre like fantasy this is the only book that I can find that doesn't make me want to read all the other books by the same author. ___________________________________ What a perfect ending! I wish I had read this when I was in high school... As an adult, the story of the two children becomes even more vivid in my mind, and the book does a great job of showing the changes in these two children over time.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  Good job, Micky! I'm not an expert, but I'm very impressed with the way you've gone about creating a game.  The way your character interacts with others, the choices he/she makes, and the choices and reactions of others makes it more than just "RPG".  I had fun and enjoyed the game in which I took the role of a lowly mercenary and was tasked with stealing the most expensive weapon in the game.

This is a very good book that I've purchased.  A little story that I didn't really enjoy:    There were some characters that were really annoying.  There was a woman, with blue eyes.  It made me feel sorry for her and the man who took the little girl in for a haircut because she was so pretty.  Also there is a lot of fighting in the story.  I would not recommend this one to a little kid as they won't understand the way some characters are written.

Write a positive review about a good book:    What a great book! I loved this book from the first page, so many people are making the mistake of trying to be realistic about their relationship with a dog and it never works out the way it should because they just don't give their dog enough room, love and respect and the most annoying part is the dog is just going through the motions. If you get a dog, you will have lots of people trying to give you advice and there is only one right way to show the dog that it is not the alpha and that your priority is the relationship and the love of your pet rather then the title that comes after the name of the dog and that is The Game. You will get some of the tips in here but the ones I am going to focus on are the ones that worked out for my dog, and I know that you will get them too because I have been there. It helps to have a good dog because you will learn a lot. The only negative thing I can say about this book is that if you have two dogs who are a bit too competitive it is going to show. There are some things to remember but if you can get through that it's good advice.   Read this book and you will make a friend. My dog came to me to get an exam for some dental issues. He was in such a bad shape that they sent a vet away to do his teeth and they were so bad that they couldn't even be fixed because they were already infected. The vet told me he had just one week to do the exam, and even if he did the exam I was going to have to put him down. I did not want to put down a sick, old dog and when my dog came back it had to be put down because his teeth were bad and they couldn  Read a positive reviewer's opinion:

Write a positive review about a good book:  I had been meaning to read The Last Word in a while. It is a short book, and easy to read.  The author does an excellent job at describing a story.  When the book was delivered in the mail it did not make me smile.  The cover is attractive, and the story is interesting and well put together.  But, there was a lot that bothered me in this book.   The writing is clunky.  As someone who loves to read well crafted prose, I don't like clunky writing.  They don't go together well.  I'm not sure what exactly I disliked about the writing, but I felt it was very amateur.  In the end, I really enjoyed this book, even though it didn't work for me.   Final Rating:  Overall Rating: 4.5/5
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book. The plot is interesting and well explained. It's a good look into a girl's life that is not told in a "weird" way (in fact, the book's main character is described as the most normal, normal girl on earth, which is a bit weird, but not that weird), and her feelings are very well written. I didn't have any problems with the writing or grammar, although I could have done without a few spelling errors. My only complaint is that the book is very light on actual action (though it contains a few things that make the characters think) which could be done better. But I will admit that my only real problem with this book was that the protagonist seemed a little too... "normal" for my liking. This is, I think, a very good book!

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This is a well written and well-researched paper on the problems that occur to those seeking to use religion for social purposes. It is quite disturbing to read about how many people with good intentions end up hurting innocent victims and creating a world that is even more dangerous than before." "This paper addresses the issue of religious coercion in a convincing, comprehensive manner. This is the first time I have encountered a book like this that covers the entire scope of the problem and presents an overall solution.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********************* I was in a lot of moods when I was reading this book. I'm sure, like all of us, I'd often find myself drifting off during the workday and wondering, "what would it be like if I just went to that bar or bar on the other side of town every night for five days and just danced my ass off." After all, why should we have to work every day? Why not do something that we love that we can't even do right now? It would be great!  And then I got home and started looking for a job. It was only a few weeks before Christmas, so there were only a couple hundred people in my job search. If I had a full time job, I might have done something like this... I'd have probably found a place in an office by then. But I didn't. So, for three weeks in a row, I lived at my mom's, and danced my way through Christmas parties, and New Years Eve, and the day after Thanksgiving, and everything in between. It wasn't fun. But the thing that stuck with me the most about it was how I felt, like a complete different person in that time. Even though my parents weren't around to watch me, I felt like I was on my own. I wasn't doing things with my friends, I wasn: a. spending time with people I barely even knew. b. in my underwear. I wanted to move out. It's like when you do something so fun and you're like, "Hey, let's go to the club tonight!" and then you wake up in the morning and realize, "I don't have any clothes to wear." Or, "It's just me this time."  My next question is how much the people I slept with knew about me. I've always had a good reputation in my neighborhood, so my parents were probably just like, who the hell? But my roommate didn't know I was doing it at all. When I was backpacking around Europe, we would always just hang out on the couch or in the kitchen and chat. I never had a one night stand, so it's weird that nobody was aware of the fact that I was sleeping around.  It took me awhile to realize that I'd completely changed. I felt awkward, like I'd lost something. I missed my old self so badly. I even started to feel like a slut. I still

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is full of knowledge. I recommend this book for the history of human rights as well as the current situation. A few things to remember: -There are many good books on human rights, but this one is a special book. -The current status of human right in Iran is very different from the time this book was written. The author wrote about it in detail. He wrote a great book about the present status of the rights.  There are some very bad governments, but there are also some really good ones too. -Some countries that are good and some that are not. This book shows you how people are living in different parts of the world. I think this book can be used by everyone who wants to understand the present situation of human and civil rights in the world -This book can help you to understand some issues on human and social rights in many countries of the past and in many parts of modern-day.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* A great read! I enjoyed the story and characters. The author does a wonderful job of writing a story and a story about people. I can see how people could relate to this book because I have a similar experience of growing up. My mom took care of me so my dad worked in an office. It was just me and my two brothers. The mom used to take care of us, as long as we didn't do any things to offend anyone. But it was the two girls, one of them is my girlfriend now. One day one of my brothers said that I should be a real man and go out and do some stuff and do it well. He also said that he was the kind of person that could fix your car if you just asked. The other one of the girls was the same. So they both took a liking to me and it was a friendship that lasted until my dad was killed. But this is the story of how they became friends and became one of many things that happened in my life. I like that it is a short story, but it can be a nice quick read. I enjoyed it very much. I just wish that it wasn't so long.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful

A bad review about an unenjoyable book: I loved this book, but the author needed to work on his story telling. The author was kind enough to answer a few questions for me after I got the book. The answers were very helpful and gave me more confidence to continue with the story. Review for the new book "A Boy's Tale" by K.W.J. Woodbury (2018)   The new book is also available online on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk  Author K. W. J. Woodcome is a popular author and cartoonist in the UK, and also resides in San Diego, California.  I bought this book for my 8-year-old son. He is a great kid, loves reading and playing with his Lego.  the illustrations were also good. 's book follows the adventures of a boy named James as he tries to save the world from the evil wizard, Nefair!  The book features a lot of fun and exciting ideas like:  Flying a car by gliding in it with his wizard friends! - James has been studying magic for years, but he is not the best at it.  for this story, he is the most awesome wizard.  he uses spells like Firebolt, Lightning Bolt and Freeze. He can also use them to control water, and he can even create lightning bolts that strike anywhere in the world. He learns a lot from his friends and the other wizards as he starts out on his adventure. James is the hero of this book because he can save the whole world! ,,  - I loved the illustrations in this book!

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________   For what it's worth, I did read the book. A lot of people complained about the prose, and I thought it was ok. I thought that the prose was a little on the heavy side for my tastes.   It was fun to read a story about the supernatural. I think I like this type of stuff, but the stories have so many different ways you can twist the story around. I've read other books which focus on the supernatural, and some of them are very short and dry. This is a longer, more thought provoking and enjoyable book.   The only thing I don't really get about the book is the fact that it was written in the 60's or 70's. Some of the science in the book has changed, for example we have the DNA testing for DNA. I just wish we had better understanding in some of these cases. It's a little sad that many of these people have passed away and they never get a chance to be able to be heard.

It was great - everyone had great ideas to share and they were all on the same page (the same page as the author). I attended every subsequent meeting until the last one and had the chance to chat to the people who had written the book and had done all the work.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's great, and I think a lot of folks would like it, but my son had to read it because he's still learning to read. I don't think it is a book that a baby will love right away.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A little bit off topic but it's the most enjoyable book I've read this year. It was like a good buddy movie.   The characters are just as well drawn as the story and the plot keeps up with the intensity of the characters that are being portrayed.
Write a positive review about a good book:  My second (but by no means last) book from this author I'm a huge fan of the fantasy genre and I've enjoyed the various books they've put out in that genre. I just found the series to be a little to slow for my liking. The characters had interesting aspects to them but the pacing felt a bit slow at times. The world was great and there were a lot of good and interesting characters, but again a slow pacing can be a bit annoying. The writing style is a very light and easy on the eyes type of prose that was quite enjoyable for a fantasy book. The author did an excellent job of using vivid colors and using them to great effect in the story and the illustrations were superb. There are also quite a few funny moments in the book that would definitely be appreciated by any adult readers. All in all this is definitely an enjoyable and very light novel, though I do think it would be better if the pacing were more even. For the price I'm going to give it the 5 stars I'm definitely going to recommend it to anyone looking for a light fantasy novel. 9/10
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book helped me understand a large part of what I do every day."  Have an intelligent and interesting answer:   "I thought it was very interesting, and it explained a lot." .  I've been looking for a book that can give me a quick, concise understanding of the inner workings of how we run our business and what is involved in setting up and running our business. I also wanted to learn how to get my work done in a way that has real value to other people. I did a lot of research into this and had to read lots of book and see lots of videos, and had some very challenging discussions with other entrepreneurs about how to organize our business in the right way. The biggest problems that I found with this book are (1) It is not very detailed about what the most effective ways are to organize business activities and (2) it does not go into a lot more depth on setting up a business. There is some good stuff, but a lot is just a series of bullet points.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________  The only thing I can add is that I am a huge fan of the author and really enjoyed the book.  A must read!   Thank you for your book "A Good Place to Grow"  --A Good Book Reviewer   --The Storyteller--  I enjoyed this book, I recommend it to all of my friends   It's a good story and you can learn a lot from it.  the beginning was just a little to confusing but the later parts were much better   Also you could do a lot better for some of the descriptions I can't remember the names of the people but I can say that all of the adults that are mentioned were funny, and I liked the way that you could describe how funny they were.   All in all I thought it was good but could have been a little more clear about some of things. I have an 8 year old who will read it in the next few months and I am sure he will think that a lot of the language was a little too strong for him to understand   A good read
Write a positive review about a good book:  The World of The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien is a very engaging fantasy novel, and one that is enjoyable in all the ways I look for in a fantasy novel: depth, suspense, and good characters.  This book is a worthy investment in the series, and while I have no doubt that the final book in the trilogy will be a disappointment, I would still recommend this book to any fantasy fan who enjoys good writing and the story of Middle-earth.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book! I don't even know where to begin, it's really amazing, and it's one of my new favorite reads. I really liked the story and I hope that we get more books like this one in the future. The writing is great, the characters are strong and unique, the book is short but it's not boring. If you're a fan of paranormal stuff I think this book will be a great read, I can't wait to see where the story goes from here.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I recently picked up a copy of this book and it is a must for those who are on the fence about trying this way of cooking. When I read about the different ways to do this one was very clear to me, I just decided that I would give it a try. I am so glad I did. The best part of this cookbook is the photography. It really is beautiful and well organized. This book is also quite large which is great for easy storage. You can also get the printed book on Amazon for a great price. I will definitely be purchasing more. My thoughts:   I purchased this cook book because of the name and the reviews. I have had a tendency for my family to be a bit of a traditionalist, not a fan of anything that goes beyond what is served at family gatherings. I thought this would be a good guide for them to have some of those traditional dishes that are traditionally served in the southern areas of the United States. This recipe book has so many of them. The main thing that I didn't like about the book was that it didn't give a great description for some of the items. It was mostly just that they didn't really say how they were prepared. They do have pictures in the cookbook for each of the dishes but they didn the pictures to give the recipe a better description. I know that if I ever do make any of these recipes I will just have to google them. They are pretty straight forward. The Pros:  There are several items listed in this book that I have found to be very easy to prepare. Some items take no more than about 10-15 minutes to prepare and others can take anywhere from 10 to 25 minutes. I also thought that the descriptions were helpful and it really gave an idea of the kind of food that would be served. My favorite parts of this recipe book are the photos. They really are gorgeous and I just like the fact that there were more pictures in this cook books than in most books. I purchased this book for a 9"x13" book which was a good size for easy reading on my coffee table and for easy on the shelf storage. This cook book will help make sure that I can provide my family with traditional Southern American meals. It has so much variety of recipes that I am sure that my family will be able to enjoy this book. I think that this will be a great addition to any Southern kitchen!

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Night's Dawn is a good, well-written, well presented read.  While I had read the novel before I found this novel's alternate world a really fun place to visit.  Thank you, the author.   Read an unedited and unfiltered review by the author on Goodreads:  A young noble is born in the kingdom of Ragnarrar, a small kingdom in the east, to a good but naive family.  This family has a strong influence on his young life but his father is not in favor of him going to an academy.  As it is he is forced to leave and has to seek his fortune on his own.  He makes his way as a thief and an assassin in the underworld and a soldier in the royal army. He is not always happy, but this makes him a better man.  His time in the army is an interesting experience. It is a small but interesting time in his life. The story takes place in the land of Rargarrar in the far north, far away from the mainland.  The countryside and mountains are very beautiful.  Unfortunately the land is so beautiful that it does not offer anything to the main characters.  They come from the most well off part of the country, with a king and nobles, a city of great power, and an academy where the children from the wealthy families go to learn.  In the academy there are a lot of girls but only boys.  Their teacher is named Mirin and they are taught about the world and their world but never to ask them anything about it.  Because Mirin is an old man and has lost his touch, his lessons are of very little use.   He teaches them that they will be given a chance to become men one day, and to take it well, but if they fail, they will have to die.  Mirin seems to have an eye for these children.  Although all the young men seem to be very kind to the girls, some of them seem to have a strange interest in them.  While the young noble finds his way to the academy, he does not know that he will become part of an amazing tale.  [Note: As a side note, I think the author has a wonderful sense of humor. I found myself laughing out loud at many parts of the book. ]

I liked the format of it, the description of the characters was very interesting, the characters were well developed and the writing flowed with the flow of the story.

I wish I would have picked up some of the books that I have been looking at to help me understand the topic of the month better. It helps me to see why a particular area is in the area it is and what is going to happen there. Great job. I will be checking out more of your titles. *****  Book Details  Language : English  Genres : Action/Adventure, Drama  POV : Non-POV  Characters : None  Rating : Not yet rated  Review : I enjoyed it very much! I have just found out about this book and am so grateful to see that there is a series. So far as the plot goes, I know it will not be as popular as the first book in the series but I can't wait to find out what is coming next!  The story has a little bit of romance but this is not really the main focus, it just gets there in the background of the adventure. I really enjoyed the characters and I think that this series is going places! I am looking forward to the next book in this series and I will keep you updated on how that goes. I highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in travel! .  .
Write a positive review about a good book:  " A great read " - David F. - July 18, 2016 I have read many books about the history of the world, but this is the best I have ever read " - James - June 25, 2016  I have read quite a few books on history and I still don't understand why a certain thing happened in a certain place when there are many examples of a similar thing happening at the same time. It seems that the book takes place during a war between the Roman Republic and the Byzantine Empire, so a bit more of the history was already mentioned. In addition, it provides a bit of humor and light heartedness at some parts. However, when you read a long book that tries to tell everything, it becomes too complicated and gets old very quickly. As a side note, if you like historical fiction, I would suggest that you give this book a shot, or read something else that may be more interesting.  Otherwise you are better off just having a cup of coffee or a glass of wine. I would recommend the book because I think that most of the problems are explained and the authors have interesting ideas and are well-written. If you want a fun read, this may not be your book. However if you are interested in history and know a few facts, then you will definitely enjoy the book. I found the characters to be interesting, but I am very sure that this is a book that many people have been dying to read. I was really looking forward to this book, and I am so glad that I did! A well written book about a well-known historical figure that gives you an interesting read. There are a few things that I wanted to see more about, however, I'm glad I got to see a good deal of history. A great history book that could have been much more, but it has enough to it to make you think about it and to feel the emotions of a story that could be much more. This book will leave you feeling proud of your intelligence and curiosity and most importantly, with a bit melancholy. A well-told story that is not at all dry and pretentious. I found myself actually getting emotional from the story. Thank you for a great read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It's definitely not my favorite of her books, but I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I feel like a lot of her stories have so much tension, but here the tension is a little more muted and that made me like the book more. I really liked the romance aspect, as it really made for some enjoyable reading. I like that she wrote it in the first person and that she used short, but detailed descriptions and the same pace from beginning to end.  In this case I felt like I needed to re-read the book to understand it a little better, but it was still an enjoyable read. Overall, I'd say it's a good read, but not my first choice. 
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I was a bit skeptical about this book at first, as I've seen many other reviewers mention the "futuristic" and "historical" feel that this book has. However, after giving it some time to absorb, I can say that I was not disappointed. I was actually surprised at how good the book felt, even though I was aware of the "historic" feel to the book (as most historical fantasy books do) and the fact that the story was set in the modern era, but in this case, it felt a bit like the story of King Solomon and his wisdom. I'm definitely willing to read a book set in ancient Egypt again, if I can come away with something I enjoyed as much as I did with this one. ------------ Summary: A young boy discovers a gem that is not of this world and must use its power to find a new home, while a magical world and a strange species battle for the soul of its king. I loved the story! The protagonist is interesting, the writing is good, the world building is intriguing, and the main characters are unique. The story is exciting and it's definitely worth the read. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a novel with a historical feel, but not necessarily a historical fantasy.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________  I read this book on my iPad. It was a very useful tool for me when I needed to know what the words were for a specific word. It also gave me the ability to quickly find the meanings by typing the word. I had used this before for finding the meanings of words with my old Kindle but this book made it even easier for me. If you're going to buy this book because you have trouble reading it with your iPad (or any e-reader) then it's a good idea to read it on your computer so that you don't forget the meanings. The iPad version was very easy to navigate.  Review by: T.H. Foskey on July 21, 2015 : (no rating)  This book has given me a lot to think about when writing and reading. The author provides some great suggestions for future research that I could use. I have a feeling that I will need this one again.  is a helpful reference guide for researchers, writers, and students. The material is presented in a clear and understandable manner, so that it is easier to understand and follow. The topics covered include topics such as syntax, vocabulary, phonology, grammar, and psychology. I especially enjoyed the discussion of different approaches to writing and analysis of language, both with and without a specific reference document such as this one. I enjoyed reading about the "new" grammars and other features of "standard" English, which I had not known before. I hope this book will become the best reference I can find for learning English as I am learning it myself. ...  My only critique is that the table of contents could use more footnotes, because it is so full of entries.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this when I was around 12. It was my first exposure to non-binary gender. I've never had much interest in the subject, but this book was very well written. I'm not transgender and I definitely wouldn't describe myself as a non-trans woman, but it was a good introduction and made me want to read more. I would like to see a more gender neutral book or book that explains the concept of gender non-conforming or non-gender conforming people. That way we can all understand one another and learn from one another. Thank you. I am a very young queer and non-white transgender person and have had very little time to research and understand this subject. I appreciate the writing in this book and I hope others are able to learn and understand and take away from this book. This is the first book I have read that truly explained gender nonconforming people and I was able to make a connection with this subject! This book is wonderful and I will read the rest of the book when I have time. It took me a while to make the connection to nonbinary and gender non conforming because I was so young when I first read this book, but now that I'm an adult it was easy to see how this was the case for me. I highly recommend this book for everyone who is interested in gender non conformity or non conformity and their allies!  24 of 26 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________ I think I'm going to be writing a lot of negative reviews on this book. I'm not going to lie, it's not a book I was expecting to like, and I'm certainly not going buy a copy for myself. I've heard good things about it before but this is the first time I've actually had a chance to read it. I read it for the librarians at our local library but I'm a little disappointed. The first thing that stands out to me is that the writing style is very "prehistoric". If you've been reading SF/F for a long time, you'll have noticed the common trait of a lot (if not all) of it. It starts with the "what if" and then builds from there. I can't really say much about the actual plot, because the writing is so much like what I've come to expect from this genre, but I am glad I read this book, even if I'm still not a fan of the style.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________ My friends and I took a trip to Scotland recently to see the Stonehenge. One of our favorite things to do there is to go to the site of the ancient Celts and spend a day in their ancient burial site at the Druids' Round Tower. We also went to other sites including the Druid grove and Stonehenger Church. I must say that this book was the BEST thing that we had done. It really had everything that was interesting about ancient cultures, the mystery of their life, and the history of Stonehengy. The Celtic Druids and the Celtic Gods are the same gods that were worshiped by the Egyptians and the Greeks, plus other people of Europe. The Druids of Scotland were very important in the lives of all who came from the other parts of the world to Scotland. Some of the Celtic Druid Gods had the power to bring rain, cure illness, and even make the sky grow on trees. The Celts of Scotland held all the great secrets of the universe, and used it to help others in their daily lives. My son and I read this book as a family over the 4 days we were in Scotland. We both enjoyed it so much that we bought the CD of it at the last minute.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. I have found that people who read this book like it, and people who don't really enjoy it don't like it either. I would recommend this book to those people. It gives you a sense of humor to the story, and it's not a terribly good book, but you'll like it. It's not my favorite book, and I don't recommend it, but this was a good read, and definitely a good enough read to make you laugh, to make someone think, and to make one wish he'd never come out of the closet. I'm a little biased. (Also, I've been asked by several people if I'm gay, and honestly I don the answer is no. I love my brother, and we're both straight.)
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this in February and I thought the book was well written and entertaining with a good sense of humor.  This is a story about a girl who wants to be a nurse so she can save lives. I liked the story about her dad who is very smart and likes science.  She thinks that all women should be nurses and I think that might be too much.  One thing I did not like was the book covers.  I did like the illustrations of the nurses but I felt they were too cute.  The whole series is cute but I am a nurse and I know that if there is blood it means that someone is injured.  There are some things that are done with a smile on my face.  Another thing I liked was the way they dealt with the idea of a female nurse with a "mama bear" like mother.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book taught me much about the different types of "grit", a new term I've learned in my business.  I thought that, for the most part, I knew what grit was, but this book really changed how I view my own and everyone else's grit.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very valuable resource for anyone wanting to know more about the world of psychedelics and the work of psychedelic psychologists.

I found the book to be very detailed and comprehensive, with a lot for the layperson to dig into. If anyone is looking for a good place to start with psychedelic research, I would recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of those books that have to be read in order from beginning to end. The first half of the book is mostly just stories about the various characters, the things they encounter, the adventures they have, and what they learn from their own mistakes. This is good for a book, especially an adventure book, as it keeps the characters and their back story fresh and fun. As the book goes on however, the characters' back stories and experiences begin to bleed over and the adventures get more complex and important. And that is great for the reader, because it means that we begin to see the repercussions of their actions on the world, in the form of monsters, demons, and other things they have encountered on their quest. For those of you who don't like reading the back stories, don't worry!  The back stories are well done, and most of them do a good job of showing the characters, as well as making the reader want to know more. I can't say enough about the back story.  Every character has a back story to tell, and they all have interesting back stories! And, as I mentioned earlier, the back-stories of the main characters are pretty well done. The book begins and ends with the same thing, but it is a pretty great way to start. You get to know the characters better, and you begin to feel connected to them. The second half of this book is more action, and more action that is well-done. But the action in this book isn't the only thing I enjoy. There are some well-written character moments, and some cool twists and turns. It was fun to read and it was also a great way for the author to kick off the third book in this series. Overall, it was a good read! It had everything that I enjoyed about this book: fun, action, interesting back-story, and well-planned and written encounters.  If you're looking for a good fantasy adventure, this is a great choice.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- "I really enjoyed reading this book. I loved the story. I also enjoyed seeing how the author takes some of the stories I would think would be terrible and makes them into something that is very believable. My favorite story was the story of an old woman who had to move into a nursing home and has to try to keep her memories alive. She does that and gets along with her daughter and friends. I found it very interesting to hear her story." --------------------------- "This is one of those books that I never got to read but the one that has stayed in my mind and stayed in the back of my mind forever. It was the most wonderful read for me, and I loved it for that reason alone. My husband, who is not as much of a book fan, is still getting to read this book, which makes me so happy! I just wish we could have read it together!" -------------------------- "I bought this book for my husband, and he couldn't get enough. I think the book is great. It makes you laugh and cry at the same time. We've both had so much fun reading it."  I think this is one that I will read and re-read. I just loved it! It's the first book that I have read by Anne Fadiman that I absolutely loved and I'm excited to see what she has next. I really hope she doesn't make a sequel to this book - I think that would be very, very, bad news.  My husband and I both loved this book and both of us are definitely planning on reading it again. It is one I can see us both being happy to read again and again.   As far as the narrator goes - she really did a fantastic job. I never found myself getting bored of hearing her say, "that was a really nice story" over and over again, and my husband said that he did too. She has such an interesting voice and her tone was always such a great contrast to the rest of the book.  a book that is truly wonderful.    Thank you so much for your wonderful book. You have created an entertaining and emotional story. Thank you for sharing your writing with us, and thank you for this gift! I am going to start reading it right now.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- This book is extremely helpful and easy to read. It's about the history of the American military in WW2. Very interesting and informative, although there are a few errors here and there. But nothing major and the explanations in the book are so clear that I was able to understand what was being said. It would be very easy for a non-specialist to follow along and learn something. This is the third of the books on the subject of the military. There are so many that are out there that it can be difficult to pick out the right one. There were a few inaccuracies and the author was very quick to correct them. I hope to have a chance to read the others in the series as well.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________  "It was a wonderful book, filled with real life stories. I liked that all the stories were personal, even the bad ones. Some people were just plain stupid, some just plain evil, but they were human beings, just like the rest of us. I like to think that people like the authors when they are alive, but then they die, and what's the point?" (Posted on 1/11/15)  Comment From: Anonymous  2013-01-25T00:54:02-05:00  I like this book. One thing that I like, is that it is about how we deal with things. I don't care what I think about it, I want to read it again. I found that it didn't give me a clear and definite answer, it just told me a story of how to deal with situations. I had a lot of trouble reading it at first, I had trouble concentrating, I couldn't see how any of it made sense. I really liked reading this book, and I hope that you continue it. (Posted in 2012)  the book is wonderful. if I'm reading it again, I would re-read it. I just wish I had the book in hand when i was reading it, and my mother would tell me about what the woman said...

Write a positive review about a good book: __________  In this excellent collection of essays, writers of varying backgrounds, and with varying levels of formal education share their experiences of teaching creative writing. In an era where many students find creative writing to be intimidating, it is good to see how well these students adapt and improve as they get more experience, and the same applies to these authors. It is very refreshing to see the varied styles and approaches that writers of different backgrounds are using to teach their craft. The diversity of opinions among the authors and the way they express them are a true gift to all creative writing students. Highly recommended."  -Michele V. Jones, Creative Writing, A Guidebook  "This book, The Creative Writing Teacher, is a very readable and well-written work. You can take a peek at some of the essays here, but I would highly recommend that you pick up the book and read it all. If you are a student of creative writing, this book is the most comprehensive and valuable reference you can get. If a creative writing teacher, this is a must for your classroom library." .  Karen C. Ebeling  The Creative Writing Master Class  Author's Website: Karen C.Ebeling.com  About The Author:  As a teacher of high school students and college students, I have worked with a variety of students. My first students were from a rural, low income community with low expectations for their creative writing teachers. I worked with them every day and I could see how they were growing. After two years of working with them, I noticed that their creative output was dramatically improving, and that their confidence was also developing. That's when I decided to give writing a second chance, and in 2011 I launched The Creative writing Master Class. I still teach creative writing online for all students, regardless of their age, income, background or experience. I also have a second online Master Class taught in a more traditional classroom setting. Both classes are offered online and both are FREE for students. I encourage my students to work with me in a creative way.  the Creative Writing teacher  What was one of the most important aspects of teaching these students?  For students, the biggest learning I made from my first creative writing class was that students will be more creative as long as they trust you. They need to know that if you tell them they can't do something, then it doesn't count. I made them realize
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Last of the American Indians by Joseph Conrad I am a huge Conrad fan and this book was the latest to be added to the ever growing collection of Conrad novels.  In fact I have already finished the first book in the series and read it and loved it.   The plot is brilliant and I was hooked instantly.  The way Conrad created the new world was breathtaking and his ability to create a believable world and believable characters from a time and place very unlike anything we know today is beyond words.    The story is an interesting blend of science, adventure, politics, romance, religious symbolism, and some quite graphic and shocking scenes of violence.   I am not going to spoil it for those who have not read the book but the plot twists were very well done.   Conrad does not spend more time on the religious and political issues than on the characters, yet it is so well done and they are so rich in character and story that they easily become part of the world and its history.   The Last is an excellent book to bring a bit of the Caribbean back to our lives, and to tell the story of a man who lived there. I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The writing is superb and the narration is flawless. The only problem with this book is that it is a bit too dry and academic. The plot and character development are strong, but the language makes the book somewhat dull and academic."   (review of free book)  Review by: Julie L. On September 24, 2012, the author wrote:This book is so compelling and beautiful and well researched. The worldbuilding is superb. I highly recommend it to all those who are interested in the history of the land of Middle Earth, and Tolkien's worldbuilding. (view spoiler) , an account of the events leading up to the publication of the Third Edition of The Lord of the Rings. There is no discussion of the book's historical content as this is a history of Middle-Earth rather than a discussion of Tolkien's original works; for that matter, most of the actual history is only known to Tolkien and his contemporaries and is a matter of public record. The author, Richard P. Godwin, a former University lecturer, describes the events and characters, the characters and events, and their relationships as they happened in the late 1930s, with some emphasis on the people Tolkien was working with at that time. The historical information here is quite accurate, but, unfortunately, the factual details are largely omitted from the book, as the reader is given the impression that this is the story of events long past. It is not. It gives an impression of events, people, and places from Tolkien's day.The book, however, has an interesting structure, and is interesting from a historical perspective. There are no historical figures or events, but there is a story, and it gives us a fairly good sense of what went on between 1938 and 1943, and the reactions by Tolkien and others to this dramatic period. There were a number of reasons why, for example, the Lord of a New Zealand family had to be the only heir to the throne of Middleearth, and one was a war, with its resultant casualties, the effects of which are still being felt. The events in Middle-earth are discussed, and they show the reader Tolkien's respect for Tolkien's preoccupations and the influence of Tolkien himself. Some of the historical events are given by Tolkien himself, but most are given without a direct quote, and some are quoted in the book itself as a comment on them by Tolkien. The book also includes a chapter on the history and architecture of Tolkienland,

Write a positive review about a good book:  Truly a good read. I found it challenging to put down. The ending was a nice twist and was the perfect ending to an epic saga of love and pain. If you're a fan of the epic fantasy genre you should take a look. You may just find your next book. I hope the next one is just as good. 4.0 stars from 2 reviews The world is destroyed. Only a handful of people are able to continue living. A handful of men and women. Men and women with the ability to see past the veil of life to the greater power of the spirit. These people called The Spirits. There are few Spirits left, and only a small handful of them are chosen to see into the future. They will choose the best of their kind. They won't choose the weak. They'll choose the strong. The Spirits are the chosen ones. They can sense when the world is going to end, and they will be there to stop the destruction. The ones who survive will be the ones who are able take on the spirits and become Spirits themselves. If this is your thing, check out The End of Time by Charles Stross "I had read all of the Stross I could get my hands on by this point (or, at least I had until I read this book) -and he had the most intriguing and unique premise for a series of books I'd seen in quite a long time.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------  I've just finished reading the book and it is wonderful, a must have for any fantasy lover. I read this book when I was at the end of the world and I felt the end coming on. This book changed my life. It has got to be a work of art. Thanks a lot for this and the inspiration it gives me.  - Chris B.   The Good:  This book is just as described. It is an exciting ride. A story that will take you on a thrilling journey to the middle of nowhere to meet some new friends and a new monster.  to read the first book in this series, "The Dark Is Rising" or "The Fall Of House Day", I suggest reading "The Blood of the New Moon". The two books are very different but have some similarities in regards to the protagonist. This is just a brilliant new take on an old story. The first book is a good place to begin as the book takes you to the beginning of the journey you are on. The characters are the characters you would meet in any fairytale. I think this is a perfect blend of the fantasy genre and the historical period. It shows the power of the human will and what it can do to overcome any obstacle. The author is very talented, and I'm a big fan of her stories. She's really put her heart and soul into this one and I can't wait to read her next work!  It is great to read a book that not only entertains you, but also provides a sense of hope. I would say that if you have the desire to read something with an epic plotline, but with a unique twist, and with a very realistic story, then this would be a great choice. If you want a great fantasy that will keep you entertained, then you'll want to read this one! , a new fantasy, will take your breath away.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've bought this book because I am interested in ancient history and the early years of Christianity and also because I read the book and liked it so I wanted to review it. I really enjoyed it. It gives us a historical view of the early Christians, how they lived, where they came from, and the time of their death and burial. The book is informative and fun and has an interesting history. No rating I had to write something to try to make the review as accurate as possible.  I am a novice at reviewing books. I've started this blog after years of reviewing the same books over and over for fun and no money. I didn't want to stop after my first year and a half.  My first year review on this blog has been so successful that I had started the second year. I had written an amazing review in my first book and didn't think twice about writing a second one. However I felt that the first book was the best review that I could write and didn?t want to break the first one with a mediocre review. However, I have to admit, I was surprised at how badly this review was received. I thought I should not be that surprised. The reviews on Amazon and Goodreads are all from someone who is new to this.  The bad reviews are from people who have already read it.  It was a real shock.  Yes, this book did make me laugh.  There was a scene where we were talking about Jesus Christ, the Apostles, the Gospels, and how important it was to find the truth. I think it was when I said that one of the reasons I like this book so much was because I think we all would agree that it is very important that we learn what the truth is. We are very sensitive to it and don't like to be lied to. I said if Jesus didn't exist, or that Jesus didn??t get crucified, we wouldn?t even know that Jesus existed. I was laughing out loud at how ridiculous it sounds, but it is the truth about people?s response. I have been a skeptic since the day I was taught to believe in Jesus. I also have not given the book 5 stars because I still have some problems with the writing style and the descriptions of Jesus?s life. I know that you can't really get a complete picture of who Jesus was by reading his life, but there were things I wasn?t too fond

This is a must-have book to get used to the basic math behind this hobby. I will definitely recommend this to a friend.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book on the history of art. I was surprised at the length of the book, especially when I finished it. It's a bit of an odd book as there is a large amount of material that was not included in the first edition. It is interesting as it deals with different types of art and its history, not just as it relates to European art, but also Asian art. The book covers the art from the early Roman Empire to the 19th century, covering the work of Rembrandt and Van Dyck, and includes information about art dealers, the people that trade in art, the role of art as a business in society, and art-related topics like the meaning of art, value of art to society, the idea of art-world in art museums and museums, the nature of art itself and its evolution. I think the author did an excellent job in this book and I think there is great value to be found in looking at art history in this way. The author is well-known and I'm sure a lot of the information and information on art dealers was already available in other works. If there is one flaw I would have to give it an extra star as it might be a bit confusing at points when a specific work is described and others are not included. I don't think there should be a single chapter dedicated to the art of one artist, though, since there is such a wealth of material. Overall, a good read with lots of information. For sale: A piece of art with a note from a friend. There are several pages on the sale of art in this volume and a lot on the buyers' perspective, especially since there are so many different types and the buyers themselves are unique in their outlook on the art they have purchased. This is a well-thought-out volume and I do think it will be of great interest to collectors. Here's the review:  This is a new work by the same author. It deals with the history and development of the art market, focusing on different types. The emphasis on buyers is interesting, but I wouldn't say it is central to the content. It does a good job at explaining how the buyers and sellers interact and the different types in terms of their attitude and motivation. There is a short chapter about the role played by auction houses and dealers in the art world, although there is nothing much on this in particular. It isn't really a book that
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________ This book is a really good read. It helped me see why people have a hard time leaving the Church. I do think it's necessary to leave the Church if the doctrine is not compatible with your life. I had been in the Church for a while. I knew some of the basic stuff but didn't know about much more. My questions about the Church have never been answered with good answers, just with excuses and denials. I just felt it was my right to ask some questions I had that made me doubt everything. I was afraid of being rejected, but decided to leave anyway and now I am free from the Church."

It's not everyday that you get to read a story where the story is told as well as the characters are written, but that's what makes it so great.

The author does a wonderful job of summarizing her experiences and explaining how her experiences have helped her to cope and get better. This is a great start for anyone interested in being a better advocate and/or care giver to others living with schizophrenia, or anyone who wants to learn more about the condition.  the book is well-written, easy to follow, and filled with stories. The "bad days" are included with good explanations on how to recognize and cope with them. The experiences are also well-organized and explained.   The chapters that deal with what happens after the negative episodes are really well written and explain how to get through them with a little more understanding. There are also chapters dealing with the positive changes and coping that come after each experience. These chapters are a nice overview of what is happening in her life and what she needs in order to be a "good" advocate.  . , the author makes the "bad-day" descriptions relatable and clear by using phrases like "her brain is just screaming for help." She explains how this behavior is something that people with schizophrenia do to try and get attention or comfort from others. The chapter about what happens when the negative episode is over is also interesting and easy to understand.  : This book contains a number of helpful things you can do to help people with and people you love. I am especially interested in the section on the "Good Things" section of this book. I have been wanting to read about this for quite some time now.

I think I will read the sequel. My next pick up is "The Witch of Dune" which has some great characters. "A Game of Thrones" is an excellent read. There are some good stories in here and they are not too much longer then others. "The Demonologist" is another fun book. The only problem was that they could have made it more interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:  What the heck, let's go with this one. I've not read any of the books by Mark Steyn before, but I liked his new book, so it's a good addition to my list.  The American Left: A Documentary History of the Progressive Movement From Theodore Roosevelt to Bernie Sanders by Mark Lilla This is a book I had to wait for. The American Left, A Documental History is a fascinating and often-disturbing narrative on how the Progressive movement influenced the political landscape in the United States, from the 19th century to the present. The book focuses on the evolution of American Progressivism from Theodore Roosevelt, the father of modern liberalism, to the current Democratic Party and its leadership of a party of its own.  It is not an easy read; it's long, and the text is littered with footnotes and endnotes, and it's occasionally difficult to keep track of the events and people discussed.   Steyn has an excellent style: his prose has the casual quality of a news story; his use of adjectives is often appropriate and interesting (as he often is about the author of this book), but his subject is difficult to read.  The problem with this book is the time he spends explaining why we need to rebrand Progressivism.  He explains that we have been using Progressivism as a catch-all term for the liberal cause since the Progressive Era (1887–1927).  Progressivism, however, does not have to be a catch all term.  There's nothing in Steyn's explanation that makes me think it is not appropriate for a progressive ideology.  Steen and other progressives have not only used a broad definition of Progressivism to cover a wide range of issues, but they have also used Progressivism in a way that has been used to justify and legitimize every form of conservative thought and action in the years since the 1960s.  And I say that as someone who used the word "liberal" a lot when I was growing up.  But Steyn is the one who should be explaining this.  In fact, he does so in great detail.  So much so that one of his book's weaknesses comes from his unwillingness to make this clear.  It is only when you dig deeper and start to take this story as seriously as Steyn does that the shortcomings become glaring.  After all, he goes through the details of the Democratic Party's evolution and its use of

PAPOLLO'S "JOURNEY FROM ROME":  "No one is an island. All are connected." - George Bernard Shaw  I was lucky enough to be taken to Rome, Italy for my first experience on my spiritual pilgrimage. I attended a wonderful two day event at the Metropolitan Cathedral of St. Paul. It seemed a little strange to come to a city that had no churches to speak of, but the opportunity to visit the city and participate in its great cultural events such as the St. Mark's Day parade was the reason I went to Rome. After having attended an amazing weekend of events, I now wish that I had been there a week earlier to take the full immersion into the Catholic culture of the city.  One of my favorite things that Rome was blessed with was a festival to celebrate the birthday of the Lord. We attended the feast of the Holy Spirit and had a beautiful time.  has an important message for people of all faiths: "The true spirit of love and peace that we wish to live for the rest of our lives is not an attitude but rather a relationship. It is not a matter of what a person believes or does; rather, it is a matter whether we share our love in a way that can grow our relationships, our family relationships, and ultimately, our world."  This is my fourth visit to Italy and my second time as a pilgrim. I wanted to give this book a try as it sounded so interesting and I knew that Rome offered so much to be studied. This was my most important book, and I was impressed by its depth of information, depth of thought, and depth of insight.  the book includes a series of exercises for those looking to live in the love of Christ.

The descriptions of the world, the language used is quite vivid. The narration by Rachael Coote was excellent, as well as the ending. The way they tied everything together was a nice twist.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "A masterful study of a phenomenon that most of us are too complacent to even notice." —Peter N. Siegel What an amazing book. I love the way he approaches the topic and the way that the evidence was carefully laid out, but I was also really taken with the stories and how much of it I could see and feel for myself. What a fun book to read. It had everything I could want in an easy to understand text: great writing, good descriptions, nice illustrations. If you are new to the study of psychology, this book will show you how to find out about psychology without any prior background. There is a lot to say about this book and the author, but it's all covered in a short book. It was not as interesting as The Psychopath Test. If you have just a general interest in the study and the book, or if you already have a good knowledge of the subject, this is a great book. Great book about psychology, I enjoyed it immensely. I did not see much that was new in it, but the writing style was very entertaining and made the book interesting to read, not so much the writing. A very well written, accessible book. Good on topics that many people can relate to, and it provides examples.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "Inventing the Future: The Mythology of Modern Technology", by Edward J. C. White, is a well-written and entertaining book that examines the development of technology over the last two hundred years and how technology has impacted our lives. White's book is not only entertaining and interesting but it is extremely informative about the history of modern technology as well as it's effect on us. White does a great job explaining how we can actually live longer by increasing the number of years that we live with our family. He also discusses how the Internet, the World Wide Web, computers, and the computer virus have affected society as a whole.   However, while this is an excellent book, I would have liked it to have had a more complete explanation of the "Great Leap Forward" that occurred in the early 1960's. In that same era, China, India, and other nations of the world began using a completely different method to produce energy. Instead of burning coal and oil, they used hydroelectric power. In less than ten years, India became one of the most developed countries in the world. In the early 1970's, China adopted this system as well and within a decade, both the U.S. and China had become industrialized nations. In a very short period of time, the US. lost its "Leading Industrial Nation" status and became "Secondary Industrial Nation." If the Great Leap Forward had been explained in more detail, this book could have been very useful.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is great. It's so well written that I found myself thinking about it often, not only because of the great story but because the story made me laugh out loud. It was also an interesting book, and made me think about some of the more popular movies that I've seen. The only other books I've read about vampires in general that were interesting to me were The Vampire Diaries and the Buffy series, so this was definitely worth the time. Read about a really cool vampire:  The whole book is so well-written that I ended up reading it in two sittings, reading the first chapter at night while reading through the whole book (it was about 10-12 pages long) and then waking up the next morning to read through the second chapter and so on. I got to learn a lot about the vampire, and I liked the fact that he wasn't really a vampire, just a human with some supernatural abilities. Overall, it was well-read, had great characters, and had a great story. See the book in action:   The film was pretty much what I expected it to be. The characters and the vampires were all pretty similar, but I was also interested in watching the vampires interact with the other characters.   Read in a public library:  This book was available to be read for free in a few different public libraries.  I took notes and read at my own pace, so it was easy to read and not too difficult.

Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite thing about this book is that it tells a story that is true, even though it's not realistic. The story of the life of the great man is fascinating to me because I know he is alive and he is still involved in politics. This book brings you through his life to his demise and then his rise again. He had all the talents of the past but his political and military skill were unmatched. This makes for a good story as the author lays out his vision and tells you about some of the men he knew. This is a good history of the time and shows a picture of a man who had it all, yet is very down to earth.   As a whole, I think this is a great book and a very good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "In a time of war, it is especially important that the armed forces of the United States be able to respond quickly and effectively to any threat."  — General George S. Patton  (1911-1943) "The American soldier, unlike many others, is a real patriot." — General Smedley Butler  I had the pleasure of visiting General Butler in New York City at the height of his public persona, which was not as much a matter of public relations as it was of a man who felt that his country's honor and values were at stake. In my years of experience as a military historian, I had never met a general like General Butler. General Butler had a strong, clear sense of American exceptionalism, and, as a young man, he had seen firsthand the impact of American militarism. In a speech delivered in Washington, DC, in March of 1941, he gave his famous and much-quoted "Iron Curtain" speech. He had seen the Soviet Union, and its army, and realized it posed a far greater threat to the United State's existence than Hitler and his Nazis had ever done. It was that understanding that gave him the resolve and the inspiration to lead the charge against Nazi Germany. His words should not be misconstrued to mean he was fighting the Nazis as a political act; they were the very reason why he became a general and later the U.S. military's Supreme Commander of World War II. When he was a young officer, General Butler was elected to the UIC (United States Military Academy) faculty. As a faculty member, he often spoke at public occasions, but he never wrote a paper in front of an audience. While the majority of the students seemed to be interested in him, his focus was usually on the future of the Army. He would also give speeches in private to individual students at night, but these were generally short and off-the-cuff. What did General Butler mean by "the American soldier is a genuine patriot"? General Butler knew that, in a world of war and destruction, there is only one answer: you must fight the enemy until you are destroyed. He knew the only way to win, and to win decisively, was to defeat the enemy before he could destroy you. It is true that he always used a metaphor of "flinging a knife" in his speeches. This does not mean, however, that he believed that the use of knives

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________ Hi, I have bought this book a lot and I can say it is really interesting.I want to point out that I am a fan of science fiction books so i was looking forward to this book but it just didn't work for me.The main character is named Arcturus and she is a robot which is very intelligent,she has some problems like having a human's heart and i found this interesting because if that's so then why is she named Arcy?she is named after the arcturian star that was once in a stable relationship with a planet of humans but one day a supernova explosion made it into a brown dwarf.Arcturus also has her own feelings and is kind of complicated.I liked how Arcturians are always the ones who survive the first supernova.I don't remember the exact words Arctura said but the main character was trying to explain that,when a star gets old it will explode and destroy the galaxy and we are in the process of doing it.I thought this part was interesting.There is also some good and bad people in this book.I like that some of the bad guys are people with super powers,such as the man who can see all the worlds in the universe.I think his name was Arion.He has an army of robots but they are all fighting for him because he is the king of all robots and he has a big ego and they all believe they are better than him.They were fighting him and he was being very mean and they were getting destroyed by the other robots he made.I also liked that they had some robots who helped them and had a good relationship with them.I was happy to learn that Arcturs was the one who helped make these robots and that they can talk to him and can see what he is thinking. They all thought he was crazy and they didn't want to work for him but they were all loyal to him.I am glad that the robot had a personality,but he seemed to have problems and some problems he didn't have a good personality about.I will say this,the author is very good about giving the readers a time machine to see things that happened before the time machine so that it doesn't feel like it is just happening to him now.I found the science behind it to be interesting. I am glad he gave us an explanation of how space works and how the stars and planets are created so that we can understand
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** The book was an interesting read. I'm not entirely sure if it is meant to be a "historical" work but it was interesting. It certainly was fun to read. It is not a comprehensive work. It doesn't cover every aspect of the life of Jesus. But it gives an idea of what the church was like. And I can see why it is such a popular book. It covers a lot of ground and in an interesting way. I wish the author had given more detail on the life and teachings of Jesus but the author does a nice job of weaving in the non-biblical parts of the Bible and leaving the more historical bits of the book to the end.

In addition, each chapter is written in a slightly different style. It makes this a fun and engaging read. I found myself picking up a couple things here and there to keep me going.   This is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the inner workings of the federal government. It will keep you on your toes and will certainly make you think twice about some of the things you think you know. Review:  The government is an arm of the wealthy and it uses its position to exploit the poor and the unemployed. This book, written by a former employee of the US Treasury Department, shows that the government is not only working against the interests of the people, it is also destroying it.  He begins by outlining the various branches of government and their respective powers. The book starts out explaining that the US government was designed to make money for the wealthy, but when the rich created their own government to give themselves more control over the people they were so against, they had to make an example of the poor. He also details how the money was taken from the people by taking away their rights to vote and using the power of the military to arrest and execute people in cases of extreme protest.

"The English have, in short, been the chief instrument in the overthrow of the ancient government of America, and, with their help, have, for more than half a century, brought their designs to a successful issue. " "No longer did the Spaniards dare to try to enforce a foreign power against the colonies. Now, as before, the people in all the colonies had themselves to decide the questions of policy. The American people had begun the revolution, and had brought the issue to a crisis, and their voices had become the decisive element in the whole struggle for existence." "For thirty years no English power intervened in the affairs of the United States. And for thirty years the peace and prosperity of America depended entirely upon their good faith and good will. If it had been possible to keep England from coming to America, the peace would still have been preserved and the American people in peace, for England would have been compelled to renounce its designs and to quit its colony. But, by a fortuitous combination of circumstances, England did come to America. She made war upon the colony in order to maintain the power and glory of her own navy." - "The English Have Been the Chief Instrument in the Ousting of the Ancient Government of America," (1791) (written by William Bradford, the colony's governor) There's an oddity in that the English are seen as the main oppressor in this story:  "[T]he English are the chief agent in the putting down of the colonies... the English have the power to take the government from them." In the actual history of American politics we see a lot of English domination.  We see it in the founding of the country in Boston, in the creation of the federal government, in our state governments (like Maryland) and local governments ( like Virginia and North Carolina).  The first colonies in this country were formed by the English, and the next ones were also formed by them.   Now, we don't know if these English colonists were actually all from England, but we know a lot about their background.  Some were Puritans.  Others were Puritan rebels, and a few even went to England to fight.  The first colonies were founded with the idea that the

Thanks for making an excellent book that the family will love.  4 out of 4 stars Krista I loved this book, so much so that I purchased all six of the trades and read them all in one go! It was an interesting book, that I enjoyed and enjoyed to read! However, I did have a few problems with it, the biggest being the title itself. As a fan of the XMEN, a big part of this book is to teach the young readers about the X MEN. Not only is it a good thing to do, it's also really smart on the part of the author to include some of those "X-TRA" characters, the XUBI, and even the NEW X-MEN, as well as including the "New Mutants". Also, the inclusion of the old school X-FACTOR team was nice and I'm sure I'll pick up some of these older series when I'm older. For a more recent character, I liked the new Ms. Marvel. Also, I appreciated that there were multiple versions of the same characters in this book (as well as the new ones), so that the readers could enjoy each of the individual characters. I also appreciated that the young reader was being given information that they would need to know if they wanted to be an effective X-Man or hero. I would have liked to see the character that is "the new Wolverine" go more in depth into his past in this installment as well. However, if this book does what it set out to do for this reader, it will be a winner.

The book tells the story of two men who come into a country town and do bad things. While I enjoyed the latter novel quite a bit, this one was just as engaging. I enjoyed all of the characters from the good and evil characters of the story, and all of them had an interesting back story and I never tired of them. I really enjoyed the prose in this book and enjoyed seeing it all in action. The fact that the writing is very good made me appreciate the characters a lot more and make me want to know more. This is another book that is well worth reading and will make you want to read more.    A little bit about my writing style.   I like to write about real life situations.  To me, it's very engaging.  I am very interested in characters who have to deal with the problems of their daily lives, the everyday stuff.  So I try to write like I would be, and that's how I write.  If you like books that are entertaining and have some good story lines, you should definitely give this book a try.  My hope is that this book will inspire other people to read as well as myself, and I think it did.  Goodreads: Darling, Jack, The Good Soldier, The Good Soldiers,  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

Because I hope that you will finally stop trying to learn the lessons from life without taking the time to actually live them.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I would recommend this to anyone who has ever been depressed about the fact that they could never figure out a way to change someone else's mind, to understand what it is to be able to change another's mind.   My best friend and I were in a relationship for almost two years. He got involved with a woman who was abusive. He started to see his friends being abused and felt very bad about it. Eventually I got fed up with this, and told him it's wrong to leave his girlfriend, and that I wouldn't be able handle it. He ended things with her, and we both started seeing different people. He had been in therapy for over 2 years before that and it worked wonders, so I figured that would work for us. But in the end he couldn't handle the feeling that I wasn't going to be around for the long term, so he ended things again.  . I don't have any more details to offer, but it all worked out in the long run for both of us. And I was never in a position to be hurt because of my friends' pain, and neither was he.   a book I found to be interesting:   This book has great things to say. It's full of interesting stories of people who have been abused and of people they have gotten to know through their support systems, and it gives great advice for people struggling with that experience. It also has some really helpful tips for people who are in relationships or who have a bad habit of being dependent on other people. In this way, it's different from other books I've read that are not really self-exploratory and don't really teach you how to be more supportive. However, the writing is a little old-fashioned and doesn't have as much depth or insight as other books.  , is an autobiographical story of my life in which I tried to cope with the experiences of abuse, depression, and anxiety that come with being a "victim" of a sexual assault. It is full of hope, but also a lot of understanding and insight into the ways that we can find ourselves in a very difficult situation, and be willing to take action to make it better.I love this book. It has a great insight about how we can be helpful in the lives of other people, but still be in control of our own lives. I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:............................I think this is the best book I have ever read by a great author.  Thank you for your time.  the book is absolutely amazing. it is well written and very well thought out. It is not about the best of a book, it is about the journey of this author. he writes with honesty and passion, his story is like no other book. I am very glad i decided to buy this book, and will be reading it again and again.  was a great book, i loved it,  the book is about my friend.  a great job.  and  i am glad i am reading it and  to find out what happened to him. ,,,  This review was written as an introduction to the book, to introduce new readers to the author. However, I can already see that this is a book that will be read by many who are also new to his work. The narrative is simple, and the main characters all appear in the same story. However the structure and story are both quite complex. As you progress through the book you will meet some characters that are more prominent, and you will learn much more about the author's life, his background, his struggles, his dreams. These issues, which all begin to grow larger, form the book's heart and as we learn more about these elements in the story, it helps us to understand the author even more. As the narrative progresses and as the novel moves towards its conclusion the themes of racism, sexism, classism, ageism and all the other problems that the world faces becomes ever more prominent.   The writing is so simple, it has all the qualities of a short story that has only one central character and that character is the author himself. At the beginning of the book the author does nothing more than introduce himself and his life and to provide an overview of what he has written. Then, as he progresses through his story, he creates more characters, more situations and more questions. And then, once again, as the book progresses, his writing increases in complexity, and then, finally, his prose becomes so dense that, as it approaches its conclusion, I felt like I was being told a story by someone who could only have written one book.   a very good book, but i cannot recommend it unless you know what you are getting into with this book.  that was exactly the point. that was precisely the point

I feel like I have come a long way since then, and this book really helped me get where I am now."   ~ Anonymous Reviewer Read the Full Review | Buy the Book A couple of weeks ago I received a copy of a new book from Tor Books: The Waking Fire. This is not a review of the book. That's for you to read if you're interested. I am just giving you my thoughts on this book, a book that I feel is a fantastic piece of work.   This is my first book by John Scalzi, and as far as I know, it's the first of his that is based on his own novel. If you're a fan of his other novels (and I know that I am), you'll find this a great book for new fans or for fans of his earlier books. If not, I'd recommend his other work, such as City on the Edge of Forever or Redshirts. This new novel, The Wakes, is set thousands of years in the future (some call it "the dawn of the twenty-first century") and tells the story on the first planet in the Solar System that is inhabited by an alien race who call themselves the Fade. This book is a great read for a sci-fi reader or any fan of fantasy, as it features some of the best writing in the whole SF/F genre. It features an excellent cast of characters and is full of adventure, mystery and adventure.   I was surprised by this book. I really didn't expect much from it. I loved City on a Fire, The Last Colony and City on Fire, and was really interested to learn more about the Fades and their culture. I knew very little about them before The Wounds, and I was really looking forward to reading a book by David Dalglish (or maybe John Scalzis, but I don't know).   What really surprised me, was the amount of depth I found in the Fad. As a sci fi fan, I always thought that there weren't a lot of alien races in Sci Fi. I mean, I do think that a
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Devil's Hand was a really enjoyable novel with a compelling plot and a fascinating setting, I would recommend it. Write a negative review about an average book: The Devil's hand has an interesting setting and the characters are interesting but it has a few weak points. The characters were just the type of person that you would be like if you had a personality disorder, the protagonist is very whiny and self righteous and the author keeps writing in the same manner.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________ I just finished reading this book - it's like a short story version of A Tale of Two Cities. It starts with the basic plot, and the characters slowly develop as they overcome obstacles. This is a well written book. You'll learn lots about the history and culture of the Chinese empire. The only down-side of this book is that it is written in Chinese. That may be a good thing - but I find it hard to read it in English.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I would absolutely recommend this book!  There are things I like and things I don't like about it.  It was really interesting to me because I love reading about the things I love.  As for the rest of it, I will say that the book has it's flaws, it's not perfect but it has some very good points.   It's not too long to read and it covers a lot of the common mistakes and why they happen.  But as said in the beginning, this is meant to be a guide book for people who are getting started in the industry and I am not the best person to write it because I have a lot more experience and can write a more professional book for someone to read.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________________________________ [The Book]: The Book: 1) This is the most unique book I have read in years. 2) I have never felt as if I had been reading about people's personal struggles, which are well documented in books like "The House of the Spirits" and "The Secret" 3) If you are in the middle of a very difficult phase of a depression, this book will help you understand that you are not alone, and that the person who is hurting you may be someone very close to you 4) The writing is excellent, with all the characters having real and vivid personalities 5) It is clear that the author has a lot of empathy and understanding of what depression is like for those who suffer 6) This book was a great introduction for those new to depression 7) If I could add just one thing, it would be that the book is not overly philosophical, and can be interpreted many different ways 8) This was a very easy read 9) It may take a few days for your body to adjust to the depression and the new medication, but once you do this will go on for a while (a few months). 10) This should not be an all-day read 11) This can help anyone who has ever struggled with depression 12) This takes you through several different experiences, and will help make you realize how it is similar and different for everyone. 13) This will not be for everyone, but if you have been suffering for a long time, then read this and then come back to see if you really need it 14) If all else fails, there is always therapy. 15) You will not like everyone you meet, but it is well worth it to go into this book with an open mind. 16) If anyone knows what to say to people who are struggling with depression and want to know what to do, please please please post it here. I have met and spoken with many depressed individuals who were not well. So, please let me know if you found this review helpful. I'm going to try and answer all of these questions below.

We got to take our dogs on all kinds of different outings and it has been wonderful.

We also took the puppy to the vet for a wellness exam and he is a little shy at first but after a few sessions he has come around.

Write a positive review about a good book:    You don't have to be a great reader or a writer to enjoy a good read.   I think the "Good" in the title refers to what I'd describe as the emotional depth of the book.  The book is full of heart and soul and has something for everyone.  It touches on topics such as grief, depression, family, friends and love.  While there are some scenes that were a bit "harsh" it was done with respect for those who are feeling that way.  I was given a few warning that this book is a "soft" read.  However, I was so caught up in the plot and the characters that I didn't want to stop.  At the end of the day, this is a book that is filled with wonderful memories and the joy that the readers feel. I am glad I read this.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I was really disappointed that I read this book. But, what can I say, I have a lot of reading to do. This book is great. It is filled with all of the horror, intrigue, action and excitement you would expect from a great book. The only thing that I would want to see changed, is the main character. I don't understand why they would not just write the same character over and over. I am not saying you should change the main characters, that would be stupid. But if they just did it the first time, maybe the second time I would be a bit more open to it, but it would still be very annoying. Other than that I love the book. I know that there are a lot like me that do not like that the main protagonist is a murderer. I do not mind that I do like that. It makes the characters much more interesting to me. It adds something different to the book that you would not normally get in a book like this. I would recommend this book to any fans of the old school horror novel.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books you go back to and reread.  I think it is one I will reread for sure.  I have just finished reading this book and I could not put it down.   This book tells a story which is the true story of the events that occurred in an Air Force base during the 80s.     The main character of the book was the woman called "Marble", who lived at the base, in the late 60s, and wrote a letter to her husband a year after the events which occurred, asking for advice on how she could escape the base after finding out that the men were being murdered.   The main characters names were James, David, David and Jim, who were all former officers of the base and it was told how these men were murdered, and they were never heard from again.      The book also goes on to tell how one of the men who was murdered was also the only one to survive, and how she made it to the US, and lives a normal life at a normal job.   In conclusion, I can tell you that this book is one that I will be re-reading again in a few months.   This is one for any person that reads the history of the Air Force Base, in which you never know what to expect, and this book will provide a lot of it.   I have also read the book by a different author, and I do not know if the story will be similar or not, but I definitely recommend this book.   My rating for this book: 5 stars.   See full review See my review about my book on Goodreads Here:   http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2...

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good story that has a lot of potential, but for some reason it's so badly written. In fact, there is no writing, just a whole lot of exposition. The plot starts off rather well and I liked how it was slowly revealed that the "evil" man is really a good guy and his "evilness" is just his way of dealing with the guilt he feels for being a man and trying to act like a woman. At first I thought the ending was pretty good, but then I thought of this quote: "So it turns out that you have to be evil to live like a human. That explains a lot about myself." and I can't help but laugh. It makes no sense.        "It was a wonderful experience to have a little friend who looked just like her and who made her happy. She could be her little brother and even her little dog. It was all a dream." -Ginny And that's where the whole thing comes crashing down. We get two different stories with two completely different characters who end up having the exact same ending. I can only imagine how hard it must be for the author to write this story twice, but I think it's pretty awful. And it doesn't help that we also get a story about how we can be different and a book full of quotes like this. There is nothing about this story I liked at all. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful

The book had a great story line for about 2/3 of the book, but there was some really good stuff that was left out.

Write a positive review about a good book: **********I read this book as a student at a Bible college. I loved the style of writing, and I had an amazing time in the reading. This book gave me a lot of ideas on how to live a better life with God. One of the things that stuck with me was the fact that Jesus did not claim that He could do all things. When asked how long it took Jesus to do all the miracles He did, He said it was not so much time as "little time" and "long time." Jesus said, "Because I was with you, both times I did it I was in paradise." And He also said, and this is an important point, that He had to take care of those who were His followers in the beginning. He had some of them, who were not able to work, and He gave them a little time with Him in the garden, and in the cave, and they had a place in the boat. And when the people were out of that boat, He sent a dove to them, and told them what happened, and how many times he came, and where he went. This was a miracle, because it showed that He was with them in the past, and he was helping them in a little way now. I'm glad to have learned something from this book.  Review of Christian Apologetics by Douglas T. Moo, Ph.D. I've used Christian apologetics on many occasions, but it's always had a certain air of mystery about it. If you're like me, however, you've always suspected that the authors of the apologetics weren't really "real" apologists. After reading this book, I'm convinced that these authors weren't even trying to be "real." What a great way to prove this! In this book I've come to see that the "Christian" way of apologetics is just a cover-up for other agendas, and as such can never be taken seriously. This is the book I was looking for; it will teach me more than I could ever learn on my own! This is a great read and I will not be buying any more of the "fake" apologetics that have appeared in the Christian publishing industry in recent years. This one is a good, practical introduction to the subject. I recommend it highly.  (This review was written when Christian Apology was originally published. The book has since been reprinted by another publisher.)

Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I've ever read by a woman about being a lesbian is "A Thousand Kisses a Day" by Mollie L. Martin. Why don't men kiss?  I just realized that I'd read about men kissing a thousand times over the last year-plus but I'd never really thought about it.  But, what I've come to learn is that it's really just one more "human" trait that women have over men.    This is something that's not going to change any time soon (unless you start talking to women, then it will).   That is not to say that all men are bad kissers, but men have some unique kissing behaviors that are unique to them as well.  Here are some of the things men do that women do not:  1.  A man will always kiss a woman first, and then, he'll let a woman go first, even if he would like to kiss her.  If a man is not sure if he wants to go first then he'll put his hand over her mouth before he lets her go.  When a man kisses a woman, he usually starts with his mouth, and slowly he'll work his way down, kissing her on the neck, then down her neck to her arms.  He kisses the arms first and then his mouth moves down to the stomach (he'll never go down a woman's tummy.)  If there is any resistance from a woman she will make some noise and he will either give up or move on.  As for his lips, he kisses them as often as possible but they're never the main focus.  Some women will put their hands over their mouths when kissing a man to keep him from going down their throat because he can sometimes bite back.  The key thing to understand is that a man will kiss a female first and allow her to go before him if he's not sure he wants her to be his first.  However, if he does, he will not hesitate to kiss his next girlfriend, wife, daughter, cousin, or friend if he sees that they're receptive.  Women do this too, but to a lesser extent. 2.  Sometimes a woman will give the first kiss, but sometimes it's just that the man just wants to try it out, so he's kind of forced into it.   This is one of the biggest differences between men and women, and why
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Way We Die: A Journey of Faith and Death in Iraq"  is one of the best books ever written on Iraq and its impact on religion and the US foreign policy. It is an important read on religious, ethnic, tribal and political dynamics in Iraq.  It provides a historical and comprehensive perspective of Iraq's politics and religious identity.  In the book, George W. Bush is depicted as a "wimp" and the president of the United States is viewed as a lame duck.   The author has also pointed out that many Iraqis and Iranians, who are Shiites, see Bush's invasion as a betrayal and have long seen America as a Satan that came to their country.  In the last decade, there has been a huge rise in anti-Americanism in Iraq which is fueled by a number of reasons.  One is that the United states has not shown any support for the people of Iraq, in their wars and in their efforts to develop their country and to establish a democratic order.  Another is that many of the people believe that America is a "foreigner" who should leave Iraq. This view also goes along with the view of the Iraqis who are mainly Sunnis.  A third is that they have been repeatedly beaten, tortured and killed by the Shiites and the Americans.  There are also many who see Iran as being the enemy of their country which is why they hate America.  The book does a great job of showing the religious and ethnic dynamics that have driven people into violence and extremism in Iraq and how those dynamics have played out in the present day.  My only critique of the book is that there were many places and times that I was unsure of the facts and the interpretation of them.  I was very unsure of things that I read in the book and I would have preferred that the author had done some research.

I was also intrigued to find that the book was being published by a small press, but that wasn't necessarily a negative. The illustrations were great and the book had a feel of real historical fiction.
