Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product to connect my DVD player to my computer.  It is an OK product.  But it does not have the ability to handle both DVD and MP3.  I was able to connect to my DVD with my other device, but the sound quality was much worse.  Overall, the sound is ok, but not worth it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am a new user of the product, I purchased it as a replacement for my last Canon MP3 player which broke down.  The sound quality is great, but the product is extremely fragile.  This is the third one I have had broken in my lifetime, and it is definitely not the same one that broke my previous two, which was a Canon product.  If you do not care about this, go buy something else, I'm sorry, but this product is not worth the price it is selling for.  It will be a big problem if Canon doesn't have something similar to this in the future, because this is a major pain in the ass to return

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My Dell Inspiron 1000 had a bad optical drive.  It would sometimes hang up or just stop functioning altogether.  The only way to get it to work again is to return it and buy a new one.  Don't waste your money! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have owned this mouse for almost two months and it is now on its last legs.  I've tried all the brands and none of them work for me.  It is very frustrating to have to constantly update software for the mouse.  The software crashes and the mouse is useless.  If this is a problem with the mouse, I suggest you consider a different mouse 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have a Sony S2V4. It has a very small size, so when you're recording in it you need to have the rest of your equipment at least as big as your camera, otherwise you'll get the black and white stripes on the screen.I thought this would be a great product to use, and it was, until it started recording in the car, and the quality got awful. It only took me 2 minutes to reset it, and now the picture quality is horrible!  I bought the cheapest item, and I won't be using Sony again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just recieved my new CD player which is defective. The unit was delivered in good condition, but after some use, I notice that the sound is distorted. The manufacturer's support line does not help me any more.  If you don't know what you're doing, don't buy this product. It will be a complete waste of your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It is not a real printer.  It uses the same type of ink cartridge.  My ink was running out so fast I had to buy a new cartridge.The scanner works well but the ink cartridges is expensive and it takes a while to print anything.  I will not buy this printer again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am not the type of person who cares for the looks and is very picky with this stuff.  I bought the Canon EOS 5D Mk2 and the case was just as big and it looked awesome.  Then I realized I needed the case because I had no room to put it in.  The case is very uncomfortable to hold and it's not adjustable to keep the camera secure.  Don't buy this unless you are willing to spend some money and have the room to adjust it.  It's a waste of money.  Get a case from Amazon if you want a nicer case.  You won't regret buying this one

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this product to install my new laptop, but I did not use it. The first thing I did was to open it up and remove the battery. The next thing I tried to do was to plug it in to my old laptop which has the same type of battery, so I could see what the battery life was.  The new battery was obviously much more expensive and I had no idea if it would work properly.I was very disappointed with the new battery.  I'm afraid to buy a new battery again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my product and it was as described.  But when I tried to boot the system, the system was stuck at the "Welcome" screen and it would not reboot.  The system worked fine with my other CD burner.  I returned the unit for a refund 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to use my DVD player.  It worked for a while.  But when I started recording, it would stop.  Then it would go back and start recording again.  I tried all sorts of things, and no one seemed to help.  They did not even give me any sort of suggestions.  Finally I called customer service and they suggested that I return the player.It was in a box with the batteries inside.  So I sent it back, and the box came with the battery pack, which I put in and it worked fine.  What a waste of my time.  Don't waste your money on this, unless you're willing to replace the battery 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my wife for her laptop, and the picture quality was so-so.  The buttons on the side don't respond to the arrow keys, so I have to use the mouse.  I had to use a lot of software to get it to work with Windows Vista and the mouse drivers on the CD.  For the price, I would not recommend this for a personal laptop 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this card because it was advertised as having better performance than my old model.

I returned it and received a refund, but I will never buy another from HP again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this product on Amazon.com and it was supposed to come with an 8GB SD card. I found out that the card does not come with one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had a Toshiba laptop with an HP laptop dock. I wanted a way to plug my HP laptop into the HP dock and use it as a wireless router. I decided to buy the HP docking station from Amazon.  After using it for a couple of weeks, I got the impression that it could actually be a better option to just buy the laptop separately.  I now find HP's docking station to be very unreliable and hard to use.  In fact, HP's website says that the HP Dock can't support HP products with an ECC license, so I now need to buy an HP ECC licensed product (with an HP dock). I'm not recommending HP products

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am in the process of upgrading from my HP Deskjet 64 to the HP DeskJet Pro 64, so I decided to try it out first.  I was a little disappointed with the lack of a web interface (as I am a user of both HP WebClip and HP ePrinting Services) and the fact that the product only supported 32MB of ink and the HP scanner software would not let me choose which ink to use.  In addition, I am not sure if the HP scanners have any support for the newer HP ink cartridges (which have a better flow) than the HP ink that comes with the product.  The HP ink cartridge that I purchased did not fit well with the scanner.  So, in addition to upgrading to the Pro 64 that I can use the scanner with, I'll be trying out the 64MB HP ink with the HP Web Clip, which does have a web site interface. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use to connect to my router and to my MP3 player and have had problems with both of these units. The router gets overloaded and then the player or my laptop gets jammed.  My suggestion to anyone is to get a wireless card that can handle the bandwidth needed by your router.  I have a Linksys WRT-4300 that is less than a quarter of the cost of this one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This card does not work in my computer, at all.  I tried it with Windows XP and it did not work.  No matter what I tried, it would not boot up.  Don't waste your money.  You will waste your time if you buy this card.  It is a complete rip off from the other cheap cards that are similar.  If you want to play DVDs and CDs, buy the Realtek PDA cards

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received the product within a few days of ordering, but it was only about a month before the item was shipped.  I used the included manual and it was clear that it was not supposed to be plugged into the wall.  However, it is now so that I can't unplug the unit without leaving a mess behind.  The unit has a very small fan that whines in the case of excessive airflow and I've had to stop using the fan to cool the unit to minimize the dust.  What a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used this product and it did not work.  I am not sure why it did.  It was very difficult to use the product.  Not sure if it was a problem with the product, or it was the case itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product has been discontinued and replaced with the new HP Media Dock, which has an RFID card slot, which allows for transfer of photos to and from the HP desktop printer.  The HP Media Port is still available in select HP stores for $15.00 (includes shipping) which includes a 20-pin card reader which allows you to access all of your photos stored on the HP Media Hub in any computer.  This is a great feature to have, but it is expensive for such a small product.  I am now considering the Canon C500HP, which is a tiny, wireless printer with a built in card reader 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product worked well for an inexpensive product, but did not last as well as expected.  I returned the unit because it is not an automatic device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first few times I had to use this antenna it worked OK, but not much. The more I used it, the worse it was. It didn't work in all areas of the FM radio, the reception was just awful. I had better results with the other antenna at the store. Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have a new Toshiba Z9A that I am using with a Mac.  The original one died on me and I had to buy another one.  I was not very happy with the original battery, so I went to Amazon to see if I could get a better battery, which I did.  Unfortunately, I did not get a replacement.  Since then, the battery has quit working.  It now only lasts for about a month, which is unacceptable when I consider that it's only about a dollar a month.  What is really annoying is that the battery does not last the entire time that it is on the laptop.  On average, the laptop will turn on the battery for about 1-2 hours.  My battery lasts from 6 months to 1 year, which would not last very long.  Amazon did a poor job with their customer service, so if you do not get your battery replaced by Amazon, Amazon will NOT replace it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These batteries did not last at all.  The battery would be dead within 10 to 15 days.  Do NOT buy these batteries unless you want to use them only for a short time.  Don't waste your money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have owned an HP Elite Laser printer for over 10 years.  The ink is ok but not as strong as other brands I've had.  After a few months the ink in my copybook started to disappear.  HP did a great job of shipping me replacement cartridges but this one didn't last.  It broke and is now out of warranty.  Don't buy HP ink if you plan to use it as a replacement for another brand.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product description says that the earphones can work with both earphones and the phone, but I did not get any confirmation of that when I purchased them.  The sound quality is fine, but the product description makes the claim that the phones have a volume control which is very limited, so you will need to use the volume to the max to hear anything.  If you are using the phone for phone calls, the earpieces may be too loud.  I had to use ear buds and listen to the phone on speaker for the phone to work.  Don't waste your money, don't buy these unless you can get the phone part that works with them, and if you want to use them, buy a cheaper brand 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't have any problems with my cd player but I have found that it doesn't work with my Panasonic VXA1 mp3 player. I have to use the optical disc player which has no problem. I just don't know why it doesn' t work with this player. The player is a Sony CD player so it probably has an update on the player.I have a Sony DVD player which works fine. I'm sure it's a Sony design problem 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to use with my Mac, but the case is too small.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to replace the iPod dock.  The dock is very uncomfortable to use and is quite heavy.  However, I'm a novice, and the headphones are just not as comfortable as I'd like.  I'm replacing it with an iPod nano and will report on the differences in a negative book review:  The headphones have an annoying buzzing sound.  You can turn off the "airflow" feature to stop it, but it won't help much if you have earbuds in.   I think they have a lot to do with the iPod, but I'm not so sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this cable to play my iPod and I had to put it in my pocket to make it work.  My first iPod (that I had not even bought) started to randomly stop and play at least once a month, which is not acceptable.  The sound is not bad, it's just the software has problems with it, and it was impossible for me to find a solution to fix it.  I have not bought anything from Amazon in the past couple of years. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this mouse because it looked nice and was cheaper than other brands.  It is not a good mouse.  The buttons do not work very well.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This cable is ok if you have an old, cheap TV, but if you want to be able to watch the digital signal on the bigger, new TV's this is not a great cable. The TV's in the picture have to be turned off and on every 5-7 seconds to get the signal.  Don't waste your money on this cable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD player itself is OK, but when it comes to the wireless connection, it's just not that great.  I have the same one that came with the tv and it works just fine.  The problem is that the player does not support wireless connections with the Sony DVD player receiver.  So if you have one with it, you can't use it with the TV.  It will have to be replaced.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this player at Wal-Mart. The box is well made, but the player is a piece of junk.  It is a lot of plastic and very flimsy.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product and was not pleased with the performance of this product.  The picture quality is great, but the sound quality is terrible.  I have owned an iPod touch and have had the same problems.  It does not produce clear sound, but it is much better than the iPod touch.  However, the iPod mini has much better battery life, and it is easier to use the product.This product is not worth the money.  In my opinion, I wouldn't buy this product if you want to get the iPod nano because it is a lot cheaper

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am returning this product because it does not work with my HP printer. The software does not provide the option to use it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use this product because it was cheaper than the original iMac, and it has an eject button, which is nice.  But it's very noisy.  I was very disappointed in this product.  It is very difficult to eject the CDs when they get into the case, and I have no idea how to fix this.  The case has a small opening in the side where the eject button is located, which allows the CD to get jammed.  For example, if you push the button with a ton of force, the CD may pop out the side.  Overall, the product is not worth the money.  If you are looking for a product with a large capacity, and a compact design, then this is not it.  Don't waste your money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You can do better. I would recommend that if you have a cd player that has a digital device with an antenna, this product is not for you. If you have an older radio that has an antenna built into the radio, you will be more than likely fine.  If you want to use this product on a new radio, it's a lot better. The antenna is very small and hard to use and the sound quality is poor. I bought this to use as a digital player for my radio that was missing an antenna. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You will get frustrated and give up on a good electronic device if you are having trouble with the power supply.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would never buy this because the speakers are too small. The sound is pretty decent, but not good enough to play DVD's, especially if you have to turn up the volume. The speakers don't even come close to the quality of the Denon's speakers. Don't waste your money on this unless you want a pair of speakers that can actually get loud.

The case is so small that if you move your finger a few inches from the case, the mp3 player will not go back.  My only suggestion is to get a bigger case

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is not an exact replacement for the CD player, but it is a better buy for $8.99 instead of the CD-IIS, which is more expensive.  However, you cannot use the optical output for your CD player because it is only connected to the computer via the USB cable.  So if you have a CD player that outputs DVD, this is not the product for you

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a horrible product, it doesn't work with any DVD, it has terrible sound, and the only reason it is available is because of the stupid consumer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had several of these memory cards.  The first time I used them, I had to take the battery out of the slot to reset the system.  In another case, I got a warning from Microsoft about a memory card that was defective.  It turns out the problem is that the slot is not closed all the way.  So now I have to keep opening the slot and checking that the slots are all the same.  I also have to take out the battery to reset all the settings in the system 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would not recommend this item because of the problem of the power on/off switches.  I had an AC adapter that worked with this unit, and I had to turn it off in order to use the keyboard.  Don't waste your money on this.  It would not work with my new Dell S2440L, because it has an "off" switch that works with the "on" switch.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The item that I purchased, the only item it could be, it broke after a month of usage.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this cable for a few months and it does work.  However, it does NOT have a power supply.  I need a power connector with a 5 volt power supply!  I'm hoping this is an option that can be purchased with a power cord 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You really shouldn't buy this if you plan on playing CDs and DVDs. The sound is not that great, and the player itself is not sturdy enough to hold your CD or DVD.The player also has an optical jack that is only a 6-pin plug. This is not really a deal breaker, but it is annoying that the jack can only be used so many times and so cheaply, it is just a shame that they did not include a 6 pin power adapter. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just bought this product hoping it would improve the sound and picture quality of my computer.  I bought the original brand case (no fan) for my laptop.  Since then it has become obvious that this is a case, not an amplifier.  The speakers and earphones have been noisy and the fans have been making an annoying racket.  What I don't like is that it has two power options: On and Off.  On-off is more convenient, but it also requires you to constantly flip the power switch to turn it on.  It is also a hassle to unplug and plug the power cable to turn off the computer.I don't want to pay for a case that doesn't work well 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use this for my iPod, but I don't use the charger for it. The case is cheap, so I have had it for a year now and it still doesn't charge. I'm going to be looking for a better case with more features. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product does not work well with the Panasonic LQ100.  If you have a LQ1000 and need a spare player, this is not the one for you.  The LQ10 is the only one that is compatible with this camera, and that is the LQ3000.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have purchased other CD's from HP. They are fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have tried several other brands and none have worked as well as the Sony brand.  They are more expensive but work just as well.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You get what you pay for, don't buy it. The software for the unit is not user friendly. It is a mess to use.  You will have to go to the manufacturer's website to download the software to use this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had many other Sony products and I have not had a bad one.  This one just isn't very reliable.  If you have an older model with more than about 100MB of video, this one will not be able to handle that.  It will just stall your computer.  You have to buy another one with a better design and a bigger capacity!  If Sony had come up with a product that would have performed better than this one, I'd be very happy.  I am returning this product to Sony and have never purchased another one from them again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use this DVD burner for about 15 years now, and it has never worked well with my DVD player. I thought I had bought the correct one when I got it. I tried using it with my Panasonic DVD player and it burned up the player and burned my new DVD in the same way 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this item in December.  I've had it only a couple of weeks and it's already broken.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have purchased this item, and have received it on time, but my problems started immediately after the first use.  The product would not fit my computer, I had to use a small rubber band to hold it up, and I had trouble using the software to locate the printer in the case.  It's not a big deal, it's just the first time I have used a printer that I don't have a case for, I'm sure I'll get it repaired 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound is terrible, I couldn't hear the sound of the music, the volume is way too low and the remote is extremely uncomfortable to use.  Don't buy this product.  I got it for my wife to listen to music at the beach but it broke the very first time we used it.  She is very disappointed in it.I don't think it is possible to have a radio without the remote because it is a great piece of electronic device, but the sound quality is horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is NOT what it's advertised to be, in fact it is not even close to being a product.  The product I received had the battery dead.  I called Sony and they said they would send me a new battery, I don't know if it was sent or not.  It could be that they have not sent me the correct one.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This card was not made for an HD display, i did not know until after i had purchased the product and installed. i did however get it to work with my iBook and my Macbook, so i guess it is good for something. i am not sure why it only works with Macs and not all PCs, and i am very dissapointed that it only has 1 USB port. i wish i had bought an HD card, at least i can use it for something other than a graphics card. i would recommend iFixit's HD card 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this card with a Canon FDX5200 camera.  It did not work with Canon's software.  I tried it on a Canon EOS 5D Mark III.  The camera worked fine.  Problem was, it was a Canon-brand card and not Canon's generic brand.  That is what caused the software not to work with the camera.I am a Canon user and it is very frustrating to get such a card not to function properly.  You must know that when you buy a Canon card that it will be Canon branded

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because I was on a short timer, I didn't want to have to plug it in every 30 seconds.  It is not.  The cord is so thin that it gets in the way of your hand.  I don't know how it is possible that this thing could hold a lot of power, and I have had it for about a month and it is still not charging my Mac.  This product does not work.  Buy something else.  If it was just a matter of cost, I would have gladly paid a little more to get a better product.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have not found any improvement in sound quality over the cd player that I have been using for 10 years. The radio is a lot louder and you can't hear the disc if it's playing. I will not be buying this again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this product to use as a wireless remote control in my car.  It worked for a little while, but then I lost the connection to it.  I think the battery is probably going to die in about a month.  If you plan to use it to control a DVD player in your car, I suggest you buy something better.  The DVD player needs to have a separate remote for it. I've been looking for such a product for a long time 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Not a very big player, but not worth the $50, unless you really want the big sound quality.  I have two of them and one is on the other end of my house, and the one in the garage gets the job done just fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had to return this product because it doesn't work.  The first time I used it I connected to my Mac through a wired connection only to find out the Mac OSX system couldn't handle the file type.  I returned it because it was faulty.  Don't waste your money on this product.  It doesn't support any sort of encryption, so it's useless for protecting your files.  Buy something better 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this memory stick for my personal use, and I can't find any good reviews about it.  The only positive review I have about this memory card is that the included DVD burner is good.  I use the player every day and still have to use the memory stick to burn the DVDs, so I have no complaints about the memory card.  However, the memory sticks do not work with Windows XP or Windows Vista, so if you have XP installed on your computer, you may want to consider using an external burner for your DVDs.  There is a reason why you have to burn DVD's to this memory, and that reason is to protect the player from burning a bad DVD if your DVD burner fails.  If you're looking for a good memory card to keep your personal use of the player, I suggest an Apple Pro DVD-RW burner.  Apple sells the player for about $30, so it's not as expensive as the others I listed, but the player is worth it if you want to protect it from failing 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for a cheap mp3 player and after reading the reviews, I thought this would be a great buy.  It was a little pricey, however, it was not the right one for me.  I have a Sony mp3 and a Toshiba DVD player.  The Sony mp4 is a little too loud and in general it's a little louder.  My Toshiba player, however is great.   I wish Toshiba would put out more of them and Sony would sell them more at a lower price 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product itself is ok.  The software and drivers are not, however.  I am using a Windows XP Home Server (and thus have no internet access) and have the following issues:1) the product has a tendency to hang up when you are downloading and installing the drivers, as the installer tries to use more than one of them.2) the software cannot find the software on your hard drive (if you have a dual boot system with Windows XP and XP Home) because the Windows XP installation program does not provide a search path to find the drivers.3) the automatic reboot is slow, sometimes very slow, and sometimes completely unresponsive.4) when the program is unresponsive, the automatic restart option will not reset the product (it will keep trying to restart even though the system is unplugged)5) when rebooting the system from a bad install, sometimes the product can lock up for a good 20 seconds, so when the system reboots, it won't go back to where it was unplugging and unpluggng.  In order to avoid this problem, I uninstalled the software and installed the product again and now I have a complete mess of an upgrade from the one I used in the first place

It is supposed to be a 5v DC power supply that provides 5v for the TV's battery, but there was none left to power the TV.  There was a slight hint of overloading, but it is not clear yet what the cause is.  The TV is now a complete failure.  I have given up on the TV for a second time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This card is a joke. It has all of the capacity of a 120MB card, but has a limit of only 1GB.  It is so slow that you can barely use the card for anything other than browsing.  I will never buy another Panasonic product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This card is a total piece of junk.  There are so many of them, and it has so many problems.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this item because I needed it for my ipod and I was expecting it to be just a regular headphone.  It is not! I have it in the car, I use it everyday, it does not fit.  If you need a portable, this is a bad purchase.  I have a few other headphones that fit just fine, the one I have this does not.  In addition, I have to spend extra money to replace the rubber ear tips because of the cheap rubber that this item is made of.  So it is just a very bad electronic item.  Don't waste your money on it, buy something better

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this item hoping that it would be an improvement over my previous one, but it is not.  It is, in fact, the same product.  I bought this for my wife who is on a Macbook and has had to replace her previous product with this one because it would not turn on.  In addition, I now have to spend an extra $50 for a replacement unit, which I am sure is more than I would have saved had I purchased a new product. I hope Apple will address this product in a future revision

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this CD player from Amazon and I've never used it.  The CD player worked OK for a while, but now the CD player will not play any CD's unless you press a specific button on the CD changer to change the speed.  I have the cd player on a shelf in my living room so I'm not in a position to see the button or to hear it.In addition, the CD Player has not worked with any of the CDs that I've purchased from Amazon.  This is a problem because Amazon's website states that they offer a CD player with over 1,000 CD's on the list for sale.  In reality, Amazon's CD player does not have over 1.000 CDs on the market with the same CD's listed on their website.The CD player also doesn't have any features such as automatic player rotation or stop and start.  If you do not want to use the CDplayer's built in features then you can purchase a CD changers from an online retailer such as Amazon, but be warned, Amazon sells the same model for $20 or less.  Amazon's web site is so out of date that it doesn't even mention Amazon's newer CD changing units

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You will need to invest in a higher quality product such as the HP DL-110, if you want a DVD player that can play all your DVDs. This player is not as responsive as the DL-10 or even the DL60. It also lacks DVD playback control, meaning that if you use the remote to turn the player on and off you can't change the disc you are watching. I bought the DL110 because I want to use it to record some of my favorite DVDs, but in reality I just want to be able to watch the DVD's on my computer, so I will never get the remote control functions on this player. I am very disappointed in HP's product and I would not recommend it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these in January 2007. I have had them now for about 2 weeks. The battery lasts less than a year and a half. I do not know how many hours you can get before the battery needs replacing. The only positive review I can give is that the power switch is a good one. I can turn the unit on and off from the unit's front panel. The switch also allows you to plug and unplug the power supply. The unit will not turn on while the power is connected, but it will switch to off in about a minute or so when it is off. I did not have this problem with the other ones I've had. I would not buy these again. I had one that lasted 10 years, and it was a great electronic device.

The HP Laserjet 4000 is a piece of junk.  Don't buy it.  If you want a laser printer, buy a Canon laser printer

The sound is not as crisp and clear as the Sony unit. The CD player can't play any MP3, but it is fine for other types. The battery life is about an hour and a half, and it will die if it is not charged within an hour of being unused.The remote is not useful at all. The buttons are not very sensitive, and I am having difficulty adjusting the volume on my CD, so I can't really use the remote for anything else.The picture is very blurry and the picture is the worst out of all the Sony units I have used. I would NOT recommend this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the "newer" version of this one (serial number 66543) only a few weeks ago.  I just returned it and am replacing it with a more robust model.  If you want to save your money and get a nice product, I suggest going with the older model (serial 66540).  The picture quality is better with the 66541.  The sound is a little distorted at times, especially when listening to music, but that could be due to the lack of bass.  My recommendation is to go with the newer model (66543).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD player works well with my CD player, but I am not sure why it does not play my CD's.  I do have my MP3 player that I use to listen to my CD, so maybe the CD player will be able to play MP3's that I don't want to have my CD Player to play.  It would be nice if the MP3 players that I have wouldn't need the player to be connected to the internet, which could cause it to overheat and fail.  If you do have your MP3 system connected to your Internet then this is a nice CD player.  But if you do not, then I would suggest that you keep your MP4 player on a cord that is not connected to any Internet access, and your MP2 player is a good player.If I had bought this CD player for a friend, I would have gotten it at a discount from Amazon because it was only $11.99.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very low quality printer. It does not have any sort of spooler, the cartridges are not included, it does not support any sortof spooling. The cartridges are made from a plastic that is very cheap, and the cartridges themselves are not durable.  I am very disappointed in this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered this product as a replacement for the HP laptop that I just returned because of the faulty DVD player.  I am a very disappointed customer as I expected it to work like the HP.  However, it is a bit difficult to boot into Windows if you don't have a DVD burner.  You can use the BIOS to change the DVD burner but the first boot can take a long time, even if you only have one DVD burner in your machine.  The DVD player is very slow, but not unusable.  Overall, I would not buy this product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't buy these at stores like Amazon. I've had to go to my local electronics store where they sell new iPod ear buds for a good price. Amazon is always out of stock 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't like the idea of having a remote that can be controlled from the laptop.  It is a pain to have to go through multiple menus and functions to find the programmable functions.  I wish I could find a cheaper remote that would have all of the functions that I need without having to go into so much detail.  For $30, I would expect the remote to be more than just a remote. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have used these cables in the past and have found that they can not be used to make a DVD player.  They are very heavy and need to be placed over the top of the player to be effective 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had to replace this after my iPod was lost in the mail. I did not get any satisfaction from the product nor did I get it back from Amazon within a reasonable time frame. I would not recommend this item for anyone. I purchased this item at Walmart with the intent to have it delivered in two weeks. The item arrived on December 30th. The instructions provided were for an iPod with no CD player and no batteries. I expected a CD player would be included with the item. I returned the item to Walmart, who refunded me. I will never purchase any products from Amazon again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used to use this antenna for a few years. It worked for the first couple of months. But the signal strength got worse. It got so weak that it was no longer usable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It's a shame to say that this is an iPod Nano.  The battery life was OK (about 6 months), but it has stopped charging, so I would buy an original iPod with the same batteries.  It would have been much cheaper and better for the money.  In the end, I just bought an iPhone 6S because it was a better option 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  i used to have a Canon CXR-K3 with a Canon LP-HS10 and a Canon MPX-1D4.  both of them worked well for me until the last week.  the MPX is not a Canon product.  so it is now useless for my photography needs

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these as a spare electronic device to replace my old battery, so I expected to get a better performance from them.  After only a week, they start losing power and the software has to be manually restarted to fix it.  I would not recommend these batteries as an option for a new electronic device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had many of these batteries in various brands and all have failed. This is the third battery I have bought and I am not sure if they all did fail because of the battery itself.  It does have a short life so I think it's worth trying to return them for a new one.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have used this product for over two months now, and it still has not come with a way to deactivate the wireless signal.  I called customer service and they said it would be resolved in a day or two.  So I thought I had done something wrong and asked them for a refund.  They told me I had to return the product and they would take care of it.  The item was returned and they told me they could not help me because they did not know what to do with it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to replace the "inexpensive" HP Media Center I had.  The picture quality was OK, but the remote was not very responsive.  I'm very disappointed.  For $20 more I'd expect better, at least from HP. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product did not work with my printer.  I had to use the instructions on the back of the card and print at least twice in a row.  If you have problems with the printer then this card is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product was advertised as a 4.0MP camera but it only recorded up to 3.3MP.  I returned it and it was returned to Amazon with a refund.  This is a great camera but I'd rather get a good electronic device instead of this.  Amazon's support is great but Amazon should not have sold a camera with a 2MP sensor that can only record up to 2.3M.  The camera is not good enough to use on the beach, especially if you are a swimmer or beach photographer, and it is a big waste of my time 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been using this product for many years.  I had it for several months with my daughter.  Unfortunately, it broke in the first month and never worked again.  It was a great electronic device, until this one broke.  So, I had to purchase a new one.  Don't buy from Amazon because you will get a defective one.I was very disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product hoping to get my hands on some of the new Sony's.  Unfortunately, the product works very poorly and is not as reliable as the earlier models.  I've had a total of two of these in the last two months.  Hopefully this will change in the near future.  The picture is not clear and the sound is horrible.  Not worth the money for the $50.00 I paid for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this cable for the ability to charge my Sony mp3 player with a little more convenience than the cord that comes with the car radio.  The car radio cord is very bulky and uncomfortable, and the receiver is very easy to lose.  I am not sure if this was a design flaw in the radio itself or the cable, but when I tried to plug in the car plug, it would not hold the plug securely.  This is a major flaw in my new electronic device.  So much for the convenience.  For what it is, the cable is great, but it is a waste of money when it does not hold firmly.  It does not appear that Sony is making this problem easy to solve

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product itself is OK, but it does have one problem, that is that the power cable for this unit is made for the iNano 400, but the power cord is made to work for the Nano 300, and vice versa 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered this product thinking that it was an upgrade from the old product. I thought the sound quality would be better, but it is not. The volume was too high and the sound was not very clear. It was not the speakers that made this sound, it was the volume.  I returned it for a refund. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The picture is very dim.  I used the standard cable (not included) and it only showed 50-60% of the color.  You can tell when the picture is too dim, because it will go down in a dark room.  It is certainly not the best picture I have seen on any electronic device.  Buy something else, or don't buy this one.  If you want a decent picture, buy a Sony TV that has a decent TV picture, or at least a more powerful TV (you can't see the screen if it is too bright).  Buy a better electronic device and buy something with a higher resolution.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this memory to store my personal photos and video for personal use.  When it is installed, it does not recognize my memory card.  I tried it with two cards, and it failed to recognize both.  It is impossible to transfer my photos to it.  The first card was a Kingston 64MB SDHC, and the second was a SanDisk 64MB CF.  They both work fine with it, but the Kingston is much slower to copy photos, and I am sure it would not hold my original photos.  After several attempts, I eventually gave up.  Don't waste your money on this product, unless you really need it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these because they were a good price.  I expected better than the product they provided.  In addition to being very expensive (especially for a laptop that has an internal battery) they are NOT CE certified.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The card is not compatible with the card reader. The reader requires the newer model card reader to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this thinking that it would be a better option than my old antenna. I received a couple of weeks later and the antenna is junk.  I was a little skeptical of the price when I got it but after a few weeks, it is just way too expensive for its performance.  If you want to get an antenna for your TV, I suggest looking at the $10 or less Antennacom HDD4 antenna. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It has a lot of buttons but no function. I did have an older HP printer that worked well.

I had to restart it three times to get the function to work

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It is great for the price.  But it is not worth the money if you need to charge the battery with the charger.

You will waste a lot of money on a battery that won't work 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this card for about 3 months now and it still has not worked with my HP Pavilion laptop.  If you have a non-HP laptop, do not waste your money on this card.  It is a waste of money for HP.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a piece of junk.  I have no idea what this is doing and can't find the manual for it anywhere.  The CD player itself is OK, but it can't hold any discs unless I remove the case.  Then it can hold any disks up to 3.5 inches in diameter.  No matter what I try, I can't get it to hold my CD.  It just keeps on falling out of the case and falling apart

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product because it had the same features as the Sony SACD/USB 2.1 Receiver that I had been using on my Sony D-5000CD player.  I was a little disappointed to see that the "HDMI 2.0" plug-in card that is supplied with the player is not compatible with the Sony DSP-FACTORY-CX800 that I have been using.  The card was designed for the Sony product, so I expected it to work with the DSP that I currently have.  It didn't work with my DSP, so now I have to buy the "DSP-DUEZ" that is also supplied with my Sony receiver 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a really slow drive.  Don't buy this unless you are willing to deal with the long loading times.

If you are not sure about a new purchase do some research before buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this item because I had recently purchased a Canon camera with an optical zoom.  The zoom is not that great, and the buttons are too sensitive.  It is also a pain to remove the lens and put it back in the camera.  I ended up replacing it with the Canon L series lens, which I've had for years.  There are plenty of other brands out there that do a better job at this job

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm sorry, I can't stand the fact that the earphones don't come with a microphone.  It's a pain to listen to your own voice in the car or while you're on the airplane.  If you want to have a microphone, I suggest purchasing a wireless mic from Amazon or Best Buy.  Otherwise, I wouldn't buy these.  I would say, if you want a microphone to use with the earphone, get a set of wireless headphones.  You can't go wrong with these, but be careful of the headphones they come with, they're very loud.  Don't buy them if you intend to listen on the radio.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is a bit overpriced.  I don't have an HP printer, so I cannot tell if it will work with a regular HP printer.  The printer was shipped to the US and arrived on time, but after I installed the driver, the printer would only print to a black-and-white file on my HP LaserJet printer.It is a pain to remove the cartridge, and if you accidentally delete something it is not the printer anymore, but the entire printer.The printing software is not intuitive.  My advice is to get something that will print to the screen, and then to remove it.  If you print a lot, get a laser printer, if you do not, then don't buy this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't buy these. I got a defective CD player and my brother just now got his too. We will not be ordering any more of these. It is a waste of your money. I bought these to play my iPod, but I will not buy this product anymore

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The player is very small and does not hold the sound well.  The buttons do not have any place to rest.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The case itself is great. The only thing that really bothers me is the remote.  It is so unreliable.  I use it to control the volume of the player in my car, and it will turn on the volume when the radio is off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because of the fact that the headphones are so nice.  But they don't do much when you have to listen to a lot of mp3s on them.  The only thing is that you can't remove them from the ear cup or just put them in your ears because they donít come with an attachment.  It also has an odd shape that makes it very hard to use them properly if you want to put them on while sitting down.  I had to buy a pair of ear buds with a clip to hold them in place.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The cd player came in with a couple of scratches on the case.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The radio is fine, but the antenna is not.  There is no signal to reception with the antenna.  So, if you're looking to use this radio on a public beach or something like that, be sure to look for an antenna.The antenna is actually very weak in the lower bands, so if you want to get a stronger signal in those bands, you will have to use the higher bands. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My new DVD player had broken so I purchased this item for the new warranty.  It was just a quick fix and now it doesn't work with the DVDs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am very disappointed with this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used to own and use an HP MediaSmart printer but have recently found out that the HP printer will not accept ink cartridges that are not pre-filled. The HP cartridge I was using was a pre-loaded cartridge.  The HP cartridges I purchased last year at a local Walmart were pre-packed.  So it is now a waste of my money to buy HP cartridges that I do not have.  I have also tried and failed to contact HP and received no response.  If you are looking for a preloaded HP cartridge printer, I would not consider the HP LaserJet 1000 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Not worth the money and the software to use it is not as user friendly as it could be.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product in November 2008, and was very disappointed with the performance of the card.  I tried to remove the card and replace it with a different card, but the card would not fit properly in the slot.  It would only fit in one slot, leaving the other slot empty.  The card was also very noisy, so I had to purchase a better product to keep it from blowing out the speakers when I used it.  Overall, I was disappointed with this product, and I did not purchase any more of them 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used to have a Canon MPU that worked with my Lexar printer.  Now I am looking for another Canon printer to use with my HP.  HP seems to be out of the Canon MPT series.  I have tried all of the HP MPT models with no success.  This is one of the few HP printers that will not work with Canon MPTs.  The other HP MPTs are Canon MPPT's.  If you want to print to HP MPTS, HP MPPTs are the best option.  However, if you want a Canon printer with a Canon HP printer driver, there are several Canon MPTS printers to choose from, including this Canon MPTI.  Don't waste your money on HP MPPs if you do not need them

I did not know this because the manufacturer did not send me a replacement.  If Sony will not do it for me, I am sure I will be able to find a good electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't waste your money on this because you can get the same one at a fraction of the cost at a better electronic device, if you can afford it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is OK.  It is small and has an antenna.  But the reception is pretty much terrible.  I use the WMM-DV2-DVR-2 for my office printer and it is a great device.  However this one does not offer any type of reception.  My wife has a Toshiba scanner and she uses the same one and it works very well.  So why do I have to buy another one when I already have a scanner with better reception 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The headphones don't have the right fit. You can get away with the normal headphones but the larger earpieces fit better 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would give it a 1 star if it isnt for the fact that I have to replace my entire hard drive in 2 months 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had my CD player for a year now and it has always been working.  The first year it would skip songs on CD's that had been played for more than 10 minutes, then it would stop working entirely.  I had to buy a new one after that and the one I received had broken.  It still plays, but it doesn't skip songs anymore.  If you want to keep your mp3 player working you have to keep the battery in the unit.  Don't be put off by the "eco-friendly" label.  This is not an eco-friendly device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product and the sound quality was terrible.  I have a Sony receiver that produces excellent sound but this product just wasn't worth the money.  If you are looking for an inexpensive way to add sound to your CD player don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just purchased this radio and I am not satisfied.  I wish the sound quality was better.  The volume is quite low, and the sound is not crisp.  This radio would not work with my iPod (which was an FM radio).  I did not receive any radio reception at all, and no reception was received when I went to my local radio station.  Overall, I would not recommend this radio 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have tried several brands of earphones and have not found anything that works well.  The sound is ok, but the fit is horrible.  I had to remove the foam padding from my ear canal to get the earphone to stay in my ear. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm using this to record my home movies.  The sound quality is OK, but the TV has a really high input lag and the TV itself is not very stable.  This product will only record the sound from the TV and not the whole room.  In other words, the TV sound is interrupted constantly, and sometimes the entire room sounds distorted.  I've already returned this product to Amazon and will try to return the replacement as well.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the box as promised and it is too small.  The picture is fine for a TV, but it is very unacceptably low-quality for a laptop.  I am now looking for an upgrade

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  this product did not work with my DVD burner, which is a little odd since the DVD player is advertised as having "up to 16x faster".  I tried several different brands, none of them worked, but this one did.  I will never buy this product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Not a good choice for a high-end, fully featured player. I am currently using a Samsung Q10 player (not an iPod) and have had no problems with the iPod.  The Sony player worked fine for me, but the Sony player does not have an auxiliary input.  I would not recommend this player to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This card doesn't have any good reviews so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I'm an IT guy so I'm used to all sorts of new gadgets.  This was the first card I had to try and I got some horrible results.  The sound quality was fine but the card was slow to respond to my mouse clicks.  It also had a tendency to randomly freeze and sometimes to freeze the entire computer.  In the end I returned it.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this cable for the iPod because the other ones that I had were broken.  I just bought another one to try it out.  It's ok.  The sound is OK, but the picture is horrible.  You'll be amazed at how much difference this makes if you only use the remote for an hour or two and not use it for hours

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a really poor product. It is made of plastic. There is no way it will hold a SD card with the case open. The case does not have any strap to hold it down when it is not opened.  The case is very cheaply made and I would not buy it again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The card worked for about 6 months and then stopped.  It is now out of service.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because I needed a printer for work and didn't want to shell out a whole lot of cash.  The only problem is that this printer has a very small print resolution.  Not that great for a digital device.  If you want to print small photos (which I do), buy a bigger one.  I also have a HP inkjet printer that is much more reliable and has a much higher resolution.I will never buy another HP product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am sure that if you are doing anything in the world of high-definition (HD) videos then you will appreciate the 5Mbps/1.1Mbps speed that this is. However, when watching videos that are in SD (i.e. standard definition) resolution you will notice that the speed is noticeably slow and the video quality is reduced to the point where it is not very appealing to watch at all 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is very cheaply made, and the battery is not strong enough.  I had a bad battery that died after 2 months 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this at a Best Buy store and had a few problems.  The first one happened when I installed it and forgot to turn it on (it was in sleep mode).  The second one started a fire, burning the back of the receiver (I have a Sony Bravia HD receiver) that was connected to the stereo.  I sent the receiver back and it was replaced with a refurbished Sony unit.  This is a very low quality product that is very difficult to use.  It does not have a built in antenna that could help with reception and the remote does not work.  In my experience, Sony does not manufacture its products well.  If you want to get a refurbish unit, buy from an authorized Sony dealer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound quality is pretty poor, the battery life is pretty short and the design is pretty ugly 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this thinking it was a good electronic device, it is not.  The screen is too small and there is no way to adjust the brightness, which is a real bummer.  If I am to purchase another product, I would be very cautious, as this was my first time using this.  Don't buy if you don't plan on making any changes to the product.  It will break.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product thinking it would last for about 10 years.  However, it broke after a year 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a dvd player, not a DVD recorder. I can't find any instruction manual that says it is for the recorder. It only has a "recording" function. I have tried both the "rec" and "play" buttons on the player, but the "playback" button is useless. It doesn't record, and the only "records" function is when you press "rec".The "play back" button on the remote is only "play", and the "record" button isn't even lit up 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These are not the batteries for the iPod, because they only hold 1.5 volts.  You will be wasting a lot of money, because if you use the batteries from other brands, they have the same specs.  I purchased some brand new batteries, which I will review later, but you'll have to get new batteries if you want to use the battery pack for the iPhone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this memory for my new Sony mp3 player, and it's a disappointment.  I wish I had gotten a different memory card.  There is very little room for the player to expand, and even though the card was labeled as a 120GB, it only holds about 60GB of usable space.  It is almost impossible to find a 128GB memory card, so I can't complain about that 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because it was supposed to last a long time. It lasted me only a month. I thought it would last much longer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  i used to have a Sony CD player. when i received the replacement unit, it could not play mp3's and other mp3 files. this is very disappointing because i had an original unit and i have it installed now. i am looking at other options because i can't return it.  i will have to consider other options when buying new items 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product thinking it would perform like its larger brother.  In my case it didn't.  It worked fine for about 6 months then stopped working.  I called Amazon and they sent me a new one, but it's a little thicker and less powerful, so it's not exactly as good as the one I had.  Amazon said the battery life is about the same and they have a better electronic device, but I'm not so sure.  The only positive review I can give this product is that it's cheap and can be found for cheap 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only negative review I have to say about this product is that I was unable to find the exact model of DVD player I needed (I am an A&K DVD player) in their online store, so I ordered a brand new one at the price they had on the site.  I also ordered a player with a "HDCP" logo on it which was required to get the correct player.  My original purchase was for a brand name DVD player, but the "HD" is supposed to be a standard symbol for HDCP 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm using this item as a back up to my iNuke.  I've had mine for less than a month and it still hasn't started up after all of the time the unit spent in the freezer.  It's a little hard to get a good picture with this item.  If it fails, it will be a big deal.  So far I haven't had any problems with the radio or the unit. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Not an ipod but I wanted to record some movies.  I purchased this with the expectation that it would be good.  It turns out that it is not.  The sound is very weak, and the volume is just loud enough to annoy you.  Don't waste your money.  Just get a CD player with a better sound 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound quality is okay, but the volume control is extremely finicky and the volume rises and falls rapidly when the sound levels change.  It also can't be used as a headphone jack (because the input is so small).  It's a very small piece of junk 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These are made by etek.net. I bought them and they have some defects. The first one that I have now has a broken antenna. I would not buy from etek again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't understand how this thing works.  I get an error message stating that I need to re-install the firmware.

Why is it so hard to do?  Please add a switch or other way to prevent this from happening again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had problems with this product before.  I was never able to get it to work, even with the same cable as before. I would not recommend this product to anyone, because of the problems I have experienced. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had no problem with the product other than the fact that the cable I received is not the correct color to my computer.  It is pink and it looks very similar to the stock cable, so I have returned it and am now looking for another brand 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because I needed to record my ipod and had it delivered to me with the software already installed. I got the CD player (as is is stated in the instructions), and it would not work with the DVD.  The CD player would play the CD, but the software would not recognize it.  This could be because it was a new player, or because it has an older software that is not compatible with this DVD player. I am very disappointed with this product and will never purchase another one of this product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm not an audiophile.  But when I saw this product advertised as "off the shelf", I was very disappointed.  I was even more disappointed when I tried to hook it up and it didn't work.  What a waste of money! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would never buy from Amazon, not even a replacement of an older CD player. The sound quality was awful.  I expected better than that 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is a bit overpriced for what you get.  The screen has to be manually set to 100% which is not something I can do easily.  It also has a lot of problems with the drivers and does not work at all with any of the common drivers for my Windows 7 computer.  I would not recommend this product to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am new to HP printers and decided to get the HP ink cartridge because the ink did not work on my HP ink jet.  The cartridge I received was not HP branded and was a generic cartridge made by ink manufacturer.  I returned it.  HP has offered to refund me for the cartridges I purchased and sent to me in error.  My only recommendation to HP is that they make the cartridges more attractive and not try to pass off the cartridges as HP branded ink. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because it's small, and the batteries are the size of those found in the original Nikon flash (which I've had for 10+ years). But after a week, I realized that there are no batteries in the lens, so I had to remove the battery to get them out. I don't know how this would work if they were already there, but I guess it would be harder to remove than if they weren't there 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This card is great for small applications but I found out that the card itself has a slight overheat issue and the case it comes in is very thin, making the card a bit fragile.  This is a big problem because the case is so thin, it can't be properly secured and it won't hold the card for any length of time.  If you plan on using it for anything other than watching DVDs, then don't buy this case 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this card because the other one was broken and could not play my DVD. The card worked for a few hours, but then quit working.  I tried again later with another brand and it worked.  But now, I'm looking for something that will last for more than just one DVD.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This DVD player is made by Sony and has a few minor problems.  The first is that it is a little tricky to hook up to an IPOD because it is so small and you need to have the player on its side for it to work.  Also, there is no remote control on the player.  There are only four buttons on the remote, which is not easy to use.  But maybe I am getting too picky.  I was not able to find any information on how to program the player so I will keep this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't waste your money on this because it isnt very well designed.  I would return it and buy a better electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This card was junk. It does not work in the PC, it has not been supported in any previous OS, and the software that is supposed to make the card work is not even supported by Windows XP.  Don't waste your money, get something else.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had this product for a couple of months now.  I have only had it for three days and the battery is barely charged.  The only positive review I have is the fact that it is wireless.  It is a problem that is more of a problem for me because it is a little difficult to use.  You have to hold the radio to your ear, but it is otherwise easy to use the iPod when you need it.  My wife is not fond of the iPod and I use it a lot less now that it's in this condition.  But it is still not a great product.  Buyer beware, this product does not have the same features as Apple products.  Apple uses the iPod Connector on the left to charge the battery.  This product has an iPod adapter on the right, so it is easier to use that way.  For the price I paid for this product I expected it to be a step above Apple products 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have a Canon EOS 5D, and have a Nikon F3.1 for use with the camera.  The new battery pack I got for the F3 is not reliable.  I can not use the camera at all without it, as I am unable to use the battery while shooting!  The old battery in my camera is already dead!  It is not possible to use this battery with the F5, since it is not compatible with Canon's new "Sealed" batteries, which use a much weaker electrolyte solution.  So I have to return the F2.1 and buy the new battery with my F3, which will be a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to replace the CD player.  After playing for about 5 hours, I decided it would cost more to replace it.  It is not even an improvement over the previous model.  I'm a software engineer, so I'm looking at the product for its functionality rather than the price.  The CD player I bought in September cost $150, so that would be about $20 more.  Don't buy this if you plan to use it as a player. I have been using the old model and am quite disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only good thing is that the batteries are very cheap (like a dime a dozen) but I don't like them because they aren't long enough.  I would not recommend them unless you are looking for long batteries.  The problem is that they break very easily, especially if you are not careful when replacing the batteries. I will not purchase this product again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had a couple of these units. One is about 5 months old.  The only thing that I really like about these is the ability to run a DVD player at the same time.  But they have an annoying problem that I can't figure out.  It keeps stopping and turning the unit off.  I'm not sure if this is caused by a bad software update or hardware problem.  If you do not have a DVD or MP3 player, get another product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was hoping for a better product than this.  Not sure why it did not come with the case that I purchased.  I bought this because I had a case that worked with my other Sony products.  But this is not the case!  It's not made very well, not very comfortable, doesn't protect well, etc. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am very disappointed with this product. I had a very poor experience with my iPod.  It was slow, unstable and wouldn't play the music.  I thought it would work fine, since I had read the reviews about other people's iPods and that they worked great with the Sleeve.  But this one is not even close to the others in its class.  In fact, if I had not given up my iPod to get a better iPod, I would have returned it right away

I was looking for a USB3.0/Ethernet combo mouse for it, and while the HP Pavilion is a great laptop, the mouse is still not quite up to the USB2.0 standards.  In addition to the problem with the mouse being slow, the trackpad is also slow.  My recommendation is to stay away from this mouse unless you are looking for the fastest possible mouse for your laptop.  Also, the USB ports on this mouse are only 6-pin.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because it was advertised as having the ability to use the CD changer as an MP3 player. I received a copy of a very bad book from Amazon stating that the MP3 functionality was not included. I have since returned the book. Amazon should provide a refund or replacement for this item. It does not work on all the iPods and iPhones that it was sold to me. Amazon's support is no better than their website. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product because it was listed as a "DAC" to my radio, which is a Sony MDR-1000U.  It is not a DAC, which means it doesn't have the same capabilities of the one I have.  I received it with a very old radio, with no power supply (no batteries).  The radio is inoperable, and I cannot turn it on or off, so I'm unable to review the sound quality.  The product was returned to Sony, and since the warranty is for the radio, I have no recourse.  My advice to Sony is that they do not have the ability to support their products if they do so poorly.

If you're looking for an iPod shuffle that has space for your entire collection, buy a higher-priced model from an authorized retailer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The headphones are fine for the price but are not worth $50 or more. I am returning them. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only reason I bought this cable is that the product description says that it will allow you to hook up all of your mp3 players and phones without using a splitter, and that it's made for the iPod/iPhone.  It won't work with my iPod because it has an adapter that is not made for my iPod (they make adapters for it all the time, but sometimes you don't have it).  In any case, I returned it.  I have a better cable that I'm still considering buying, but I'm not about to spend the extra $30 to buy a piece of junk that I'll have to return 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product for my wife, because she wanted to play MP3's on her PC.  After a few weeks, she found out that the CD player in the unit does not have any FM radio tuner.  It also does not work when playing CD's with any kind of music.  So I decided to return it.  Unfortunately, the warranty on this product is only 5 months.  If I were to get it again, I would not buy it. I do not know what kind of problems it has, but the product is defective 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This DVD player was useless.  First off, it did not work with a DVD player that did not have the optical drive, so I had to get a second player.  It also wouldn't play the movies I wanted to watch, even when I plugged in the player via USB and did not use the player for a few days, the DVD player would just keep stopping and starting.  This made me wonder why I bought it.  If you need the optical player, you should get something else, such as a Blu-Ray player. But I don't think this product will last very long.  I have bought two of these players, one for my wife and one for me.  The wife's had about 4 movies in their first 5 months.  My DVD player is now 20 months old.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this card at Best Buy because it is a great price.  I didn't expect much when using it, but it wasn't working.  It is a very weak card.  You can hear it when it's spinning, but the card is inoperative.  The card is only half the price, so I'm disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing was a nightmare to use.  I kept getting an error message saying it is not in use. I had to use the instructions in the manual to make it work.  If it does not work properly, return it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just got this as a gift. I have not even used it. The only good thing about it is that the volume of the system is adjustable, but the sound quality is terrible. The sound is really bad.  I was going to buy something else but now I am not.  The volume is very low and the sound is very distorted.  This is a real pain in the ass to operate. I suggest trying a different brand. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this thinking it was a better buy than the other brand name products. The sound quality is not very good. It is definitely not as loud as my Sony DV-C7. It has a noticeable loss in quality compared to the DV, but is still better than the Sennheiser PX100. The microphone is just a little bit too sensitive, so if you have an extremely loud environment, like a concert or a big electronic device like a car, it will pick up your voice. The remote itself is very small and doesn't have any features like volume, input, etc. If you are looking for a good radio, this is probably the best choice. However, if you're looking for an inexpensive radio, the PX101 is a better choice 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product worked for one day, then it stopped recording.  I sent it back and it was not the product fault.  It is a great idea to have a backup but it is not worth it to buy this because it will not record when you plug it in, and you will have to do it again.  Don't waste your money on this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm having trouble with my sound card, and the card is no longer supported. I have a Toshiba Qosmio M5V2 with the Sound Blaster Cinema sound card. I am sending it back to Toshiba for a replacement card.  I will not purchase this card again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  this item was not worth it.  the product name is "DIGITAL OPTICAL DVD RW CARDS" but when i went to get the product, i found out that it was "Digital Optical Discs".  i guess thats what they called it. i got them, but it is not worth the money i spent because the product is not working.  i would not buy this product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just received my new D-Link DIR-200 and I'm not impressed. I've used it for several months now and it has a very poor reception. In order to receive satellite or any other channel on it, I had to plug my car stereo directly into the antenna which in itself is a bad idea, but when I plugged my stereo into the DIR, the signal seemed to get worse, almost like it was getting blocked by the D-link. So, I sent it back for a refund. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These things work fine when you are playing games that have the usual high bandwidth requirements, but when I wanted to stream my own mp3's I ran into problems.  The playback would stutter every once in a while, the stream wouldn't move along at all.  I couldn't figure out why.  These will probably break soon.  They are not worth the money, unless you have lots of mp3 files to stream, in which case I would be better off with a SONY DVD player. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very disappointed in the price of this product. The sound quality was not as good as the other products I had used at the time. It sounded very tinny and did not have the crispness of the other headphones I had at the same time. The only reason I gave it a fair rating was that I had the option of keeping the stock cord and the headphones would fit my ears better 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this item in a quick sale so I was very disappointed with the product.  The software that is available to install it is not very user friendly and is not user friendly to the user.  It requires a full disk format with all partitions on it.  I would have recommended a different electronic device than the one I received if it was easy to install, and it is a bit cumbersome.  However, the product itself does not work well.  You will not get any help with it with the software that it offers 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this as a replacement for my Canon MP3 player.  It worked for a while but then stopped playing music.  The only way I can find to restart the player is to press the eject button on the front.  If I press it with the remote or the volume button, it will restart.  I'm really not happy with this product.  Don't buy it if you are looking for a reliable mp3 player with remote control

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this for my kids to use to get them online, and I was very disappointed.  I had to return it and get something more affordable.  It's a shame because it's a nice piece of kit, but I would not recommend this to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have an old Sony cam that works with my new HP DLX2000 printer, but not with my previous HP.  HP says that this product is compatible with their previous model, but my previous model has a different serial number.  I'm having trouble getting it to print from my HP and it is getting damaged (a small scratch on the printhead) when it tries to print something larger than an A4 sheet of paper.  The ink cartridge has a small hole in it and it has to be replaced

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because it had an included DVD burner and I wanted to use the included software to burn my DVDs, but I'm now looking for a cheaper DVD burner for it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this item to use with a Canon PowerShot SX.  The only problem I've experienced is that I get lots of "stuck" in the camera's electronic device and can't get it to work.  I've returned it and bought a different Canon Powershot that works just fine with the SX.I am not sure how it is possible to get this item back in stock 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product and I am sorry to say that I am disappointed.  It is not a single player type receiver.  I can only record one channel at a time.  In addition, the antenna is not directional.  What is needed is an antenna that has a directional antenna.  If this is not possible, then I will return it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very disappointed with this product.  I have had other products with the same label and have had them for a few months now and are still not performing well.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is a total failure. I have had 2 of these units with different problems.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first thing that you'll notice is that the sound is way too loud.  I have a JVC J800 that has a small subwoofer (no speakers) and I've got it connected to my home theater with an external power source.  The JVC speakers do not have an equalizer that you can turn up to get better sound.  So I'm not sure why this is so loud

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't waste your money on this, get something more reliable from a good electronic device, you will be disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product because I wanted a DVD player that would hold my DVD's. The problem is that it is so weak. The player will not hold any DVD's at all. It barely will hold half a DVD at a time, and it will eventually fail 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD player did not work with my Mac G4, but it worked fine with my PowerMac G3.  I will not buy any other brand of CD player until I find a reliable CD player that works with my G3 (I've had a Toshiba PDA CD player for years and it's reliable).  I'm not saying this because I was burned, but because I want to make sure I'm getting the best CD player possible 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The remote was a little annoying, but once I figured out the keypad to press the buttons on the front to send text messages, it got better.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for a friend and the CD player worked for about 1 month, then stopped working.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this card, thinking it would be a great deal since it is brand new. However, it doesn't work at all with my ATI card. The only reason it works is because I am using the new drivers.  I'm very disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't know what it is but it is making a LOT of noise when playing songs.  It is very noisy when the volume is on the lowest setting.  I have it in the car and when I put it on the radio I turn it up to about 85% or so.  The sound is so poor that I had to turn the volume all the way up on the car radio to hear the music.  Don't buy this product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is great, but it is a pain to hook up.  I have to pull it out of the box and plug it into the wall.  The only thing I don't like is that it does not have a power port that is labeled with a label 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because of its size and ability to handle high-res DVDs.  The case seems nice, but it is made of a very cheap plastic.  I have already torn it apart for the wires to come loose.  If you intend to store an expensive media inside, you will probably want to get something better.  Don't waste your money on this product, and get something made of better material 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because I was having problems with my other Sony MP3 player (which was also a Sony product).  The player worked great for about a year and then stopped working for some reason.  It was a cheap plastic case, and it didn't have any sort of "open and close" feature.  I have since bought a plastic case that has a "open, close, remove" feature that works well.  Sony did not inform me of this when I bought it (I thought they'd inform me when I received it).  I hope the customer service is better than mine - I bought a $15 electronic device and got a $20 refund from them. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You get what you pay for. I would not purchase again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This item was NOT as advertised.  The buttons do not respond when you press them.  I used the wireless mouse at work and it worked fine.  However, the Wireless Mouse does not have a QWERTY feature, which is very important for typing.  My office manager was not pleased with the item, and now he refuses to use it.  In addition, the mouse pad is not very comfortable, and the buttons don't feel very responsive.  So if you like the mouse, stay away from this item

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was not expecting this to be the case, since it was on Amazon.com.  I am not too happy with it, since the first time I used it, it took about 5 minutes to switch from the old drive to the new one.  The instructions were not clear, and the user manual did not list any instructions for this.  Amazon.COM's return policy states that returned items must be returned within 30 days, so I hope they will change the return policy to 30 days or I will be looking for another case, at least for this one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very skeptical about the product since the warranty was only one year.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You will need to purchase a new cable, if you plan to use it with an HDTV or another digital device.  Amazon's 1 meter 1/8" mini-RCA cable will work fine for most HDTVs, but will not work with the new 1/4" HDMI cable Amazon offers.  You'll need to buy an adapter or use a mini-DIN cable to connect the 1/2" mini to the HDTV, which is an $80 extra. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this item from Amazon and the picture quality is not what I expected.  The pictures were very dim, with a lot of detail missing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These speakers don't hold a lot of air, so I had to turn the volume down.  I had no problems with any of the other speakers in my car, and the sound quality was very poor.  The speakers sound like you are driving in a very small car.  They also produce a lot more background noise than you'd like, especially in the backseat.  If you want to listen to the radio, I'd go for a set of speakers that cost more.  You won't regret getting these speakers if you want decent sound in your car. However, if you are just looking for a way to cut back on the sound, I would look at speakers that aren't so big.  These sound great but they are just too big to use in the rear. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't know why they keep saying they are only 1/2 inch.  I have a small flat case, and they are 2/3 inch. This is just ridiculous.  The volume is only about half of what I need. I would not buy this item again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my wife and we had to replace the batteries in it with new ones, which was a mistake.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had to return it to Amazon because the CD-ROM worked on it but not on the DVD.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It does work, but you really have to watch for the speed to be in the 5-7MP range.  I had a speed of 9.8MP and it was not that reliable.  Do not buy this product, unless you plan on buying the fastest speed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a piece of junk.  I have been buying from Amazon for years and have had them all of them.  Amazon is now claiming it's a replacement product.  You can save a little money on Amazon and save your customer $60 dollars if you go to a real electronics store.  My recommendation is avoid Amazon and purchase something from eBay or another electronic device.  Buy something with a better quality sound.  They are not worth $60 and the customer support for this product is nonexistent

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because the CD player seemed to be working fine for my son, but after several days he complained it wouldn't play any CD.  I was very disappointed with the fact that he wasn't even able to hook it up to his car's radio to play his MP3's, and when I brought it up on the web, it said it had "unable to detect the radio".  I returned it as soon as possible, as I was soooo disappointed.  My advice is not to buy this because it's a piece of junk!  I have bought several of the MP3 players on Amazon.com that do work, and they all cost more than $50.  Don't waste your money!  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this for my wife's car to replace the CD player she's had for three months. It was great for the first few months but the CD didn't play for about 2 months.  I'm sure this was my fault. I would buy something else for her 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The speakers sound OK, but when I'm watching the movie, it's a struggle to get the speakers to turn on. The remote does not have any buttons or function to turn the speakers on and off, so you have to rely on the speakers for this function 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I tried the case on the Web site and had a bad response. I sent it back and they sent me a new one. This case has the wrong color, I think they got the wrong model. The color on the one I received was very dark and looks cheap.  I also found that the case does not fit the new Sony A1S1, they have different widths and thicknesses and it won't fit the Sony A3. I don't know how the case would fit other Sony A-series cameras, I'm guessing it won a lot of the cameras but not this one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this cable to use as a replacement for my old pair of headphones.  They just weren't as loud as my old ones.  It also was much more expensive.  Now, I'm looking for a new pair, but this cable is no better than my old one.  If you want to get more out of your stereo, don't buy this cable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this item as a replacement for my last Sony mouse.  The sound is okay but the problem is that it is a little too thick for my liking.  It also is not very reliable with it's scroll wheel.  I can only scroll with it at a little bit of a distance, so it can be a little fussy to use, but I'm not sure if it's the mouse or the unit. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this case to keep my MacBook Air in.  It does not hold my laptop at all.  If you buy the other type, buy it before you need it.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Not worth the money, not worth the hassle, very unreliable, I have been ripped off twice by Amazon and Amazon customer service are not helpful 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very flimsy product.  The connectors are fragile.  My wife and I lost both ends of a $10 connection when one of them broke.  You should not buy this.  I returned it.  Buy something with a nicer name instead 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product thinking that I had purchased a better version of a Sony product.  I was wrong.  The sound is mediocre at best.  It does not compare to the Sony product with the same price.  If you are looking for a cheap radio with a big, beautiful LCD screen, this is not it.  Buy a cheaper product such as a Panasonic. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  i have purchased these speakers for about 2 years now.  i purchased them for the sound and they never last a year.  after i purchased the speakers i started noticing a big difference in sound quality.  my neighbors who use them have complained about the sound quality so i bought a new set of speakers.  the sound is much louder and has a more distinct edge to it.  these speakers are a waste of money.  you could get better sound from your set of headphones 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These headphones do NOT have a microphone!  The reason for this is that the drivers for this model are not compatible with the newer Mac OS X drivers that come with drivers for most popular headphones, such as Sony MDR1.2 and Beats Studio.  There is no way of telling which is which, and you would have to buy new drivers for each one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The case is nice and sturdy, but the case clips so tightly that if I'm sitting on it and it drops on my foot, I'm dead. I'm hoping they will release a better design in the future 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product on May 15th and have received it only today. I have a Canon T4 camera that is in the dark room with the front door open and the light on, so I do not know what will happen to it, if it will work, if the power will be interrupted, if my batteries will run out, etc.  It is supposed to last me several months with use, but I am in for the money and this product is not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is not usable for the purpose it was intended for.  The antenna does not extend far enough to get the signal I need to receive TV's and AM stations.  It would be great if they would just add some foam or something to make it more comfortable to use 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't buy this because the batteries won't hold a charge for more than a few hours. They do last for awhile, but they go off when you aren't using them. Don't waste your money. I will never buy this again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is not functional and is just a novelty 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This card did not work with my Mac, but it did work with Windows XP.  I bought this card hoping it would work with OSX.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work with Mac OSX because the drivers are outdated, and there is no official support for it on Mac OS X.  For Windows XP, it works fine, but don't expect it to work with XP, because it is Windows only.  If you want to use XP on your Mac, buy a Mac with drivers for XP (or a similar operating system).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was a complete waste of money.  I have a Samsung laptop with the same CD player, and I can't even tell the difference in sound quality.  The only difference is the volume.  For me, it would have been better to get an iPod for the money. I also purchased this with my daughter, but she is not a tech and was unable to figure out how to set it up correctly.  It is a complete failure in the quality of sound, and the only positive review I can give it is that it's easy to remove, but it's a hassle to return the CD player to its original packaging 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It's not a big deal, but it doesn't work. The remote is a little finicky to use.  I used it for 2 hours, then it didn't work anymore.  My car radio is a Sony unit, so it's a bit odd that it doesn, but not Sony. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My wife bought this for her son, and he doesn't like it.  I tried everything to get it to work, and it still won't work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is only worth a few bucks. The sound quality is not good at all.  I had a different product with better specs for my home and this is just not worth it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because it has an RFID reader on it.  Unfortunately, I've found out that this reader is not compatible with the newer versions of Windows XP.  I've had no luck finding any Windows XP drivers that support this reader on any of the Windows XP-based Windows XP installations I've tried, so I've returned it. --  I suggest anyone who needs an RF scanner to get an RFMORPE product that supports XP. The scanner was originally made for Windows 95, which is no longer supported by Microsoft.  If it's still a viable product, they'll sell it to you again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought these, not knowing the battery life was going to be limited. I have not been able to make any videos with these batteries yet, so I am returning them. I'm not an idiot and I will not be wasting my money on a bad battery. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This radio will not work in my car.  The antenna is too far away from the radio.  Don't buy this radio if you want to use it in your car.It would be better if I could receive and send radio signals to my car from my computer, which I do.  It is too expensive for its lack of functionality.  I do not use this radio because I think it is useless.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD burner on this machine is slow, so if you have lots of DVDs to burn, I suggest buying a DVD burner with better speed.  It would be nice if this machine would use the standard CD burner.  The software for burning DVD's is not intuitive.  I will try the software on my next machine. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because I wanted to use the same CD player in both the front and back seats of my car.  The product is OK, but it's not as big as the car radio, and it's more expensive.  I returned it because the buttons don't work.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this item after reading the reviews.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got a cd player from Amazon, and I had to return it. The unit did not have a cd slot. I couldn't find any of the cd's I had bought from Amazon on Amazon's site.  Amazon has been very slow in getting my replacement product, which I will be receiving this weekend.  I have not found a CD player with a cd port that is as reliable as this unit. Amazon should really take care of their customers 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this as a gift for my husband and he is a Mac user.  The iPod would not play any MP3 or CD at all.  I returned it and the company would not refund it.  Amazon.com is not an acceptable electronic device company.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't buy this if you are not using a high-powered system. You will get a lot more noise if you do.  I bought the XL model and it is much quieter than the XL.  If you use a high power system and don't care about the volume, go for the XL because it is quieter.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have used this product twice, and both times it worked, but it was not worth the money.  The first time it worked fine, but when it was installed the next day, it would not work.  I could see the light, but could not see the radio.  After a few minutes, it began to crackle and would not function properly.  This product is not worth its money. I will never purchase from this company again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product because the "battery life" claim was great.  I've been using it about a month and it still hasn't made any difference in my battery life.  The only reason I gave it a try was because I was a big fan of the HP Pavilion dv71 and I wanted a "big battery" for my laptop.  It is a disappointment.  What I expected to save me time and battery life is something I don't even have any chance of doing anymore.  Do not waste your money on this product unless you want to pay $30 for a battery that doesn't do much.  There are much better options.  Buy something else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have used several brand name iPods and this is by far the worst.  The sound is very weak.  This product makes the sound worse than the iPod itself.  I bought the iPod Nano because I was looking for a smaller iPod.  But if you buy this product it is a rip off.  It will not hold a charge and will eventually go flat and break.  Don't waste your money on this product.  Buy a Panasonic product. I am a big fan of Panasonic products and will never buy another brand name iPod 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was not expecting this to be able to record from my Panasonic LAS970. The first time I tried to record something, it would hang.  It would then reboot, and it would record again.  I returned it and got the Panasonic L-E500. I had to return both because the first one had a serious bug.  The L-D500 would just freeze, and there would be nothing else recorded.  If you try to record anything at all from this, don't expect it to work.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this product because it was so cheap. I bought the same thing with a slightly different name and received the same item.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got my iPod from Amazon and it came with the CD player.  The only problem was that the player could not read my CD's at all.

It will waste your time just sitting there.  Buyer beware 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this cable because of the reviews on Amazon.  Unfortunately, this cable does not work with the new Samsung UN6500 (A.K.A. the new Sony ZX Series) DVD player.  Sony sells their new player with a "universal" type of cable.  The new "universal cable" uses the older type of the Sony cable, which is not compatible with the newer Samsung player.It is not that hard to plug the Sony player into your Samsung cable.The new Sony cable is much less bulky, and is not as rigid.  I can't even feel the plastic cable anymore when I plug it in.  In addition, the new player doesn't have an on/off switch that allows you to switch between the Sony and Samsung player in the remote control.  So if you want to switch from Sony to Samsung player, you'll have to turn the player off and on to make the switch.The Sony cable will last for years.  But you'll need to buy another Sony cable (the original Sony cable sold by Amazon) if you ever want to use this Sony player with any other brand.  After a while, you won't be able to use the Sony controller anymore, because Sony doesn't make the Sony "universal controller" anymore 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm not sure what this is, but I had a previous Toshiba TV that would not play DVDs with an HDCP copy protected disc.  I tried other brands, none of which worked.  This unit is totally useless for watching DVDs!  It can barely watch the movie, which is the only thing it can do, because it does not have an optical drive!  I will never buy this again, unless they make it in a different size.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased these headphones for my wife to use while driving and she didn't like them. They were loud and made her head very uncomfortable.  After some research, I found that the earphones used for my car (Pilot Sports Sport Earphones) use an inline cord instead of the standard headphone cord, so I had to return the headphones to Amazon.  I had hoped that Amazon would send me the inline cord to try. I did receive the inline cords, however, and I will never use these again

My original unit, which worked fine for about 5 months, now cannot function properly.  I am hoping that a refund will be accepted, as the unit is not even worth my time to send back 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It did not work with my MacMini and it was not a quick response to a customer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would not recommend this product.  It is very fragile and only works with the DVD player.  You need a higher speed drive to play it.  The software is very buggy and not very user friendly 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only reason for me buying this product is that it had 4 USB ports and 1 eSata port.  The rest of the product was a complete mess.  There is very little room to plug the eSATA into the USB port, and the case that comes with the product is so short that it will not fit inside.  I would have given this a lower rating if I had known that there was a chance it would not hold my 500gb iPod 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this cable because I wanted to be able to connect my iPod to the TV via HDMI without having to plug it in to the wall socket.  I expected it to have some degree of robustness.  Well, not so.  The first time I used this cable (to connect my iPaq to the television) the iPod died.  It was a very long time before the iPod would boot up and function correctly.  Don't buy this cable unless you want it to be a "cable" to keep the iPod from breaking, which is a rare occurrence. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product works for the price.  But not for the sound quality.  I used the supplied drivers to get a more realistic sound, but it doesn't really come close to what the real sound is like when listening to my mp3 player or mp3's played through my car stereo system.  The volume was not as loud as when I used my internal speakers.  Don't waste your money on this, it is a waste of your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've bought many brand new printers over the years, and have always been satisfied with them.  One thing I never did was to buy this particular printer.  My new HP HP LBP9600 did not work for me, but was still relatively new.  I returned it and got a Dell HP LM6000.  After a month of use (not very long, but it was a lot of work), the ink cartridge began to leak.  A week later the printer was returned and I got an HP LMP500.  HP's website is very confusing, as there are different brands of ink (some are cheaper and others are more expensive), and different cartridges.  The ink cartridge was expired and the ink could not be refilled, so I had to return the printer and buy new cartridges. The new HP LLP500 would not print properly, and I did not receive any replacement ink cartridges.I did not get the best print quality when I used the HP LHP500 because the ink was not as well suited for color reproduction.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Not as sturdy as I expected.  Might have been a problem with the unit as the case I bought it from was made from a bad quality material, not as nice as I would've expected for a high quality case.  Will be returning it.  I hope it was just a bad case and not a common problem with this unit.  If it is the case you bought from me, I would suggest you buy a different brand and maybe buy a lower quality case 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit worked for a few minutes, but then died. I would not buy this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You will get the best reception if you plug your antenna directly into the receiver, and the antenna is small and prone to interference.  Don't bother if you're using an antenna that's a lot bigger than your receiver.  They will cause your receiver to lose its signal.  I'm using an ARIA 40M for my reception, but it works just as well.  The ARIA antenna works fine, but the receiver has a lot of unwanted noise that can be distracting.  There's a better receiver out there 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't buy this unless you are willing to spend an extra $50 on the brand name brand. The picture quality is subpar. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this cable because I needed a digital device to hook my DVD player up to my TV.  It does the job, but it is not the best cable I've ever used.  I had to hook it up to the TV with the included HDMI cable, which has a very short reach.  The TV does not have a "loop" feature that allows you to hook up your TV to another device and then hook up the TV's remote.  In addition, I had trouble with the remote's operation, as I often had to press buttons to get it to switch channels 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this because I have an HP DL6000 with an optical drive and I wanted a USB thumb drive for my personal use.  I have never been able to get it to work.  The product description stated that it was compatible with the DL6000 and it appears that is true.  However, it does not have the ability to access the hard drive when it is being used as an external drive, as the product does not appear to have an option to access it from within Windows.  It would be great if the product were compatible with Windows XP.  But I will be returning it in a few weeks for a refund. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used the product for 2 months and the memory card works.  I am now returning it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got it for $50.00 on sale, but it is NOT worth the money!  First of all it only fits 10 CDs, and not 2, as I expected.

So I can't use it with the CD player case.I have used several CD players, and this one is by far the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't waste your money on this. The picture is excellent, but the sound is so-so.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You can get better speakers from an iPod, but this one is no better.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because the others I have had don't work at all.  It is only for the iPod, which has a tiny internal space.  If you want to use your iPod's hard drive (or any other type of memory) on the TV, this will not work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am not sure if this is the same thing as the HP Deskjet G10 but it has a "warranty" sticker.  I've never seen it in use and I'm sure it isn't the same product.  It doesn't seem to be able to power on my laptop.  If you have a HP laptop this is a big problem because it is supposed to be a "power on" device.  But since my laptop was already "on" I didn't even try to get it to power up.  So, it's probably a problem with my HP.  On the plus side the printer is very small so I wouldn't want to buy another HP if I could get it for free 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The picture quality is good, but the built in earphones have a horrible sound. I bought this to use in my car, but it didn't work. The sound quality is fine for driving, but I don't have to listen to the sound any longer.The built in speakers are very weak and the microphone is small and poorly designed.  I would never buy this product again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product and was hoping for a great electronic device.  My main concern was that the CD player could not play MP3's.  After some research, I decided to try a Panasonic MP3 player.  I was disappointed because the Panasonic is NOT MP3 compatible.  The problem is that the Panasonic player cannot output MP3.  Not being able to play MP 3's is a big disappointment since I bought it as an MP3 device.I do not recommend this product.  If you want a good mp3 player, buy an iPod, which is MP3 ready.  It is a great product for the price and has better sound quality than this Panasonic product.If you plan to use this mp3 receiver, buy the iPod player that is MP4 compatible 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't think this product is capable of producing accurate scans and color photos. I have used it to scan some real photos that I am not familiar with. It seems to produce a bad scan or a slightly different color than what I would have expected from the original photo.  The scanner does not accept the color profiles that are stored in the card, so you have to set the profiles manually. I would not recommend this product for color photography 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was really disappointed with the performance of this player.  I have the Sony player with its original battery, which has performed beautifully for years.  The batteries in this player were apparently replaced shortly after I received the unit, leaving me with a very high-energy battery, in the upper-end of its range.  This means that the player has a short life and can be expected to last only a few months before it needs to be replaced

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm new to Windows 8, and this card is not compatible with my system.  The card itself is not the problem.  What's wrong is that the DVD drive that comes with it is broken.  I've tried to fix it and it won't work anymore.  This card is a total waste of money.  If you have a DVD drive you don't care about the card, this card might be ok for you 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my brother.  He is a big fan of the Sony DVD player and he really likes the sound quality.  I wanted to get rid of the old ones in the cabinet and had to return it because of their low performance.  Sony is now selling an upgrade kit for the DVD player that is only worth $10 and it will fit into the same cabinet as the original.  The sound quality is OK but the performance is much worse than the original player.  There is a small chance that it will work in the new player but you will have to pay $40 for a new player and this one is too expensive for what it is.  Buy something else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this mouse because I am a student.  It is very small and has a small range.  I don't like the fact that it is a wireless mouse.  The range is great though and it is easy to use.  However, it is not the mouse that I expected.  You can only use it on the screen.  If you want to do something else, such as print or look at the web, you have to turn the mouse on and off again, which is a pain when you want something else to do while your mouse is on the desktop. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have only had this product for a week and it is not as well as I expected.  It was advertised to be able to hold up to 30 CDs and could not.  I would never buy a CD player with a limited amount of space if I could avoid it.  If you don't plan on using a lot of CDs, this player may be a good buy.  The quality of this player is not the greatest but I am not confident that it can hold up in a serious situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this product for two months now. I have done everything I can to prevent it from dying, but I can't believe that the battery can't last an entire year.  I purchased it for a good electronic device that I didn't expect to die.  Unfortunately, the battery is dead on the first day of every month.  Don't buy this product.  It's a waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had my Panasonic TV for almost 7 months now. I used the original DVD player and this unit is not the same as the previous. The sound quality is still the same, but the picture quality is noticeably worse. I am having problems with my Panasonic player, but when I tried the TV, it worked fine.  I did not get a receipt for the new player, which is not an issue.  The TV is no longer capable of playing DVDs 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My car has a new radio, and the radio is still not working.  I do not understand why it is not working right now.

It will just be replaced with another one that will be less expensive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for a better CD player.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It's a bit of a pain to use, but it does work.  The product has a number of problems.  First, it doesn't work with the AT&T network, and second, the sound quality is horrible.  I'm using the Microsoft XP version, which is a bit more expensive, but with the same features and specs.  Hopefully I can get Microsoft to fix it, but I'll have to keep using the CD player that I already have

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered these to use with a Sony printer that is very slow to print. The results are not acceptable.

There is also an "invisible" screen that doesn't turn on until you press it. This is a big deal, because I wanted to use it for a video recording and had a friend who has a Sony PX100 and I had to explain what the "screen" is to him.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been buying these memory cards for over 10 years now.  The only thing that stopped me from getting them at the first store I went to was their low price.  They were only $4.00 a dozen when I bought them at my local store.  But when I checked them out, I discovered they didn't work at all.  I could not even insert a new memory card into the slot, let alone put it in the computer.  In fact, when I tried to insert a second card into my computer it would not even recognize the second card and would reboot.  It is clear to me that the first generation memory cards I bought for my laptop would not work for this particular computer.My advice is NOT to buy these memory card.  Go elsewhere and get something else.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I tried several times to get it to work with my new mp3 player but it never worked.  I have an ATI card that is not supported by ATI software (the software that is on my mp3 is not the same that is in the player itself) and I did not have the software to set up the driver to get the software working with the ATI card.  All the other drivers I tried also did not work with the player.  It is now sitting in the corner of my room with the mp3 and the ipod player on the same floor.  The ipod is a Sony model.  So, there are several things I can do to try and fix it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very skeptical about the $60 price tag for this card.  I figured I could just return it, and save a lot of money.  Turns out I'm very fortunate.  If you plan on having multiple computers, this card might be overkill.  It does support the newest Mac OS, so it will support new Mac OS releases, which are usually supported by newer versions of Windows (even though they are sometimes older versions of XP).  However, it does not support Windows XP for the Mac OS 10.1 and 10.2, which is what I use.  So if you have Windows XP, I recommend getting an 8GB version of the card. Otherwise, you'll get a half or a quarter of a gigabyte, and you can't use the card with the latest versions of Mac OS... I recommend at least getting a 1GB version, but it's not worth spending $60 on an underpowered 1GB card.If you use it with a Mac OS that is supported by Windows XP (and that is a very small percentage of the computers), this card will be OK.  However if you use Mac OS X 10.3 or 10.4 (or even 10.5), it's a huge waste of money... and you should be looking for a higher capacity card... if you can afford it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is a joke.  There is not enough room in the product to actually fit any of the SD cards, not even close.  The product is designed to hold all of the cards and you can only store a few cards in the top compartment.  I bought this product thinking I could carry around all my cards, but after purchasing this product I found out it could not hold any of my cards and I was out $60 dollars because of it.  If you want to buy this product just do not purchase it, it is not worth it.If you are looking for a product that can hold all your SD cards and not cost you money, then buy a more expensive product, and not this one.  Do not buy this if you are not buying something else.  You will be wasting your money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD player is OK.  The sound is OK, but not great.  Don't buy this unless you have the chance to upgrade your iPod.  I don't have an iPod and the player wouldn't play the "iPod" tune.  This is a CD player with the same CD player buttons, but is an iPOD with a built-in player.  It's not worth the $20 for a "standard" iPod player.The software is just OK. It will auto play, but will pause if you move the player out of range of the radio.  But if you turn off the radio, the player will just resume.  For a basic iPod player, I'd just save your money and get an iPod.The batteries are not great and will last a few months if you don't use them all the time

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered these because they had a good review about them and they were on sale at the time.

I was told by Amazon that the remote is made by Sony, so I went back and ordered a Sony remote that was not made by them.  This one has an odd, "swirly" feel to it.  Don't waste your money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have purchased three of these units, but only one is functioning.  I've already returned the third one.  The software that's included in the units are very slow, and the unit won't record a DVD unless you insert it into a computer.  It is a total waste of my money.  If I ever had to buy another one of these, I would avoid it like the plague 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product was very slow and the sound quality was awful.  It also could not power my ipod because it would not get any signal from the receiver.  I had to reset it twice 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Not worth it.  My wife had a Canon VX500 for over two years and now is looking for something new.  I have tried many options and finally decided to return the camera to Amazon.  Amazon is very nice but I'm not happy with this camera and am looking for other options 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It is an OK printer.  I would rather have an HP printer that is a little more reliable than this one.  The print quality is ok.  It's not very compact but it has a decent paper capacity.  But the printing quality is not what you'd expect from an HP.  You will get a much better quality print if you use a Canon or Kodak.  They will last much longer than this HP.It is a shame that HP didn't make a better product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this for my new Mac and it worked for about 4 hours. Then it quit working and it took me hours to recover. The problem is that the battery does not last for long. I would recommend getting a replacement battery 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered a pair of these for my wife and I, and both ended up with a very small scratch on the case.  Not worth the $3.99 to replace just to get rid of the scratch.  The earbuds sound OK for the size, but the cord is short and doesn't last as long as I would like.  Don't expect these to last a lifetime if you don't use them.  They are a pain to take off and on.  If you want a longer cord, get the Tungsten brand.  Buyer beware! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have used this product several times and now have a dead one.  I was hoping for a product that would be better than the others but it is not.  This product does not have an optical drive bay.  The bay is a piece of junk.  It is very fragile and will break if you are not careful 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product a year ago and it's still broken. The cord is just too short, I don't have any other brand of cord to plug in the computer so I'm out of luck.  I would be more than a little disappointed if I lost it because the only way to replace it is to find another one at a different price and have to do the repair work myself 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These cables are not made for high speed data transfer, even the cheapest ones will slow down your computer. The quality is not good enough for a $10 cable. If you are looking for a high speed cable, get a cable made by a higher quality brand.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It has a lot of fans, but is really not worth the $60 it costs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These headphones did not fit my ears properly. I had to get a new pair for my wife and she was happy.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It worked for a while but then quit and wouldn't turn on anymore.  I returned it and bought a new one.  They are a pain in the ass to replace the battery and don't hold a charge.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product has a very limited amount of memory.  The only reason I purchased this product is to save space, so I was a little surprised when I noticed the software was limited in the first place.  I found it quite annoying trying to delete the most recent photos.  This is a great deal less than the 2GB of the other memory modules I have.  Overall, I do not recommend this product.  For the money, I could have purchased another 2GB product with a better warranty 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  this is a very poor antenna, as far as reception is concerned.  the reception is very poor for anything in the mid-70s to 75 degrees (I live in central Florida).  I am now looking for a different antenna that has better reception.  I have used the U-NII product with excellent results, and am confident that it will work.  it is not worth the money for this one.  if you want better reception, go to Radio Shack for something better 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my product in less than one day and was very disappointed.

I will never buy this product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used this product for a number of months and then returned it. I'm not impressed with the sound quality, since I'm listening to my iPod on a low-quality FM radio. I wish there were more options. I'd prefer a better product if I can get it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My laptop has a brand new Dell PowerEdge i7 and I wanted to remove the mouse from it.  However, the instructions for removing the mouse were not clear.  I had to go into the Dell customer support website to learn that there is a special set of instructions that only work if the mouse is already off.  The instructions here are not clear and the customer support site has a long list of supported devices.  A Dell tech support person had no idea what the problem was

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used to use this antenna for over 20 years. It was a good antenna, but when I bought a better antenna the antenna broke.  I am now using a different antenna and my results are much worse.  My home is not in an urban area with lots of buildings.  This antenna is no longer useful.  Please stop selling these antennas 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm in the market for a CD player.  I wanted something that would hold my CD's in its place while I use the other player.The Sony MP-TCD1 is certainly a better product than the HP Media Playmate.  However, the Sony MPD1's only hold up to about 300 CDs before breaking down.  The HP Media playmate can hold about 10,000 CDs.  If you intend to play lots of CDs, I'd consider the HP's player, or if you have lots of DVDs or CDs that are small in volume, go with the Sony.  But, if you only have a few CDs to store, it's worth the extra money to buy the Sony because the HP will hold your CDs in place while you play your other player (Sony). 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My car radio, made by Sony, is a Sony ICF-3000.  The antenna is of the standard Sony design and it comes with a mount.  It is a very small antenna, which means you can't really hear the station's signal with this antenna.  This is especially a problem if you are listening to the station outside the car.  I had to return the radio because the antenna is so small, I could barely hear the reception, and my car's antenna would not stay stable after a few weeks.  Do not buy this antenna

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was thinking it would be a little easier to use than the others on the market.  I can't say I'm disappointed.  The only problem I have is the lack of power.  My Sony DVD player and DVD burner use the power and speakers for a lot of things, and I didn't know the battery life until I needed it.  It only lasts about an hour before the battery runs out, and when it does, it can't power the speakers anymore.  Don't buy it. It just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a piece of junk.  The antenna works fine, but the antenna jack does not stay in place.  It does not stick to the TV, which is an oddity, because the antenna was supposed to stay in the box.  This means you have to turn the antenna up or down to keep it in the right position.  In addition, the antenna's plastic casing cracks easily, and the antenna itself is very flimsy.  Finally, the remote itself is useless, because it lacks a remote switch.  If you need a remote, get a TV instead 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product does not work with Windows XP. The product does work with XP.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this product to keep the cord from cutting the sound of the TV to the speakers.  After a couple of days, the cord cut out.  If you do not keep the power cord plugged in all the time, it may cut out from the TV altogether.  It was only a minor annoyance because the TV is very loud and I had to go through the whole TV's menu to find the "Power On" feature.  I do not recommend this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought these for my wife's laptop.  The CD burner is a little weak.  If you have to remove the battery to put the disk in, make sure you leave the CD in the battery while you are doing it.  I have had my computer run out of battery so many times that I now buy batteries at the store.  It would take me 20 minutes to get it running again!  I bought these as replacements for my old, working CD burner which lasted me 3 years.  My wife's is just now broken and I am now out a $60 electronic device that I don't want anymore.  Don't buy these.  They don't last long, don't work well and are useless if you can't take it apart to put them back together 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't buy these unless you have a brand new machine with a USB cable.  The sound quality is terrible.  Don't buy this unless you can get an iPod nano or iPod shuffle (with no dongle) with better sound quality.  I am still waiting for an iPod shuffle with dongles 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is a bit of a disappointment, it is a little noisy and a little slow to start up.  I had to restart the router to get it running again.  It also appears to be very flaky.  Don't waste your money on this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It is a little noisy, but it is a lot better than the Canon 50D.  I would not buy it again.  It will not hold the sound quality you want it to.  Don't buy it if you want to listen to CDs. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The case itself is a nice thing, but it is not waterproof. I bought it for the sole purpose of keeping my MacBook dry, and I was wrong.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had to return this item.  The only reason I returned it was because it did not work on my Macbook.  I could have returned it without any problem.  If you want a good CD player, get a Sony CD-A5.

Amazon sent me a replacement product that worked fine for about 2 months.  Now I am wondering if I will be able to return this product to Amazon or if I should return it to the seller

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an item that is only recommended by Dell.  We purchased it at Amazon and found it to be a disappointment.  The product has a very high risk of damaging the DVD player.  Don't buy this item unless you have Dell's recommendation 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm an IT pro and I can say it is a waste of money to buy this product.  I just can't imagine the sound quality is that of a regular iPod without the speaker.  If you have a small car stereo, I would suggest the JVC E5.4i as its price is very reasonable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These ear buds work well but not for the price.  The fit is a little big but not that big, you'll feel a little more secure wearing them.  You have to press hard to get the buds in your ears.  This is just an inconvenience.  There is no way to remove the buds from the ear canal with the supplied case or ear plugs.  If you want the buds to go back in your ear, you have to buy the case to do it.  I wish I had never bought these.  Don't waste your money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product has a lot of problems.  I have had the product for almost a year and it still does not work.  The product works fine on the iPod 3G model, but it does not even boot up the 3G version on the iPhone 3G.  We have a new case for it and it will work for a little while, but only for a couple of hours and then it crashes.  It is a complete failure, so if you are considering this product, do not buy it.  Just buy something better! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used to love this product, until it broke.  Don't buy it!  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this cable for my Sony HD-U500. I have had several problems with this cable. First of all, the connectors sometimes don't come out.  Second, the sound quality is quite poor, especially when listening to CDs.  Third, it is not easy to plug into the internal antenna jack, so you have to keep pressing on the cable to get the signal to work.  It is an expensive cable that I won't be using anymore 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't have much to say about this item, other than it is cheap.  I am a long time user of Canon products, so I am hesitant to say something bad about it.  However, I am very disappointed with the picture quality of this product.  In low light, I can see that there is a very slight amount of moire that is visible, and I'm also disappointed because it is the only product I've ever used that can't produce an image in this mode.  So it is a great product, if you're looking for something cheap and not expecting the best quality possible.  But in low light conditions it just isn't worth the extra money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a piece of junk. I got it because it was cheaper than my old Sony.  It was a joke.  Don't waste your money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have purchased other brand name products, and these are not as easy to assemble as the ones I previously purchased.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a horrible product.  I was able to use it only to transfer files from my laptop to my hard drive.  It's so slow and unreliable that it is a waste of money to buy it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this as a replacement for my old cd player that had died and I had to return it.  However, it is not worth the money.  It does not work very well with the iPod because it is slow.  I have had my iPod for a year and it has never quit on me.  The buttons don't work at all.  So if you have to return a dead iPod, don't buy this player.  Also, the remote does not do anything and you have no way to turn it on or off.  This is the worst iPod I have ever had.  Don't waste your money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product thinking it would be good for my kids to use.  Unfortunately, it is not.  I tried to find a good alternative and purchased the Sony DVD player that has an extra USB port for a mouse/keyboard/etc. The Sony is great for its size, but the Sony USB is a lot heavier.  It is not a big deal to have an extra port to use, but when you are spending $300-400 dollars, you might want to consider something better

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product does not support the USB-C standard.  If you want to use the USB connection with a standard USB-A cable, it will not work.  You will need to use a mini USB-to-C-to adapter for that purpose.  The unit is not compatible with the Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller (or its Xbox-compatible counterparts) -- you will have to buy an adapter for this, or use the controller with an older version of the Xbox 360 controller (which does not have an M-connector) or some other controller -- such as the Logitech G510 or Logitech Xbox 360 Arcade Stick -- which do support the standard USB connection 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only thing that made this thing usable was the remote.  I found that the receiver could not distinguish between different sets of tones.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been using the product for 3 months and I have found it to be of very poor quality.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I tried this card with two Dell laptops and one HP notebook and both broke.  The HP laptop with a faster processor did not get any more than 16 MB/s on the card and the Dell laptop with the slower processor did.

I have to agree with other reviews, as this unit did not work with my DVD player.  It would burn a bad copy, and when I tried to burn the DVD, it wouldn't start.  A second unit worked fine with my previous DVD player...so I think I got burned by my previous unit.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this item thinking it would be a good electronic device.  It is not.  We have had problems with it.  If you plan on using it for anything other than DVD playback, you should not buy this.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product for my daughter to replace the cassette she used to record her music.  The product works, but it's not as convenient as the one she used before.  It is cumbersome to use, and requires several clicks to start and stop recording.  I'm not recommending this product, however, because the product's design is a little dated.  There are cheaper options that offer better sound quality and convenience 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It works with my Dell VIO 300 but I don't like the color and the sound is not great.  I can't return it for a refund.  Don't buy this unless you like a yellowish color 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very disappointed in this product.  I have a HP LaserJet printer and an HP LaserWriter.  The HP LaserStation 6.0 is much slower than the HP LaserStudio 6.5.  It does not print well with photos and text and it does not produce fine prints.  There are many other printers that produce more photos, more text and much better prints.So I bought a Canon HP Photo Printer and a Canon LaserWriter and decided to use the HP printers on this one because it was the fastest.  Unfortunately, the HP PhotoPrinter produced very poor photos and I had to take photos from a digital camera and copy them onto the HP printer.  However, the Canon Laserwriter did print fine and I am very disappointed with this HP printer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The radio does work but I find the reception to be very poor.  You will have to do some more research to find out the best radio for your car.  It's a pain to use and not very useful for a new car.I'm returning it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use the printer to print documents for a client, and this thing has a huge black hole at the bottom of the paper! The problem is that the printer is not compatible with the newer Canon LaserJet printer, which has an ink reservoir at the top of the cartridge and the cartridge goes in to the printer through this hole. The ink was ruined

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't think this is worth the price.  The sound is OK, but not as great as the Sennheiser MDR5.2.1.1 with its subwoofer.  I am going to buy the S-MARK-5 because of the subwoofers, but this is not an option for me at this price. The sound quality is much better, and the sub is much quieter.  Buy something else! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The battery is ok but the radio is not.  I tried the "Duo" radio with the iPod and it is not a fair comparison.    I had the iPod with me everywhere, when I went to the store, it was not missing, the battery was working, but the "duo" wouldn't turn on.  So I returned it and purchased the Motorola SB-C600.  The SB-600 is a much better radio.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have to buy a new battery every year for my Sony Vaio.  It has now become an annual habit.  I bought this battery a year ago and it has now started to deteriorate.  The first time I used it, I thought I had to replace it.  But now I have bought another one.  This new battery does not have a good reputation.  Buy something else if you can afford it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used this card in my Pentium 2 (i7) and it worked for a short time.  After a while it stopped working and it's now back to the "I don't know what to do" state.  My advice is to return it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only thing I will not buy again is the HP Media Dock because it is much smaller.  You'll need to invest in something like the HP Protec Wireless Dock if you want the same amount of space and flexibility as the HP Dock.  I'm not trying to say the HP-CDA2-A3D is bad, but it sure is a little pricy

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have used this product many times. The first time I put it in, it wouldn't work and I had to return it.  The second time I had it working, it was slow.  So I returned it and got a different product from Amazon.  I'm sure the product I got is better than the one I had.  Amazon is a very slow electronic device and I would not recommend purchasing from them 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product description on Amazon said it would last for years.  Well, it lasted less than a year, then stopped working and had to be replaced.  Amazon customer service does not help.  Don't waste your money on this product.  If you are looking for a CD player, check Amazon and buy a Panasonic or Sony.  I got mine from Amazon because I needed one, and it was cheaper than a Panasonic.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The earphones work ok but they don't fit well.  I have a full size earphone with a softer ear tip so the earbuds won't stay in place in my ears.  The ones I received from Amazon were made of plastic which is not very comfortable.  It is hard to get them to stay in your ears because they get in the way when you talk 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got mine to work.  Now it is useless.  Don't buy this.  If you buy it, buy a better item.  I used to have mine in my car for 5 months without a problem.  The only problem now is it is constantly sending the "check" message that the software can't access the printer.  It also sends "no printing" messages if it is off, and "printing" if it's off

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this to use in my MP3 player.  The sound quality is a little better than the iPod touch but the lack of an external power supply really hurt.  My MP3 battery died after only 5 months and I had to return the iPod to the seller.  It is a shame because the player is great.  But for an iPod player with no external power source it would not have survived the first few months.  I have since bought an iPod mini for my son.  He is also a big fan of the iPod but I'm sure he'll be using it less because of the lack on the iPod's battery life.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to use as a remote for my VCR and it's just plain bad. I have to constantly tap the buttons to make the signal go through. It's pretty useless. I returned it for a replacement. I will never purchase a Sony product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my unit today and it is not working. The manufacturer said it would take 6 weeks for me to get a replacement.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got it, but it broke after about 10 hours.  If you get it, make sure you remove it from your car's radio, and don't let it sit in the radio for too long!  I used it for about 2 weeks, and when I got the radio back it would not hold on to the CD, and I would have to start over.  I do not recommend this radio to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had to return this card twice because it doesn't work properly.  I first tried to use the software that is included in the software for installing the drivers to make the card work, and it did.  However, when I tried to boot it from the CD, it would not even show up in the BIOS.  The CD will have to be formatted first before it can be used.  It's really a waste of money, since the card worked fine before I returned it.  In addition, I have to return it because I can't get it to work at all.  If you do decide to use this card, make sure you read the instructions and understand how to format the CD to make it work properly

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had no problem with this product, but the sound is really bad. I can't hear any detail of the songs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this item because it was a bit cheaper than the other items I had to get rid of.  But, in the first week it died in my car, and it is now out of warranty.  I am hoping for a replacement from Amazon. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this thing for a few months now.  I am constantly getting a low reading signal.  The problem is that the radio receives the signal with no attenuation whatsoever, meaning that the signal is being received in an entirely different area of the FM radio than the signal received by the radio itself.  This is a complete and utter annoyance, especially when using the FM channel in a car.  Also, the radio is in my car's glove box.  What gives?  I would never buy a radio that only receives AM, and certainly not at a loss to your radio's reception.  Don't waste your money on this.  Buy something that works and is at least as good 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been trying for years to get the Sony DVD recorder to record my original home movie.  I bought this product thinking it was an inexpensive alternative to my Panasonic camera which has a built-in DVD player.  What a difference it makes when you can't record because the recorder is broken.  Don't waste your money on this product.  The only thing it does is copy your DVD to your computer.  It won't let you record a picture.  Buy something else.  Sony has a reputation for making junk products, but they can't even keep this recorder in working order 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product does not work with the ATX-PS2 controller.  I tried this out with both the ATA and ATX controllers.  Neither worked.  It is not an ATX controller so I don't know what kind it is, but I doubt it is the ATE.  The ATX product works with both ATX and ATA.  If you have the ATI controller you should try this out too.  Otherwise, it is a complete failure.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these for a friend. He needed something to hook his laptop to. We thought the ipaq was a little small, but this one was so big it would not hold the weight. The keyboard is fine, but not enough space for it to fit the mouse. The mouse itself is junk.  It doesn't have any buttons or d-pad, it is all plastic and has an awkward shape. I am not sure how it works because the mouse doesn't work.  You have to turn the mouse on with your finger and hold the button for about 20 seconds until it starts moving.  If you don't have a mouse pad to rest your finger on, you will have a really hard time controlling the computer.The ipaq is a total piece of junk. It is very bulky, but it works fine for what it is. I don't think you can get any better for this price at any other store

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a new product that the manufacturer has not adequately tested or verified that it will support the new Mac OS X. This product should not be recommended to customers because of the high likelihood of being incompatible with Mac OS. The product is listed as compatible with XP and earlier. The manufacturer should be held responsible for the product's compatibility with Mac. If you intend to use the product with a Mac OSX computer, I suggest that you check with the manufacturer directly 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this card for my wife's laptop, and the picture quality is pretty bad.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because the previous manufacturer's one did not work with my printer.  I am very disappointed.  You can't even print from it, and it costs more than the last printer.So it is time for another manufacturer to come out with a better product, and hopefully, one that can print from the printer.I have bought from several other companies before, but have always had excellent results with their products, and now I am looking for a new one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this item because of the previous reviewer's negative review.  I was not impressed with the size and that it did not support the latest version of the USB cable that I wanted.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was not expecting any problems with my new wireless router.  But after connecting to the wireless network using the router's built in web interface, I found that it would randomly disconnect and re-connect to the network every few seconds.  I had to disconnect from the network and log into the web interface manually to reset the router and keep it online.  It's also not very easy to troubleshoot a network problem with the web interfaces of most routers, so I have no idea how this router's problem is solved.  The manufacturer's support site for this router is really long and difficult to understand.  You'll need to contact them for help after you've tried to troubles shoot the problem and they won't be able to help you any further.  Buyer beware.  If you don't know what your router is capable of, don't buy it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an item I am not willing to use.  I have a new Panasonic DVD player that has a built-in CD player.  The player does a great job with CDs and MP3's.  But, for my own enjoyment, I want to listen to the songs I have on my CD player as well as listen to my DVDs.  So, I bought this antenna instead.  It's not much more expensive than the stock antenna, but I'm not willing (and can't afford) to pay for a new one when I'm done with this one.   I've seen other reviews stating the stock model is OK for the price, so I'll take that as a positive review, but it is not good enough to keep me from replacing this with the stock version of this antenna.  After a year of daily use, the antenna has become extremely fragile.  In addition, the signal quality is very poor.  This antenna would not work well with my HDTV or any antenna with more than about 5 watts output power.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this to use with my Canon Pixma 200 camera and the software it is running has very poor stability.

If you want a decent photo software to use on your camera, buy something else.  I will not be returning this unit

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't think the product will hold up to its name.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this item thinking it would be a better than my previous Canon charger.  The charger is very flaky and unreliable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I tried using the CD player on several computers, including my own. I found the product to be unreliable and not supported by the software, so I decided to replace the CD players with something else.  I ordered the D-T3V DVD player. I just received it and it works fine.  My only complaint is that I wish they included the AC adapter. I have to use the CD port instead of the built-in USB port, because the DVD player requires it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use the "S" model of this product, and when I try to use it, I get the warning that it is not compatible with my PC.  I was very disapointed, because the "A" model worked fine for my old Dell PowerEdge.  The "A", however, did not work for me and was returning it.  A simple check on Amazon's site would have resolved the issue, but it took me over a week to find out that this product does not work with PowerEdge products, even if it says that it does.  Amazon's technical support is lacking and I am not able to get any help with this product.  Don't waste your money on this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am disappointed with the purchase of this product, since I was hoping to receive a quality sound for my iPod. It is only okay, not as great as the CD player, and far less convenient than the CD changer.

The AT90 is a far better product, it's far more powerful and it has more memory, so I am very disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these to go along with my laptop and they didn't hold up at all.

The product is not as advertised, it will not hold a charge and does not have the capability to boot the computer to the OS you want.

I am sure that this problem can be solved in the future but I am so frustrated with the printer because it doesn't work. I will never buy another product from Amazon again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only positive review I can give this product is it is nice looking, but the sound quality is atrocious.  The sound quality isn't even comparable to the other Sony headphones that I had.  I will be looking for a different brand soon.  It doesn't matter how much money you spend on a Sony product, if it has a subwoofer, it is a big disappointment.  Sony's subwoofers are simply a waste of money.  Don't waste your money on them.  Buy something with a decent sound system instead

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this to listen to the radio, but found it to be more trouble than it was worth.  It would sometimes skip the stations (I wouldn't even know they were missing, they were just fading away and the next station would pick up).  I'm looking to return it now, but not being able to find a replacement.  I'll try and get one with better specs

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought 2 batteries at Target and used them in my laptop for 2 days. One failed within 1 month.  I returned it and bought the same battery at Amazon.  Don't buy these.  They are a waste of money.  Amazon sells for about $3.99 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product was not working in any way whatsoever. The power supply was too small, and so it is not even possible to use the "A" button. You can't even use the remote for anything else. I am so very dissapointed with this product. I will never purchase any Sony products again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You get a great picture with the Canon C700, but this is not the case with the C740.  The picture is not as sharp as the C700 and is less detailed.  There is no way to adjust the picture quality beyond what the manual provides.  I have had mine for less than a month and now I cannot use the "adjust" feature to get the picture sharper

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had to return it. The software that came with it is not user friendly, and doesn't work well with my laptop.  It is a pain in the neck to do anything with the software. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because it was advertised as being an antenna.  I have to agree that it is NOT an antenna - it is an antenna splitter.  The signal is NOT strong enough for me to be able to receive the signal from the broadcast station, so I will return it and buy something else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had a few of these and have found them to be unreliable. The speakers have a tendency to go out and sometimes the headphones won't be heard.  The sound is decent for the price but not great.  I'm returning the product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this in the mail today, but not the correct size. I ordered 2 pairs of ear buds and both came back with the wrong size ear buds, but with the same type of wires as the original pair I received.  The first ear buds arrived with two different lengths of wires, which I am assuming is the reason for the wrong sizes. I'm not going to waste my money on this product, since it doesn't even have a clear case to protect the ear buds from the scratches it gets. I have a new pair of earphones from Amazon and the case is great. It's clear and the only thing holding the ear bud in place is the strap. Amazon is selling them at a lower price than I'm paying for Amazon's ear buds! I'm going to throw away my Amazon ear buds 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this item because it was the best option at the time, but I can't believe I wasted my money on it.  It doesn't work well with my Sony DVD player and I can see a significant difference in the picture quality.  I'm just glad it's over $15. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had my P-Mate for two weeks now. The problem is that it will only record video when the player is turned off, and then only when the TV is off.  I do not have any problems with the P-Match, but it is a bad buy.  Don't buy this because it only works when you turn off your TV.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product, thinking that I would get the same sound quality as the Logitech C920.  The sound is not very loud and the speakers do not fit in my living room.  It is more like a glorified radio receiver.  If you want to listen to the radio in your living room, I suggest you get the Logi C920 instead.  Don't waste your money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only reason I bought this product was for the DVD recorder.  I just cannot use this product for my home entertainment.  Not enough room to plug it in, and it's way too small.  It's more expensive, but I will never use it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These CDs are just plain junk.  I wish they were made out of a higher quality product like the Sony CDPs.  The only reason why I didn't throw them out is because the software that is included with the program is so simple that I figured I could just leave it running to check if I've made a bad purchase.  It's a big pain to replace these CDs and I'm sure many others out there feel the same way.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  i bought this because my iPod didn't have a slot to put a mp3 player in, but it would not hold my mp3. i bought it because of the price and the fact that it's only a little smaller than the mp3 players I've been buying at the store. i really shouldn't have bought it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have a new printer, HP inkjet. I bought this product thinking it was an upgrade from my old inkjet, which was a Canon Pixma. After a few weeks of printing, I realized that it was actually the same inkjet as the Canon Pixmas. I contacted Canon customer service for advice, and they told me to use their "safe mode" in order to protect the printer from damage. I tried that for about a week, and it doesn't work anymore. I have now returned this product, as I am sure it is unsafe. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this product because it was cheaper than a higher end version. Unfortunately, it is very unreliable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered this antenna because the old one broke and it's so much easier to use one antenna.  However, the antenna is not as sturdy as the old antenna. The antenna is flimsy.  I had to use a small hammer to crack the plastic antenna in order to get it to work properly.  In addition, I'm a little disappointed with the sound.  The radio is very weak and can't get loud enough to receive the local stations 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this item for my son to use with his Sony MP3 player.  The unit worked for a while and then died.  I have since found that Sony no longer offers a replacement for this unit.  You will have to buy a different player if you want to use this one.  Do not buy this item if you plan on using the player with an MP3.  This unit is simply not worth the money if you intend on using it with an iPod or a digital device that does not support it.  It is a waste of money and time to have to return it when it will not work.  Don't waste your money on this item

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to use in my car.  The problem is that it doesn't work in all the cars I have.  I have a 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse with a factory radio that's installed with the navigation system.  My problem is the same: the radio just turns off and it doesn�t come back on, so I can't use it for the navigation, even though it's connected to the car's CD changer.  But the antenna is in the front, and I can see the antenna through the dash, so it's a little less visible to the driver.  This antenna isn't very good, and it just makes my car less safe, which I don't mind at all.  It could have been a problem with the car itself.  There's a good radio in the trunk, but it has an AM radio that works better, so this one is no longer needed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD player worked for about a month and then stopped working.  It was only when I tried to record CD's that it would work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound quality is fine.  But it has no ability to hook up your mp3 player, and it doesn't work for iPods with a 3.5mm plug.  I bought this because it would plug into my iPod with the 3.1mm plug, and work for the iPod.  It wouldn't hook up my iPod when it was plugged into my Mac, and I couldn't find a replacement iPod to replace the one that wouldn't work.  Don't waste your money on this unless you have an iPod with a plug and a 3-meter cable

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have owned these speakers for about a year.  The problem was they began to fail after only about a week.  I tried all of the different brands and brands of adapters to try and fix it.  None of them worked.  Finally I decided to get some other speakers that were less expensive.  They work better.  But the sound quality is still not as good as I was hoping.  It will be a while before I return these to Amazon 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am very disappointed with this product.  It does not fit my MacBook, which is a 14.1" MacBook.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this to hook my new Samsung DVD player up to my antenna.  Unfortunately, the antenna is very short.  The antenna has a very slight plastic wrap that the antenna can be attached to.  I don't know if this is just a manufacturing defect, or if this product is just not designed for this.  It is very easy to damage this product if you leave it too long without an antenna.The product is very cheaply made.  Do not buy this antenna if you want a solid antenna that can withstand the occasional short.If you plan to use this product, keep the antenna in the back of the antenna and do not use it all the time.  Don't expect a long antenna that will support an antenna for your entire house

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product was a complete disappointment.  The speakers sound very weak.  I had to use the remote control to turn them on and off, which is a hassle if you are trying to record something.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these as replacements for my old CD players that had burned up.  I have now purchased 2 more of these and am in the process of returning both of them.  The problem is that these do not burn CDs in the player.  They only play MP3's.  There are other brands that will burn CDs.  Amazon sells these for $10 each so I am sure that they will work just fine.  If you need to burn CDs, buy the CD burner that will only burn MP3s. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this for about a year now.  It has done everything but save the CD from scratches.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this thinking it was a good deal, but after one use, it is not.  The antenna is not strong enough to transmit the signal.

It would randomly power on when I was just a few feet away from it.  The sound is great, but I am concerned with the fact that it can't be powered on when there is no one around the house.  Also, if I try to power it on from outside the house, the fan is too noisy to be comfortable

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My TV died and I needed a replacement.  I bought this for a bad review.  The picture quality is very low and it only has 5 HDMI inputs.  You cannot get it to work as a receiver because you cannot control the volume.  It does not have an AUX input so it does not work as an external source to your receiver or sound system.  If you want to watch TV without being connected to your PC, this is a bad TV.  A better TV would cost at least $100.  My recommendation is to get a TV with a HDMI input and have it connected to a PC.  They both have HDMI inputs so it is easier to control them from your PC. I was very disappointed

Unfortunately, I have noticed a very high amount of RF interference with my cell phone.  I have tried different settings on my cell phones and the interference persists.  This card does not protect the phones from being damaged by the radio.  Do not buy this card if you plan on using your phone to listen to the radio or use it as a cell phone antenna.  The radio is an antenna and the antenna must be protected

The remote that comes with the player is VERY VERY flaky.  It does not respond when you press the "answer" button, and it will hang when you push it a long time.  Don't buy this player, unless you have a really good remote, and if you have to play CD's, make sure it has a "pause" function.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this radio because the previous owner had a small FM station, and this radio is a great price for the little FM stations I have, but I am having problems with the FM reception.  I have an AM radio, and I can hear the station, but not the commercials.  When I plug in the AM radio for the FM station that I hear, it gets an extremely weak signal.  In addition, the radio does not have a manual switch to select the FM stations for my station.  For a portable device with a FM radio, this radio would be a nice radio, but it is a big mistake to purchase it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these because of the great reviews on Amazon.  Unfortunately, they don't hold up to the claims that they are.  I can see the difference in picture quality between the pictures I get when I turn on the TV and the picture quality I get on my other TV.  One picture was fine and the other one was very blurry and not in focus.  It is very unfortunate that Amazon offers these for free, because they do not have a warranty.  If you have a lot of pictures that you don't want to lose, you should look elsewhere

I will be returning them, and I hope Amazon will be more reasonable with their replacement policy.  If you want to play DVDs, this is a horrible product to buy.  Don't buy this unless you know what you're doing.  I'm very sorry, but I won't be buying anymore from Amazon 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was a customer of these ear buds at the Amazon store and they did not work. The cord is not thick enough to make a good seal. The ear buds just break. Amazon was very rude about not replacing the broken ear buds and was not willing to refund the $40.00 I paid for them 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  the DVD player is a piece of junk.  I was looking for a cheap one, but the ones I found on Amazon.com had better picture quality and performance.  If you want to watch DVDs and CDs from a computer or other device, I suggest getting a DVD/CD changer with an optical disc player and an ethernet connection

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The headphones are uncomfortable and not comfortable, not recommended.  The cord is weak, and I have to constantly pull it out to get comfortable.  I will return the product.  There are cheaper options on the market, but they are not as comfortable as the Logitech ones 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this cable and installed the correct software. The sound quality is OK, but not up to par with the $30 iMOTION cable I have that is made by a different company.  The sound is louder and the bass is more distinct.  I would not buy this cable again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD player was not working.  I could play all the tracks on my CD player but not the rest.  The player is not able to handle any CD's in the CD tray.  You need to remove it from the tray and place it in the player to use the rest of the CD's 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this product in January and it was not working until today.  I have had this unit for about 2 months and have used it for about 15 hours a day.  It has performed perfectly fine, but is now not functional.  This is a bad item. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was a bad piece of kit. I used the new product in my Honda Accord for 2 months and had to replace it. I have had no problems with it but my car has suffered a total loss of memory. The original memory card was just as good as this one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought the card, had to return it due to an "unexpected failure" of mine.  Don't use this product unless you are comfortable with its performance.  My copy was the only copy of the game to work with this card 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this because I needed a phone for my girlfriend to use in her car.  It is not a phone.  The phone that came with it broke after a couple of months.  I am not a fan of the idea of using an expensive phone for personal use.  Not worth the extra expense 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this in store for $50 and it is not what I expected.  I have to keep calling customer service for support and it never gets fixed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this card to use my Sony printer and the card did not work on the Sony printer at all. The Sony printer worked fine with my old card, so I am really pissed off at this card. I am hoping the newer Sony products use this chip instead of the cheaper card with a generic serial number that does not work.I really didn't like this card and don't plan on using it again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had to return this product for a refund because the radio does not work on the CD player.  I was hoping to receive a refund for a bad book player.It is true that there is a small amount of interference when you try to listen to the radio through the CD, but it is negligible and far too little to make a difference.The CD player will work fine with the radio on the DVD player.I was really disappointed in the service I received from Amazon.  They sent me a new radio with no problems.  If Amazon will not stand behind their products and refund customers, then I will not buy from Amazon again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very skeptical about the idea of a DVD player that was so bulky, but this one is much heavier and more difficult to move around.  The sound quality is very bad and I can't really recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The iPod works okay, but it doesn't support the new FAT32 format. The iPod is also very heavy.  I would recommend you look at other options like the Shuffle or Nano. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product in May of 2005. I have used it to record several concerts and it was not working until June or July of 2005! I had to return it and buy another. The sound quality was awful.  If you want to record something without it turning off and freezing, do not buy this product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would not buy this product again. I returned it after 2 months of use. The CD player was working fine when I bought it, but when I plugged it into the wall for the first time I found it refused to play.  The manufacturer has no answers to this problem 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had the antenna for about two weeks now.  I don't have any problems with it at all.   I use it to listen to the local FM station, but it seems to have trouble picking up the higher-power stations.  It will sometimes pick up the lowest-powered station in the range, but not always.  In other words, if the station is really in the neighborhood of my house, I'll get a strong signal with this antenna.  But the strongest station in my neighborhood is actually about 100 miles away, in a town 30 miles away

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You will not find any positive reviews about this product. The sound quality is mediocre, but it does have a decent range and the price is reasonable.  If you are looking for an external drive that can record your DVDs and CDs, look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is not worth the money.  You will be replacing the batteries in it after 3-4 months.  I have one for my iPod Nano, and it is the same problem.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this because it is a great product and I would not buy anything else.  However, the only problem I have is that the volume knob is too small for my ears.  The knobs are quite small, but that is not an easy thing to get used to.  My other problem is that it does not work well for headphones.  If you plan to use the product for headphones, I would suggest buying the iPod adapter.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product to replace the previous one that I have had for years. The product is great, but the connection was very unreliable. I would have to turn it on and off several times a day to get the connection to work. The price for this product was reasonable, but it is a shame that it broke so easily. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been very pleased with the Sony mp3 player.  I am however very disappointed with this item because of the antenna that is attached to it.  The antenna is made of PVC and is NOT made of metal.  This antenna is very fragile.  It would break if the player is dropped on the floor.  Don't buy this item unless you really want to make sure your antenna is not broken!  I would suggest buying a different Sony mp4 player with an antenna made of steel

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't understand the hype that these headphones are better than the Beats Studio because I can't even use the headphones for listening to music.  The headphones sound pretty bad in general, especially for the price.  I would have been better off buying a Beats Studio at the same price as these, which are actually very good headphones.  It's a shame that I can not even use them in the car because the sound quality isn't nearly as good as the Beats.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my husband. He loves his CD player.  The buttons don't work well. The CD player's buttons do not have any resistance to being pressed.  We have had this for 2 months now and the buttons are getting more and more worn out.  I will not buy any more of these CD players.  Don't buy these CD Players!! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this because it was advertised as a USB hub.  It was not.  I had to return it and use a USB port on my computer for my USB hub instead.  This is a really big deal.  Don't waste your money on this one!  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have purchased and returned this product for one reason only. It is a little hard to plug in and it doesn't stay plugged in.  I also do not like the fact that I have to unplug it before using it.  It is very cumbersome and takes a while to set up.  Do not buy this product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this card, which is supposed to be compatible with a 1GB memory card, but when I tried to load some programs, the only one I could use was 1GB, which I don't have.I have had several other cards with this card and have always had the same problem with it.  Don't waste your money on this card.  I'm returning it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was expecting a better product than this.  I received the product, and after 2 months the unit was broken.  The sound quality is pretty decent for a $30 device, but I do not have the ability to turn it on.  Very frustrating, and I will be returning this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my wife's iPod Touch, and it's not as easy to use as the Apple products (e.g. the iPod Touch is much more intuitive to use).  The buttons don't click on and off the same way as the iPod touch does, and you have to do the same thing with the buttons on the iPod itself to use them.  Overall I'm just disappointed with the iPod product and don't have it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  i bought this because it is supposed to have all of the radio functions of my i-pod, i.e. FM, AM, AM/FM, FM/AM, FM stereo, AM stereo, and AM/AM. i am very disappointed. none of the functions work and are extremely unreliable. i have had it for 1 month and have still not received any sort of response from the manufacturer. i would not recommend this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am not very pleased with the product, the sound quality is not very good.  I would never purchase anything from Amazon again.  Amazon should be more sensitive to the customer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It is a nice looking piece but it has problems.  You can see the problem in the pictures.  I have had this for about a month and it is still working, but it is only half working.  The radio has a short range, so you cannot pick up the signals, and the speakers don't have much bass.  If you have a big television or radio antenna, this might be OK, but for small home appliances I would not buy it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The picture quality is excellent for the price, but the battery life is so short that you won't want to use it for anything more than a short time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The player itself is fine, but the speakers sound very bad.  The volume was too loud, and they tended to ring in the background.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This cable does not meet the specifications required for an iPod cable, as advertised on Amazon. The product description is incorrect.  I would not recommend this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD burner does not work properly.  I have had to return the unit because it does not burn DVDs that have more than 4 or 5 files.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It does not hold up to the standard of the Panasonic branded ones, but it is not as expensive as the others and it has a much better warranty 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It worked for my 5,500 rpm player, but it broke after 3 months of playing.  I had to buy new speakers because the one I had worked for 5,000 rpm.  The speakers are not made by Sony.  It looks like the speakers have been made by another manufacturer, but I can't be sure because I don't know the brand name of the speakers.  They have an extra wire hanging from them.  Don't buy this item unless you really need it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You have to pay $20.00 for this mouse. The mouse is made of cardboard and has no mouse wheel. There is no way to use the mouse wheel with a wheeled device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  i've had this for about 6 months now and it's a big piece of junk.  I've tried it with various printers and scanners.  the only ones that work are the HP ink cartridges.  i have also tried with the HP Color LaserJet, which is a real piece of crap.  but i've also tried the HP LJ2000, which does work.  now i just have to find a better printer.  if you're looking to get this printer for $40 you may as well spend $60 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD-R drive did not work with my Sony camcorder, which was running at a resolution of 720x480.  I bought a different brand for $5.00 at a local electronic device store, which worked fine with the camcorders and which I will keep.  The drive was useless for recording pictures.  It was impossible to eject and transfer pictures in case of power failure.  Don't buy this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only positive review about this product is it has the capacity to store the CD, but it does not have the capability to store all the files on the CD. I have had the product for only one month and I have already had to write one negative review.The fact is that if I use this product to hold my CDs in the same fashion as the player, it will store only about 5% of the files, which is about half the capacity of the player. For example, my CD has about 30MB of music, which has not been saved to the player at all. The player will store the rest of the music in the internal hard drive, which, by the way, does not hold any more than 30MB 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't waste your money on this product, unless you want a bad case. I used to have the original one that was fine and I would buy it again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product at Amazon because the other reviews here are all positive.  It is an MP3 player but it is not an iPod.  I am sure it is a iPod if you plug it into an iPod and use the player.  The only positive review is that it works with the iPod, but the product is not compatible with the older iPod Nano.  So if you plan to use this product with an iPod Nano, I would suggest getting a third-generation iPod nano 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't know what the difference is between the two of these, but the only way to use the optical drive in Windows is to press the eject button to get it out of the system, then use the cd burner function to burn the disc to the optical disk, and then use Windows Explorer to view the CD in the software.  If I were you, I'd take a more expensive player with an optical drive so you can burn your disc to a cd and use the player as a player.  I've seen no indication that the optical is actually an optical disk in Windows.  The player only recognizes discs on the disc burner, so you'd have to burn your discs as well to get them to play.  It looks like an optical burner to me 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought these for my wife's new laptop. The only positive review I can give is that it is a compact size and that it has an antenna which can pick up FM and AM stations and HDTV stations.  The problem is that the software is not user friendly and it will not allow you to adjust the antenna for better reception.  My wife was in the car with the radio on for over an hour while we drove to an FM station in another town. I had to turn it off and restart the software to see if it worked again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very excited when I found this little thing for my Canon PowerShot S9500 camera.  It seemed to work well with my new Panasonic S9510.  However, after some time it started losing connection to my Panasonic S90X and I had to turn off the Panasonic camera so that it could connect to the new Panasonic camera.I've been through many other brands of "mini USB" cards and none of them worked with my Panasonic.  I'm a newbie at electronics and I've been buying brand new equipment and new cables.  So if anyone else has this card, it might be worth looking at Amazon or at eBay 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these because I wanted something that would last longer and hold up to the constant scratches on my laptop. Unfortunately, they are not worth the money. The only positive review I can give them is that they do not make a mess, which is very important to me. The scratches are noticeable, however, and will wear out your mouse. I will never buy these again, unless I get rid of them and buy a mouse from Amazon (which I will). 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because I wanted to have a radio that was smaller than my old PDA, and I wanted the ability to have it with me when I was driving, so I wanted something with less cables.  The PDA does have the ability, however, to have the radio on your dash and a CD player on the back.  I was a little disappointed to see that this radio does not have the FM radio function.  However, the CD player does have a built in FM transmitter, so that's a plus, though not a necessity.  In terms of the ability of this radio to transmit FM, I am not sure how that works.  Maybe it's something to do with the transmitter, but I cannot get it to transmit over the air, and the FM transmitter itself is not built into the radio itself.  That's not a big deal, however.  If you don't care about FM, this radio is a great choice, and there are plenty of other radios with built in AM radio capability, but for the price, I'd say it's a step back 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this item because I needed a DVD player and wanted to record DVDs.  Unfortunately it does not play DVDs with any quality at all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had a Dell laptop that was starting to fail and i needed a new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product does not work. The video is out of sync and it is very annoying to have to replace the battery so often.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to replace my old iPod with a smaller size. I was very disappointed in the lack of features of the original.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It does work, but only if you have a brand new modem. The customer service rep told me I needed a newer modem, which is a lie. I have been told to return the modem, and Amazon is doing it for me.  Don't buy this product. It is junk.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is a little expensive but I am not buying this because of the sound quality.  It's not great.  I have the stock cable and the speakers are not very loud. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very small product. I got it in two pieces and it is just barely bigger than the battery holder on the back of the unit. The sound is very poor and not very loud. The only positive review about the product is the fact that it does have the ability to store an extra battery. However, I do not recommend this product because it is very bulky, and the instructions do not give you the option to put a new battery in it, which is very important when buying batteries to use with this product. It is a shame that such a good electronic device would be made in such a small package. The product will eventually break, but the only way it will break is if you drop it on its side or it gets caught on something. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received the product only 4 days after the delivery.  I expected to receive the product by the next day.  The product has no functionality.  Do not purchase from Amazon, as they do not deliver timely

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this battery because I'm looking for an alternative to my Canon Epson 6500.

The 6500 is more than twice the price, and is much better in the long run

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered this radio and was very disappointed.  I received the product very quickly but it did not work.  This was due to the fact that the radio's antenna is so short.  If you have a short antenna, this radio is a total waste of money.  It would be nice if this product was better. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this cable at Amazon for my son and was hoping that it would be more than an occasional use item. I was very disappointed. I have a Canon printer, but the print heads are often switched off. The printer now has a hard time printing in low light. It's hard to believe this is the same cable I bought for the Canon printer at Amazon 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very disappointed with the product. I have not had any problems since I installed it, but the sound quality is sub-par. I am looking at getting rid of it as I do not like the sound of this product. It is loud and I have to listen at least 15 minutes before I turn it off. I would rather not have it if it was less loud. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have to say I've had problems with this product in the past.  One time it broke my power cord and I couldn't get it to turn on again.  I just wanted something to replace my old power cord because the power cord on this one broke.  That is why I bought this item instead of the generic brand name that is included in the box.  It would have cost me a few bucks to get the generic power cord 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only negative review I have about this product is that the antenna does not seem to be strong enough to get signal out of the building, especially for FM.  The antenna does seem to pick up a signal quite a bit better with the antenna mounted on the wall of the apartment, however. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because it was the cheapest, but the picture quality is horrendous! I have to reset it and use the "HDMI reset" feature to get it to work, otherwise I have problems with the TV.  I have a Panasonic plasma, and I cannot get the TV to connect to it! It has to be turned on and off with the remote, or it is always in the "off" position. It is not even "on" because the picture is always too blurry and the TV will turn itself off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've used the card with 2 of the Panasonic CF-6600's in my Canon PowerShot SD30.2 (with the other in a Canon Powershot P600).  The cards did not work with the P600.  The CF-2600 was fine, and worked with the Powershot SD30, but it did not have any trouble with the CF-9600 card, which worked with both the P6000 and P600 with no problems

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this product for about a month now.  The sound is ok, but not great.  It's a little hard to use the remote because of the sound, and it is hard to find the "stop" button.  I've had to return it because the volume is too loud for the room.  Now I have a new Sony ear bud for my iPod.  What a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a bad product. You will have to take your TV to a store to return this one. The picture is very small.  The sound is also very tinny and barely audible. The battery life is only 2-3 hours on a charge.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is not as advertised. I am a heavy electronic device user, and I can not use the "up to 20" in the manual.  The only option I can find is to call in a tech. I will not buy a "up-to-20" product from Amazon, this is a joke.  Amazon should be ashamed of their products.  I will be looking elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The headphones themselves were fine, but the ear-pad broke and the headphones were useless.  I returned the headphones and bought a different pair of headphones.  Do not buy these if you want to use them with a computer.  The sound quality is not comparable to the better headphones I have, and they will break easily.  If you are looking for headphones that will hold up to a laptop, look elsewhere

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have an HP Pavilion, which I have since purchased and installed.  It is an HP Media Smart Hub.  The hub has 2 Ethernet ports and a single USB port.  I had 2 problems.  One is that the USB ports are only accessible when the laptop is powered on, so I have to plug in the power cable first.  My second problem is that when I unplug the power cord, the laptop stops functioning for about 20 seconds to a minute.  If I plug in and then back it up while it is on, the power will still be on but I won't be able to access the network.  HP needs to do something about the ports so that I can plug in while the laptop sleeps.  They are both very difficult to plug into.  Other than that, the hub is OK.  There are only a few of them so I can't complain too much. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product was shipped in a very damaged condition. It is not usable for the purpose it was intended for. The sound quality is a huge disappointment. The speakers were very poorly built. They do not fit my ears well. The microphone is not sturdy enough to withstand the abuse I am giving them. The buttons are not as easily accessible as the controls on other speakers I have purchased.  The only positive review I have about this product is that the box it came in is a great deal cheaper than the others I have received.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these because they had a great review, and they are...  only moderately effective.  I can get more than half a song with the first tune.  So I guess it is just not worth the money.  Don't buy these if you want a decent CD player 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The iPod nano has a very small case. The screen is not quite as big as the ones in my other iPods. I have been able to use the case to protect the speakers. It is very difficult to turn the iPod into its case when it is sitting on the floor because it does not stay secured in its case.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used the product to record my husband's DVD collection and then transferred them to my Mac using Media Composer.  It works but not very well.  I have not yet used it to record a full DVD, but it would have been very easy to do so.    I had a similar product from Amazon.  The only difference is the Amazon product came with a DVD player and a DVD burner.  Amazon's product was a complete failure.

There is no way to get it to work if you have the manual for the mouse on your desk in front of you.  The software is totally out of date.  It is also very slow.  A friend of mine told me that if he did the same thing he would have problems with this mouse.  So I bought another mouse.If you want to use a mouse with this, buy something else

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this for my new printer.  I have a HP 705 and it has the usual "quicker" scan speed.  This scanner, however, does not recognize the print head when it is turned on.  In order to turn it on, I had to first hold the scanner with my hand.  The scanner's screen is very small and hard to read.  However, it does scan fine on the regular HP printers that I have.  It is, however VERY slow on the HP printer.I wish HP would make a faster scanner 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was expecting a better product.  I bought it thinking that it would be able to hook up to my PC and I needed it to work.  What a disappointment!  I have had my Powerline for almost 2 months and I have not yet had it work with any of my Windows software.  The drivers are very slow to update.  They are even slower with the latest Windows 7 version.  If I have to buy a new one, I'll buy something more expensive and be more satisfied 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these to replace an old pair of CDJs.  They worked fine for a few weeks, then started losing reception and became unplayable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product was very cheap, however its performance was very poor.  It would not work on the first attempt with an SD card and it would not let me copy any files over the network.  I returned it as soon as I received it and bought a more expensive product from Amazon.  The only reason I gave a bad review about the product is that Amazon charges a very high price for its product

The ICX is also less expensive than this, and is far more convenient to use

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this cable for my iPod, and it worked for about 1 week before it started degrading in quality.  I returned it, and now the quality is horrible.  My iPod now needs an external stereo system to get sound.  The product description was fine, but the cable was not made for an iPod and I could not get any sort of warranty from Apple.  You need to purchase the Apple product for an Apple iPod, as the one made for your iPod does not have the same specifications as the iPod.  If you buy this cable from Amazon, Amazon will give you an iPod to return, but I wouldn't buy this if you have an iPod that does not work with this cable.  It is worth it to buy the cable if you are looking to get an iPod from Amazon and not have to worry about the quality.If you buy a different cable than this, it may work for 1 week, but it may cost more.  Amazon has a bad customer service.  Buyer beware.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The case has a very small storage compartment that does not fit any hard drives.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this because my wife and I are both wireless networkers.  We got it together with an AT&T 4G phone.  The phone worked OK, but then it died after a couple months, probably because of the weak battery.  You need to buy an external power pack or a battery charger if you want to keep it running.  Don't buy this one if you don't plan to keep the phone connected for more than a few days.  I would not recommend this to anyone

I can see and hear it, but when I am in the camera's menu and use the volume up/down buttons, I can't hear anything at all.  I also have the power cord connected to my Macbook and it's a little noisy.  My only complaint is that the cables are quite thin, so I'll probably end up replacing the battery with an AC power cable next time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product itself works for the first few days, but after that it stops working.  I don't have any problem with the sound or the fact that it is so cheap.

It's an absolute pain in the ass to use because it can't even read the info anymore when it starts.  For a $15.00 card, I expect it to be functional.  If you have a high-end card, you might get away with buying this one, but for everyone else, this is a complete waste of money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This radio works fine, but is not very user friendly.  You have to have your own antenna to use this radio.  It doesn't come with a battery charger and you have to buy a battery if you want to use it on a longer trip.  I'm not too big on the small radios, but this is an expensive mistake.  My radio is on the back of my car.  The antenna is only 30 inches from the ground so I'm really not worried about the reception.  There are better radios that cost half the price.

I had an excellent electronic device with the X5, but I still bought this because it was advertised as having an MP3 jack. Unfortunately, the unit does not have an MP2/Ethernet jack. I would have been much better off if this product had an MP1/EVERYTHING jack, which would make it an MP5 or MP3.

The first time I plugged in this card, it just made a horrible screeching noise as if it was trying to start the computer.  It's now taking about 30 seconds or so to start up and work, and then it crashes.  Very frustrating!  I had the same card for 5 months, and it started working properly again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The case was a little big, but other than that it is OK.  The only thing I can think of is that it doesn't stay closed all the time, which is probably a design flaw.  If you want to use the keyboard and mouse, this is a bad case.  I have one of the smaller ones and it is fine.  But if you want a larger case that can protect your mouse, you might want to consider this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product has some problems. The DVD player itself is ok, but the included software is not working. I will try to fix this in the next few days. The player itself, however, has some serious problems when it comes to DVD playback. The software crashes on almost all DVDs, even the most recent ones (i.e. the DVD player is from 2005). I do not know what this is all about, but it's annoying. If you are looking for a DVD player that works well, this is a bad buy. I would not buy this player again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an aftermarket product. I don't know if they are really that cheap, but this product does not work.  It's only a black screen, not a picture.  I'm sure there are better options out there, but at least they don't have this problem.  If I could return this item, I would

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It's great to have a DVD player but they can't get it to play all of the DVDs I have.  The only way I can get them to play my DVD's is to use a copy of Windows Media Player in XP.  I have had two different brands of DVD player with the same problems.  If you like Windows Media player, you might want to avoid this brand. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I tried the same thing as a friend and it did not work for me.  I am very dissapointed because this thing was very easy to install.  What happened is the software did not support the USB connection to my printer, which is why I couldn't get it to work 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm a Mac user and I wanted to have a DVD player that would play all my DVDs. I decided to get this because it was so cheap.  What I did not expect was to find that it would not play DVDs if I put a brand new DVD into the player and it was not formatted properly 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my husband and he loves it, but the remote is useless. I would suggest the Mophie, because it has more buttons. It's a big difference in how the remote works

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very disappointed to receive the item I ordered. I have had no problems with it, but I will be returning it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The player worked for the first week, then stopped playing.  Don't waste your money, get something better 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because the previous ones I had had the problem of being too hot to use with a small case.  I don't want to be using my new laptop in such a hot environment, so I bought the case with the intent of making it less hot to wear.  It is a great idea to do so, but I was wrong.  The heatsink is just as thick as the other one, but it does not cover the bottom of the laptop.  If I put it on the back of my laptop it gets a lot hotter, and I am very uncomfortable wearing the case because it makes me sweat.  Don't buy it if you want to wear your laptop in a hot area 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The item is very cheap.  I will not purchase again.  It's very unreliable.  Do not buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  i don't understand why the manufacturer didn't change the case type to anodized plastic, as there is a huge difference in durability when using anodize vs. leather.i bought this cable because it was a good deal, but it doesn't have enough signal strength to justify the purchase. i just wish i hadn't spent so much money to purchase it when i had the option of just buying the cheap cable i already had.i was not able to get any support or assistance from LG.i am so disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I tried to mount the item in the car, but it did not fit in the dash.  If it fits in the trunk, it may fit into the dash if the trunk is opened.  It is hard to tell in the pictures whether the item will fit in a trunk.  I would not recomend this item to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product arrived late and we were not pleased with it. We couldnt use the sound unless the CD player was powered on. i tried several different CD players and none of them worked. this product is a total joke.  We will never purchase any other brand of CD player again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first thing I noticed is the sound quality. I have an HDTV and this speakers produce pretty poor sound, and even worse with the bass.  I thought maybe I needed to adjust the speakers or maybe something was wrong with my TV but they didn't work any better with my HDTV than my other speakers.  The second thing I didn't like is that the speakers don't come with any carrying case or the included cable.  If you don't want to take your speakers on the road or want to use them as a media player, buy something else.  My suggestion to Sony would be to take a close look at this product and do a better job making them stand out to potential buyers 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had my PDA for almost 4 years now.  It has been upgraded with newer components and it still works fine, but is a lot of trouble to use and not very fast.  The first time I tried to use it with the latest version of Microsoft XP, the program froze and would not save the screen.  I had to reboot it.  This problem was solved with the upgrade to XP Professional and now it works great.  However, I would not recommend this product.  In the future, I will use a Canon product instead 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this player because I thought the other one I had was ok, but it does not work very well with the iPod. I've tried all sorts of things, from changing the iPod from the CD player to my MP3 player, to my computer, and have finally settled on the iPod version. The player works OK with the other player, but with this one it does NOT work.  The player won't hold the iPod, and the player will turn off after 30 minutes of not holding it.  I have a Mac mini, and it will NOT hold the player if I unplug the USB cable and plug the player back in.  You'll have to have both the player and iPod plugged in to be able to use the iPod's.  If you don't mind paying $20 to have it fixed, this is a good player.  Otherwise, stay away from this player 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product was not usable until i got the 2GB card.  If you plan to use it as a 2GB, make sure you get the 2 GB card before you buy this product.  I have had no luck with this product so far.  It has not worked with any other cards.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The case was very small, not adjustable at all, and not very well made 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only reason I bought this for is the ease of setting up my wireless network.  The antenna is of poor quality and has not delivered any signals at all.  If you want to keep the wireless connection going, buy something better 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the player for Christmas, but only played one song before the battery ran out. I returned it and bought a rechargeable batteries, but when I tried to charge them, I got a warning that they could not be used in the car, since it was so cold in the trunk. The batteries last longer if the car is cooled down a little bit. The player is not very loud, but it's not very quiet either. The only redeeming factor is that the batteries are included, which is a nice touch 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit does not come with any instructions.  There are many reviews saying that you must plug in the charger and then plug in your CD player to charge it.  I have not seen this instruction anywhere else and am not sure if it is included with the unit or not.  For example, I plug the charger in and it tells me that I need to plug the player in before the charger will charge.  Plugging in the player after the charger has charged it will NOT activate the CD player or anything else connected to it.I did my research before purchasing and found that other sites have had similar problems with this product.  You will not get your money back 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my new mp3 player and it is very slow, very unprofessional.  I've tried many different mp3 players on the net and none have been this slow.  The sound is OK, but the fact that it does not have a power plug is a big mistake.  Don't waste your money on this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this printer because it was advertised as being "seamless" (i.e. not glued together). I expected it to be. I was disappointed to find that it was not.  The only difference is that the front panel is held together by screws rather than by the "plastic" that is usually glued together.  I have a Canon Epson HP 8400 and it does not have any problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am extremely disappointed with this product.  I've had it for a month and it still doesn't work.  It seems to be in an endless loop, so if you have a problem, just try to restart it or the software.  You will get no help 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had this for a few months now and it has only made a dent in my laptop, not enough to warrant replacing. I was hoping it would last longer than that.  I wish I had a better option because it does sound great for it's price 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The batteries in this product are a disappointment.  The unit lasted for just 2 months before needing to be replaced.  We have tried to find another battery that works.  It's impossible to find one that will hold a charge, let alone last long enough to last you 10 months or more 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was expecting a lot more than the 50 MBit/s that is advertised. I expected that the player would be able to record to an external drive, which would be stored and ready to play right away. The player does not have an SD card slot, so I am unable to use it to record and play back the recorded files to an SD. The DVD player is not connected to any of my digital cameras, so there is no way of checking the quality of the video I'm recording 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an OK case, but it's really hard to open and close because it has no case clips. I'm not an electronic device connoisseur, so I was surprised when I opened the case and found that it had not been properly closed with case clips! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product in hopes that it would work for my iPod but it does not work on my iPod because of a bug in the software that is required to support the iPod.  If you are buying this product and want it to work for your iPod, be very careful 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this for my kids who were on their way to college. The sound is not very clear. The TV's volume controls are not intuitive and it takes several tries to get them to work.  Don't waste your money, get something better! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit is fine, but its software is awful. The default version is a pain to use. The programs are hard to find and it will sometimes crash when I try to change something.  I have been told that it has an older software so I'm being cautious.  My next unit will be a Panasonic DVP-R20. It will be cheaper 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have a Canon Epson V750 and it is a beast.  I am constantly losing it, it can not hold any more than 20-25 photos and it cannot transfer to a Mac with iTunes.  This thing can only do what I have programmed.  The transfer speed is very slow and sometimes I have to do manual work to get it to transfer.  Very disappointing.  But if I have some other card in the slot it can work.  So I'm out of luck with this product.  What a rip-off.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The radio seems to be OK, but not very reliable.  The reception is not consistent across the city.  I have had no luck in finding a radio that is more reliable.It is a shame that I can't give this item a good review 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm so disappointed with this product. I would not recommend this product for any electronic device. It does not work very well with an i7 laptop, and I was very disappointed with its lack of support for the optical drive I purchased for it. The only reason I gave it three stars is because I will gladly take it back if I can get it to work with my i7, which it does, but it's a hassle 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I tried this product out and it is very difficult to get a signal with it.  I was able to get it to transmit just slightly over the 5Mhz limit but it is still not enough for me.  The signal strength was not that great.  Not much useable at all 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this item as a backup, but it is useless. I can only do a few songs. I do not recommend this product, unless you plan on using it every day. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been using this product for a year now and I have to say I am very disappointed with it.  It's a very simple product to use, but the volume control does not work.  The volume is fine, but it is not adjustable.  I also have to remove the antenna and the connection to the computer.  All of the other functions work fine but this is the only thing that does not.  You have to constantly reset the volume to keep it from falling below zero 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for something to hold my iPod, and had no other options. I thought I'd give it a try, and was very disappointed. The case is not made of leather and the headphones are very uncomfortable, making it difficult to get them on.  I have a large Sony mp3 player and this is not a viable solution 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was hoping that this would be the difference in the range and reliability of my router.  I got it for $75 on Amazon, and it was worth $20 less at Best Buy.  However, it's really no better than the Linksys I've used in the past for my ISP.  This router is really a step backwards for the money, since they offer better features and better performance than the TP-Link model.  My advice to you is to avoid this one.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't waste your money.  Donate it to the "others" at Amazon or Wal-Mart and save your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had this card for about a month and now it is dead.  I am not happy with it because it does not work at all with my new Dell laptop and it is a big pain to use.  Also, it was very slow, I could barely use it for an hour and 20 minutes and then it would hang and refuse to power up again.  If you want to use it with your new Dell, get a Dell card instead of this one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had to return my mouse because of the poor trackpad.  I've had a few of them in the past and all had terrible trackpads.  If you are looking for a mouse with a good trackpad, get a Logitech one instead 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this printer for 2 years now.  I tried to use the software to print in color, and it was very difficult.  It prints black, white, and green.  You can get the green color from the pictures, and the black color is so faint that it barely shows in the picture.  My wife is very disappointed with this printer.  Don't waste your money on it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received a defective product.  The instructions for installing the software were incorrect.  I have been advised by Sony to return it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only positive review I have about this product is that it was very easy to use and the sound quality was ok.  The fact that the microphone does not record audio at all is a real bummer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this item because I had a Toshiba laptop that would not hold a charge while running on the external power.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This DVD burner worked for a while, but it got slower and I stopped using it.  It doesn't have any protection against a virus so you might want to use a more expensive brand of burner, which is why I purchased a brand new one from Amazon.  If you want to burn DVDs, I would recommend an A/V Media A/v DVD Burner (or equivalent).  The burner on this unit is a piece of junk, and I am now using the Amazon brand burner.  Don't waste your money on Amazon - their product is inferior to the Media-X brand DVD burner 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this as a spare power supply to keep my old power supply at work, since I needed a new power supply.  I was not impressed.  It didn't hold a charge, and the unit was a little loud at high volume.  Overall I wouldn't buy it again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am not sure why the item is so cheap...it is not very nice.  It only has a 3.5mm jack.  The microphone is not great.  I wish I could return it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because the picture quality was great with my Canon S110c.  But when I switched to the Canon S400c I started to get "jelly-scanning" artifacts.  It's a very slow image quality, I got about 2 frames per second.  I would recommend you get the Canon product instead of this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered this cable from Amazon.com.  It did not arrive as promised.  Amazon refused to refund the money.  I called Amazon customer service.  Customer service said they cannot refund the product because they don't have the correct number of connectors.  They said they would ship the correct amount of connectors to me.  A total of 6 connectors were sent to me, but the 6 connectors I received did not have any plug on them.  If you buy this cable, don't buy the ones they sent to you 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these earphones and they did not work with my Sony Sony MDR1X.  I contacted Sony tech support and the representative told me the earphones will only work with Sony MDP1X units.  Don't waste your money and buy the MDP2X which has a better sound.  The Sony MMP2X is not as comfortable as the Sony MDF1X earphones. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only negative review I can give this product is that the volume control does not work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is not worth buying. I just used it and it is very unreliable. The sound is great if you can get it working, but when I tried to connect it to my stereo, it wouldn't work.  I'm very disappointed in this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this CD player after looking at other brands at the price. The player is in a state of disrepair.  It works for a few minutes then it turns off.  I have a Sony player that is in great shape and the sound is excellent.  The player has a slight blue tint to it when you turn it on.  If you do this on the road you may be safer than if you were to use the player on your own car.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product works for the first 2 weeks then stops working. I called Sony and they said they have not received any complaints from anyone with this product.  I don't know what the problem is, if it is a bad motherboard or if the product is defective.  If you have a new one, try it out first and if it works you may be able to get a replacement at a reasonable price 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This printer is not made for printing.  If you want to print photos, it would be fine.  However if you want a printer that can print lots of photos per hour, then this one is a joke.  It takes 10 minutes to print a photo, and then another 30-60 minutes to take it to a photo booth, where you have to stand still, and you cannot even turn the printer on.  The only reason I bought it was because it was the cheapest printer I could find in store.  I would never buy another brand.  Save your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this cable for my ipod, and it did not work out. I have since bought the cable to use with my iPod 5G. It is a much better deal to buy the $4.99 cable from Amazon that I had in the first place.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this memory to replace my old ones that were broken. The only problem I had with the old ones was that they didn't hold my photos well enough. This memory does not hold well enough for me to be able to edit my photos without losing them. The first problem I ran into is that I need to plug in the memory at least twice a day, and that is the problem with the second problem.  It takes at least a half an hour to edit one photo, so if I leave it unattended for even a few minutes, I'm sure I'll lose it.  I tried the "just press the power button for a few seconds" method, but that didn't work, so I had to return it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It's ok if you want to plug it into your power supply and have it go through your computer.  But if you have to power up your computer every night just to turn it on for its first time, this product won't work.  The AC line is too short to keep it plugged in 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It does the job.  If you want to save a little money, try something else.  I purchased this to replace the DVI port on my HP Pavilion 1520 and it was a complete waste of money.  My HP Pavilion has the HP Linkport.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this printer, which was supposed to be great.  But it really isn't.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use this phone for the occasional call.  I've had several problems with it.  First, it doesn't work when the dialing pad is set for the number I want.  Second, it cuts out and comes back on.  Third, the phone sometimes gives out an annoying ring.    I don't use it anymore.  The only reason I bought it was because it was advertised as a replacement for my broken Panasonic.  It's not.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You will get through many boxes but one box is in the case when you open the case. The bottom of the case does not allow you to get in the front to remove the battery (this is a major drawback if you use it in an apartment or an older house).  You must also remove the batteries from both sides of the box to get access to the batteries.  The case is also hard to use with your fingers and if you drop it the battery can get broken

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a terrible piece of equipment. I will never purchase another iPod unless I have the original iPod with me.  I have a second iPod with my wife and it is a great product.  The only way I can get this to work is to buy an external CD player that is also an iPod.  If you want to keep this iPod, buy an iPod case.  You can't see the internal CD player unless you have an iPod with you

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've tried it with my Dell PowerEdge R700 and it was not as fast as the other HP printers.

Don't waste your money

I bought this product thinking that it would help me get rid of my iPod but it has not worked for me 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would not buy this unless they were in stock.  I'm just one person that bought this because of the fact that the iPod was so easy to put into my car's iPod slot.  After 2 months and no complaints, I have now had to return it.  It is very difficult to hold the iPod in place when it is upside down in the slot, and the buttons are very small.  For the price I paid, I expect to be able to use the iPod with the case attached.  Now I am looking for another brand of iPod that is less expensive 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't waste your money on this product.  If you have a small room (or a low end mp3 player) then you will probably get more bang for your buck with a better quality mp3 device from Amazon.  The product is not as advertised.  I would not recommend it.  It is very flimsy and hard to use.  Don\'t buy this unless you want to be embarrassed to have this product in your house.  Amazon could have put it together better 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My printer worked for a while but stopped working the second I turned it on and it stopped printing the first page.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is an overpriced product, its hard to get the battery out. I am now looking for a better one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was a mistake.  I bought the $50 package of these for my wife and the software didn't recognize them and I had to return them.  So, don't waste your money.  It is a little awkward to use because it is quite heavy and the controls are not easy to get to at first.  Also, when you plug in your phone, it will go into the wrong mode and you will have to reset it to the correct mode to use it again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the only thing i have not been able to get to work for my new Sony Vaio.  I am having to return it.  It appears to be the only one of the "computers" to have this problem 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my item a few days ago and i'm having problems.  I've had the product for less than a week and I've experienced no issues with it.  Now I'm having issues with the software that is running.  There are many different kinds of software on the product and some of them are not very user friendly.  If you are not a computer expert you might be in for a long time waiting to get a replacement because there are no support options on the site 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for a good mp3 player for my daughters birthday.  The one I got is a lot less reliable than I expected and the sound quality is awful.  I will be returning it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would not recommend this product to anyone. It has the same issue as my previous Sony MP3 player which I returned. The unit works fine in the iPod, but when I use it in the car, it does not work at all.  I will return this item. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was not too impressed with the price, but I did receive a good electronic device.  The problem was that it did not work well with the SD card I purchased from Amazon.  I have had it running on my Mac for a few days and it does work, but it is not very stable.  Amazon will not help you get a replacement.  Buy something else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It took forever to sync my CDs with my CD changer, and then my discs were useless for the rest of the week.  I returned it, and am planning on buying a brand new product.  It is worth the money to buy a player with the remote, but the CD changers on this unit are a joke.  The buttons are hard to use, the menus are cumbersome, and the remote has to be placed right on top of the unit to use it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this at the end of the month because I was going to use it for a DVD burner.  I was not very impressed with the product.  The color output is terrible.  It is not even remotely usable for DVD burning.  My DVD player is a Sony VHS1000.  So I was expecting better from this product.If you do not have a DVD player, this is probably a good electronic device.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had two of these units in the past year, both of which have been lost.  It was one of those things that I just didn't know what else to do, so I just put in the replacement units from Amazon and kept on doing the same thing.  I did a little research and found that these units are "no go" with the "safe mode" option in Windows XP.  So I turned off the safe mode option, and it did not work for me.  Not a big deal, but I just wanted to be sure that I had disabled the safe-mode feature in my Windows XP machine.  Also, since these units do not have the "power management" feature, you cannot use the power button on these units to turn them off - it must be done with a "power saver" software package.  Finally, I find that Amazon's service is very slow, even for their free stuff - so it may be a bad bookkeeping device that Amazon has (or the software).  I wish Amazon would do a better job of fixing these units if they get lost

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You can't expect to get anything useful from this card when you do not use a CD player.  The video is terrible and is quite slow to encode.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this item hoping to replace the stock antenna, however the reception is not better. The reception is better on the $10 antenna, but the reception on this one is horrible.  I am leaving this item because I have better alternatives 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought these to replace my old Sony CDX200 which died after a year and a half. They work well for the first few weeks and then become less reliable.  After that it takes forever to play a CD. I bought an extra one so that I could use the first one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The speakers don't work at all.  I have been told by my electronics tech that they were out of warranty and that I could return them.  What a waste of time.  The only thing is they don't come with the power supply so I needed to buy that.  Other than that the speakers don' t do much.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this for my Sony PVM900, and I was not impressed.  I have tried the other brands of headphones and none have been as bad as the Sony PVMs.  They sound worse than the PVM 900.  The ear pads are uncomfortable and are not comfortable to wear.  These do not have a good isolation from the ear when playing music, and they also have a problem with distortion that can be very audible.  Also, there is a problem playing the CD that comes with this set.  When I turn on the CD player, it doesn't work, and when I shut it off, it reverts to the "normal" sound that comes from the player, which is pretty annoying when it happens every time.  It seems like this product is a big gamble for Sony because it seems to have very few advantages over the PVMS.  Don't waste your money on these! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't have the best luck with electronic devices so I really don't like this product.  I have had mine for over a year now and have had trouble getting it to work.  It has all the buttons on the back.  So what if it didn't have them all?  The problem is the radio.  If you do not have the radio you cannot use this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This thing worked great in the beginning.  Then it started breaking up and becoming unusable.  I returned it for a new one and it worked fine for the first week.  The second week it started doing funny things and making noise.  We've had it for over a month now and it has now broken.  Don't buy this unless you know what it is and how to use it.  It is made for a different type of device

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this for my wife's laptop, and I must say that it is a total waste of money. I had the case on a few days, and my laptop still does not work. The case seems like it could hold a ton more air, but it doesn't. I have it in the closet because it's not the air that's the problem, but if I were to have to buy a case, I'd buy the one with the holes instead 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't buy this because it will not work on a Windows XP machine. It will work on XP, but it will never load an mp3 into it and you will have to start it from the command line.  I've used many other products, including HP products, and the difference in sound quality is noticeable. This is a big waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product because of the high-end price and I was a little disappointed.  The sound is very thin, not very detailed, and the speakers aren't very loud.  I don't have much to compare it to, but it was just as weak and not as loud as the Sony stereo.  It also has an RF antenna which is a real problem.  You can't use the FM radio because it is so weak and inaudible.  If you want to use the TV and the CD player, this is a no-go.  A good product: the sound is good, but the speakers are too small to use for a small home studio.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  the battery does not last as long as I expected, I'm still using it to charge my phone.  I bought it because it was advertised as being able to charge two phones at once, and I've found it does not.  If you want to get two batteries at once and charge both at the same time, buy a battery case, it will do the job.  It would be nice if they just made a smaller version, but it would be much cheaper

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would not buy this product. The only reason I bought it was because I had to replace my aging CD player. The unit works with the DVD player that I have, but not the CD player that is included with the unit. I cannot even see the DVD that is being played on the unit because it is too small for me to even see, much less play. It is a waste of money. I would suggest going with a Sony player for your CD player if you plan to do a lot of watching or playing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I tried several of these before finally finding something that would fit my needs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've used them on both of my Canon PowerShot and Sony Ericsson G700 cameras.  The G700 camera had a noticeable amount of "flickering" of images.  This is when the LCD is turned off and the camera is not recording the images. I've also had an occasional "hanging" effect when the camera's LCD is not on.  After doing a little research I decided to purchase the SD memory card that would fit my G700, and was very disappointed.  They cost $40.00 and the card itself only came in at about 4MB.  I bought this card from Amazon and received the item within 1-2 days.  There was no warning from Amazon when the item shipped so I had no idea that it might arrive damaged.  When I received it, I discovered that it had been returned damaged from Amazon.  Amazon was kind enough to offer me a $30 gift card and a $5 credit, which I can use towards any other Amazon items I want.  It's a very unfortunate situation that Amazon has returned damaged items to me and I would not recommend them for this type of item.  However, the SD card itself worked fine with the G700 and it worked perfectly with the Sony Ericksson G705. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These things are junk, they will NOT fit in any normal case, they have to be the size of a regular case.  I used them for 2 weeks, and they broke after just 1 month.  My next ones will be the same.  Don't waste your money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My car radio, which is a Mitsubishi made, is on the lower end of the spectrum. I have not experienced any signal strength loss from it. However, I find the receiver has a weak reception. I also wish it was a little easier to set up and use.I would not purchase a SIRIUS for the car radio because of the weak reception I am experiencing.I am also concerned that the FM transmitter is not working properly. I was able to get it to receive the station in my area, but I will be returning it for a different radio. It may be the radio I have been using, but it is also an example of what you can get with SIRIs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this to replace my Sony mouse, which I no longer use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my first unit of this in a timely manner.  However, the only problems I had with it were the fact that the mouse wouldn't go into Windows 7.  I have since upgraded my operating system to Windows XP.  If you don't use a mouse in XP you might have problems with this mouse.  The software for Windows XP has no options for switching between mouse modes.  You have to use the mousewheel to switch between modes. The mouse buttons are all on the left side, which makes it very difficult to use this mouse if you are right-handed.  My friend who is right-hand dominant can use this keyboard better than I can.  All in all I was disappointed with the mouse because it is very slow and it is not adjustable.  In a positive review about electronic device, it works but it's very hard to get it to work in Windows XP, and it's not adjustable, which is why I gave it a 1 star rating

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't waste your money on this product, as there is no clear instructions on how to remove the front panel and replace the battery.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my wife's printer and she loves it.  The print quality is a bit low, but not terrible.  However, the printing speed is slow.

I hope HP or another printer manufacturer can improve this thing.  Don't waste your money!  It's a waste of your time and money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these because they are a cheap brand that you can get at most electronic device stores.  Unfortunately, they did not work.  It did not come with the instructions that you needed to use them.  I got them from Amazon and the instructions were not clear enough.  They will not fit the Sony NP3100 and the only way to get them to work is to buy a Sony NP1100, which has all the same specs and has a better label.  The NP1 100 is very easy to use and does the job, but I will not be buying Sony again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product thinking it was a great product, but it is not. I have to use the included paper and bubble to protect the CD.  It is not a good product, if you want to protect your CD and don't want to spend $20.00. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the DVD recorder, and it worked for about 1 year.  Now it is on the shelf.  It's sooooo slow.  If you want to record a DVD, buy an external recorder, this is a waste of money.  I would never buy another brand of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because I wanted an iPod to be able to hold my mp3 player and the new mp3 in addition to my other mp3s 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It does not work with all of the iPods, but the most notable ones are the Sony, Samsung and HP.  The Panasonic, LG and Olympus are not compatible.  It also won't work with the iPod mini, although it does work with it, but is not very easy to connect.  There are adapters that can be purchased that will allow you to connect it to the iPod, but I am not sure how well they work.  I will not buy this again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use this for my home theater system.  After installation it did not work.  The only problem is that it is an "airflow" device, which means that it does not draw air through the speakers.  My sound quality is now very poor.  If you want to have an air-conditioned sound system, this product is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased the PIA 25 and did not get it for one reason, the battery did not hold a charge.  I used my old battery that was made in 2000 and it still holds a charge 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The battery was not what I expected.  I am not sure why it took me so long to get a replacement battery.  The charger works with both AA and AAA batteries, but not AA.  It would charge both batteries to the same level.  Don't waste your money.  Get a cheaper charger instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased the product for my husband and it is just as advertised.  We have had it for about 2 months now and he is having problems with it.  I have had a few other brands of CD's that worked fine but this one just doesn't hold together.  He has used it for a lot of movies and it does have its uses.  But it is not worth it to have to go through the trouble of replacing it.I do recommend a good electronic device but if you do not have it then don't waste your money on it.The product itself is fine.  However it is hard to get the product to work properly if it doesn't have the case, it has to be screwed into the case.  It will break if you don't use the case to secure it.One other negative review: I am very disappointed in this product.  The case is ok for DVDs but I will never purchase the product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought these because they had great reviews. Well, it doesn't work. I tried using the wireless keyboard and mouse on the network and they both fail.  The keyboard has to be plugged into the computer. The mouse can only be used by the mouse itself and not plugged into anything else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound is great but the connection is horrible. The sound isn't even close to the original connection of the iPod. You'll have to use the "Sonic" feature on your iPod to make sure it stays connected 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  i bought this to play my mp3 player and it was just OK. i did not like the fact that it did not work with my iPod, and when i went back to get it repaired i was charged $150, and it only took me 4 days to return it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had several cases from Amazon and they've all had a slight crack in the bottom which causes the case to not close properly.  I got this case and immediately sent it back and Amazon wouldn't give me a refund.  Amazon should be ashamed of their bad electronic devices.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had a Canon MP3 player for 6 months and am very disappointed.  The volume control is unreliable and it doesn't have a battery that's worth keeping.  I have a digital camera that uses the volume control.  It is a major pain to switch between the two in the menu.  In addition, the player is a huge piece of junk.  Don't buy this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just installed this product and the sound is very low. The speakers are very small, and I do not have an amp to power them. The sound is so low that I do no longer listen to the radio.  I will not recommend this product for anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this because the product description stated that it could work with any iPod with an adapter.  However, the instructions for the adapter included a warning that the unit would not work with the iPod 5G.  So I returned it and purchased the 5G adapter.After a few weeks of trying to connect my iPod with the product, I realized that the product did not include instructions for making the connection, which is a common problem with iPods that come with adapters.  I then had to write a negative reviews about other iPods.  Don't buy an iPod with this product, it won't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It has 2 usb ports, and it only has a mini-usb jack.  I can't plug it in to my computer, because the power is on my computer.  My phone is the only one that is plugged in, and the power light on it will not turn on unless the computer is plugged into it.  There is no way for me to turn the computer off.  The only other reason I gave it 5 stars is because I do not have to replace the power cord 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product does not have a stand, and the instructions for how to assemble the stand are not clear.  The stand is made of some scrap, not metal, so if you put it together wrong, it will come apart

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have used this product for several months now and the sound quality is terrible.  The microphone picks up everything that is in front of it and it is impossible to adjust the volume.  If you have any kind of serious ear problems and need help, please look at the Micron Mic.  It is a much better product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My wife bought this for her laptop and it didn't work.  We thought it was just a software glitch and it worked after a few days.  However, the next time I tried it it refused to run at all and it would not boot up and would only display a blank screen with an error message.  After calling support, they said it was a problem with the DVD drive and would be repaired by them.  So, we bought another DVD player that worked.  This product is an expensive piece of junk.  I won't buy another product from Amazon because I wouldn't risk getting a broken item that won't even work anymore 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Not worth the $50.00 for this product.  I have used several other brands of cd player with better sound and much less hassle.  Don't waste your money on this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product thinking it would work as an external hard drive, but it was not.  I returned it.  This product is not compatible with the Sony PNY XPX series and the XPX model is no longer manufactured.  Sony no longer makes this product, so I suggest anyone purchasing it for this reason should consider the PNY QA1 product, which is compatible with XPX.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had this printer for only a couple of weeks now and have already broken it twice.  The first time it was with a Canon ink cartridge, and the second time it didn't even have the ink.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this antenna, thinking that I needed to have it in place to receive the local FM radio stations.  It is NOT true.  In order to receive radio stations, I must have the antenna on the base.  I was VERY disappointed in the design.  Don't waste your money, get something better.  The antenna was NOT sturdy enough to hold the antenna in place and was very susceptible to breaking. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had this product for less than a year and have had no problems whatsoever.  I would never purchase this product again, since it was so unreliable.  There are cheaper products available, and I do not regret having purchased this product.

I'm sure that I will receive a refund, but if it is a major problem, I won't be able to use the software on this product again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I tried this because my other ones weren't working and it was cheap.  I bought this and it doesn't work.  It just doesn't connect.  What a complete waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this CD to replace a bad, burned CD, and it worked OK.  However, it doesn't have a built-in disc burner, so I had to buy a player.  I also bought a player which had a built in CD burner, and that one worked OK, but I couldn't burn DVDs (or anything else).  I wish I hadn't bought this player. It cost way too much and I have a ton of CDs and DVDs, so it's a big disappointment.  But, the CD player was a nice thing, because it allowed me to listen to my CDs on the plane 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD player is OK, but the remote is a joke. It is very hard to use. I have had it for a year and it still refuses to use the "seek" function.  I have been trying to get it to work for the last couple of months, and it has never worked.  Don't waste your money on this product.  It is junk. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just received my first pair of earbuds, and I can't believe they're so cheaply made.  I'd have to go buy some of them from Amazon to be able to even try them out.  You won't be disappointed, however.  The material is not durable enough to hold up over the ear, so I'd suggest going with something that's more rigid.  However, I have to admit that they're a little uncomfortable for some people, and will probably get better with time.  Don't be suckered by the cheapness of these. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a great electronic device for those with a large media collection.  However, the connection is very weak, sometimes it hangs for 10 minutes, sometimes 20 minutes.  Don't expect great performance with this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this for my daughter to use for her TV. She got used to it, but she didn't like the fact that it is a power cord that comes with the TV.  I decided to try the Sony Mini Dock for my PC, which works just as well.  We'll see what happens if she decides to use this to connect to the TV in her bedroom or her car, but I wouldn't suggest it for this purpose 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only reason this product is rated so low is because of the antenna. I have purchased and returned many of these antennas. In addition, the product does not fit my car's radio very well. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very expensive product, but it doesn't hold the picture. The only time I really saw any improvement was when I had to have my picture transferred from the TV to my computer, and I couldn't even open it to the computer to get it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My original Sony CD player stopped working on my newer, bigger Panasonic plasma (with more than 10,000 video & sound songs).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this cable hoping it would be a great replacement for the cheap and noisy Sennheiser S-U1s, but it isn't. I was hoping for better performance, but I am still paying the $8 a month for it because it doesn't deliver. It's just too much work to get rid of the noise of this cable, plus the fact that it is so short. If you have to have an earphone, get a Sennhofer S-500S or Sennhub. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this thinking it would be a little better than the Sony product, but it is not.  It is not even a 1/8" or less.  I have to unplug it every 10 minutes or so and the volume is barely audible

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have owned these headphones since I was a child, and have had many other brands that are more comfortable.  These do not fit my head at all.  The bass is pretty loud, but not at all pleasing.  I am a big fan of Sony, but the sound quality is subpar.  Sony's customer service is great, but I wouldn't recommend them as an option for a good electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to record my personal videos.  However, it does not work properly with the Panasonic DVX400.  The DVD player can't record in 4k (that is the highest resolution).  I had to delete all the footage and get a new one to use with the DVX500.  I will never buy another Panasonic product again.  Very disappointing.  Don't waste your money on it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this player because I needed to use it to stream my HD movies to my laptop and not have to plug into my TV.  It does work, but it is slow and is almost impossible to use with a big screen.  I am a big fan of Sony, so I thought I would try this out.  What a disappointment.  Amazon customer service said it would be a 5-star item, but I will never buy another Sony product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am returning this item.  I bought it and it does not work.  It's a pain to use it because it's so tiny, but I will never buy another brand again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've been using this product for 2 months now and the picture quality is horrible.  I have an HP laptop which has a much better picture.  If you are looking for a digital device with a decent picture, I suggest you get a cheapie camera or something better.  The product does have a few features such as a color balance, but you will be paying for the software to use this feature.  Amazon is selling this product at a lower price, so maybe they're saving a few bucks, but I would never use a cheap camera if I want to use a picture that looks decent 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It has a very low amount of room for the cables. I had to use the included clip to hold the power cord to the case.  I think I could have used the included included power cord clip to connect to the power supply. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  the mp3 player has a plastic housing with a small radio antenna.  the player has no input power, so the only thing you have to do is connect your iPod to it.  if you use the remote you can get the iPod out, but it is not a practical thing to do

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This card has great picture quality but it is just not enough for the gigabyte capacity you'll need.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This antenna is not as effective as the other ones I've tried and the ones I'm about to try are $20 cheaper.  I don't know if I'm getting a bad antenna because I've never used this one, or because this one is actually more expensive than the others.  In addition, the antenna is too long for my room, which is why I am now looking for a shorter antenna.  There is no reason to waste $30 if you can get something better, even if you have to pay for shipping.  It's too much of a hassle to replace this antenna.I'm returning this antenna because it doesn't perform well and the price is way too high for what you get.  Don't waste your money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had my HP and had to return it because it was defective.  I received a refund, and it cost me $75.  Do not buy this product unless you want to waste your money on a bad piece of electronic device.  Don't be fooled by the glossy color and the fact that it's a little bit thinner than the HP.  It's a total ripoff!  It would be best to get a HP from a friend who uses the HP and you don't have to worry about shipping.  But since it is the same price and the HP is made by HP, I will never buy from HP again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would have no interest in this product if it did not have the built in battery.  It does not.

This is a waste of money and the manufacturer is not helping 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have used a variety of different brands and sizes of these CD's. They all work. The problem is, they all use the same manufacturer name, Toshiba. The ones I received from Amazon (with the best service) also used Toshiba, but with different model numbers. Amazon does not seem to have the same model number on all their Toshiba CD's, making them all unusable. I returned mine because I cannot use the CD's with a Toshiba drive (or at least the ones I receive). I will never use Toshiba again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product works fine for the money.  But it doesn't do much when it's really cold.  The only way it works is to keep the battery powered all the time.  Don't buy this product if you want to use it without batteries 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this for my husband's laptop, he uses it everyday.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  the radio has a strong FM radio reception, but the reception is really weak for FM and AM.  I think it's because of the small receiver and the small antenna which is in front.  If you are looking for a FM radio with reception strength in both AM and FM, then this radio is not for you.  This radio would be great if it had a bigger antenna to get better reception, especially for FM.

When I tried to use the card with my newer Canon camcorders, I got a "scanning error" on my screen.  I contacted Canon customer service, and they sent me a replacement card.  If you don't have any of the newer camcordered cards, I'd suggest trying a different camera, because the card worked perfectly with my Canon cam.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because it was advertised as a compact DVD recorder.  The only problem is that it only has 1/4 inch tape in it.  It's not much, but if I had a larger size I could have used it for a stereo system 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had two of these drives for a year and a half now, and the only one I use is the newest model, which I am not happy with. The first drive broke in less than a year, the second just this past month.I had to return both drives and buy another brand of drive. If I had to do it again I'd return this one. I really should have gotten another brand. The manufacturer, SanDisk, is doing a lousy job marketing the product.  Don't waste your money and don't buy this drive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm returning this product because of the poor construction of the cases.  The lid, where the screen is, is very thin and fragile.  Don't use it if you want to keep it in the car.  If you have small items, like a small electronic device, it would be a better case 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is ok but not reliable.  The only thing I have to say is that it's not very clear what the connector to plug into the printer is.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am a big fan of the Panasonic DVD player but this one is just not working.  I've seen other reviewers have had the same problem.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product does not work with the ASUS nVidia MCP31X. I had it up and running for a few minutes before it quit.  I bought this item thinking it would help me keep my new TV cool. I wish ASUS would bring the MCP32A motherboard chipset (which is included with the M35X) along with the LCD and MCP30A/MCP30D TV so that we can use it to its full potential. If ASUS just wanted to make money, why did they not sell a motherboard that included MCP36A (the same chipset as MCP20A).I am not a tech person, and it may not be an ASUS issue, but I suspect it is. I would not purchase this item again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It does not come with a cable, it is not as sleek as the Dell Inspiron 605i.  I would have been better off just buying an external antenna for this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product did not work and the shipping cost was high.  I returned the item and will not purchase from them 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had bought this because of the recommendation in the other reviews.  After installing the software to access the card and the drivers I found that it did not work with the Windows XP operating system, which is an older operating system.  I have to keep using the older version of Windows to access my card, and it is very frustrating.  It has also become extremely difficult to remove the cards when cleaning the card, as the instructions for doing so are very difficult to follow 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD player itself is ok but I'm looking for something better for my car radio.  The antenna is ok so I just want it to get better reception.  It just seems to not get the best reception.I've tried a lot of other products and this is the worst.  I'm still trying to get my hands on the Sony KDL-500, it seems to be better 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  the cd player itself is a decent piece but it is just way to slow for my  movies 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It is very small. i do not think it is worth the price and I am sure most people that have this device are not going to like it.  I bought the Canon Epson 2430 printer and the included software for it is very limited. I am not able to print from it and have to print through the Adobe Acrobat software. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound quality is OK, but the cord is WAY TOO LONG, so it gets in the way when I'm driving.  Don't waste your money, buy a decent cord or use the included iPod dock 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had two of these units.  One has worked for about a year and then failed and has been replaced by a different unit.  The first one I had did not work.  This new unit is worse.  I cannot use it to record music anymore.  If I want to record my favorite songs, I have to use my computer with the software that does not support this product.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had two of these cards, both at a good price.  One failed and the other one still works, but now I am using a generic card that I bought at Best Buy, and it is just as reliable.  I was not able to get it to boot up because of the card.  The card I had in the other hand is the same brand that I used for my Dell S2710 and it works just as reliably.  Do NOT buy this product, unless you want to be vulnerable to hardware failure when it does not work

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is OK. But when you use it for the first time you will be disappointed.It does not come with any instructions how to use it, just a big manual.It can't connect to your network or the internet without an extra charge, and it is not supported by Microsoft. It can't support the wireless technology called WPS (Wired Personal Area Network) 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this cable because I wanted to hook my TV up to a DVD player.  It was never fully functional, and now I am going to return it because it won't hold my DVD player anymore.  I would not buy this cable if it were not for the fact that it was cheap and works with the TV.  Not sure what else to say other than I'd avoid it if you are looking to hook your TV up with the cable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product was not working properly with my Mac.  I returned it and bought a different model that worked.  In the long run, I would not recommend this product.  The manufacturer should have known better

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm a new electronic device user and have to say that this card does not perform well.  The only positive review I can give is that it was very quick to install and the software is fairly intuitive.  My experience with this card so far has been poor and I am returning it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have tried other solutions and none of them have worked.  It seems to work with my HP printer but it doesn't work with HP's Color Touch paper.  The printer wouldn't load at all in Adobe Lightroom and I had to restart the printer and then I could print.  If you have a HP Color Touch with this printer, it might work for you.  I recommend you look elsewhere for a printer with a better quality and better price.  This printer was bought for $150 at a local store and I would have to pay $100 to get it at Costco 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was hoping for better reception and sound quality than what I got.  But this is just a very cheap antenna, not worth the money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't waste your money on this thing. The only thing it can do is save photos to your SD card, which is not much of a thing.  It is not worth the money at all 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this card at the local Walmart.  My husband had a HP laptop and it got a bit warm so he called HP and they offered to replace it with a new one.  HP's product manager suggested I buy a generic card instead of the HP card.  I went to the same store the same day and they said they couldn't sell me the HP product.  The HP product manager who recommended the generic card told me not to buy it at Walmart.So, I got the generic product.I was happy with it.  But it is a bit of a pain to get it out of the laptop.  And the software on the HP brand cards is not as good as the software for the generic cards. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The picture is OK.  However, the sound quality is very poor.  It is barely audible at times, especially when I'm driving.  I can't use the headphones while driving because it makes my ears hurt.  The speakers are OK.The remote control is not intuitive and is extremely difficult to use.  You have to press a button to change channels.   I would never buy this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a terrible product. I had to replace the battery because it did not hold enough juice. The remote has to be turned on and on all the time. If you are a professional who uses the remote all the day and night and not really use the remote at all, this is a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These cards are a bit pricey, but I did receive them in time for the holidays.  However, since I received them in such a rush, I am unsure if they will work with my new laptop (which is not yet installed).  However I'm not sure if there is a way to uninstall them, which is a very bothersome issue.  If you have an older model Mac, try this out before ordering these cards again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It was working fine for awhile, but then it stopped.  The next thing I tried to make sure the connection was clear.  I plugged in my TV, connected the receiver to the TV, and then the TV to the receiver.  Nothing.  Then I tried the same thing with the iPod and the same problem.  It stopped working.  No other problems.  Very disappointing.  Don't buy this unless you're okay with the risk of losing the connection.  If you need to use it at a friend's house, make sure you buy a decent iPod/iPhone adapter that'll keep the connections stable.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It does work.  The problem is that it is a pain in the ass to configure the software to use the built in sound.  I tried using the "Sound Settings" in the GUI but it does not work for me.  You have to know what type of speaker system you have to have the software setup to use.  If you have a stereo it is easy enough to set the volume for the left and right speakers.  But if you have two speakers it is much more complicated 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product was sent with the wrong size of USB cables. I contacted ASUS and they sent me the right size cables. Now, I am unable to use the mouse at all! The product is now unusable and I will never buy from ASUS again. They also sent me an incorrect shipping label. I had them send me the product first to see what was the problem, and they agreed to send me an exchange.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It does have an internal power supply so I can't really complain.  It is not a battery.  But the problem is that when you turn it off, it will go into standby mode.  In standby mode, it turns on your system's CPU and uses the computer's power to keep it running.  If your computer's CPU is underutilized (i.e. you use it all the time), it will drain your system and waste energy, which is very bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this product because I had a problem with my old receiver.  I tried all of the repair options and the repair guy recommended a different product.  In the end I bought a "new" model.  It was junk.  So now I am out of both.  The product itself is junk, but I still don't know what to do with the receiver that I just returned.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just received this product and it is not working. I am not sure what to do about it.  I will try and get it fixed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound is a little better than the other 2 i have bought.  However it is still not as great as the iBose X60.  The buttons feel flimsy, and it is a pain to turn the volume up and down.  It also takes quite a while to get it to turn on and off.  Finally, it does not charge my iPod, which is a shame since I usually use it on a daily basis.  Overall, it is not worth buying because of the flimsy buttons and the lack of sound quality 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound is OK but the cord isn't long enough.  I've tried a shorter one but it was a little louder.  You can't plug it in at all without having it sit for a few minutes and then plug it back in

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this thinking it would be better than the other ones I had. I have since found out it is not.  It is very slow and very noisy. I would not buy it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound quality is ok, but it lacks a little something.  It has a very high impedance, so it doesn't fit all ear buds very well, and it is not very comfortable.  I had to put it in a case (which I thought was the best idea).  I am glad I didn't have to do that because it would have costed me more to return.  The only reason I didn't return it was because it was on sale at Wal-Mart for $19.99!  If you want to listen to music on your phone, buy a corded phone, not this phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound is not very clear. It is not that great to listen to. The speakers sound quite cheap. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The software to use this card is a total pain in the ass. It is a "hidden" application that requires you to log in every time you want to use the card. This is one of the worst pieces of software I have ever used. I can't even use the "uninstall" function on the program, because it is a constant pain to do so. I also find the card to be rather noisy, so I don't use it in the bedroom. It also has an internal clock that is a bit slow. This card has the potential to be a great product if you don't mind the hassle of using it. I won't be buying this product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My copy machine stopped and started every time I was away from it.  I think I have a faulty drive.  It was only $30 but is definitely a waste of money.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The headphones are comfortable but I am still very disappointed.  The sound quality is good but I was hoping they would provide a better fit.  You need to be careful to not squeeze the cups.  They will break easily 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had to buy a replacement product that has better sound. The problem is the power supply. The unit would not accept a standard power supply with a 5 volt output.  I used a 12 volt model and it worked fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The player is OK, but I wouldn't buy it unless I could find a replacement. The speakers sound OK, they're not awful, but they're lacking in some areas and it's really hard to get them to work.  I have to listen to the player all the time to see if it will actually play my CDs. I also have to turn the volume all the way up to make the music play. I would NOT buy this player if you have a bad CD player. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm an owner of this product.  The problem with this product is that it doesn't support an SD card with a capacity of 1 GB.  I bought a 1 GB SD card from Amazon, and I can see that Amazon's product specifications have changed in the last few months.  Now, Amazon has this product with a 1GB capacity.  In the last year or so, Amazon also changed the way the product operates - the product no longer supports a "write to a disc" operation with the SD card - so I had to uninstall the product before I could start using it.  Amazon's website also claims that a "capacity" of 1GB is required for writing the entire contents of an SD Card.  While this product has a "written to a CD" operation, this feature is not supported by this product - only the "write a positive review about an electronic device" operation.  As a result, this product can't be installed and used with a full 1 GB capacity SD card 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It is a bit slow, but not very accurate. I have tried to get the software to speed up. This is the only thing I do not like about this product.  I was hoping that the price would be better because it is such a hassle to use.  You get what you pay for.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this player for its sound quality, but the sound quality is quite poor. It is a big chunk of plastic, and the sound is not as clear as the other players I have. The volume is pretty low, so I don't have to turn the volume up to listen to the music 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had the product for a few weeks now and it has yet to show any noticeable improvement over the old stock battery.  The battery life is certainly not as good as my other Canon Epson printers, which use batteries that last for years.  I would not buy this printer if I could return it because the battery life isn't good enough for the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product a few months back, and have been very disappointed in its performance.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was disappointed to see the new Epson Epson Workforce II printer that came with the ink.  I wanted the same product with the same ink that was included in the HP LaserJet 7 and HP Studio 7 printers that HP supplied for free to me.  But this HP printer is junk.  You can't see the print with the screen - you have to look at the screen to see what the print is actually doing.  It's a joke.  Don't buy this product - don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product does not work in the USA.  I was given it as a free electronic device by an Amazon employee and Amazon told me to return it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a complete waste of money.  I will never buy another brand of CD player that has a CD changer.  It is just plain junk.  There is no volume control, it does not play MP3's, and it is totally unreliable.  This would not work if the CD player was not so cheap.  You will end up wasting a lot of money on this if you buy another player with a CD player changer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  this memory is a big disappointment.  I was hoping it would work, but it just doesn't.  it's so much slower than the others.  there is no way to change it's settings, no way for it to be recognized as a backup or as a normal card, etc.  if you use your system for a while and you want to go back to it, you'll have to buy a different card.  also the memory is NOT expandable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product was advertised as an external drive.  Unfortunately, it is not.  The only way to use it is to connect it to your PC via the included power cable.  This is a big mistake because the included cable is quite fragile, and the power cable must be kept in good condition.  I have bought a few of these and have lost one, and I am afraid that is going to happen again.  It is a waste of your money.  If you have a portable system, do not buy this.  You will waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't waste your money on this product.  It isnt worth it for what it is, and is much more expensive than a more reasonable product.The only reason I gave it is because of the color options and the fact that it can record all formats.  I just bought my Canon VHS to Sony C1 Converter (WAV/AIFF/FLAC/MP3) which does everything that this is capable of.  For example, it can make a WAV file out of the Sony C2 video, and it can also do the same with the Sony CMV video format

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to replace the one that was missing an IPOD.  The case is great but it is not very sturdy.  If you drop it, it can be broken very easily.  I also found that it was not very water resistant.  It doesn't do the IPOD justice when it is under water.  Hopefully the company will take this back 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use it as an external CD player but do not like that it only works with one brand of CD player. So I decided to purchase the iPod brand and not be bothered with the extra hassle of finding the right brand for my particular iPod.  However, the iPods do not work with my CD player that has a built in CD player, but they work with the iPod I purchased for my other computer.  The iPod brand CD player is useless

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This item is poorly designed.  The front is made of plastic that can crack if you try to remove it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had two units in a year.  The first unit failed within 5 months, and I have since purchased the replacement unit.  It's a different model, and not the same as the one that failed.  I'm hoping this one lasts longer, since the previous one failed within 1 year.It doesn't record at all, so I can't use it as a reference, and it doesn't support playback of DVDs.  If I need to play a DVD on it, I'll buy a different product, which has DVD recording capabilities.  You might get better performance out of a faster processor, but at the cost of a small price increase 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It isnt very bright, and when you want to see something in the center of your screen, its hard to see.  I use it to watch movies.  You might want to try a different brand 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I tried the "easy" way of buying this product and it has a tendency to fail.  I've tried the repair procedure (which included contacting Amazon) and it just wasn't worth the hassle.  The unit worked for about three months, then it started randomly shutting off.  Amazon sent me a new one (without the "Easy" repair procedure) and the unit still doesn't work.  There is no indication of a problem with the unit, which means it's probably an "out of warranty" issue, not an "in warranty" problem 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered this for my daughter, who is 5 years old and likes to watch movies.  She doesn't like it, and it didn't fit her DVD player.  It also doesn't fit my older car.  I returned it to Amazon and they said it would be fixed for free.  The only way it would fit is if I just ordered a different item that would fit.  Amazon doesn't ship electronic products well, and I have been very disappointed in their customer service 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this as a replacement for my Canon Rebel XF, which now works with my Panasonic GF4. I've had several problems with this, ranging from "stuck" in a dark room to "losing" all my pictures due to the fact that the "lock" feature on the camera was not functioning. I have had to replace the batteries, which I do not have to do every time I take a picture. It is a huge pain in the rear to have to constantly turn the "locks" on and off, and I have no idea whether or not they're working.  If you plan to use this product, make sure that you have a "lock"-style locking device, as this one does not have one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It has 2.4k of internal memory but lacks any software to manage that memory. The CD player itself is OK but the software is very basic.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this memory card in hopes of saving space in my laptop. I bought the 16MB version and when I tried to copy an ISO file, it would crash the computer. This is a great memory card but it would have been much better to buy a faster, 64MB memory card. I've had problems with the 64MB version. I had to use my own CD drive to copy my ISO files and then I had problems copying my other ISO files. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound is very mediocre. I used to have a Sony PXD-D10, which I had for years and still use. It worked perfectly for years, and when it broke, it was replaced with an XMG.  The XMG, however, has the same problem as the PXDs, and no one has a clue why. The XGMS-A1 is also a dud, but that is more to do with the fact that it was my first Sony device, so I have no reason to believe it's any different.  If you have an older Sony device that works fine, I suggest buying an A5. I'd stay away from the A1. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to hold my mp3 player, but it does not work well for that.  I have to unplug and plug it in manually to keep it from overheating, which is a little annoying, but if it overheats, it shuts down, which means I have no way to turn the radio back on.  If you don't use the remote, don't buy this!  I wish I hadn't bought it, because the instructions for using it are incorrect.  Do not try to hold the radio in your hands and try to operate it.  It is not designed to be operated like that.I would not buy this product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had no problems with this product but I am very disappointed because it is very expensive for such a small product.

I would recommend you purchase something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this memory card, and when it arrived, it didn't work.  I tried to repair it, but the card did not work. i don't know if it is because this memory is only made of a certain type of memory, or if it's because it's not working properly, but it is a very annoying experience.  It was also a pain to remove the card, insert it into the memory card reader, and then take it out again, because it sticks in the reader, so you cannot remove it easily

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It is very noisy when connected to the radio, but not at all when playing back a DVD.  The only good thing is that it does have a little bit of FM reception.  It would be nice if it could get rid of the FM reception, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a terrible product.  There are not many of them, and the one that I bought did not work.  I wish the company had put up a replacement that was as good as the first.  If you are buying this product, don't do it on Amazon, because it won't last, and Amazon won't refund you 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only reason it failed to keep the signal is that the wire was too short, not to mention that there are many longer wires to use

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product I bought was a little different from the description. The only difference I can see is that they were missing the case that the actual product had. The product that came with the case was fine.  I will not buy from this company again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used to love this mp3 player.  It was just the one that didn't work for me.  I have had the mp3-c2 for a month and I'm still waiting for a replacement unit.  Do yourself a favor and buy a good brand new player, if you don't mind it being a bit more expensive.  This mp3 would not play with this mp4. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product does not work with the ipod touch. The ipod has a special jack that is used to plug into the receiver (not the ipods). The ipods need to have a special antenna attached to them. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The item is advertised as an iPod dock and that is it.  The case does not protect the iPod when it is in the case and the iPod is not safe when it's in the carton.  Don't waste your money on this case 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to use as a DVD player and it failed within a year.  I am trying to get it repaired or replaced and have already contacted Toshiba for help.  Don't buy this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm not a big fan of the MP3 player. I bought it because it was cheaper than the Sony product.  I also bought it on sale and since I have it, I've had the same problem with it that I had with the Sony.  The player randomly stops playing songs after 1-2 minutes.  It's not the iPod player, it's the iPod Nano. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased the unit to replace my Sony CDX500 which I had already bought as an upgrade from my Sony unit.  The unit works fine with the Sony CD player.  However, it does not work with the Philips CDX700 which is my main CD player for the house.  I will have to return it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used this product for 2 months. I tried to record 2 videos simultaneously, but it didn't work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  i got this thing for my wife, who doesn't use a PC and needs to hook it up to her ipod/iPod.  it is VERY finicky with how much space it takes up.  we got it working with half the space, but it only worked with 1/4 inch thick plastic pieces.  if you get this for your iPod, it will not work.  i would suggest something better if you want it to be able to hold and operate on 2 small plastic pieces 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received the box as promised.  The case came with a single CD, however, the CD player was defective.  I called SONY and they told me that they would send me a new CD player.  Unfortunately, the new player did not have the same specs that the defective player had.  So, I returned the box.  Now I am stuck with a defective player that I cannot use.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've owned many, many, and I have to say this one is the worst.  First off, it is really hard to use it.  Secondly, it doesn't hold a charge very well, if at all.  I have tried to use the charging cable as much as I can, but the problem is it's so bulky that it makes it hard to move around.  Thirdly, it has very little built-in protection.  It has no case, which is very unfortunate.  Also, I don't like the fact that the mouse pad is so flimsy that it can easily be lost.  You can see this in the picture of the mouse, which I'm sure is pretty much the only thing that will stay in place.  The mousepad has been lost twice so far, which isn't even that rare 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My TV died within a week of purchase, and I'm returning it for a replacement.  It's an antenna, right?  So what's the big deal?  I don't want to listen to radio stations through my TV.  If the TV can't receive FM stations, what else could I do with it?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't know what happened to this product, I bought it from Amazon.com and it was a gift to my wife, so I expected it to work just like it was supposed to.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am sorry but the sound is so-so, and I can not get it to record with mp3 at all.  I have it recording with SACD.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use the "normal" DVD player and it always cuts out the commercials.  I tried the "high" settings and it cuts out every once in a while, but I have not had any problems with this player for the last few months.  The only way I can get it to work is by opening the case and removing the cartridge and plugging it in.  If you do that, the player will not work.  Please don't buy this player 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because it is an MP3 player and it can handle SD and CF cards.  Unfortunately it is not a good MP3 device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  this is a really bad product.  I bought it thinking that it would work for my new HDTV.  it did not, at all.  i tried to get a refund from amazon, but they refuse to refund anything unless it is defective.  so i am going to return it and try another brand.  the only positive review I can give this is that it works for the HDTV that I got it for.  if you are looking to buy this, be prepared to spend at least $30-40 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These discs are not made for the iPod!  The case is too small.  It also does not hold the iPod, and does not have any room for the battery in the case.  The only reason I purchased these was to get the iPod with my new car stereo.  Now I can't even listen to the iPod and I'm driving.  Don't waste your money on these discs.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would not buy this product again.  I bought a second Sony PDP1 and it worked fine.  The only reason I bought this one is because of the price.  There are better options out there for this type of device.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The antenna doesn't work with my car, but the antenna is fine for my radio. I don't understand why the manufacturer doesn't have an antenna that works for all radios, not just the Toyota Prius! The car radio is not the problem, it's the antenna.  I just wish the antenna was a little more sturdy and it would be worth the price for me 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this product for over a year now.  I keep seeing on the web and in other reviews that it is not reliable.  The problem is that the unit does not work well with other batteries.   I had to replace my old battery with another brand.  It will hold a charge for about 30 minutes then go dead.  In other words, I have a half charge left and when I want to charge it, I'm going to have to turn it on or plug in the charger again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product does not work for all my MP3's. It is not compatible with the iPod Nano. I returned it to Apple and got the same product.  I will never buy a "mini" iPod again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this as an option to replace my CD player which had a bad antenna.  The product is OK, but it has the antenna at an angle that can't pick up the signal from the outside.  It also has the radio on the back, which is awkward.  You have to take the radio off, remove the CD player, and put the radio back on.  If you do this with your CD player in the car, it will not work anymore 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this phone to replace my old Nokia phones.  The phone has no sound, no reception and is very difficult to use.  I am sure the company has improved the phone, but the original Nokia phones worked fine.  Don't waste your money!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Not much room for a battery, but the fact that it does have room for an AC adapter and the cord that you will be plugging into is very flimsy.  It is VERY easy to break.  Don't buy this one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The antenna is very sensitive.  I bought this because it seemed to be better than the antenna that came with my TV.  However, I was disappointed in the fact that the antenna is extremely sensitive.I did a few things to try to get it to work better.  First, I installed the receiver, then the antenna, then it worked for a while, but then it wouldn't work anymore.  After that, I switched over to the antenna supplied by the manufacturer.  But this antenna is not nearly as sensitive.So, I returned it and I'm looking for a different antenna.  Don't buy this product, it is not worth it.  If you buy the antenna from Amazon, Amazon has it for a great price 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This DVD player worked for my wife's birthday party.  The problem was it broke very quickly.  Don't buy this DVD player unless you plan to do lots of DVDs.  This unit worked for a few months, but broke soon after I bought it.  Buy a Sony unit instead 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just want to make a negative complaint about a terrible electronic device. I bought this for my son and we are both very disappointed.  It is an antenna but it is a crappy antenna. It is very sensitive and will not transmit signals in a good direction unless you keep the radio on a very high frequency.  We had it set to a local station so it did get a signal but it never was as strong as we were hoping for 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered the 5gb card to replace my 50gb card that was damaged.  It came very late.  I had no idea that it would cost me so much to replace the damaged card.  My customer service rep told me that they could replace my damaged card for me, but I would need to return it with the 50gb that I had.  If I did, they would have to send me the 50gig card.The card is not usable until I return it.  After 5 days, I will have to pay $20 shipping for the 50GB card, plus the $30 mail-in fee.  The other customer service reps in the store did not help me at all 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only reason I bought this card was because it was cheaper than the others in the same category.  It's definitely not worth the money because I will never use it.  If you want to save a few bucks, buy the same model as the other brands.  I can tell because my card has a sticker on the front of it saying "Cards are not guaranteed" which is a complete lie.  The one I got broke within a month of being installed and it cost me $150 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this for my son who has a Nikon SL3 and he wanted to shoot more photos in the dark. The picture is terrible. You need a manual setting to be able to shoot properly. I have not been able to get it to print a good picture. You will get a much better picture with a Canon. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had the same model for about 5 years and now the CD player is dying and won't hold any more mp3's.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had purchased the HP Elite Hub, and it has become a pain in the arse when trying to use the software that controls it. The volume controls are not reliable, and I have found the network connection unreliable, making it difficult to use some of the programs. I do not recommend this product unless you have access to HP support 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought this for my daughter who is 5 months pregnant and had to return it. The problem is the case itself, it doesn't fit her perfectly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You can use the CD player and the cassette player in the same car, but they won't play together.  I'd suggest buying a stereo system which has two players 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would not buy this for a personal computer.  The only thing that saved it from a complete failure was the fact that it could not be ejected.  I had to turn the computer off and on again, several times, to get it to eject.  It would not eject when the power was on.  For this price, I expected a few more features.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very happy with the product and the installation of the CD.  I wanted a DVD burner that was less expensive so I could burn my favorite DVDs to my computer.   The DVD burner worked fine for a short time but when it came time to burn my DVDs to the hard drive it would randomly go into the sleep mode.  This would cause the computer to restart and would then stop functioning.  The best thing I could do was to purchase another brand of DVD burner.  Not worth the money for a bad DVD burner 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This cable is a nightmare to use with an iPod. I would never use it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD case does not protect the CD, but it does protect the speakers. I bought this because it had the best warranty. However, the speakers will not stay in the case while playing. This is very annoying because you have to remove the case to clean the speakers or you will have a noisy mess on your desk. I will not purchase this product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this with the expectation that it would not interfere with my ipod and not require any extra software to use. I was wrong. I will not be ordering from Amazon again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received this as a replacement for my Canon PowerShot SX700.  I tried several times to get it to work, but it wouldn't turn on.  The only way to get the printer to print was to remove it from the wall, which is an extremely expensive option in the city of San Francisco.  If you can get it up to a power output of 200 or so, it will print fine.  There is also a small print problem if you print to the right side of the printer, which I have seen in other printers.  Overall, I will not buy this printer again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for a new iPod because it has an internal battery.  However, it doesn't work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had to send in a replacement, which is a shame.  The iPod shuffle was working fine, and the iPod nano worked fine, but the shuffle would not work with any of the iTunes software.  I did not get any error message on the computer.  After several attempts, I finally managed to get the iPod shuffle to work.  Now, when I plug in the shuffle, the iPod will boot to the iPod logo screen, which appears to be a Windows XP logo.  This is very annoying, and I can't use the iPod because I can only type in the program "iTunes" 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just got it today and have to tell you this is a pain in the ass to use and is VERY slow. I have to stop and turn it on and off several times a day just to get it to work. I've owned many printers in the past and I have never had problems with it. The problem with this printer is the ink cartridge.  You can see the tiny dot in the center of each cartridge and it is very difficult to use the cartridge if you don't have the paper with you.  It is impossible to use any of the programs that require you to have the cartridge with you, like the Adobe Acrobat.  The cartridges have a very small margin for error and they all seem to be the same size.  This printer is junk.  I'm going to return it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered this to be my new TV.  I tried the DVD player and it worked for about 2 hours.  Then it would not power up and I would have to go back to it.  The remote did not work and I had to order a replacement for it.I am so disappointed.  Do not buy this unless you intend to use the DVD as a remote.  It is NOTHING!  I am looking for a replacement, but I don't want to spend $80 to replace something I can get for $10. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this case to keep my iPod, but it has a big hole in the center. I thought I had fixed the problem by putting the case on a new one, but the hole is still there. I don't think it's worth trying to repair this case

It is not supported by Windows Media Player (WMP) and cannot play CD's at all.  I have sent Amazon back the defective CD player.  If you get this drive, I suggest not using it because of the risk of a virus.  Amazon will not replace the CD Player for a defective one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very disappointed when I received this product.  I had been looking at other vendors options (Samsung, Lexar, etc.) and I am glad to see the seller was a genuine HP customer.  My new printer had no connection to the printer or its power source.  It did not work for two days.  Then it started and the printer stopped printing.  The HP technician did not help me.  Don't waste your money on a bad HP printer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The radio worked well with my Sony Walkman but stopped working after about 2 months. I bought a second one at a big electronic device store in order to try and get it back on the air. It is a different model and doesn't come with a manual.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It is nice to have an HDMI that has the option to use the optical out port. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The optical out is only an option if you purchase a model with the optical input. Otherwise, you have to use a "regular" video cable to get the audio signal. I bought one of the "mini" units that has both an optical input and an audio input. I tried it with both the optical and the regular cables and both ended up in the same spot (on the floor) for an hour or so. I had to return it because the HDMI "mini HDMI cable" I bought did not fit properly, but that is the least of my problems with this product. The fact that it is only a "mini", not "mini+", connector is a problem, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product does not have any kind of label on it and the label that came with the product is very small.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have tried using two different Amazon products, and both have failed miserably.  The Amazon Echo has always worked fine, but the Amazon Fire TV would constantly stop working, sometimes for minutes, sometimes minutes and minutes.  I've returned both, and Amazon refuses to replace the defective unit.  Amazon, for goodness sake, please fix your products.  If you're looking for a good Amazon device, look elsewhere.  There's a reason Amazon charges more for Amazon Echo products than they do for Amazon FireTVs 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is not a true sata connector, so it won't fit in my system, unless I buy a genuine sata-to-sata adapter.  It's a cheap plastic-on-metal connector, and it's cheap for what it is.  You won't get better value for money with a genuine Sata to Sata adapter 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought them for my wife and she wanted them for her phone.  The reception was great when I installed the antenna.  Then I realized that it was the antenna and not the phone. So when I returned it to Amazon for a refund, I was given a refund for the antenna (because Amazon considers an antenna "part" of the phone).  Amazon does not want you to know that an antenna is required to receive the signal.  Amazon's customer service is not great.  Don't buy these because they say they're "airpondable".  Don\'t believe Amazon.  It's a waste of your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product does not support the internal memory card I purchased to hold all the photos I take.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These batteries don't hold much charge, so keep them away from your electronics.

I would definitely avoid this battery unless you plan on keeping your electronics plugged in all the time

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had a Sony mouse on sale for a couple of weeks.  I wanted to keep it and used my new HP mouse, so I returned it to Amazon and bought the HP mouse.  Unfortunately, Amazon didn't honor my return.  It is a pain to use.  Not only does it look ugly, but it doesn't work.  The buttons don't work, the scroll wheel is broken, and the mouse itself is not reliable.  Amazon's customer service is a joke.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You get what you pay for. It's an ok piece of plastic, but not great for the price. It is however great for someone to lose or damage.  You have to be really careful what you use it for.  It will hold your ipod for quite a while but you'll need to be careful not to rip the battery out.  Also if you accidentally drop it you can get a bad one, since it is so thin.  The ipod is not waterproof but is a good case for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a dvd player that I will never use again.  The sound is ok, but the battery life is horrible.  I've seen the other reviewer mention that they've replaced the battery and it seems to be a little more reliable now.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product a few months ago and when it came time to hook up my new printer, I discovered that the cartridge that was included in the package is not the same one that was originally purchased by the manufacturer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I tried to install it and I'm now wondering if I did something wrong.  It has no support for VGA, it has no drivers, it doesn't have a switch.  I wish I hadn't bought this.  If you have an older machine, don't buy this!  I've had it for a week and it still works for me.  The other thing is it's a pain in the ass to use.  Don't waste your money on this.It is worth a try but if you have the problem it's probably a software problem with this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am very disappointed with this product.  I expected something better than an iPod nano.  It's just OK.  The buttons don't work, the battery life is not great and I have had a lot of problems with this in the past few months 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had this product for about a year.  The software update on the remote doesn't work anymore.  I'm not sure what else is wrong with the remote, but I've been looking at the manual for other remote controls that have worked for years.  My recommendation is to stop using this one.  Don't waste your money.  It's a waste of money to buy the remote for the money you can get from the other manufacturer.  Use something else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only reason i bought this product was for the sound.  I have 2 of these and they both sound great.  The problem is the batteries.  You can only have 4 in one battery at a time.  If you want to have more you have to buy 2 batteries for 2 speakers 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this with my Amazon Prime plan. The picture quality was ok, but it would be annoying if I had to constantly plug it in and out. I would have to turn the unit on and off every 30 minutes or so to keep it from burning through the batteries. I am a heavy user and the only reason I got the Amazon Prime service was because I want it to be plugged in all the time 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These things do not hold up to much.  It is a waste of money.  You have to keep on using the cables until it gets hot.  I don't know how to measure the temperature, but it does not hold it anymore after 15 minutes 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is really bad.  I would never recommend a piece of junk.  This is the worst product I've ever purchased.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I tried this product on several times, and it wouldn't power on my Dell Latitude N5220.  The only way I could get it to power on was by using the CD burner in conjunction with the product's onboard processor, which I'm told is the same chip as the Intel processor that powers many of Dell's consumer electronics products.  Don't be misled, the product works with any Intel-powered CD/DVD burner, not just the one I bought.  If you buy this product, do not use the CD that comes with it, as it will not work with this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this radio in April of 2006. It was very slow in operation, but it did have an antenna. I wanted a different antenna. This antenna did not work with this radio, it did not get the signals, and it was a waste of my money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The radio is OK, but the CD player that is supposed to hold it has problems.  The CD player itself does work for a while, then the radio will not hold the CD.  I have not been able to get it to work with my CD player anymore.  It's a waste of money to buy this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to play DVDs, and have not been able to find a good electronic device for it. The sound is okay, but it is too sensitive to the DVD player, making me skip through the disc and accidentally skip past the DVD. The remote control has no range, so you have to use it on the floor, or in a chair or something. I would not buy this item again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had several of these units and now the only one I have that is not working.  It has a bad antenna and the radio doesn't work for anything.  I have a radio that works great with my other antenna so I can't imagine the problem with this one.  The battery is a joke.  Don't waste your money.  Buy a different radio or get something better

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have tried all of the different kinds of adapters that they sell on Amazon. They all seem to be in stock.  I would never buy something unless they were available in store.  The thing that really irks me is the fact that Amazon is selling it at a huge discount because it is an Amazon branded product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am using the Sony mp3 player that was shipped with the case (it's a Sony model).  I purchased this item on a lark and thought I'd try it out before returning.  It seems to be ok for mp3 playback, but it will not record on the computer, i.e. it will freeze.  I have not heard of any other cases from Sony that would be able to withstand the strain that my unit will put on the case.  Sony MP3 players don't come with cases that protect the speakers.  A lot of the other MP3 cases that I saw on the shelf at the electronics store looked to be made of a lightweight plastic.  My mp3 case is made of cardboard.  So far it has not lasted much longer than other mp3 cases

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered this product as a replacement for my old "Sony earbuds", which have stopped working.  The earbud is too small, and I was not able to fit my ears in the right position, which caused a loud ringing sound in my ears.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I am not a big fan of CD/DVD players.  I used this player for about a month and after that I switched to an external drive.  My disc player is still working but the sound quality is horrible.  If you don't need to have your discs in your CD/ DVD player, then I would not suggest this player.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had this antenna for 5 months now, and I still have not received any reception.  I had to replace it with the exact same antenna because the reception is just so terrible.  If you plan on having the antenna for a year, you better not waste your money on this antenna.  This antenna is not worth it at all.  Don't waste your $20 bucks 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't know how many times I have tried this product and it is never worked.  It does not work in all regions.  I am looking for something that is a bit more reliable but if you have to use this product on the network, you will find the problems on your network.  You can't use it on the internal network because it will not work.  My advice is to buy a Cisco product that is certified for internal use 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I don't use any DVD's but these, so I had to return them and buy another one.  You need to buy another model of DVD player.  Don't buy this because it does not work.  Buy another brand, it works great.  This one is useless.  I am returning it and buying something else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased the printer because of the features it offered and my hope that I could print at the cost of my $30 printer.  Unfortunately, the printer did not deliver on that promise.  The printer does not print well at all and the cartridge is too expensive for the printer to be worth it.  I returned it and am trying to get it replaced with a cheaper model.  If you're looking for a low cost printer, avoid this one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD player was not functioning in my car. The manufacturer had me return it.  I returned it to Amazon and they shipped me another.  The new one worked for the first month, but stopped working after 2 months.  Amazon will not honor returns, so I have no recourse but to try Amazon again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my product and it worked as expected.  The sound quality is average at best.  It's also quite slow.  For example, in the last two weeks, I had to restart my system at least four times because the volume levels kept changing.  This product definitely needs a better sound system.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I tried this product out after reading the reviews here and was very disappointed.  It took some time to get it to work.  I did eventually get it going.  However, the sound quality is very bad.  My husband had to turn off his car stereo because it was so quiet.  He bought the speakers for $80.00, and the sound is $200.00.  If you can find better speakers for your money, do it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very surprised when I received the package.  The case is very thin.  There are not even any pockets.  I expected some type of protective cover, but this does not work.  It is very hard to open.  Not only that, the case is not fully waterproof.  This product was not a good electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very skeptical about purchasing this card because of its limited capacities, but when I received the product, I was surprised to see that it was actually full size.  However, since I didn't use the "mini" versions, the performance was much worse.  If you don't need the mini versions, this card may be worth trying, but don't waste your money.  Don't get it, unless you want to have the best performance for your money, which is doubtful at this price.  I'm looking for something with more performance. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this card and the card does not work properly.  I am using an Asus M2A motherboard.  The card does NOT WORK ON ITS OWN!  I can't even power up my computer because the card is too hot to touch.  Don't buy this card unless you want to pay a big sum for a new card!  It does not support the ATI card, the only ATI card it supports is the ATI 6300M, which I am NOTHING but pleased with because it has a much better heatsink than the Intel/AMD card! I hope ATI releases a replacement ATI card that supports the 6300!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product for a client and it didn't work for them.  I sent it back to Amazon and they shipped me a new one.  The only thing that worked for me was the "power saver" feature.  Amazon has it listed as a "feature" but the description doesn't mention it.  They should have included it when they sent me the original one back 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It's not very clear what the difference is between the "Lite" and "LITE+".  They both have a different size, weight, and shape.  If you have an older laptop that's slightly bigger than this, don't buy this product - they will not fit.  It will not even fit in your laptop case, let alone your bag.  I returned it and bought something else

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have tried several brands of the memory card in the past and always have returned them because they were damaged. This memory card is the first time I have ever experienced something so serious.  I was able to return the card for a replacement, but I was told the replacement would cost $50 more.  Needless to say, I will never buy from Sony again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have not yet installed the network antenna but I've read and seen that it has the ability to work with the "airwave" technology to receive and transmit signals. This would mean that it is actually possible to have a complete duplex with the antenna and radio, but for the time being, I'm keeping it because the radio has no reception and I don't need it anymore

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have a Canon Rebel with a Canon DVD player and an M-Audio cable, which is both very reliable and also has a remote.  It was also a Canon product, so I thought I'd be protected by Canon.  What I didn't know was that Canon's remote, while having the same buttons as the Canon player, has different buttons for volume up/down and for play/pause/stop.  So the M-audio remote controls both volume up and down, which results in no volume buttons on the M9.  The M- Audio remote is also the same as the remote on the Canon DVD.  I had to send the M7 back to Canon.The M9 worked fine for the first month or so, but after that I got a new Canon DVD-Player, which didn't have volume up or down buttons.  Finally, I got rid of the M8 because it wouldn't play DVDs anymore.  Don't buy this remote 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm a professional sound engineer and I needed a way to record and play back my MP3 files without having to carry around a large, expensive laptop.  The product failed on me in less than 24 hours!  The volume was reduced on my MP9 files (128kbps) and the sound quality was horribly distorted!  I returned it within a couple days of receiving the defective item and am still trying to get a refund from Sony.  Don't buy this product!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just bought this as an alternative to the generic cd player I was using and I am disappointed.  It doesn't hold a lot of mp3's or play very well, I have to adjust the volume.  You might get a little more out of this than I did because the mp3 player is quite cheap, but if you want to use your mp3 collection on this player you should go for a CD player.  I was also disappointed because it doesn't have any kind of auto power-off feature.  This thing just doesn't seem to work 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My Sony VAIO PV3 was having trouble with itunes, but I bought this because it had a remote.  I used to have itunes work fine with my mp3 player, but when I tried to use the mp3 remote with this DVD player it refused to recognize it, and wouldn't let me control it (and I can't really do that anyway with mp3 players).  I returned it, because the player itself would not work anymore, it just refused to play the DVD that I had given it to itunes to play.  Itunes now gives me the option to send it to Sony for repair or replacement.  Don't buy this remote if you are a beginner because it is not user friendly

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My original Sony DVP-CXB05 was on its way to me in a few months.  I just received it today and it has the same problem as the other review.

Don't buy this one unless you have a more expensive radio.

It will record the name of the person calling and then the name is repeated on the screen.  Don't waste your money.  If you really want to make a phone call you can buy a better phone.  The Motorola ones that come with it are good.  But I will not buy a Motorola because this one is a complete joke 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have bought several Sony products in the past and have always been pleased with them.  The earphones that I received for review, however, are defective.  I was very disappointed when I discovered that I needed to return them and purchase a new set.  My first pair lasted one month and then I decided to return and purchase the same set again because I wanted a different set of earphones.  Sony does not do a good job in customer service 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The battery that came with the laptop is not rechargeable.  It has a 6 month battery life.  The unit also has an antenna that is very weak.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The case is not as advertised, but it's ok for my $20 phone case.  It's a lot of room for the battery, but not enough for a full charge.  I don't want to charge it every night, so I'm just gonna keep it charged the next day.  Don't waste your money on this case!  I will never buy another case that will charge my phone unless it's clear what it's capable of and has an extra room to hold the battery 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this card for my new ipaq.com system and it works fine until the moment you want to take a picture.  Then it freezes, takes 30 seconds or so to start and you have to wait until it starts and works again.  I think it is because the card's internal memory is not very fast.  If it's not working, just leave it alone and try again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for a cheap way to record my own DVD to my computer, and this is a great buy for $5.95.  I am using it with an old HP DL24 running Linux (Ubuntu) and have had some trouble with it.  The first problem I had was it would randomly crash or stop recording if I was running an OS other than Windows XP (which I have installed).  I had to reinstall the operating system to get it back to working.The second problem I have had with it is it does not support the DVI output.  So far, I have only been able to record with the D-Link brand DVD recorder that I purchased.   I will not be using the HP brand DVD recorders.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You have to have a very large player, and it's too big to fit in my car. The sound is mediocre, and the software is a total joke. I was given the software by a salesman and it has all sorts of terrible suggestions. For instance, the software recommends "scanning" the entire disk, but the disk itself isn't even a compact disk. I can't even open the software to scan the disk. It's a joke! The software is so bad that it actually breaks the disk in half when I attempt to remove the drive

I am in the habit of turning the volume up to maximum (and turn the speaker down a bit), and the sound is a bit more distinct.

I have a HP printer that was manufactured a few years ago and has always worked well with the HP software.  This printer would not print anything.  The color is extremely low in the photos, and when I tried to print some documents, the printer refused to print.  It would print only a few pages at a time.  If you're considering buying this printer, I would be highly advise against it.  My advice to you would be to buy a HP ink cartridge or another brand that can print well.  A lot of HP customers have this problem with their printers, but it is not a serious problem for HP printers 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This card is not worth the money at all. I will not buy another one.  The card is very flaky and I have not had any success getting it working with Vista or XP.  I would never buy another product from a bad manufacturer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this item in hopes it would work. I purchased it at Wal-Mart as a spare to replace the old, broken Sony player. Unfortunately, it does not. It does however have a better sound than the previous Sony player, which I bought for $10 cheaper! The problem is that the antenna is in the wrong position, making it impossible to receive FM radio stations. If you have an FM antenna, please keep it in the same position as the antenna on the Sony player and avoid this item! If you don't have an antenna, don't waste your money! I will not purchase this item again. It is more than likely not compatible with any of the other radios I have and I would not want to use it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These headphones have great sound, but have a terrible fit.  I'm a 32" female and I've tried several different sizes and they all seem to be way too small.  It is hard to even put them on, let alone listen to music.  Don't waste your money.  You can get better quality headphones at the same price 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My old Sony Walkman Mini did not have any problems with the CD player.  I bought this CD player because I wanted a smaller, cheaper player, and I'm not satisfied with it.  It is way to loud, it cuts out some songs when I play them loud, and it is very unreliable.  There's no way I would purchase this product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This radio is not even functional.  The sound is terrible.  There is no way to select stations without using a remote.  I will never purchase this product again.  Save your money and buy a different radio 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this product for 4 months and I can tell you that I do not like this product.  The signal strength is OK, but I have been experiencing problems with it's ability to find a good signal.  I purchased this product because of the good reception I received from my previous Samsung product, the S6NU, but it's not quite the same.  It is very weak in my house (on my kitchen TV) and I cannot get the signal to come in.  Now, I am not an electronics expert, so I don't know exactly why this is, but my assumption is that it's because it's an antenna.  If this is the case, then I'm sure there are a million other people who have the same problem and they could probably get a better antenna at a good electronic device like this one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because it was cheap, and it was advertised as an FM transmitter.  But the reception is not very good.  It is more like FM reception with a weak FM signal, which is a little disappointing because it is a lot more expensive.  I was hoping for better reception, but alas. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I ordered this product from Amazon.com and was surprised when they shipped me the unit after 1 day and I had not received it.  I called Amazon customer service and they told me it was my fault.  Don't buy from Amazon if they don't do a good electronic device first.  Amazon's customer service is horrible.  My TV was delivered after one week but the product is still broken.  Very disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this thinking it would have a better range than my old Panasonic model.  It didn't.  I also thought it would be quieter than the old Panasonic.  Well, it isn't.The only good thing is that it's smaller and lighter.  But the volume is too low for my needs.  Don't waste your money.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got the item but after few days the player is inoperable. I have to use the included remote to change the channel and the player itself is inoperative. I suggest you do not buy this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is not a good mp3 player.  You will want to keep it on a shelf for the sake of it's looks.  Don't buy this player. I have a Sony player which works great.  I bought this player thinking that it would be better.  It's not. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my husband and he used it to listen to music in the car. He really liked the sound but the sound quality is very weak. You can tell when you have this product on because the volume knob is very small and the speakers can't get loud enough for any serious listening. This product doesn't have a volume control and it doesn't work with your car's radio because the radio is set to a very high volume level. This item is a complete waste of money! Don't buy this if you want to listen with your radio 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This item has an extremely high risk of damaging the sound card, and I have been told that there is no way to tell if the sound is damaged, which I believe is true. I have had my iPod mini with this product for two months now, and am still very unhappy with it. I am not going to purchase another product from Apple because of this problem 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for something better for my iPod, I was very pleased with the iPod shuffle and it lasted longer than I expected.  Now I want something better.  I had the old iPod nano and the earbuds did not last for more than a year.  This new iPod is way overpriced.  You will never get the battery life or durability of the old Nano.  Buy something from Amazon, Amazon is the best, the price is right and I will save you money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It isnt worth paying for the software to find the ip addresses. The product itself isnt very reliable, but it is an add-on so if you want to use it for the wireless connection it is worth it.  Don't buy this.  I bought this hoping that the software could find the addresses 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Not worth the money if you can get it for cheaper.  Only works on Windows XP but it can be installed on Linux, I guess.  I bought it from Amazon and it didn't even come with a USB cable to hook it up to my Windows PC.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have tried all kinds of wireless routers and the Linksys is the worst one.  You can't send any of the signal to it and it doesn't have any of its features.  I don't have a lot of time on my hands to try new routers, so I'm going to stick with the Linksxes. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is great for the price, but the remote itself is very hard to use. It is very slow and cumbersome to navigate around and search through menus.  The remote is very expensive, and not worth the trouble. I will never purchase a Canon product again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This antenna is junk. I had to use a different antenna, and the reception is way better.  Don't buy this antenna if you plan to use it to receive DirecTV. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been using this product for the past year.  The first time it worked I tried resetting it, and it did.  However, after that I had to do it every time I used the computer.  After that it did not work.  It's also very difficult to reset the CD player unless you have an AT&T phone line to reset it.  I would NOT recommend this product.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product worked OK for a couple of weeks, then it stopped working.  My CD player is an Sony CD player, so the Sony parts are a little harder to find in the parts section.  So, it might have been my fault, and I'm hoping that the company that made this product will help me get it to work again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This card is a total piece of junk.  It's not worth the money because it's barely working with my ASUS M2A laptop.  I've returned it.  Don't waste your money on this.  Better to get a brand name card

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I received my Sony mouse as promised. However, I have since purchased a more expensive one, which is much better in every way. I am now wondering why Sony did not give me the option of a better mouse when the first one I purchased did not work.  It is very frustrating to have to return something because the customer service representatives do not understand what they are selling and what is required to complete the purchase 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have 2 of these and they both fail to work. I will be returning them. I would never buy a Canon product from Amazon 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The DVD recorder is a piece of junk.  I lost my entire library because I forgot to remove it before leaving the house.  The only reason I bought this product is to use it to backup my home computer, which was already running a copy of Windows XP on it.  It has a crappy 1MB flash memory that will not last for a long time, and a mediocre CD-ROM drive.  If you plan to use this product to backup your computer, then do yourself a favor and buy a good CD-RW player.  Don't waste your money on this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My first attempt to hookup my new DVD player to the back of my car failed miserably.  The sound quality was OK, but the player's ability to receive the signals from my radio was non-existent.  I had to return it to Amazon for a refund.  Amazon's customer service department is notorious for its poor customer service, so I was rather surprised to receive a negative reply from a good electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just bought this and I don't like it.  I have a Dell 1550 and an HP dv2000 and both have different color profiles and both work well.  So I was a little concerned.  However, it does not have a "manual" menu.  Instead, it uses a standard "light" menu which is very confusing.  There is no indication when you have a new setting or change to a setting.  For example, the "custom" setting of "light on" could be "on" and the "off" setting could be called "off".  It would be nice if it would have a manual option to use the "manually" mode.  And it would be nicer if it could be turned off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I used it for several months, and then it stopped working.  It is the only one I have ever used that would not work with any of my other CD players, and it would not even work with my older player.  I've seen other people's reviews online about this, and they all agree that it is an expensive mistake.  Don't waste your money on it.  If you need to burn a DVD, just buy something better, like a player with a built-in DVD burner. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The headphones don't fit my ears very well, but this is not the reason they are not fit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for a portable mp3 player with the same functionality as my ipod but smaller, and the mp3s in my store were all at least 5" and could barely hold any music. The player arrived with a small label on the bottom with the model number. The label does not even fit my ipods. It is too small to hold the player and is too big to hold my ipads. The mp3 players in my local stores are made of a much stronger plastic than this one. I returned it and got an ipod. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this as a replacement for my original Sony receiver, and I was very disappointed in its performance.  First of all, the receiver doesn't have a memory slot to store discs, so when I insert a disc and pause the disc, I have to wait for the disc to be reset for the next disc to play.  The receiver also lacks a power input.  It is a great design and a nice addition to my stereo system, but if you want to use your CD player with your iPod, or even your MP3 player, then this receiver is a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These headphones don't have any protection.  The only way to protect them is to have ear plugs, but that doesn't really do any good since the earbuds are so close together.  So if you want to be safe, get a pair of real earbud headphones, like those by the Bose brand, which do. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The card did not work with my Windows XP/2003 64-bit system.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound is very poor. I had to turn it down several times before I was satisfied. The sound quality was okay when the CD player was working.  The volume was too loud for the songs I was playing. I have had many of these products. I'm sure they all have some problems, but the quality of this product is unacceptable.  I will never purchase another one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD player works well for the small player I have, but I wanted a more feature rich player for my large home theater.  I'm not a big fan of the iPod dock and thought it might make sense to have a remote for the CD player, so I bought this product.  It works fine for the little player, but the iPod is too big to use with the remote.  If you want to use the iPod with the CD players you'll need an iPod adapter, which is included with this product but not included with the player

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm on a low budget and don't have any of the fancy features of my other brand, so this one was a big mistake.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD changer broke when I put it in the car.  It was a minor annoyance to have to return it to the dealer to get a replacement unit, but not really a big deal.  If I had a problem with the unit, I would be much more careful with the software.  The unit will not start if it has any programs running.  I have seen a lot of other people have the same problem with this unit, and there is nothing that can be done to prevent this 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is OK but if you want to use it for playing DVDs, you need a DVD player.  It does not have a disc player connection.  If you want it to be used to play DVDs, the software is not supported by this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product does not work with the HP Pavilion notebook, which is manufactured from a different type of memory than the regular notebook.  The memory installed does not match the HP notebook.The product has an external power supply, but it is not included in the package.  HP's warranty doesn't cover this defect, so it's a very expensive repair job if you want to be able to use the HP computer at all.  I have had it for 6 months now and it still works, but I will be returning it because it is of no use to me anymore 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The card is okay, but the card does not have an optical drive. I guess I have to get a new one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This antenna is terrible!  You will waste a lot of money on this antenna because of the low signal.  I spent a ton of money to get the SONI-CXD antenna from Amazon, and it was much better.  If you don't live in a big city or in an area where you can get good reception, I would go elsewhere.  This will ruin your signal. If you live in an apartment or apartment house and you want to get a decent signal, get a bigger antenna 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm on a new HP laptop and purchased the new HP wireless card with the ability to connect to either a wireless network or a cellular network.  The connection is great for a short while, but then the connection drops to a very low signal strength.  This is an issue with the new generation wireless cards because of a recent firmware update that is being pushed out by HP to the network owners.  I had purchased this card in November 2011, and now it's in August 2014, and the signal strength is not at the level that it was at at when I purchased it.  If you are having problems with this card, I suggest trying the HP WFP65A for the same coverage at a lower price.  HP has recently added support for this new generation of cards, but they have not done a thorough job of updating their firmware to support this newer hardware.  They still have a good support for their previous generation cards, which has the best signal strength out of all of the wireless cards HP offers.  Don't be suckered into buying the HP brand wireless cards unless you really know what you are doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had this card for a year now and it's still not working.  The card itself is fine.  But it is a pain to replace the card with a different brand that is better, as they're both made by Sony.  I have a Sony NP-G700T with 512MB of RAM.  What I'm doing is putting it in my laptop and then plugging in the DVD burner which is connected to it.  You can see the burner and then press the power button to start the burner.  Then you have to wait for the computer to boot.  In my case, it takes about a minute.  Now, when the computer does boot, you get a black screen and then the DVD starts.  It's just a pain in the neck to keep it all together 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got a free sample of this from Amazon, and it was great.  However, the remote is very hard to use, and the buttons don't feel comfortable, so I wouldn't buy it again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It is very loud.  I used to have a Sony earpiece that worked fine.  This one does not.  It also has a very weak connection, which makes it harder to get a good signal from the receiver.  For my purposes, it's useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product a few weeks back and was not able to use it.

It is very easy to set up and use but the product does not work with the current version of Windows XP. I contacted the manufacturer and received an email back that said that I am not the only one who is having problems with this product. This is a very costly mistake by HP.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have used this product for years.  It was just a few months ago when the power supply suddenly died.  I was very happy with the power supplies on my previous ones.  But this product failed me in a very big way.  The power supply was still working and I was able to get about 60-70% to a few PCs, but then I started noticing the power consumption going up and down dramatically.  As I thought I might have had a bad connection with my PC, I restarted the PC and it worked, but the power level was down again.  Now, I am having to deal with buying a new power supply to prevent my next power supply from dying

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this item because the store had it in stock and it was a good price.  Unfortunately, it is not an ideal product.  First, I found that the product name on the label was incorrect.  The product has a label that reads "Warranty Card" and not "WPS."  I also noticed that it has two connectors which were not included with the product. (One is for a battery and the other is for an antenna.)  In addition, the product doesn't have an on/off switch, so if you have the product plugged into an outlet, you'll need to remove the antenna to use it.  I really wish I had not bought it because it is a waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got this product in March and installed it the very next day.  I have since used it twice.  The first time I plugged it in and it worked perfectly.  Now the second time I have plugged it and it just doesn't work.  It won't connect to the network at all and won't go through the normal setup process.  My ISP told me to return it and not waste my money.  Well, now I am having problems with it at home.  If it's connected to my network at home and it's a network that I can access at work, then it will always connect.  In other words, the only way I can see it working is if it is connected to the Internet

I was able to get it to function by using the built-in software from the manufacturer that allows you to customize the wireless connection between your Mac and the router.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this product as a replacement for my old DVD player, and it was a mistake.  It does not work with any DVD discs, and the menus don't work with them either.  You can only get to them by pressing "A" on your remote to get to the menus, which is very inconvenient and not user friendly 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because the previous owner had the same thing and had it fixed.  I'm sorry, but I don't think this is a reliable product, unless you can get it to play on an ipod with the same model.  There's an LCD on the front of the radio, but it's so small that you need to turn it up to get a clear image 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I'm not sure what to say about this, but I'm a big fan of the Sony MP-V1 for my camcorder.  I wanted a new recorder that I could record faster and louder than my previous model.  The MP-1000 is not that.  It's way too slow, and I have to turn the recorder on very frequently to get the sound to record.  Also, it doesn't have a battery backup, so I have no way to record while the power is off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I would not recommend this product for an Apple Mac.  The internal components are very flaky.  If your Mac is slow, this will slow your computer.  It is also very loud when used with headphones 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had a Sony PCE 6400D with a Canon S9500i. I needed a replacement and had a little trouble finding a generic name. I also had some issues with the connection of my iPod and the Sony receiver. I got a replacement Sony PCL6500A and the connection is much better.  If you don't want to be fussy with a specific brand of receiver, you will not get much from this unit.  I'd rather get a generic Sony receiver with the Sony PCl6500.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My HP ink cartridge stopped writing and I had to replace it.  The ink cartridge did not work with the printer that I bought for the printer.  It also has a very high cost.  I was looking at several printers with the HP cartridge, and I saw several with the same problem.  HP should be very careful with their ink cartridges.  They should be returned to them with no questions asked

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I got a replacement from Amazon for my faulty D-Link DVD burner and am very disappointed.  The unit I purchased as a replacement does not have the "burn" button that I was expecting, which means it does not function as a DVD burner.  I do not know why Amazon sent me a defective product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is a very low quality product.  It doesn't fit the car perfectly, it makes the speakers a lot louder than I like, and it is very slow.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had mine for about 2 months. I bought the antenna at Amazon and installed it. It worked for a while, but now it is inoperable.  The antenna is on the wrong side of the case.  It is not possible to get the antenna to transmit on the right side of this case.If you have an antenna on this case and you want it to transmit, it is not a good antenna. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had to return this item several times. I have seen some other reviews that have had similar problems. I think they were because the unit has a different color than the picture. I bought this unit because I have always had to have my DVD player to work, even if the remote is on the floor. Now I am returning it because I do not want to have to deal with it anymore. It is a piece of junk. I do have an older Panasonic DVD player that works without any problems. Don't buy this. It's a waste of money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to replace an older iPod that had been in the closet for 3 months and finally died.  The player works great, but it is so flaky that you might want to consider the older model.  I haven't tried the new one, but I did find the same problem on mine.  Overall, the player is a bit pricey, but if you have a newer iPod I'd try and avoid this one

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It worked for the first few months but has started to go out of stock for the sake of the few people who still have it.  I'm not sure what they could have done to make it work in the first place.  Buyer beware.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  It does not have any options to set the maximum number of simultaneous connections.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have a Canon MP-C1 that I love.  I bought this cable from Amazon for my Sony Xperia Z1.  It's okay, but it is far too short for my Xperia Z.  The MP-T20V cable is too short to hold the Z1, and the Sony earbuds also don't work with it.  Amazon doesn't sell longer cables, so I'm going to try a different brand from Amazon that does.  That's a little frustrating.  But the MP-Z10V is better.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound is OK, but it is a pain in the ass to use the remote with this product.  The buttons have to be pressed and held down and not just to navigate.  If you like a wireless mouse, this is a great product.But the remote is junk.  I've had several, and I find the same problems with them as well.  For the price of this mouse, you can get a better product, so buy something better than this mouse.  Don't buy this mouse if you want a mouse that works and doesn't make a big fuss in the middle of your house 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was hoping to get a better case for my PDA.  I have had other PDA's from the same company (Dell), but this one is the worst.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased the unit with the hope that it would provide a good wireless connection. However, the performance is not as advertised and I have been unsuccessful in getting it to connect to the radio, even when I have the radio connected to my laptop via an Ethernet cable.The unit is poorly made and has an unpleasant design. It is also very hard to get a clear signal. It also does not have a clear name and does not come with an external antenna. It does not fit my laptop well. I will be returning it. The unit is a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased this item as a spare to replace my previous Canon C300 which had failed to work with the same printer.  I have a Canon C700 with a slightly different ink cartridge that works fine with this product.  It was not advertised to be compatible with this printer, but the packaging didn't say anything, so I bought it anyway.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to hook up my HP printer to the network, and it never worked. The first time I tried it, I could see the HP logo, and I could print from there, but the program stopped printing and I couldn't get it to reconnect to the net again.  The second time I hooked it up, it worked but the print job was a bit off.  It took forever to finish printing and only then did it start printing again. So I can't recommend this for printing anything, because it just never worked!  It was a total waste of money, and just one of the few I've bought that didn't work!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is okay but for me the product itself is not worth it.  I have had to replace the product 2 times now, first for the product to not turn on, and then for the fan to go out of service after a bad review about the product.  For example, after 1 week of usage, my fans are dead.  Don't buy this product if you want a product that can only be replaced after 1 month of use

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have purchased this product for several months now.  I find it to be a pain in the rear for me to keep it charged and I have had to return it  several times.  The product will die before I have a chance to use it.  It will run out of power and it will require a power converter or plug in the power source to keep the computer running.  This product is simply not worth the money for a cheap product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product description does not include any mention of a 5V/2A output, so I have to assume that it is only available for 5V2A or 5V1.5A outputs. If you have 5V and 2A outputs, you will have to use a separate power supply to provide the 5V output to the printer.  I would have liked to have received a 5v/2.5v output option, so this product is not very usable

The second box went out within 15 mins. and the first one after 2 mins.The problem was not with the box but the cable that was used to connect the box to the computer.  It is a very cheap cable with not enough strain relief for it to work. The problem is the same as with the original product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for a way to have a portable CD player and I was disappointed.  My unit would sometimes only play the first song in a CD, leaving me with only the first few seconds or so to listen to the rest of the CD, or it would quit playing altogether when I tried to turn it off.  It does have an FM radio though, so if you want to listen FM and you don't want to keep the player on the road you can just listen to FM.  If you're listening to a CD that is less than an hour long then this is not a bad unit.  I had to return it and buy something else.  Don't waste your money

The first time I tried to write a negative about a defective item, I tried a different card.  My card worked fine for about 3 days before it started to freeze.  By the time I got it to work, it was in the freezer.  So for the first couple of months, I just didn't use it. I just put it in the bag and put it away

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have a Toshiba Satellite P2 that I use for both my work and personal computers. I've had problems with the unit on the two computers I've used it on. First, I did not like the fact that the software that I used to change the battery life from 24 to 48 hours ran out after only an hour or so, so I decided to replace it with the HP MediaPort that I have.  After doing so, my computer started shutting down because it could not complete any more processes.  The HP MediaLink was fine for my personal use, but I decided it was a waste of money to use it on the computers that I had to use at work.  So I am now using the Toshiba ACD1000S, which is exactly the same product but with the exact same HP MediaPORT software to change battery life, and the HP software that was available at the time.  I hope this will help me avoid another problem that I encountered when I tried to change my computer's battery, and I hope HP will release a new software to fix this problem in the future

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have tried several brands and am still looking for a good quality CD player.  The Sony is the only one I have so far to have issues with.  I had a bad one at first, but it worked after about a week or so.  It worked with a DVD player in my car but the remote control didn't work with the DVD player.So I'm returning this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because it looked good at the price, but it did not perform. I would not recommend this to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Don't waste your money. I've had two of these batteries and both failed. The first one lasted two months and the second lasted three months. I will never buy another one of these. They're expensive, not worth the hassle to replace 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  this item was supposed to be a 5 star item.  unfortunately, it is not.  the CD player is just plain junk.  its not reliable.  I will not be buying any more from Amazon. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These cards are junk.  The only reason I bought them was because of the name.  I have used them several times, and have gotten a couple of them to fail.  They have a very small amount of space for the software.  These would have been a waste of my money if I had found a good brand of memory card, which was available at the time.  It would have made a huge difference in my computer, and I'm sorry I wasted my money on these.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This card is not as advertised.  The card does not support any kind of wireless connection.  I'm not sure why it's not listed on the website.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for an iPod with a decent sound system but not too much weight to it. The first one I bought cost me $200 which I thought was a great deal. The second one was too heavy to hold it and I couldn't use it because I had to put it down. The one I had bought was a complete disappointment. The sound quality is terrible. The speakers aren't even that strong, which makes them useless for listening to music. I bought the original Apple iPod, which had a much better sound quality and was well worth it. I will never buy an Apple iPod again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You will not get a positive review about this product: The only reason I gave it a negative is because the product is not compatible with my printer. I tried it with both HP and Canon printers. Both HP printers do not work with the software and will not output anything unless I remove them from the printer. The software to support the product will not be released for this product. If I could do something about it I would 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only thing that can be positive is the sound quality.  However, the software is not user friendly and is VERY slow, especially when loading songs in and out of the player.  The remote does not have any options to speed up or slow down the playing of the song.  I will not purchase this product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is not rated.  The software to use it is extremely outdated, is not fully supported, and does not provide any functionality for the CD player to record from the CDs it contains.  It is an absolute waste of money.  Buy a better player.  For an extremely cheap $40, I think this one is a bit of a rip-off.  I'm giving it away.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You can see the video signal coming from the antenna, but not the signal strength. The antenna is not strong enough to get you the maximum signal strength possible 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this at a local electronic device store.  I'm not sure why they gave me the product, as it's not listed on Amazon.  Amazon says the product is available in all the right colors.  However, it's only available in a white version.  It's hard to believe they are not being sold by Amazon!  Amazon customer service does not answer my emails very well

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was very disappointed in the purchase of this product. I have no problems with my DVD player but it did not work with the CD player, CD changer, or cassette player.  The player did play the cassette but not the CD.  This is a serious problem, I would not recommend this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was looking for a cheap option for my iPod, and I couldn't find any.  So I bought this.  The only problem is it doesn't have any "stand" to keep it in place while it's being played.  If you have any difficulty with the iPod getting to your side when playing, you can get it back to "stand by" by turning the iPod off and on again.  But I wouldn't recommend this product for anything.  Don't waste your money on this product.  I'm not sure if the iPod is a mini player or not, but this product is clearly not sturdy enough to hold it up

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had no problems with my Toshiba portable mp3 player.  But when it came time to use it I noticed that the buttons could be slightly too sensitive.  I have the Sony PSX-X200 and I was really hoping for a better electronic device.  The buttons are on the right side of the player, which is not a great place to press.  On the PSX I have an extra set of buttons on the top to make it easier to press the right buttons 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Not much help, just an annoying electronic device that won't work with the ipod nano.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product is great. However, it is only a 50MB player, and is only able to hold 1,000 songs. I am looking for a 50,000 song player with a CD player, that is capable of holding 1,500,000+ songs

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had these batteries for about 6 months and have yet to see any real use. I have the cheapest possible batteries and they have lasted for 5 months.  They last longer when the battery is warm.  However, they only last about 5 to 6 hours.  If you like the battery but wish it would last longer I would buy a lower wattage battery. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been very disappointed with the quality of the iPaq. I have had 2 of them since they were purchased and they both failed to work and would not boot into OSX. I wish I would have waited for the iMac with built in DVD player so I could get this one out of the system. I am still a customer, however, but I would NOT purchase this again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I was thinking of buying this because it was cheaper than the other brands, but I had to return it because of my other cables. I had already purchased the cables and adapters, but still couldn't get it to work.  Don't buy these unless you really need them to work with your mouse, which is a rare case. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to replace the Sony CD player that had broken.  I got it in a week or so later and it is a complete waste of money.  It is too small and it lacks any kind of sound.  There is a lot of vibration in the speakers.  The sound quality is worse than the Sony player.  You should get a better player 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have a HP Pavilion PowerEdge PXE printer that has a "smartprint" feature that allows you to print from your home printer to your HP laptop via the network.  The printer had an ink cartridge that had dried up after one use, causing the printer to stop printing, so I had to take the cartridge out and replace it with a new one.  In addition, I had a problem with the ink cartridge being too thick, and I had also noticed the ink flow in the direction of the ink, which led to the paper curling in the paper.  I would suggest not purchasing this product unless you are willing to have it repaired by HP 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I had purchased this product for my wife for her to use on her laptop to play movies.  We did a few tests and it just didn't work.  The video worked in both Windows Vista and Windows XP but the sound was off.  I returned it and got the cheaper Panasonic DV-A2000 DVD player which works just as well.  Now I am looking for a better player. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have owned this product for 2 months. I have had problems with it. I cannot turn it on without it turning on, and it won't stay powered on without the power being cut off. It does have a power port, but it is only accessible by pressing a button on the side of the unit. I don't know if it is just me, but the unit is too small for an iPod, and the buttons don't work well enough to get the volume up/down buttons to work. It is also not waterproof. The product was advertised as being waterproof, but not for this price! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  Bought 2 of these and they are not very reliable. I have had problems with both mine and my friend's. The unit started working but quit and wouldn't go to sleep.The unit was not connected to my laptop so I couldn't test it, but I did try to use the unit with another laptop and it worked. I'm disappointed in the design of this product, it's not very user friendly, not as cool as the more expensive products. I don't recommend this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these to replace an old Panasonic 12.1 cd player that failed after only 2 months. I expected to be able to watch movies in the dark, but it turns out that this player does not have an optical output.  It is completely useless for watching movies in complete darkness, and I now have to buy an external DVD player for my next electronic device.I would not recommend this player to anyone, as the lack of an optical input makes it totally useless for the purpose of watching movies!  I'm going to return it to Amazon for a refund, and am very disappointed in their customer service

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have been trying to find the iPod Mini with a larger battery for my new Sony mp3 player.  I did a search on Amazon.com and found a Sony mp2 player that also included a battery that was compatible.  Now I have a larger iPod Mini, but I will be replacing the battery with a Samsung battery that is smaller.  The mp2 is great, but the battery is too small for my mp3, which is the main reason I bought this product.  Hopefully I will find a better battery in the future, but for now I will have to find a battery from Sony or someone else to get the mp2 to run in my car 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My Dell Inspiron 7500 was damaged after only two weeks. The fan stopped working, but not before I replaced the power supply.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  These are not what I expected at all. I had been looking for something that would keep my ipod and mp3 player from falling apart.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This card does not work with Windows XP (I do not have the version of XP with this card).  The driver is very slow.  The card is not compatible with XP's native disk formatting.  I have tried both the Microsoft Windows XP CD and the Ubuntu version of Linux (Ubuntu 11.04).  In both cases, the disk format option was disabled.  Do not buy this card unless you have a genuine Microsoft Windows 7 installation disk.  If you do, you will get a great deal more performance from an equivalent Kingston card.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The first time I used the product I was totally disappointed.  It was an instant mess.  If you are buying this product to use a scanner you will need to buy a new one.  I have had several in the past 6 months that have not been able to scan.  Don't waste your money on this one

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this because I have an older Canon Epson printer that's not supported by Canon's new software.  I don't know why Canon stopped supporting this, but since it's an older printer, it may not run well with the latest firmware (11.05) of the product line.  This is a shame, because it was advertised as being supported by 11.05. The software (S5CX) is a total disaster.  It can't open PDFs, or even open a simple Microsoft Word document with any kind of clarity or accuracy.  If you have an Adobe Acrobat reader, be prepared to have to re-open Adobe's document every time you save a page!  I had to turn off the feature completely in order to have a normal functioning printer.  Don't waste your money! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I purchased these cables for my Sony digital cam, which I use for shooting videos.  After about 3 months of use, they began to get stuck on the screen and needed to be unplugged.  It's not a big deal since you can just pull them out of the socket.  But since they are so cheap and easy to lose, I returned them 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I just returned this item. It is a shame because it is the best antenna I've ever used. However, it is very sensitive to the signals and it can't tune in the correct direction with any frequency. I tried several different antenna types, including a cheapie from Amazon.com, and the best one is the Sennheiser brand.The reception is very poor for the band I use (2.5Mhz) and the reception is worse for the higher frequencies (40Mhz).I also have a Sony radio, which has better reception, and it is only $30.00 less. The antenna is not worth the $40.00 I paid for it.If you want to receive FM signals, buy a radio with a more powerful antenna. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product does not work on my Sony A900.  I was advised to contact Sony.  But they don't have any way to contact me.  The only way I can get it to work is to call Sony customer service, because I do not have their number 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  You will get more than 2 channels at half the price if you buy this, but the picture quality is lousy.  I've had to buy an external antenna to get my picture to look good. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This product is made to be compatible with any type of DVD.  But, if you want to burn a DVD to a blank CD or DVD and use it with the DVD recorder (which it does), then you must burn it to a single disc.  It is not an option to burn multiple DVDs to the same disc and the product does not support burning of discs that are not made to play with it.  The product is useless.  Buy another product that works, such as the Toshiba DVD player or the Sony DVD recorder 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've tried them on several of my computers, and it is a complete waste of money.  It does not record and is very slow, so I would not recommend this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The cd player doesn't play CDs and it's impossible to eject the CDs. I just got it because it was on sale. It is not worth the money. It was in my husband's car for 10 minutes while we were driving and then he just threw it away

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I use the iMac G5 in the front office and use it only for browsing. The mouse has a rubber pad that slides around the trackpad. It does a poor job of grip and has a tendency to slide down the track pad to where it is not safe. The trackpad is also quite sensitive. I'm considering switching to the Logitech MX 5 Pro because it has an adjustable mouse pad, rubber grip, and the trackpads are not so sensitive 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my wife's laptop.  We both tried it, and the sound quality was OK.  The problem is that it is very sensitive to ambient noise.  I'm listening to it in the living room, and when I turn it off, the volume goes from low to high within seconds.  It is a major problem because we have a small child, and it's a little bit too loud in there, too.  Do not buy this product, unless you're OK with it being sensitive to the noise.If you don't care about the volume level, buy something else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to help me with my DVD collection, but I soon discovered that it is useless for that.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've had mine for 3 months now, and it's now dead.  The software hasn't even been updated since  I bought it!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  My CD player stopped working after I installed the update.  I was told by the support staff that the software needed to be updated.  It was not an option to do this, however.  The unit would restart and go to sleep and then it would not work again.  So it will not work if you install the update before it restarts.  Also, the CD player now has a problem with the "seek" feature.  As you can see in the picture, the unit is not centered properly.  This can be very annoying.  If you use the CD changer, it is best to turn the unit all the way down and let the unit sit in its sleep for a while.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these headphones because they had a nice price, and I would like to have something that works for all sorts of different headphones.  They're not - they don't fit my ears all that well.  The ear cups are very small.  Also, the batteries that come with them are extremely expensive.  I expected them to last for a long time, and they don�t.  But it's worth the money to get the ones that fit.  Just be careful when putting them on, the wire will get stuck in the side of your ears.  It might be worth getting some ear plugs to help keep the wire from getting caught. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this card for the money but it is a very slow card.  It has a 1MB memory limit and the system would freeze for me to quit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I've owned several Apple products, but none of them were the product that is described as being "waterproof".  The case is actually very fragile, especially in the front and back.  I had to take it all apart to get the back watertight.  In addition, the case has a plastic front that's susceptible to scratches if you rub it against something hard.  If you don't take it apart every week, you'll end up with a broken screen.  For the money, the product seems to be more expensive than it actually is.  You might as well go with a better case or purchase an electronic device that's more durable.  Overall, the lack of water protection is a serious flaw.  The "water resistant" label does not mean anything, and if your case gets wet, it's no longer water resistant.  It's simply not water resistant
