Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing I can say about the movie is that it is too good to be true. The script is amazing, the acting is amazing. I don't want to spoil the movie by saying too much about it, but a good movie needs some good special effects. You must watch this movie, if you want to see good special effect from a bad film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The original Spider-Man has long since disappeared from television. Spider-man has returned. This incarnation does not disappoint. First of all this movie has no humor at all. I will not even begin to explain how the jokes in this movie are bad. This movie makes you want to punch your television every time the jokes fall. If you have ever watched a good movie with a good villain, this is not it. Instead this is like when a bad driver cuts you off in the middle of the road and tells you how awesome his new truck is. In other words, this movie is about as dull as can be. This would be a great movie for a comedy team to make but as far as I am concerned it is not worth watching. A movie like this should be made every once in a while. If there is a silver lining, it is that this version is much better than the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a film that is supposedly about a man with a grudge against a woman, the main attraction for the majority of the film does not have much of a personality. A man with no heart, or any personality at all, is an attractive thing to behold, but it gets tiresome after a while.   Some of the acting is pretty poor and some of the plotline is pretty stupid. There is nothing funny about it at all (I would say that it is a very bad movie if it were not so bad), but a very silly, slapstick, and very bad ending to a very stupid movie is a good way to end a bad week. I thought the main character and his girlfriend were very good, but I think a whole lot of bad people went into making this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie ever made. It's so bad it makes me want to hit myself with a mallet and die from the pain. It makes me feel like every film I've ever seen with a man with a gun has gone so bad, this is no exception. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a film that I could never really enjoy (a common problem with American action movies).  Despite that, this was still pretty entertaining and had a lot of interesting characters and action scenes.  For example, there was a good chase scene and one of the most intense fight scenes ever.  Also, the film uses a lot different action shots - which is a very good thing as it keeps the story going.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only movie I was actually interested to watch! (The other ones? I didn't pay any attention to them anyway). I am pretty sure that they are a parody of horror/comedy (with a black cat as a lead character)  I think that a lot of people find this movie amusing, although I did not find it entertaining (although I suppose this might be because I am only 20 years old...). I guess they are good at humor, but the film doesn't have much going on at all. It is pretty much just a bunch of funny lines, (the "I am not a killer" line is a good one...) and some cheap shots, (a couple of these shots are pretty funny, although not as funny as some of the ones that I saw in films such as "Friday the 13th"...). However, some of them are pretty good, some are very very bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical bad movie with terrible acting, terrible acting with really bad acting, and horrible special effects. There is also a really bad ending with the evil overlord threatening to destroy the galaxy and make everyone suffer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete piece of shit. You'd think that since it was an original story, it would do something different with it, but no, it's just more of the same - a stupid, stupid, and stupidly dull movie.    I don't care what the story is about. No one cares. You are stuck to a chair and the only way to go is forward or backward. No, it isn't the time to explain, it is too bad that no one cares about the story or the characters.   No one cares that a boy is trapped in a room with a clock that keeps stopping.   the only time anyone has any kind of reaction to anything is when they run up to the clock in a panic, get in it, and try to stop the clock. Well, that's the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story goes, it's about a boy named David who has a strange connection with a girl named Jessica who's an orphan...she's actually his step-sister because his mother died in a horrible accident. David's mother left him a letter telling him that a strange girl would appear, she was in the hospital and he would need to take her home...and that this girl's name was Jessica and that her step-brother was her boyfriend...David starts walking around the hospital looking for Jessica and when he finally finds her she's in the midst of a hurricane. David tries to call her but there's no answer...so he finds a telephone pole and tries to take a phone message from her, but when that fails he calls a friend of his to come over. David says he's not a very good boy so David tells the friend to bring Jessica over so he can show her a nice time...and David's friend, played by a creepy man named Peter Cook, gives him the evil eye. Jessica's step-father then appears and asks Jessica to marry him. Jessica, who never knew a husband, agrees to marry her step brother. The wedding is going to be a disaster but when the two boys hear about this David's reaction is priceless. This movie doesn't get better than this....the best bit about this movie is the creepy Peter Cook...I wish there was a video of him.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have a soft spot in my heart for any movie with an evil clown (or as one of my cousins calls him, a "Jolly good fellow" or a "Mr. Snooty"), a bad-taste, foul-mouthed, self-absorbed, bigoted, and totally un-American clown like The Joker. I'm a big fan of Batman and all its related characters and themes (though I didn't love The Dark Knight. A little too much soap opera) and I've often admired comic books (the first thing that comes to mind is a little girl wearing a leather jacket from the front cover of the second issue of the first issue of Spider-Man: The Animated Series - one of the funniest things I have ever seen. The only cartoon that I thought was funny was the Bugs Bunny/Lucky Duck movie, although the Bugs movie is the funnier of the two.) But The Joker is the real thing. The Joker does a number of things in this movie: He kills Batman (after Batman gets off the floor and turns his back on the Joker), he shoots and kills Robin (it's a really funny movie), he takes pictures of the bad guys and shows them in his photo booth (that's right- a real photo booth! That's what a photo booth is all about - the little people taking a real picture of a photo. And how did this guy get his name? A clown named The Joker, of course!) In the end, he's shot in the stomach and killed by Robin, who has to find a way to get into the photo booth so he can get another shot! He's a good guy. I do wish that Robin could have done more to save his friends' lives. Robin had trouble getting to the photo shoot and then he tried to go in the booth, but the door to the booth was locked. It was a long time before he was finally able to get in and get a picture, which ended up as the opening credits. I had really enjoyed the movie, but I do wonder if I would enjoy a movie like this today. As you can see, it was a pretty good movie at its time, but today it seems to be pretty bad. I mean, we have to keep in mind that the Joker never got his own show, or the movie even came out on TV until decades later, so why would you see such a bad comedy today? It was actually better
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In an unfortunate turn of events, a young man loses his wallet to a bus-stop in New York, which he'd recently stopped at. This is not a good thing for a guy who just happened to leave it in the bus stop to collect when he got off. The kid tries to get in touch with his family by ringing up an acquaintance and finds himself at the wrong house. The guy isn't home to see him so the kid calls the guy's brother, who doesn't show up. A week later the kid runs into a man who looks like he's a cop and asks for his wallet. As he does, he notices that the wallet is still in its original place on the bus-stand. The wallet is a valuable and precious item and as such must be used in a very important way. As the kid goes to see his friend who was at the last bus he saw, the man who was the policeman gives him the wallet. Now the kid is in possession of the wallet of an old police officer who's been dead for many years. The thing is, the policeman has a wife who is a woman of great power. She is powerful not only because she's a woman but also because she has a history of dealing with crime. This means she has the power to blackmail the old policeman into showing up and taking responsibility for his lost wallet. This was one bad move, but there are worse bad moves.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst kind of bad movie I can think of.  I guess I was expecting a really weird and weird looking creature.  I was wrong, it was really lame.    I think the idea was that it had a big red tongue and would come out of its mouth and eat you with its big red mouth.      The movie was so stupid and stupid that I had to turn the TV off, like the bad movie that it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The idea is pretty good but the execution is substandard. There are multiple scenes which should not exist and when the character is on screen and the dialogue is bad, it's almost hard to take it seriously. I think the reason that it is so bad is because it does not take itself seriously and it is almost like it has no heart. This is why there should be a moratorium on new films with such bad actors in them. This was made for the masses who have no sense of humor and a good film will not impress them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is called "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" and is based on the life of a little boy who has to face many problems in his tiny world.   A bit of a story about a little kid is enough to be more entertaining, but the acting is poor and the film doesn't get anywhere, just getting you to think about how little this kid has to deal with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved this movie.  It was funny, it was funny in a fun, weird way.   They were talking about a zombie with no head who would only eat people who are a little too nice and have a little bit too much money.  A zombie with a head and no sense of humor!        The story was kind of sad, but not in a bad way. It is a story about a young man who finds a headless zombie and has to decide whether or not to eat the corpse, or make him a sandwich and leave him as a "possession".   It was a little cheesy, but fun.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen and I can only hope I made a wise decision when I decided to check it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went to see the old Rob Zombie movie Halloween because it was on TV at one time. It was fun. I like Rob Zombie. There is a joke in the movie about a woman who tells Rob Zombie about a joke she just heard at a party. Rob Zombie says 'It can't be heard, so I don't know who told it'. She says, 'Don't think it can't. I heard it. It is about a guy dressed in women's clothes'. Zombie thinks it is a good joke. The joke is really good. The only real thing about it is that it ends with Rob Zombie saying 'So long'. It was good but I wish Rob Zombie could come out with a new film, I do really miss Rob Zombie! It is sad to see that most of his movies are really bad. His movies are always terrible and so are his movies, so it is like it is the same movie over and over again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a very bad movie. I saw it twice, as a kid and then again 20 years later, and it is horrible in every sense of the word. This is definitely the worst movie I have ever seen. The cast was a disgrace to the movies: they all came out and said they were going to do their own version of a Monty Python comedy (they hadn't a clue what that was all about), and they made a poor one; one of those dull, unfunny, predictable, cliched movies that they've got down pat nowadays: it's not really a comedy - it's more a comedy that they have tried to make a little bit less dumb. It is quite funny for a bit - the first part, where we see the entire crew together - a film from a long time ago - but then, it just becomes a disaster: the director is not the man to make it work - and it was a terrible mistake to hire him to begin with! The only people who aren't laughing are the actors! And they are all dreadful, dull, self-pitying, stupid people! They are the worst sort of people. But then there's the music: it is terrible: it has no rhythm and is so badly composed that it is difficult to listen to. The only music they were lucky enough to use is the theme from the BBC television show Doctor Who: I don't want to say too much about the story - because it is nothing special - but it is a waste of time. The film opens with a man sitting on the sofa in his bedroom - not at the end of a long day or a long night - but at the beginning of one of the most pathetic, unimaginative, boring, tedious and unimaginative films that I have seen since I last saw Monty Pythons in the 1970s. So much for Monty's genius - and with no trace of genius left in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a nice idea to play a game at high school...it's kind of a shame that the game isn't fun.   The kids are annoying in this movie, and it doesn't help that they're played by the same actors from the first movie, a good acting pair. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So I was excited to read this book because I'm from the South. I also saw movies like this a lot in the '50s and '60s. I didn't like it. I thought it was stupid, and stupid people always say stupid things. This movie didn't do any of that. I did laugh at several characters (mostly the ones with the funny faces) but I didn,t enjoy it one bit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible, terrible, horrible movie. I can't stand the terrible actors, the horrible special effects, the cheesy dialogue, and the terrible writing. It is the only movie in which I have ever felt so strongly in a film that it made me laugh through almost the entire first half. I had hoped the movie would be better, but alas, it is pretty much a non-entity.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this is the worst movie I have ever seen.  The worst part about it is the cast of characters they are putting on.  Who gives a crap about these people if they can't act, and if they cannot act, then why would you go to the trouble of making them?  Also it is pretty obvious to the audience that the story isn't real.   It all boils down to a story about a poor woman and her son in a post office.  This story gets a little convoluted and stupid in the end because the story takes place in the early 20th century and everyone seems to be in their teens and 20's.  I find it hard to believe that someone could get away with that crap and be able to make a profit off of it.  Now there is nothing wrong with a story of a poor mother and her child being lost in a lost and found post office, and that story is a beautiful and tragic story.  Well, the reason I didn't like this movie is the story.  That was the worst part.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending is a little confusing because, if you haven't seen it, it doesn't have much of a beginning, and the climax doesn't seem to have much to do with the characters at all. It just kind of ends.    I liked it for the simple fact that I love science fiction films and I love sci-fi stories, but it seems like a very bad attempt to combine the two. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not sure why this movie was made at all, and frankly I'm a bit surprised it made it this far. The movie has a few scenes that look impressive and even an original ending, but everything else is just mediocre. The plot is quite convoluted at times. The story begins when a man walks in a store called the Magic Door. He sees a magic card. He pulls the magic card out of his pocket and takes it inside. The guy in the store does some spell, and a mysterious girl shows up next to him. The kid tells the man to buy the card and the guy agrees, so the two go to an underground city and have a fight. Then the guy has an argument with his wife, and he takes a trip down into the sewers and the woman is kidnapped by the demons. He goes on a quest to find the card, and find a good way to save his wife. However, he doesn't find much help. The other heroes are either boring, incompetent, or just plain stupid. And there's only one way to win. Well, there are a couple of different endings (they end in a very unsatisfying way). The movie never changes any of the characters or their attitudes. That's a bit of a problem when you're trying to make a movie like this. Also, when the man found the card it was actually the result of a spell cast by a demonic entity called the Magus. However as we all know, demons exist and sometimes do things they aren't supposed to do. So the man, who is a former magus, uses his magic to break the spell and retrieve the magic wand from the Magu, which in the movie, turns out to be the Dark One and his "guardian angel", the Horned King. This is the movie's only big victory. Then we find out that the man was actually a spy sent by the Magis. He was told to steal the card by a man who would turn up in the future. The Magis then kidnapped the man and the man's wife and the card turns out not to exist. So what's a hero to do? Well, he has some other people from the past go back in time to find out what they can about the card's disappearance. The one who appears first is a young girl named Sara, and this is where things get really bad. It's obvious Sara's the type to end up like her mom. The older girl
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those awful movies that you know when you see it, but you don't really notice it until the end: a sad story about a man who gets killed in a car accident, and when the driver of the car reveals that he has been in love with the body he's been in, the film starts to unravel. A movie that really tries to be depressing (not that the "crappie" part is anything unusual), but is so poorly written that it comes across as a bad joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a very low budget movie with poor special effects.  I never heard of it but I'm sure this movie was made because there is a movie on this website that has a much better special effects and dialogue. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is actually the first movie that I have seen recently that I did not hate. There are many things about this movie that are just bad. However, it is not all bad. For some people, I do find this movie interesting. It has a real touch of adventure, and the characters are all likable. But for those people who are used to a certain kind of movie, this one will not do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was bored as hell while watching this movie, I watched it like 20 times in a row but I couldn't understand a single one of the characters.   What is so bad about this movie is that the main character has no personality at all; she looks boring and weird and she's a pretty bad actress as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was the most boring movie I've ever seen. I hate the idea of the movie, but the whole reason it was made was to see Michael J. Fox, but he was in a bunch of movies the same year. They had no idea what to do with him and the movie was bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know what the hell this movie is about. I'd like to watch a man fall through the sky in a helicopter. I wouldn't like to ride a motorcycle with that bastard, or drive a jet airplane at an airport, or climb a mountain in a hot air balloon...but this movie did nothing for me. It is kind of boring to watch and it was supposed to be really funny...how the hell could it be funny? The writing is atrocious, there was no music and there was a lot of bad acting. The ending really makes no sense to me...maybe it was filmed in an airplane in some country and there were two passengers who died? The movie is so stupid that I don-t know whether it was made in Canada or Italy...this movie could have been written by the writer of A Christmas Carol.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie where a giant space spider comes to earth from space to eat us all for dinner! And it turns out that the spider is so big, that it gets on top of buildings and towers and eats whole families for dinner, which must be one of the worst ways to live.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are moments in the third act that are pretty bad.  One in particular is a really stupid one.       There are things a big guy like him should be able to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoyed the film; however, this is an awful movie and it's a bad idea to put a story about a man in a tree on a Friday for kids. I would rather not waste a good Friday watching a terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am going to be the first to say this movie is terrible. I mean REALLY TERRIBLE.   It should be illegal for someone to make a movie with such horrendous acting and such terrible writing as this. If someone put this on tape and sent it to us for free, we'd buy it right away.  The movie opens with a guy named Jim Crow (Emmett Howard) who is being followed by a lynch mob, which is in retaliation for the fact that Jim has done something terrible to the town.  I guess Jim is a little mad because he has gotten a lot of trouble for something that he did.  Jim is running home from being arrested, when he gets into an accident.  He falls out of a tree and his knee gets broken.  A black sheriff takes Jim to jail where he is brutally beaten. Jim is then put to work on a plantation.  You know how there are white slave owners and black slave owners.  This movie goes a little something like this. Jim Crow is a very sweet guy who is in prison because he did something bad, but Jim is pretty much fine.  It was really not that bad of a movie.  As far as Jim is concerned, this is just one of those "one of those" days.  Of course, things get really bad when Jim gets out of prison.  Apparently, he has done some pretty bad things in the past and some of his friends think he is going to come back to town to do it all over again.  One of the other characters (Nancy, played by the fabulous Grace Jones) decides to stay with Jim to make sure he doesn't do it again.    I actually liked Nancy. I like her sort of feminine, yet strong, style.  She seemed like a good person who didn't deserve a beating just because she is a pretty girl.   The other characters didn't seem to be in love with Jim at all.  They sort of thought he was crazy and just didn't want to be around him.   As a person, I don't really care for Jim.  But as a slave, I actually did like Jim a lot.  And for most of the movie, he was a very nice and caring person.  In fact, it is pretty easy to see why this guy was a slave for so long.  There were a few times where he was actually pretty tough.  Sure, Jim was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the second in the franchise: "Big Momma's House", it is one of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen (the first being the very first film), but still one of my least favorites (I have never even seen the first one). I actually enjoy the film more than the first movie - I mean the first is so bad it just makes me laugh, this film is actually quite funny and makes you want to watch the second one as a sequel - and then that's not good at all either: the movie is all about how a guy, named Mike, gets an appointment at Big Mommas House to see his mother in the middle of nowhere (well I say "middle of nowhere" but really it's the middle in-between places). Anyway this guy ends up at the house, he's very nervous about his mother because Big Morm has been dead for 20 years (they bury her on a hill in the woods) and he has nothing to remember her by. He starts getting sicker and sicker, and the family is left alone to deal with his condition. One by one they do the funeral, Mike's mother, Mike and his brother are all in there when they get there and he starts to come out of his body. Well it's not actually his body, he just starts to feel his mother's body in his mouth and it's quite a shock - but not in a good way, you know what I mean? At all. I mean he comes out of the body and it turns out he's actually dead, but it's like that when you know he's dead and he's not. Anyway there's Mike in his body and he keeps on coming out of it until he finally gets it right, and by "right" I mean it's a little like when you're riding your bike and you're not really riding the bike at all, you're actually riding something that's bigger than you, but not quite - the bike stays stable because you're in it. Anywho, that's about the film, you've watched all this before so it should be a piece of cake and it definitely isn't. I give it a 2 out of 10, which is the same score as I gave the first film, and even with the comedy it just doesn't have the same "hits" that I remember from the first. This is the 2nd installment in the The Big Moms series by Robert Zeme
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found myself with a bad hangover, and decided to go see it anyway.   Well, this film doesn't have an easy time getting out of the theater, and after about 45 minutes I was wondering if I had made a bad decision.  At no point is the film exciting, which is not surprising given the budget and the talent behind the movie.  The story is a mixture of a bunch of cliches from the 90's, and while it was somewhat fun to watch I did not think it was all that engaging.  I don't think it ever makes me laugh out loud, despite being a film about a hangover that involves aliens and a giant bug.  This movie is filled with so many tropes I don' think it will ever be enjoyable for me, even after my first viewing.  But I have seen worse, and it didn't even have a plot.  It is an interesting movie with a lot of heart, and for a first time director it was quite entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While not as bad as some of its predecessor, The Room is still quite bad.  The plot is pretty much the same and nothing has changed since that awful movie made $10,000,000 on a very small budget.  There's a reason why this movie never even made it out of New York to Los Angeles:  The Room was not really in the business of doing anything interesting.   There were not any memorable characters (one of which is also one of the worst actors in Hollywood).    It's not really that good at making an old movie feel new.  In fact, the most interesting part of The Room  was in the ending credits. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So I was watching a movie with my son and after I had finished watching the movie my son looked at me and asked what did I see the last ten minutes of the movie for. So I told him I thought it was all over when the boy says "why are the horses jumping over the truck?" And then the truck starts to go backward and then it is reversed.  A bad movie at a bad time of the year, but a good movie nonetheless.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd describe it as being "a good bad movie."  It is about a guy who lives with a woman named Elsie (played by Helen Hunt), and her daughter, Rose (Cara Delevingne) who is a big fat longhaired blonde.  The movie opens with her complaining about her dad's lack of attention in the kitchen, and when his wife leaves him he calls Rose up to his bed and tells her to come.    This makes a lot of sense since Rose is the one who does most of the housework in the family.  And then her dad shows up wearing nothing but a mask, and she tells him to put it on.  He does and his face is so grotesque that she's speechless.  Rose.  She isn't wearing a mask!   But when she finally does, she's wearing a full-on woman's body.  So he takes off her mask and begins to molest her.  The movie follows his molestation of Rose, which goes on for several hours.  But this all takes place under the cover of darkness!  This is so stupid, I'm almost tempted to call it one of those "A-movie" movies.  What else is going on in this movie?  It was the perfect opportunity for Cara Delevingnes to do a few things: 1.  To be the "bad girl" (which is what she's supposed to be anyway) in a movie. 2.  That is, to have some fun with a man who has obviously molested her. 3.  Because the film is so obviously a ripoff of A Nightmare On Elm Street (there are similarities between both movies).   And I suppose that's where the similarities end.  This movie is a rip off of a very popular and well known movie of the same name.  I'd actually recommend it to those who like cheap horror crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never seen a movie that made me sick more than this one.  I guess there's a good movie for every sickness: I've seen people die horribly in movies before, but I never saw a zombie movie with such horrifying scenes.  That doesn't mean the movie is necessarily a bad one:  The ending is definitely predictable.  It's a film that gets its message across through its characters, not through its plot.  In fact, the movie isn't all that bad:  It doesn't make the zombie plague much worse, which is a good thing.  The movie does, however, seem to show a bit too much faith in zombies;  If it is just humans, then it would be ok (the main character and the main character's girlfriend are really cute in a creepy way)  The "zombie" parts aren't quite that bad, as they're all done very well.  What was really annoying, though, were the parts where zombies are showing off their moves.  Like a bunch of young kids, they try to do the thing that only zombies can do.  While they did pretty well in most scenes, I had to laugh at one of the "zombies" in a dance routine.  Zombies, I know you're bad, but don't be that bad!  There were several scenes in the movie where I really thought I was watching a documentary about the zombie pandemic.  Most people, when shown a movie like this, find it terrifying.  This is one of those movies that will have a lot of people shaking their heads, but not everyone will do that.  If you've been watching zombies, I strongly recommend Zombie Apocalypse.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I bought this movie because its trailer looked promising. Its a nice little movie. It doesn't really stand on its own, because its like 10 others like it. It was so lame I didn't want to watch it. The characters in this movie seem like they are supposed to be the villains. The only reason this movie isn't a 1 is because of the good parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie several times before but never with this cast and it is truly awful. The film is bad in everything it does. The story is ridiculous. One minute is a comedy scene where the three girls go to a beach, and then the movie cuts to a black and white picture of a woman standing in a field in a red dress. The girls don't want to go and the story keeps on going. Eventually the three of the four are at a wedding and then some crazy guy shows up who tells them the reason for their arrival and they decide to have fun. One of them ends up in an office where they do things like try to make a cup of tea.  It is only after they have all been through this ridiculous scenario that they decide not to go to the beach, but instead go to some other beach to have a picnic. At the end the three find a strange book. The book is strange in its own way. One would imagine that they are supposed to find some weird book. And when they start reading it it is like reading a normal book. It is in every way weird. It has a dog named Mr. Bones who is trying to go find some fish so that he can go back home to his people.  And then the three go back to the cabin and start to read. They find out that the book is about the strange man who goes into the woods to look for fish. Well the next thing we know the three are walking to the woods because they are hungry and they are being chased by a dog. The dog is actually a wolf who has been turned into a dog by a strange man. The men go to an old castle and try to stop the wolf from eating the woman and the three boys. When they find out about all the stuff that is going on they start to leave but Mr. Wolf is too clever for them. He starts turning into a strange beast and it takes them a long time to catch him. In the end they kill the wolf and it goes into some weird dimension that they don't like.  The ending is just ridiculous. It just keeps going. The only good thing about the ending is that it is a very funny scene.  I really hope you like this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In most films this is a plot device that will never be heard from again.   For the most part it's an excuse for the director to make a few cheap and stupid jokes.    It doesn't end, but this film just goes on and on...   -

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a little hard to get a good view of the movie, it's so short.   The best thing about it is that it has an interesting plot, the villains are very evil, and the heroes are good and all (a little bit).   This movie doesn't hold up very well, although there is a good plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was only 17 and this movie was so bad I was so depressed I just wanted to sleep in my pajamas. I could never think of any other reason to even see the movie other than to see that horrible movie about this stupid little boy who runs away from a group of bullies. I watched the movie about 3 times. I didn't want to because it was so boring. The movie was basically a movie about a kid who never thinks of anything besides eating.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would be more than happy to have an argument about this movie with the man who is credited with the screenplay "This is Our Youth." Well, let's just say it is not a good film.   This movie was made in the 60's so it has a lot of the trappings of the era. It doesn't have much to offer by way of originality either. It is a comedy about a boy from the suburbs who has a little friend, a girl from a nearby suburb, who wants to have sex with him.  It makes me sad because the young Tom Cruise and his friends are pretty much my favorites. I'm not really a big fan of comedy but this movie has a funny sense of humor that makes it worth watching and makes it very watchable. I will say though that this movie isn't very funny for long periods of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To those of you who enjoyed 'Cult of Chucky,' I suggest that you don't bother. This is the movie that makes you wish that a demon could eat from your intestines. No, I'm sorry that I just made that up. Anyway, this movie is the complete opposite of Chunky, the 'Cthulhu' slasher. I just don't get this. Not only is there no 'Saw' or 'The Conjuring.' This movie doesn't even have the sense to try to evoke scares from any of these classic horror classics. Instead, it makes all of the old films into the most silly, campy, 'Weird Al' Yankovic' type of films. I don't care who the director is and how much he's 'earned' with the success of 'Candyman.' I just cannot enjoy this movie. It's so poorly executed that it doesn't earn it's name. And that name has to be cursed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For the most part, the movie is uneventful. This is not much of a surprise though. This film is about a group of four school girls, and a groupie. What's really interesting about this movie is that at one point, the main character reveals herself to be a gay man. That's very unusual for these type of films. The acting is very weak. There are some scenes that are quite good. The soundtrack is just alright. The movie has a rather lame climax. However, it is still a good movie, if not very good in general.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember seeing this movie at a friends house in college (I had just graduated). We watched it in 3D, we were both drunk, we both looked stupid. It wasn't an enjoyable movie! I don't recommend this movie to anyone!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a sea of bad action films, the second half of the film is an anomaly. I'm not quite sure why this is the case, but here is a pretty decent film. The premise isn't much more than "a group of mercenaries band together to rescue their leader from an island prison." This is all the film needs: a group of renegades trying to get out of an island jail. And it doesn't disappoint. The villain is pretty much the only thing wrong with this film. He is a sadistic, despicable thug, but also the perfect choice for the film's premise: a ruthless villain that goes for the jugular. However, the bad guys never do anything that is truly evil: they are all the characters we're familiar with, if they were in the real world: ruthless bad guys, who don't even try to do anything new with their evil. Instead, they go through a number of classic bad guys (see: The Devil) who are forced to deal with the villain's twisted brand of justice. Of course, we don't get much of a sense of character development here: the mercenaries all seem to be running away from a bad situation, rather than confronting it. It seems like they are being forced to do the right thing by a sadist. The only real good character in this movie is a villain called a "Karate King," who appears in the third act of the movie, and is completely unsympathetic. The villains aren't much better. Although they have different motivations, the main villain all too often acts in an overly violent way, and only seems to be interested in killing the bad guy: he doesn't even bother to go after the baddies. All he really wants to do is see them dead. It also seems like the evil of the villains isn't as real as it appears. For example, the villain who takes over the group of bad guys during the last act has a tendency to break out of prison (as well as take some of them hostage) and go to the island prison. And the badguys actually go and kill him. This all feels like it's just one big joke: the bad villains are villains just like everyone else, but they all break out when they're being beaten up. You'd expect a hero to be more responsible for his actions than this. I guess this isn't a bad film, so much as one that's a bit of a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just finished this film. It's absolutely awful. Don't watch it. If your a fan of the first one I suggest you go watch the one that has a different ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is not a good movie to look at if you are looking for something good and original. It is like a bad version of a good idea. The film is about a man who has his entire life ahead of him, but when a beautiful woman is found murdered he is forced to start all over again. The story is rather simplistic and at times the plot can be really hard to follow, but the ending does provide a little bit of closure to this story. Here is a review by the critics: I like all the stories I saw, especially that of the man who must find a way to save himself from his own past, however I thought the ending was disappointing. I would like to see more of this sort of thing going forward. For those who enjoy a little dark humor and not all that bad a movie, this one might be their type. For me, I wanted to like it, but I didn't. I do like a good mystery movie but the final two scenes made me wish that the director would have cut back a little on the violence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst "moody" movie I have seen in a long time.  This is a movie about a kid who is not good at anything and who has to keep going to keep living.  The guy who plays the kid is not well developed.   His hair is a mess and he does not seem to be a happy guy.  This is the first time I have ever disliked someone and that is saying a lot.  I liked this movie when I was a kid, but I no longer like it now.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I was young, a good friend of mine who worked as a waiter at a restaurant and then later an employee of a motel told me about this little-known film starring John Wayne. I watched it on video (I think it was the VHS or the Betamax, as I can't remember exactly), and it was just a bad film; I mean, the script was bad, the acting bad, and the special effects were bad. I remember seeing the movie once before when John Wayne was on the television, and I remember how badly the movie looked and acted. It's sad how this film seems to get bigger and better every year. And then the director, Howard Hawks, who was also the film's star, died a month after the movie was released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a terrible excuse for a superhero movie.  The movie does not even have any actual superheroes in it at all.  In fact, the villain is just a "superhero" version of a bad guy.  What an unoriginal idea.  And the bad guy is just about the most unlikable of bad guys.  I mean, you don't give a guy a magic suit with two mouths and then have him say, "I'm gonna fuck that girl in the ass, and then I'm gonna shoot her in the face."  You can't imagine how awful the movie was.  If you like:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies that everyone who is anybody in Hollywood knows about. It stars Jack Nicholson as a successful screenwriter who suddenly finds that his marriage is a complete disaster. His marriage is such a disaster that Nicholson spends all of a weekend with his mistress in New York where they have a series of unfortunate encounters with a group of men that is the stuff of nightmares. One of these encounters is with Jack's friend and sometime lover who is not only a violent violent psycho, he is also very intelligent, funny, and knows everything about women. Jack also ends up getting very annoyed by this "nerd" who tries to be "cool" by telling him how he dresses and when he comes over to his apartment one day, Nicholson gives him a good old slap across the face and Jack is ready to leave him and his creepy girlfriend. But that's not all. Another one of his men has broken into his apartment and stolen his gun. Jack decides to go for the jugular and he does something that is absolutely genius. He ties up this violent man with a rope and then proceeds to throw his mistress, who has been tied up with a plastic bag and has been trying to be cute, in front of a moving car. That is actually pretty smart since if the car has been moving when the girlfriend gets thrown in front, he's in serious trouble and it won't be long until the car is running back over Jack's mistress and he has to start chasing the car to make sure that the "nerds" are okay. That's not the end of the movie. The "nerdy" guy (yes that's a thing that actually happened) gets arrested at the scene and Nicholson decides that this is the end. That would be the end if it weren't for one thing: the police chief has a very interesting reaction to the whole thing. He takes Nicholson down to the station with his daughter in tow and Nicholson realizes that maybe this situation is actually a good thing for him. Now, if the movie had not been so funny, it might have worked. This is a movie that just has a lot of humor. Nicholson plays the guy who is really mad at the world and has come to this realization that maybe he is the only thing that is going to save everything. It might sound a little melodramatic to many people, but Jack Nicholson has quite the voice. He is absolutely hilarious. So yeah, it is very much a good movie. If the ending was less

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this is one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen, it also seems like a poor excuse for a sequel.   The film stars some of the biggest movie stars of the 70s: Gene Hackman, Julie Newmar and John Cazale.  It would have been better if these actors did not sign on for it because all of them are very bad at acting.  The plot of the film is based on the true story of a movie producer who created a movie like no other called "The Great White Hope" about a white man who saved a people from a race of brown people, this movie was so controversial that the producer lost his movie business.  So he decides to create a movie that shows the great white man in a much more modern way.  This movie has the same plot as "The Jungle Book" except that the white man does not save a brown tribe (he is white but he has brown skin) but he saves the human race.  You will see the most horrendous acting ever seen in a movie.  John Cazzale and Julie Newmara both portray a black man and have a very bad time. They are not black and they are not white.  When the director asks the actors to put on a good performance, the actors in the wrong part of the movie do exactly that.  There are several other actors in this movie that are equally horrible.  I was sick to my stomach every time I heard the white people's "r's" when they say things like "You're white, right? Right?".  I would have loved to have seen the actors on the film where they live, as they are all white. I hate movies where the white characters don't do anything.  My husband loved this movie. When he saw the movie he wanted to show everyone that he was a great movie fan and I wanted to laugh because I thought that this was funny.  In case you are wondering, this is a great film and a great lesson for all of us. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a lot of good action movies released in the late sixties.   They are a combination of Western and Western European elements. The gun fighting is realistic and fast and the action sequences are great. There is a little romantic comedy in the last few minutes, but this is all the fun we get.  I just don't like the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a HUGE sci-fi fan, and I was very excited to see this movie. I have never been a huge fan of sci-fic, but my expectations were extremely low! I thought I was getting a movie about a robot who wants to eat. It was not! The story was about a group of high-tech military robots called "Robo Corps". There were two major plotlines, and one of them, the plot involving the "Robopocalypse" was the worst and the least believable plotline ever! It was a bad robot movie! The Robo Corps had only 2 major plots: A bad guy that steals their technology (which is very bad) and then they set it on a date with a girl. But there was no reason to date a human being! It wasn't romantic! They were all just robots with the same personality! They would call out commands, but the main character would not do them! They all looked like robots (except for one guy who looked like a little boy), and there was an old lady and a kid playing on the set and doing the robot stuff! All of the robots acted like robots and the only characters were robots! It all made no sense at all! Also, the robot "M.O." for that film is a guy who would get into his "Robot" and go out into the world, and that was it. It makes no sense! The plot didn't seem like much of anything! I found myself bored to tears with it! I mean, the whole movie is a joke! There was not a lot of comedy in it! They had to have been tired because there is nothing funny about that movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The one thing you must have learned from me before you start on my "trying to get a movie called the 'Ghostbusters' made" thread is that I really don't care about this movie. I've heard rumors about it since the movie was first announced, and I've listened to people talk about the movie endlessly. There have been many talks about the film, about a movie about a supernatural team of Ghostbusters. I don't really see the point, because nothing about this idea seems to me like something that would be very good for the people involved. If there's anything here, it's a little funny; I like this kind of humor, but this stuff always ends up being like a bad game of pinball, except that it's really annoying to be watching. There are a lot of weird, silly jokes that just make it look like a really bad TV movie with a bad name, which it is. (If this movie had been called "Ghostbusters: The Return of the Greatest Superhero Team of All Time," I would probably have enjoyed it a lot more.) I am just glad that the cast is not doing this movie, which I think the producers made a bad mistake by trying to do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a good movie, but a bad one.   This movie was made by the director of the famous "Viva Zapata!".  It shows the story about a young Mexican who kills his family and himself and escapes to a place that is full of people who are all dying by the end of it.  The only part of this movie worth of attention is the opening scene where the mother is giving away the young son and the father's body to the animals.  It was kind of interesting at first but it got worse after the first 20 seconds.  And then there was the fact that it was a Spanish Language movie.  A lot of these movies make the audience think that they are the ones who are trying to do something good, but it is just a movie made to promote and sell a Mexican product, nothing more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't see this one, but I'm glad I did! If I could give it zero stars, I would. I am not a big comic book or sci-fi fan. I was only there to see a "comic book" movie. I thought this was one of the worst.  I was disappointed in how poorly the action scenes were executed and the characters were completely one-dimensional and pathetic.  The effects were terrible and the movie is so overproduced it just looks cheap.  A big mistake was the stupid idea that we were supposed to feel sorry for the main hero. I'm sure a lot of people thought it was funny as a way to sell more movie tickets!  As much as I hate to say it, I wouldn't like to see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember this movie for its great opening, which has been remade three times in the last twenty years.  It is a dark comedy with the most brilliant acting you will see all year.  There is also a great story that takes place in a movie theater; we are watching a comedy and a tragedy.  I remember seeing this one, the opening was a great one with the amazing cast.  I don't think this movie gets the attention it deserves; but I would love to see it, but this is just a bit too tame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was a huge fan of the movie. The story line was amazing. This was a great movie. I'm going to miss this movie.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Toss from The Perfect Time! My Mom is the worst. I wanted to do this movie last summer and we watched a movie on television. The show was not bad, but the movie was. We had the same experience. Now it is over. I saw it in a theater and it was really nice. This is a time capsule classic. Love it. I recommend it to all of my friends.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's hard to describe a movie which is so good.   "In the event of an emergency, please call 911" is the message in The Black Mirror.   There is a kind of sci-fi, horror, horror-fest-like aspect to The Black mirror. It is a black mirror; the characters are mirrors, and the world is a mirror.  I read a lot of "black mirror" books, and have read quite a few books in other genres, including books with similar themes, but there is something about this movie that is unique, as it has so many things in it that make me think that the writers had been watching a lot and had come up with something pretty innovative. I would love to see a sequel to The White Mirror.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The original Superman: The Movie is a very good film, a good time at the theater, but it has nothing of the original comic, that is why the film is often mislabeled as a sequel or a remake.   This is a straight-up remake of the first Superman film, it retains virtually all the charm of that first film, even down to the character of John Lund.  However, the film isn't much more than a retelling of the second film's story.   I've mentioned a lot of criticisms of the film:

There is nothing funny about this movie.  It is a piece of garbage.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, it is funny and the characters are pretty interesting and I like the characters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love it.  I don't really like horror or thrillers, I never found one worth paying a premium for and this is a real horror/thriller in a great way.  The story is a lot different from most horror/suspense movies out there, it isn't really a horror/sensation, but it is still scary.  It has a strong cast that does a great job of giving the movie a lot of laughs, it is great to see some of the actors like Jon Heder, James Woods, and Jeffrey Combs, they do a great impression of the movie, and this version was the first time that I've seen the film in its uncut glory.  This movie is a must watch for a spook lover like myself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This has one of the worst endings I have ever seen.  No, I don't mean it is completely cliche:  Not even close.  The first half of this film is pretty good.  It doesn't give itself out too much, it's not really an overly long film by any means, but it's got a decent ending:   The main character, who has had the misfortune of losing his family of origin to an accident (it turns out that the boy in the accident was a mutant, so he gets a freak accident in the end, too) is a sad, lonely man.  He spends his time trying to find his family.  And then, when he finally does get ahold of the family, the only thing they can do is keep him as a pet!  In an interview with a reporter, his father states his intent to have him put down so he can be put out of his misery.  (This leads to the film's only "good" scene)  But wait, this is the last part.  After that...?    As with most of the films from the 70's, "Mutant X" has absolutely no redeeming qualities.  This is not the best film I have seen, but I find it hard to believe that it did not do better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After seeing all of the negative reviews out there, I would agree that this is a movie that the whole family can enjoy. It does a really good job of making us feel like we are there. We have a family that doesn't take itself too seriously. The only real problem we see comes from a little boy, who doesn't want his toys to get old. He goes on to be a very successful actor, and he is also a great dad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This has been described as "The Worst Movie of All Time."  I was a huge fan of the original and was looking forward to this sequel.  The plot was a complete disaster.  This movie was a total disaster.   The only thing I liked about the original was the music.  I liked the music, I liked how the actors were playing and the special effects were awesome.   The problem was the script.   It was full of crap.   I could not believe how badly the characters were written.  And the special effect scenes, well they were just bad.  It is obvious that the directors were not trained enough.  To think that a movie like this could even get made, is laughable to me.  If I saw this movie again I would see how the plot goes.  So you see I was not a huge box office winner.  But I liked this movie, I was entertained and it was not bad. If you like bad movies, check this one out.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a good movie. I thought it would be a fun movie but it is not that entertaining at all. Even with the new cast, there are only minor roles.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie itself is pretty bad.  Its a remake of the original movie.    It's pretty cheap.  It has some good scenes but its a remake.  I think most people are not going to like it.  The actor who plays the part of a soldier who tries to shoot himself while he's in an armored vehicle is an actor from a TV show.  His acting has no idea what he's doing and when he doesn't know what he is supposed to be doing he falls flat on his face.  If you like military movies I'd avoid this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing that all about me, i really hope the film was never completed.  It was terrible.  The director of the film wanted to portray himself to be a really bad guy.  He told a story about how he robbed a bank, so in order to prove how bad he was he pretended he robbed it.   He then decided to go on a road trip to rob more banks, and of course he didn't do it. The result was that he was arrested.  A couple of bad characters, and poor direction.  I will never watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was initially concerned about the poor acting in this movie and it didn't improve much. The film opens with an over the top scene where a woman's body is thrown off the balcony of her apartment building. The woman is screaming in pain and in terrible pain. It is obvious that she suffered quite a fall. The man next to her screams too, his body too. She's trying to crawl to the entrance but her arms are completely numb. The cops are called and they go to her apartment. They see the damage and the injuries and they tell her that if she is still alive it will only be a matter of time before she dies. She asks why they didn't bring her to a hospital in a hurry and they reply that they have to go to the hospital first. So they start to work on her. She is lying unconscious on the floor of the apartment and her eyes are glazing over. Her boyfriend appears to be on the phone with a man. So this poor woman is lying there in her state. She keeps thinking that this guy is there and that she can get off the floor and then there is no more pain. And then one of the cops comes in and says that the ambulance is on its way and that he could have been killed. Her husband arrives soon after and he tells the cops that he's not dead yet. He tells them that the woman in the elevator has already died. She has collapsed and his foot slipped off the railing and he has landed at the top of the building. His body is mangled and there is blood all over the floor. But he still says that he is alive and he's going to be OK. The bad guys arrive and they take the body and leave. The next day we see a very badly dressed man get on the elevator with his wife. They're sitting in a very bad position. The wife is trying to reach the ground but she can't. She says that this poor man has survived this and that is a miracle. After she takes her husband's coat off she then looks up at the balcony and sees her husband falling. She lets go of the railing. She cries and says she can no longer carry on and so she grabs her husband and starts to crawl away. She does manage to hold on for a minute, then she falls over the edge and dies. We see that it was not a great fall because she falls very low down. And so does her husband. So the bad guys leave the poor woman
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an extremely forgettable movie that is just about a gang-bang between two young girls. The movie is so bad that it is not even worth mentioning because the whole plot line is so unbelievably stupid. The main thing about this movie is that it should be released in the U.S. because this movie has nothing to do with any actual Hollywood movie. Also, it has a lot of sexual themes that make it not an acceptable movie for any teenagers or tweens. I give this movie a rating of F+
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most depressing film about the end of the world, this one.   While not entirely without charm and humor, it is rather depressing, sad, depressing, and sad!   And it is a very cold, grey, dark, rainy, rainy day, with a greyish-white sky; like I said, depressing.  But the ending, as I said before: it is not good.  It has been a long time since I had seen a movie so sad that I thought about killing myself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my humble opinion, the only one of the four major Star Trek movies that were actually pretty good. That doesn't mean they had a bad story, just that the writing was often clumsy and the direction not always up to snuff.  One interesting point of interest in this Star Trek movie is that the main character is playing a game of chess with a computer. This sort of scene is very reminiscent of one of Kirk's dialogues with the computer in the Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country  (as in this case, the computer is "the Enterprise" and the computer's name is "Picard" and they play chess).  After seeing this scene, I wonder if there is anything to be learned by watching the show that wasn't previously evident in Star Trek, or whether we should simply accept the "solution" (to put it more precisely) offered by Kirk in the classic movie: It's not all about the science; it's about the philosophy. It's all about thinking things through and seeing things from another point of view. That's how he can have a good time with a woman.  I don't doubt that most people will find this movie an enjoyable evening; it doesn't hurt that there is some good dialogue and the two actors do a fine job of playing the characters. The problem is that when the story does get rolling the quality falls off in dramatic fashion.  It's a shame, because I think the script could have been even better had there been more time; however, I don�t doubt that this film would have been a box office hit if it had not been released in theaters so close to Christmas.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete disaster. I would give this to anyone with poor taste in movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When the studio decided to shoot a movie about a guy that likes to "bust things up," it was a bold, brave gamble on the part of the producers, but I had hoped that in the end a story of redemption could be found. Unfortunately, all we got was a film that, for a change of pace, is not a rehash of all the things we've seen, but rather an exercise in how a typical day in the life of a professional boxer might be spent. If one has seen any of the other recent boxing movies, then one would expect the same sort of antics. In fact, this movie has little to commend it. Its main attraction is its casting, which is very disappointing. The actor who played the part could not possibly have more than three lines. He also makes a joke about being the last person to wear the belt in the movie. At least he has to try, as he spends most of his time making fun of the young lady playing the part. There is not one real good thing to be found in this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Ghost" of the Christmas Tree (1999) is a truly awful film.   If you think I am overstating the obvious, then look at the plot: the hero is a man who loses his wife to the forces of evil, but he still goes off and saves Christmas, only to find out that he was never really there at all.  There is absolutely no reason for anyone to go see this.  I don't know if anyone, after seeing the film, will want to go to the mall on Christmas Eve. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is really, really bad. It is about a man named Bob. His life is going nowhere so he leaves his wife at a party. At the end of the night there is an attack by a band called The Beatles. Bob's wife gets him at the end. He is attacked.   The movie is bad enough when it stops being so bad, like it ends and says, that's it. It starts again but the plot doesn't make any sense anymore. This movie was a joke and a big failure, it is very boring. There is nothing good in this movie so you should not waste any of your time on this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You get the idea that this movie's about a man (David Bowie) who was killed after losing a bet to the guy on TV. He was killed by a giant robot. The robot in question is called the T.X.O. (Terrestrial Organic Outcropping) and is a giant, multi-legged creature with a very big head. Bowie is the only human left alive after this whole fiasco (which takes place in a futuristic Los Angeles) where he meets up with a robot that is trying to kill Bowie. After a whole mess of weird crap that involves Bowie trying to stop the T-X.Oh's robot and Bowie trying save the human race from being enslaved by robots, we see a scene from the "Aliens" movie. The guy who plays a doctor is trying in vain to keep Bowie's head above water to keep it from turning into a fish like it is going to turn into. This is just about the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is the worst, the plot is the most ridiculous, the monsters are all the worst. If you're looking for a good time then this is not for you, if you're a fan of the late 60s and early 70s you probably won't find much to like here, there is almost no story to it at all and even if there was a good story there was not much to care about. I was hoping that this would have been the end of the rabbit holes that I was in but then I was sent on another movie that was worse.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thing that is most frustrating about the movie is that it really doesn't feel like it is even trying at all, that is, the whole movie has been about how awesome and witty and cool this movie has turned out to be, but it never manages to do so. It's a story of a young boy who is a little annoying, who is totally oblivious to the world around him and who is pretty much a robot. There are some pretty bad acting performances here and there, and the movie definitely doesn't seem to have been very well thought out, but there are a lot of great moments in this movie. It is totally ridiculous and hilarious.

I love the Star Wars universe and I love Han Solo, but this movie does not live up to either. The characters are not that interesting, the story is pretty boring, the voice acting is terrible, the special effects are forgettable, and of course, it is not a Star Wars movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It takes an hour to get to know the protagonist and it's too much to be good.  It's not too hard to see how it's based on a famous stage play but that doesn't make it good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really don't think you should go to this movie.  The story of this movie is bad, the acting is terrible and you would have no fun watching this movie at all.    I really don`t know what was so good about this movie but I don` t remember seeing a movie like this since I was in middle school.  The movie starts out with a woman getting raped, this is the most generic rape I have ever seen.  Then in a few hours there is no one left to rape.  This movie is just a cheap joke to draw in viewers.  The movie also has the annoying character who talks like a guy about women, this character never says anything about the movie he is in, which I suppose is supposed to be a bad thing.  At some point the movie moves to a woman taking a shower.  Once again nothing interesting happens here except for the guy who is supposed be talking about the woman who is showering.  After a while the character with the funny voice says that the woman is hot.  And so you can just imagine the movie going up and down this path to nowhere.  If you see this movie then you know that it has nothing to do with the movie you came to see.  What was funny about this was the way the camera moved around.  I just thought it was really funny how the camera was going around.   The only good thing about this is that they left this movie with the ending, so hopefully this is a sign that they will never make a movie with me again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a weirdly unoriginal movie, that will make most viewers ask themselves, "So, what are they going to do now?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of those horrible films I always hated and thought was the worst film I've ever seen is about to get the biggest blow out in movie history.   If your a fan of the   1980's "Dune" or   "Doom" (not related)   I guess you'll be happy to know that a "Dawn of the Dead" sequel is on the way.  This movie sounds like it has a lot of the characteristics of the "Dunes" but it also feels quite different, and maybe that's why I'm such a big fan of it.  The movie begins with a rather long prologue that describes the character of the titular character in some detail.  I will go on record here and say that I am extremely intrigued by the whole concept behind the story.  At least, I feel that way. In the prologue, we learn that, as an alien from another planet called "Earth" she is on a planet called Earth and as a result there are many other alien visitors on this planet, one of which she calls "Herd".   At some point in her life, this alien princess went through a lot so she knows how to deal with them.  Her people have a form of magic that is used to control all forms of life on their planet and as they are a very primitive species they aren't able to communicate with the more developed and intelligent races on Earth.  She had a group of friends and she called them the Guardians of the Earth. These group of people were able to do many things to control those who were not able to control themselves.  Eventually, she had the opportunity to marry a human man named John.  John was an engineer and is the main character of this film.  What happens is we see John's reaction to the alien princess and the events that have occurred.  He goes to Earth and she meets him.  During this time, John runs out of money and he is forced to turn to a "Herder" named Ray, who teaches John how to make money.  However, the only problem is John has no money. John then encounters Ray who also needs money so he teaches him how to do so too.  Also, we see a whole bunch of other characters on Earth who are all trying to get rich.  As a result, the movie follows the lives of these various individuals and their struggles to become as rich as possible.  Once

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie about a woman with a terrible temper and a bad husband.   The wife is in jail, and the wife's husband, a Marine.  This is a movie about Marine, who hates his wife, and tries to be a bad Marine, to punish her, so he can be the bad Marine again.  The bad Marine's wife is called Tilda Swinton.  She had a bad temper when they first married, and tried to kill herself several times.  I've read about Tilda, but I don't remember her, and I don the bad movies.  If you see a bad film about a Marine, but you don't know who the Marine is, then you really should see this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is pure rubbish! It's a "movie" that seems to take place in some kind of alternate dimension where the dead return in order to torture and kill people. And that's about it. All the actors have the "stiff upper lip" syndrome - no, not the "tough guy" syndrome, but the "the dead return to torment those who are about to be killed!" syndrome. The only actor in the film who has any acting talent is the girl playing the "sadistic nurse". As for the music, it just sounds like a cheap knock-off of the "Axe Man" theme. So, if you want to watch some dead people come back to torment and kill you, this is the only film you should see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just saw this movie about 30 minutes before I had to go to bed. I don't think I had any interest in this movie, which I heard about a few years ago. It looks like a film made to make people laugh, but instead of laughing, I had a nasty stomach ache.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is all about the romance. They play a little boy and a girl playing on a swing set in a swing park. We have the boy, and the girl, and a swing, and an adult in a costume... and the other adults, who are dressed like kids. I like the kid's swing... but I don't like the adult who is dressed like a kid. It's a pretty lame film, and that is saying a lot.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So this is a horror movie...kinda.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing that makes this movie really bad is that it was made in a studio (at least this much better than most of the ones that we saw on television in the 80's), it was the worst movie ever made in the English Language, it shows the American TV crew as big whores who were always on the take. This, I believe is the best, I'll give it that. It was made for the kids (I think it was only made for kids) and was basically a cartoon where they took all the characters that were used on the TV show with them (in particular the "suck it" voice that was used all the time to get the kids to do stupid stuff and "paw" the big bad wolf) and made them into animated movies with the best actors I've ever seen on screen (such as the great Robert Mitchum who was a good actor and still has a lot to show). It had a lot of silly humor and the voice actors who played these characters really went all out in their acting. I love the animation, it really shows what a studio that Disney was. I liked it a lot (and I think it is still on tv and in video stores) and I think that it may have been better than some of the kid's animated stuff that was around at the time. It is one of the top 10 worst movies ever made ever. Don't bother trying to find it because it's been pulled from a video store and will probably go for quite a bit.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first 10 minutes of the film are very unentertaining.   I think the director intended to show a bit about the history of the United States with a montage.  However, for some reason, the film never ends.  It just goes on and on.  Maybe it needs an edit?  I'm pretty sure this is the last American movie I'll ever see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is an odd mix of old and new, that is to say old in the sense that it isn't really old. There are a few things from the 1940s that I love: The "Punky" Paul Abbott and Billy the Kid are both featured in it, so that is at least something. I wouldn't say that I was a big fan of the old school "gangster" comedies of the 1940's, which was my favorite time period (although I am not sure I saw any more of that before it went to video), and I don't feel like I am saying much about it except that I found it interesting enough, but not much else.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think I might go insane trying to watch it. It was made in 1970, but it looks like 1970 to me. I don't mean that in a bad way: this is a good movie that just looks dated in places, and doesn't work because of it. The acting is awful: no one has a great physical presence, which is odd given the times they were working in. The only people who seem to work in 1970 are the cops and the FBI, which makes this movie somewhat of a '70s B-grade film. I've never seen a movie so stupid that it's entertaining: the only reason I was attracted to this is because I am bored. The FBI chief has an attitude problem and the only thing they do are play chess. The police detective is a little slow on the uptake and he doesn't quite get the basic concept: the police detective who was investigating a sex ring doesn't understand sex. And the police chief is so pompous that he thinks the FBI must be bad, when the FBI are actually much better. There was another guy who was a little bit better: he was a pretty good detective in this version. The bad acting was bad for the entire film. It's just not a good film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never seen this movie but I do know it was written by Paul Newman and directed by John Wayne.  I didn't like the movie at all. It seemed like the plot was written to please John Wayne rather than be realistic. They showed John Wayne in a lot of bad movie roles before this one. I think this was his best one. It's supposed to show what it was like to be a fighter pilot with the enemy coming in from the west coast and the whole thing being a training flight to show the crew what their life was about. They land and John Wayne tells us what to do when it's dark. They put on lights and you have to get back in the car as quickly as possible. Then they drive to some mountains and John and Fay come across a car that is stuck in the snow. They pull it out, get out and John gets the car started to drive off but Fay tells John to stay put while she gets out. He does that. It takes a while but at last they get out in daylight. John Wayne then goes back to the car and gives Fay a hand and she goes to work on it. When they start to drive away they spot a little girl walking along. John is kind of annoyed and says something about it being too cold but then he's very happy to have her in the front seat. As the little girl is about to get in the driver's seat John tells Fay to drive. She starts to drive but John says "Stay back! I'm going to show you how to drive!" Fay is so frightened when she starts to take the girl into the car that she runs back. John puts her down again and gets into the driver seat. He drives off into the woods as the girl gets into bed. When he gets out of the car Fay says, "Well, it wasn't a nice trip. It might be time to get out too. It was cold." It was a silly movie. I don't think I'm supposed to like it but then it's John Wayne so I do. I guess I liked it too much.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie stars Michael Douglas, whose movie career is one of the most disappointing of any actor (as well as an Oscar-winner). This was his first appearance on television. The only interesting thing about this film is Douglas' performance in the role of a womanizer (a character that I didn't understand, as the man in the film looked nothing like Douglas). I found myself confused a lot during the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really don't know about anyone but me (but I'm sure all the others will agree), but this movie is just plain awful.  Seriously, the writing is pretty bad, the acting is pretty awful, and the overall plot makes a mockery of itself, to the point where it becomes ridiculous.  All you can say about this movie are, "Wow, the director and cast were a bunch of morons."  That may be the nicest way to summarize this movie.  It's funny, but it's not funny at all.  I mean, what the hell are they laughing about?  I really don,t know about the kids being in the hospital, I don't think they were seriously in the ER.  When the kids were in the movie theater, they weren't in the ambulance, and they didn't even make it to the hospital until after their parents had left, and we don't even get to see them again for a long time.   I don''t even know what happened to the two kids.  How do they get out of there with the rest of the kids?  This movie does a good job of making sure you don't actually know what's going on in this movie, and I can't even begin to tell you how horrible this movie was.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had always been curious as to what this movie was about and I was very disappointed.   It starts out nice with a nice guy who has a big dream.  What is it he is dreaming of?   What do you think?  And we can see from the beginning that it wasn't really dream it was the real deal.      When we start this movie we are met with the girl that we all know as Jessica and we get to see her at home with her little brother and dad.  It is not exactly a happy family since it is the time that her father decides to go into the war with the Germans and her mother does not want that and is trying to persuade him to stay home but he refuses.  The father leaves and soon his wife returns but this time her husband isn't with her.  And there is Jessica.  Jessica is a very kind and intelligent little girl and I believe her parents did well at raising a little girl who would grow up to be very much loved.  Even if she did get a little out of control at times.  But it wasn�t what she was trying to do that was wrong.  She is a model student and she seems to be doing pretty well.  Well that is what she says in this movie.  However her father is not happy that her grades are so good and he wants her to stop.  He wants her for the army.  So now she must go to England and enlist.  Now she is going to be a little difficult to handle but I do believe that her parents will find someone to take care of her.    And it will be a long time before we get a good look at her and the family she will become.  After she leaves her home she must try to do things that most little girls can�t.  That is to get by and I guess with her grades she did pretty good and if she had tried to go to college or the military school.  For all I know it might have been a good career move but it is also a very bad one.  In the movie we get an idea of the war that Jessica is going into.  There is a large number of the Germans that are all white skinned all looking to kill other white skined people.  I know that when I was in the army we all wore white so I can not be sure but I think there is another enemy that is white skin

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The "Jurassic Park" movie was an American dinosaur blockbuster, about the life, deeds, and final demise of a prehistoric creature that is all too human to the extreme.  The plot follows the exploits of a small group of scientists and their attempts to save the human race from extinction.  One of the film's best features is the fact that it never tries to make a movie out of the story of how dinosaurs are introduced to the public at the beginning of the 20 th century.  This movie has so many more interesting and entertaining aspects to it than that one aspect.  And that aspect is that it is one of the first American science fiction movies to really depict dinosaurs in a realistic way.   If you want to learn something about dinosaurs go to the movie and listen to the narration of Dr. Carl R. Baugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would give this movie a bad review because it is just like "Caddyshack". There is nothing wrong with this movie, however, I wouldn't even think of recommending this movie to someone who isn't familiar with the movie "Caddy's Game". This film also doesn't look as good as it does in the old days. If you have seen a "Cadillac Man" movie, this is a "cadillac man", not a Cadillac man. The plot is similar to "Cinderella Man", however, this time he is a real American hero instead of a fairy tale man. This time the movie goes too far to parody American mythology and is pretty ridiculous.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle: Rocky Takes a Vacation!," the cartoonish Rocky Balboa, a lovable goofball, discovers that a good old friend from the old West, Bullwinkles, is out and about with a couple of goody two shoes in the great American West, just like Rocky wanted. Rocky and the gang have a bit of fun on a trip of a few days to a place full of the good old West good times. There's plenty of fun times to be had in this movie. There is also lots of laughs. And a few nice special effects in this film. I like it, but not as much as the old cartoons. If you are the type of viewer that has grown to enjoy a good Rocky movie, this is a good one. The bad part is the characters. In some of the scenes, they are so stupid. They look so stupid that they look like they were made by kids. Not that we are making a derogatory remark or anything. But there are quite a few of them that aren't very funny to watch. Also, it is an old cartoon that is getting a movie treatment. It is like a "modern" version of the old films. This one should not get a big promotion. It doesn't need it. But a movie that looks like a kid's cartoon is being given a movie deal? Well, there's no good reason why it should get a good deal. I guess it's better than an old Western. That's not enough to get me to give it a rating. I'll probably watch it, just to see how bad some of these kids look. If they are good at making a good cartoon, why bother trying to make them look real?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't bad, it just isn't any good. It's a slow film, and there are a LOT of scenes without dialogue, but there is something about them that seem to make you think they have something to offer. Even if there aren't a lot of surprises, there are still a lot to like. There's some really good acting, including a good performance from the young Tom Hanks. I also like that this is a movie in which Tom Hiddleston's character is not a loner or a lonesome figure, but a lovable and fun character who you want to hang around with. And, you also get a good dose of science fiction (the movie isn' the first in which a starship crash-lands on a strange planet populated with strange creatures--it's called "The Planet of the Pachamama" in this movie) that I thought was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this was a pretty bad movie, I'm not gonna watch it again because I think I'll just feel sad watching it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole film is set in New York, yet we never see a single movie in Manhattan. In fact, most of the scenes filmed in Manhattan are filmed in another city, like Portland, Oregon, or San Francisco, or even Austin. This is a Hollywood film so naturally no one is complaining about lack of New York locations, but the story itself seems to be made up of scenes in the same place over and over again. The film follows a poor, but determined man named Peter, who is trying to start a new life in New Zealand. After he loses a few thousand dollars in the stock market (which was a fluke) he finds himself in a desperate situation with a man who seems to have nothing but bad advice. If this movie isn't terrible, I don't know what is.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking for this movie to watch on a Friday night, and it was very good! I am glad to see such good movies like this! It is very bad though. I don't think the writer had much talent! If he wrote a good movie like this, he would write a good screenplay! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is so bad that it's better to be bad than not good. This is the same thing I'm seeing in the latest Twilight Zone episode. And it's not for the reason that you might think.   There's a great deal of time spent at the dinner table with a young boy playing a "strange music" that he thinks is "my mother's music." And the mother (who is played by one of my favorite movie stars) is a great actress and gives a wonderful performance.  The kid is really being annoying and so the father, a very well-mannered and kind man, decides to send him away. Unfortunately, this isn't the way to go.  There is no ending, there is no resolution. Instead, the young boy has a strange, but amusing, conversation with his grandmother. She asks him why his grandmother is "so beautiful."  And then she says that she never liked the first version of the movie with the little boy who had two hands and so he became an ugly baby who could't move his legs.  So the dad gets his girlfriend (played by my favorite TV actress) to read the part to the son and the little man comes to life.  And he gets a girlfriend who loves him.  A lot.  I have to give the movie a thumbs up because it's pretty good fun. It's one of those films that you're laughing but you're also crying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking forward to this movie for a long time (in my opinion) and to be honest it's not as great as I thought it would be. It's basically the next one after "The Abyss" which we all know and have seen numerous times. It still stands up as a very good horror movie however. It was fun to see a young Tom Cruise in a horror movie, I think it's very safe to say that I have a problem with the idea that we have to go down to another dimension to find a young couple. There's really not a lot of explanation for why this couple (who is not named) would be there. If it wasn't for the fact that it's Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in an 80's movie then I wouldn't have cared as much. It feels like Cruise has really done the time out and is now ready to get back to his roots and get back into acting with Nicole Kid the way Tom Cruise always does. The problem is that his character, a new pilot in the Navy that he had to train to make sure he did not get killed by some space shark doesn't even have a reason to be there at all. He flies through space just because it's a nice space to fly through. It might be good to see an older Cruise in one of the more adult roles but it is not even a good role. Cruise isn't bad, he isn't great but he can't carry a movie. The story seems like Cruise and Kidman will go down into the depths of space to be chased by some kind of space shark but as far as I can tell that is not the whole of what is going to happen. It also seems like there will be more of a "revenge" angle which doesn't seem to match up to what we learn at all in this movie. I don't think this movie is even good enough to make up for the first one which I thought was bad but in retrospect I think this is the second worst movie that Cruise has done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie. It was a pretty boring plot.  This is not a bad action movie and this is definitely not the worst Hollywood movie I have seen but if you are looking for a serious thriller with a good storyline then you would be very disappointed. This is definitely something you should watch with the kids and to have some laughs.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst part was the ending:  I was hoping this movie would be a bit better than the other two that followed, but I was wrong.  It was a bad sequel to a bad film, so the fact that there were so many characters that didn't seem to be in any other sequels seems to be a clue that it's going to be really, really bad.  I wish they were all dead.  If you're going to make a sequel to The Wizard, just call it The Wizard 2: The Revenge.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie about an evil and stupid man. His wife was a complete fraud, but that did not prevent her from being one of the few nice women in the movie. She did a great job portraying evil. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie looks like a cheapo science fiction movie based on an older science fiction novel, called  The Dandyman, written by a little famous author named J.E. Sheridan. It is not science fiction at all, it is made with cheap effects. There is very little space drama and very little of any real action.  This is mainly a comedy, a comedy that is more like a bad version of  Laurel and Hardy, a movie where the main character has a friend named Mr. Mac.  Here is the plot: Mr.Mac is the "crazy" guy who goes around "talking funny". He has a big head and a big moustache and talks funny. He does not really do anything. He has no personality. He is just a weirdo.  It looks like it was created by making a bunch of cheap action figures out of action figures. The only thing that makes this movie funny is the music. It looks to have been done by a student doing a joke on a teacher.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not bad at all.  The film is filled with jokes, as are most of the other films of the year.    But  the humor is more subtle and subtle.  Some of the jokes will just blow your mind and others will leave you slackjawed.  This is not a film to watch with your kids, it is best viewed on a Sunday afternoon with a few of the buddies when the kids are getting tired of a family dinner. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My first impression of the movie (and by that I mean my first time watching a bad, mediocre, and offensive movie - that's how they described it) was that it seemed like a typical "caper" movie. It has the usual trappings of a "cappelade": a group of young people go to a movie (with the occasional "scary" music in the background), they are beaten up pretty bad and then the cops come along and shoot them (including one young girl), the movie ends with a cheesy music cue and the ending is kind of weird. I was able to find a copy of the film (on VHS) at the local video store. You have to be pretty hardcore to watch this (not that I'm a hardcore caper fan - I've seen a few). The ending is pretty bad (which doesn't help to make the film any better) and the characters were all pretty generic (especially the girl from the movie). I'll have to rewatch it (or just wait for the DVD release - I'm sure it'll be at least 2 hours longer) to see whether it was really a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While I'm not really into the whole comic book genre, this is a decent action flick which features some fantastic set pieces, which, unfortunately, do get repetitive. There is a fantastic chase sequence in the middle of the movie where a convoy is chased by ninjas. These guys are really fast and really tough.   Unfortunately they don't show up again until the last twenty minutes of the film, when they finally get the opportunity to go toe to toe with Batman for a while. This sequence really didn't impress me, because I'd expected something more spectacular to come out of it. The battle was rather anticlimactic, and the Batman guy was just there to run away while the ninjas had to fight off the police helicopters that Batman had been trailing to arrive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say that my high school English teacher was a good guy is a bit of a stretch. He's a former policeman who worked in some of the roughest neighborhoods of London. After seeing the success of the films of his old hero Michael Mann, he decided to make a low budget, low budget movie about a real gangster. He didn't have the imagination or the talent to write a movie that would be a contender for an Oscar. The plot, which starts at a bus stop to pick up a prostitute (Mackenzie Foy) and ends with a car chase, is based on a story by an Irish author named Jack Cusack about a man who gets a bit too close to a gangster who can't help but admire him. There is no sense of urgency to get to the end of the story, and the dialogue often sounds more like a bad imitation of the late William Buckley than a real interpretation of the man, Cusacks character. But it's really not bad, and there are a few good moments in it that make it worthwhile. My friend, who is a film buff and a fan of Cusacs works, told me about this movie. It's interesting to see his way of getting an acting job. One day he gets the job, gets the girl, takes the job away, and comes back the next day. The film has a lot of good moments. But you should be careful not to watch too much of Cinco De Mayo, it is a short film with a lot to show. It gets a little too violent towards the end, but is a fun watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a low-budgeted movie that will probably only be remembered by the kids who are into this type of stuff and for the rest the movie is just a low quality mess. The production is shoddy, especially the special effects, there are no actors of any note and the sound is cheesy.   The story is nothing more than a bunch of kids acting silly all with the same plot, and there's nothing at all funny or original about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most awful movie I have ever seen, but you get my point! The story revolves around a man named Bob, who has an overbearing mother (who just happens to be his mother's sister) whom he calls by name. After a long time, the mother decides to move to a different town. The entire family is unhappy there and it gets even worse when Bob's best friend, George, is shot and killed. But a miracle does occur when George is resurrected by the holy water, and in a moment of weakness, Bob tries to stab himself. But what comes out of his mouth is not a knife or a bullet but a gun! And a very bad one at that! I could go on and on about how horrible this movie is but I'll stop now because it is bad all the way from beginning to end. The characters in this movie are all completely useless. The only thing that makes this movie worthwhile is its terrible special effects and the fact that you get to see some really bad acting. It is sad that this is the only decent movie they have produced!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't care much for the film, but then I read the reviews, which were pretty good.   That's fine, but I wouldn't recommend this to a movie lover.  While the film's story is interesting, its characters are all the same, with different names, and not much of an interesting personality.  The only reason I found this entertaining is because, unlike a lot of other films, they did a nice job in showing the effects of radiation and how they can effect people.  I'm sure this film would have been better if they had shot the film in a more realistic setting.  It's a shame that this film only has an R rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no point in me explaining a bad film. I have seen it so many times I remember it to be bad even if I am told it is good. I wish you would be able to find a copy of this film in the cinema.  Makes a great Christmas present!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A "great" movie.   One of the first films I'd see back in the 1970's.  It was a fun, funny movie and a good action movie. It was one of the original "Citizen Kane" movies!   I do not remember the director being a good director at all.  He was the same as the rest of the directorial talent. The script was awful.  The lead is a bad person.  I never understood how a nice lady could be this evil.  There's a lot of violence and a lot sex.  But not much humor.  You can only get "great performances" from someone who is in a great mood.  For me the great star was the lead female. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time we see the "hero" being dragged kicking and screaming by his wife to the hospital (the wife was trying to kill herself) while being tortured by the police. She is dragged screaming, screaming, while he is kept standing there and not doing anything but just staring at the police as they beat him and torture him. The end is like a nightmare, because the "happily ever after" that we have been promised will never happen.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are several things to like about this movie: the soundtrack is really good; the performances are all good, with a few very good performances in the second half; and of course, there is an awful lot of violence.   All this, in a movie that is supposed to be a love story between a woman and a black man.  I thought I would never watch a film like this again, but I found myself wanting to watch it over and over again until it made me sick.  It's a real pity that it only has five stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very stupid movie. The writing is bad and the acting is poor. The movie is based on the Bible and in it you have a Christian missionary who goes to visit a Jewish village. He and another missionary, a lady, are given a lot of power by the Lord to do all the evil in the world and they do it. The only time the Lord ever appeared to them was to say "no" in the movie. This movie was not well made at all, especially since they had no script except a bible. It was stupid, bad, stupid stupid bad!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a strange, slightly disconcerting film which is set in a world where the inhabitants are all giant apes. The film begins with a typical, yet creepy, gorilla movie, as a child is introduced to the gorilla race at age 5 and, eventually, joins one and, after a time, has children as well. The story unfolds like a typical "zoo" film, with gorillas going on the hunt, eating people, making babies, and then finally killing off their own kind in an end-of-world, apocalyptic setting.   After about 2/3 of the film, you have to wonder why all the apes are so big? Is the film trying to tell us something? Why is this film being released at a time when the planet is in trouble? Are all humans going to end up being apes?   The only thing worth mentioning in the film is that it doesn't make it seem that bad; there's a nice soundtrack, and the gorillas do make good, if not creepy-looking, characters. I found the film entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is difficult to imagine how a movie could be more awful. There is little else to say about this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can't really think of anything to say about this movie other than how fucking lame it is. It doesn't even look like it was made in the 70s! It is almost like a 70's TV movie with music videos thrown in. It is so bad it is funny! I was laughing out loud with the stupid characters and stupid ideas. I never want to see another movie by this director.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie maybe 6 or 7 times. I am not sure if this movie is even made by Paramount.  At least it's funny and at least it doesn't feature a bunch of retarded people (like in a lot of the movies that are made by studio like Paramount).  A few years ago, when I was in high school I read this book called The Black Mirror.  It was good.  I read it again recently and it was not a good thing at all.   This movie is like the Black Mirror with an insane amount of violence and sexual content that are pretty much unnecessary.  Even though I didn't enjoy the movie I am sure a lot people who like this kind of movie would like it.  So if you want to see a good Black Mirror movie, I recommend this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It would be funny, if it weren't so depressing.   I'd like to see the director of this movie take some time off from his "normal" life, and write a film about his son. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not good. It is a poorly done rip off of the 1970 film, which was the most original movie to be made about people in the year 2014. This film is a bad film. This movie makes the film about people that don't live in the years that they are supposed to be living in. It really doesn't have anything new to say and the performances are bad. I'm sure the director of this film has probably watched a lot of television and bad film adaptations of a movie like this to get some ideas.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This   is not a bad film.   It   contains a little more of everything than   it   does, and it  is a very good film. The   characters are more complex than  to   we are used to seeing and the story and pacing are very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not good. It was bad bad bad and that's it! And I said this before and I'll say it again; I don't know what to say about this movie because I'm not even sure it's good! But the bad was bad, the boring was boring and the pointless was pointless. But the stupid was stupid! And it was bad! But I said before that I don' like movies of this nature because they are almost all bad movies. And these are not bad movies, they are bad! And bad bad! I don the first movie which was good, but it still wasn't great; I thought they could have done a little better with the story line. But I'm glad I gave this movie a watch because I don;t recommend it to anyone!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of this movie is pretty straightforward, a young man is kidnapped by a female stranger for the express purpose of giving him a bad time. After that he meets the same woman and another guy (who looks just like his captor) who are also kidnapped and taken to another part of the country to be executed for "being evil". This is where the movie gets boring, because the only real bad guy in the movie is played by Robert De Niro and, as such, is given very little screen time. That said, Robert DeNiro is really quite a nice guy so I can't help but like the movie to a certain extent. It also manages to be pretty funny at times (which is a difficult feat). This movie is, unfortunately, not available anywhere on DVD.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cute girls having fun in a strange place and being sexy isn't usually all that hard to make, but the film's production is not particularly good.  There are a couple of moments when the camera pulls out and the camera stays out of frame for a good while (for about a minute) in a shot that seems almost too silly to be realistic.   But the most bizarre aspect of this movie is its apparent sexual content.  At the climax, two of the girls start running naked past the camera.  After a while, a young guy takes a shower in the next room.  He looks as though he's about to take a shower.  When he comes out in his underwear, the girls follow him out into the water and continue making out.  The idea that two girls are having sex in front of the camera in this movie (and other scenes) is bizarre.  But it works.  It makes for a very entertaining and funny movie.  I was tempted to think of it as a "cute girls in a weird place" type of movie, but really it's a weird porno. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed with this movie. It's one of those films that seem so bad, but I couldn't stop watching it. The premise of the movie is a boy named Johnny who is playing a game in his garage and has a very strange and frightening experience with a girl named "Monica", and then he becomes very good friends with a little girl named Monica and this is only the beginning of the bizarre events that occur. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not only a very boring movie but also very bad with no real story or message whatsoever. The only positive thing about it is that the characters are pretty well done with their personalities and expressions. The actors seem like they were trying to give off the feeling of an old time radio comedy. There was also a little bit of a musical number with an acoustic guitar that was pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was disappointed with this movie.   It is set in a post-apocalyptic America where there is a strange disease known as the Blue Blur where it comes from an alien spaceship that is supposed to be destroyed.  It comes from the sky and it has the ability to change people's skin colors.  The Blue Blurred look like the blue blur itself.  In a post apocalyptic setting where people have died of the Blue Bloomers the government created an experimental virus that could give the Blueblur a chance at survival.  Unfortunately it doesn't work but instead the Blue blurs infect others and turns them into the same type of blob.  When one blurs are infected they have an urge to kill all the other blurs but a group of five survivors make a plan to use a cure to save the world.  A group of three main characters play a small role in this movie and they are: A couple who are searching for a cure and eventually find it in the hospital where they give a small part to a doctor who will then give it to the other Blue blur.  He is also infected by them but he helps the five out.  Then the four survivors, a man, his wife, a kid, and her friend, have a run in with a band of Blue blurring who were trying to kill them all.  This movie could have been so much better but there is not a whole lot to it.  I didn't like the main characters and I wasn't all that interested in the ending because I think it is a little forced at times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is quite likely that you are familiar with the concept of "frozen in time", but have you heard of "Rasputin" by Alexander Pasternak? A strange Russian monk, Rasputin, comes to London where he is taken in by a lonely, slightly eccentric man who is also a bit of a lunatic, and who starts putting on a series of spectacles, then getting into the bath with the monk and saying strange, incoherent things and then trying to kill him by plunging a dagger into his heart.   This is the story of a Russian woman who was married off to a peasant, and then divorced, then married again to the same peasant, who doesn't leave her for a single day. I have not read any of the books by Pasternakov about Rasputina, but this is the only one that is based on a true story.  It was very poorly executed, and even though it is a movie it is very strange, like some kind of insane fever dream about a Russian peasant girl, who has a strange and sinister fascination with a mad monk with a lot of other odd ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very happy to see a sequel to " The Thing," but not very much surprised.   The Thing is the stuff of nightmares.  One thing I have to say about this movie: it's hard to find a bad actor.  I like the idea of being a human-like alien for a long time.  At least the alien part is better than the human part.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know this movie is a remake of a classic from the 80s and has a good storyline but the acting is terrible. The girl playing Mimi is terrible, this movie has been made to give a remake for the 90s and it will fail miserably, the 80ies movie had many great lines and the 80 and 90s movie doesn't even come close, the only thing that this movie does right is the soundtrack and it is very nice.   Don't waste your money, and this movie isn't worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is more to a movie than meets the eye. We get a few good scenes but nothing much in the way of the story, the acting in these scenes is weak and the film ends too abruptly. The worst part of the movie is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is kind of funny how the movie starts off really slow, I mean the movie really doesn't take off till the end.  The movie just seems like it's going nowhere and it does it with a rather bland story that just seems to be more of a waste of everyone's time than anything.  The movie is about a man (I think) whose wife passes away (I really do not get what happened in the movie, if there is any truth to it, I think it would have had something to do with an allergic reaction to a piece of meat) and he does not really want to get back together with his ex wife.   He goes back to where his ex girlfriend is living and when he comes back from work he finds her dead.  What follows is a pretty bad murder mystery.  I mean you wouldn't really be looking forward to watching a good murder mystery movie would you?   There isn't any actual crime in this movie and it doesn't go anywhere.  But if you need a movie where you can just sit back and relax and watch a good old-fashioned murder mystery, this is the movie for you!   If you like a good mystery, then you will like this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Forgive me if I have to state that I've watched it so many times now, it is a pretty bad movie. At least it is not the kind where a couple of guys (I guess a couple since no one else is in the house) are on a "tour" to see if the "Candy Man" is still around to play the guitar. Well, that is pretty much all there is to the movie. First, you get a good idea that the "Gingerbread Man" has no sense of humor about himself and his ridiculous character. That is a given but the movie is worse than the song (I mean Gingerbread man). A couple of the songs, such as the classic "Stairway to Heaven" or "Blue Moon" can hardly be called catchy. They are good, but not great. There is a really odd performance from the singer and the other character is also not great but the song, "Taste of Cherry" will probably get a laugh out of you (which it does). There are no songs with actual power in this film and it is only in the last few minutes that things are finally kicking up. It's a shame that the film was a complete failure, but there are many other good movies, but this is just too bad to be good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of reviewers have commented on the fact that this movie is not "bad", but it is boring and devoid of any originality.  It is definitely NOT for kids!   The story is predictable and the characters are the same in this movie as they were in "The Adventures of Captain Video." The best part of this movie to me is the opening scene that shows off a video store and the store itself is a replica of the store from "The Video Munchies" which I liked even though there was a whole lot of people in that video store!  There is a great soundtrack, but that does not make up for the fact the actors in this are not very good! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies that I loved but hate that I've watched it too many times. In fact the whole genre is just such a disappointment. I'm going to be honest I'm really disappointed in the fact that it's supposed to be the first full length movie. I mean this is supposed to show you the whole history of what happened at Fort Mosely (and a lot of the other places in Georgia) and then to go back in time and follow them in the 1940s and 1950s. But it's not like they took that much time to tell the story. The only "history" they show you is in the opening narration which I don't understand at all. If I didn't know better I'd think this movie was made up entirely by the author of the book because he talks in such a slow and meandering manner (like an old man talking about his grandchildren) and he seems to be talking about things he already knows about or has done in the past. It's actually more like a history of the United States by a guy who lived here in the 1920's and the 1930's. You get that much? That's the only history you get? They even show the movie as being set in the 40's, but they show the people who were there in the 20's and 30's, too, but then they show that these old folks who were in the 50's and 60's also thought these things were really really bad. And then of course there's a black man who was in the army in the 60's and early 70's, and who thought all the same things about it. So it's a mix of old people who are all going back in their stories and new people who just don't know the history they've got. It was really boring. This movie is just a history and an introduction to the author's family who moved here in 1906 and did lots of stuff. There's nothing for anybody to find. And there's nothing about the Civil War, either. I really don't think this writer ever really lived here, either, and I think he would have been happy to sit and watch these movies. I've never even heard of any of the places he talked about. It seemed like they just used his family's stories. I can remember the only thing I remember from this movie is the author telling me that he'd met people who had been killed in World War II and that this movie had a real message in it

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm pretty sure a lot of people are going to give it a really low score because of how boring it is, but I guess some people do like to see the bad movie from the first and I guess you have to do that sometimes. It's not an incredibly bad movie by any means. It has a few decent set pieces and some very stupid jokes. It isn't quite as bad as its predecessors but that's not saying much. What is is saying is that I hope that they don't try to remake this because it is not nearly as bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good movie with a bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I heard the name "The Terminator" I wondered how it ended up with a title like this. A Terminator movie was supposed to be about a man who was an immortal being who lived in an advanced civilization and who lived for millions of years in peace. This man was a being from the future who came back to the past and killed all the humans on Earth before he went out and became a machine so that he can live forever. This is what made him the perfect Terminator, he had all the advanced technology and the only reason he was no longer in the future was that he was killed by a human. He went back in time to the future and told the humans to get out because he was coming and then turned himself into a machine to live forever and then did it again and again and killed humans until there was not a human left on Earth.  This is exactly the way the movie should be called because it is the actual beginning of the movie that we all know and love.  For a while it worked, but then the plot changed again and the movie was ruined by it's stupid, pointless ending.  The main character of the film, a guy named Kyle Reese, and his companion Linda Hamilton (an American woman who has no idea about time travel at all) go to an amusement park near the present to spend the day with some of their old classmates. It has become a tradition for these kids to go to the amusement park each summer and they get to spend a lot of time together and they often take their time talking about their lives. But this day is the last day of their lives and they have been playing all morning with all the rides that the amusement parks have to offer and there is still time before the sun comes up and the sun starts the day up in the sky. There is no danger of the sun coming up and killing everyone because there is just too much fun that all of them should have left behind. But then the sun does come up and it is getting darker as it gets closer to the time that the sun would destroy the Earth. Linda and Kyle tell their friends that they will run out of energy soon and they will never make it out of the park alive. They give their friends the final ride and they tell them that it is okay to die because they would have loved to have stayed in the park forever and played the games that they had enjoyed together. They then turn into robots so that they can continue to live the rest of their days
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film.  It's bad because it's boring!  The plot is bad because  we never get to know our main character's life outside of his job.    We get a short scene of him drinking a beer at work, which we see from behind a glass wall, and then we never see him again!   He is just a guy and there is not much of a story or any reason for him to get away from his job!  There are no people who are memorable as we never meet them, either.  One of my favorite parts of the film is when our hero drives over to a house to find a woman (Holly Hunter) who seems to be in a bad way.  He opens the door and says "I'm a bit late" and she starts to cry but then stops.  She seems to just be standing there!  In the end she turns out to be ok, and the two of them are not the least bit interesting to me.  As a big fan of this film I would not recommend this film to anyone!  If you like action and you like big breasts then give this a try!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know its been a while since I read the last one, but there isn't much of a plot anymore.   From a quick glance at the box it looked like another boring, stupid, pointless action movie with no reason to exist.  I won't go in to detail, but let me just say its kind of like a parody of 80s action movies.  A bad buddy cop movie where the bad guys are played by poor actors playing the baddies.  The story is so bad, the entire thing is shot in an 80s movie theater, but its supposed to be about the good guys.  It's like a movie that was made by a bunch of drunk people who wanted to make a movie about ninjas and the cops and then had a stroke and had to throw together a movie to sell to people and ended up making a lame bad buddy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a bit of a waste of time.   The actors are good, but the movie is not the highlight of the day, it's a really boring mess of plot that doesn't deserve to be called a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that has to be seen to be believed, The Road Warrior is a fantastic movie about a former outlaw trying to stay alive in a city where everybody is dead or dying.  As the old man's horse is killed, his son tries to stay with him and make it into a life of crime but he has no money and no skills and the only ones around him are other dead horses.   So the son begins riding around killing people, and getting into fights.    So the story goes one day that a young woman is crossing the road with her daughter when she is run over by a horse.  This horse is named Joe, and his name means Joe the Great and a man who is the only person who knows that Joe is not the real thing.  It is up to Joe to take out this outlaw who has killed more people than anyone in the town.  The story has some heart in it.  I think the old lady was probably the only one who wasn't trying to get away because she saw what Joe did and decided to take him out.  As far as bad movies go I would go with The Road Warriors over almost all others for the story, action and the performances. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this would be a good movie but a poor film that is made up of bad ideas that are executed poorly.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't know when my friends and I were talking about this movie we needed to watch it.  We didn't watch the original "The Naked Gun" movie, but we knew it was so funny it needed to be made into a TV show and that's what they did.  They took the original, which was about a detective who had a gun that would fire at a man's penis whenever he touched it. The original had a man named Harvey Keitel as the titular lead, but KeitEL was killed in this movie and was replaced with Ray Milland.  The original movie had a great cast and an amazing premise that turned the standard "hero's quest for a penis" trope on its head.  You didn't need a huge gun.  I mean, it would do a little damage but nothing like the giant gun it was originally supposed to be.  If you like these old films you will love this film.  Also, a fun game:  Put a gun under the TV set to show the gun is a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I had the makings of a great sci-fi movie, but it was more trash than entertainment.   With the help of a brilliant special effects designer and composer, the movie shows how a scientist and a little girl find love while in a war zone, and what happens when their love is stolen by someone else.  The premise is fantastic, the visuals are spectacular, and the performances are excellent.  Unfortunately, there are so many bad parts that it becomes almost unwatchable.  With this flick, it is sad that we all have to deal with an ugly, un-funny, and ultimately unsatisfying movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie in the entire history of Hollywood and the world.   There is no way to justify it, the entire movie is one boring, repetitive, ridiculous, cringe-fest.  What the movie does well is make us laugh (the first time) and feel a bit bad about how terrible the movie is, but it's not even close to making the movie worth seeing.  I would have to rate this movie at least an "A+" which is about as bad as I can get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a lot from this movie, but it was nothing special.   In my view, the plot is just terrible, and I mean just awful.  It would be hard to believe that a movie that has a great main actor and director like this couldn't be better than the mediocre script.  The actors who play the young girl in the movie are all good actors, the director, Tom Savini, is a good director, and the actors all play the roles of the young women in a way that isn't bad, but is definitely out of character for these young women.  These characters have no depth and the stories that they tell are poorly done.  I could have done without the stupid singing and the terrible acting, but I guess I have to give the movie a score of "F". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was supposed to be a good movie but it was made into such a pathetic film it had no chance to even try it's hand.  I didn't care for it at all.  The plotline was bad to begin with and only made worse by the film's actors, who seemed to have an awful time trying to play it.  It is just so bad I would not watch it again even if I had to pay for it. I can't believe I wasted $12 dollars.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My second "bad" movie was based on a series of novels, each book with its own special twists! I thought the book was interesting, as it was based almost on reality and there are some good characters in it, but it was terrible.   The movie is just about people doing "things", which is to say a lot of walking and drinking. It is made worse by the fact that the actor who plays a detective with a beautiful wife who has been kidnapped by a couple of thugs is the most dull actor I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about an astronaut, and a little dog, who are being hunted by a gang of criminals. Their prey is a little girl who is going to be a star in the future.   All I could think was "How could that woman look so good in a movie?"   There is a wonderful ending at the end of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You know when you are in that zone and just want a good movie to watch while you sit down and relax? Well, a movie called, "The Dark Knight" just came out a few weeks ago on DVD and I have seen it several times now. The movie is one of the best made movies in years, I mean it is one that does justice to the source material by having every single one of Batman's moves in there, it is a superhero movie after all and not a simple crime thriller, and it does such a great job of that and then the movie gives Batman a big supporting role and then lets him run around as a vigilante, like the old days in my opinion. This movie is about a man that is in a wheelchair that he got back when he was shot in the leg, the only problem is his partner is so crazy and insane he gets called Batman and he is always out on the town killing criminals, because he is Batman! Oh and he has a robot partner who is only good for one thing and that is to fight the Batman with an electric batarang! This movie has all kinds of cool stuff in it and it even had a cameo by some good old Bruce Willis. It was not the best movie to come out at the time but it has been very good for several years now and there is not a bad thing to say about it, especially because it was directed by "The Coen Brothers" themselves.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are a lot of bad movies out there, but the latest to come up is an old-style horror film from the 1970's. The actors are so terrible that the horror aspect is ruined;  I have been looking for this for a long time, but I could not find it anywhere.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a good movie that I did not think was bad. The problem was that it was really stupid. The best part of the movie is the opening with James Doohan driving a DeLorean. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, that was a stupid movie! It's a stupid excuse for a movie about a man who goes around with his dog to do chores. If you need an excuse to see a stupid comedy movie, watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. A lot of the scary stuff, such as the "torture chamber" and the "chamber of skulls" is done with a lot of cheap effect shots. I've seen worse and that's not a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know if it is because of the movie itself or not, but there is no way I was going to see this movie. It was not only bad, but bad on every level imaginable. The acting was terrible, the writing was terrible and even the special effects were bad, as it was obvious from the get go. I know some people love CGI and 3d, but when it is so bad, and when it isn't very good, that is not something that I am going to watch on a regular basis. A great disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It took me a long time to find a movie that wasn't boring or corny, because this is a movie made to make people feel better about themselves. It's so corny that it's hard not to take a laugh every time someone mentions the "Famous Five" and their "Ace in the Hole" game. The script is very similar to the one in The Three Musketeers, which is a bad film on its own, because it makes everything all about the characters and they talk like they're in a "The Three Muskaets" movie. There's a joke in the beginning of the film about the fact that the protagonist, a man named Jacky, goes to a golf course to play a game where the other guys say "Good luck, Jacky" at the beginning, and then he says "Hahahahaha!" like he's watching a Disney cartoon. It might be a movie for adults, but it's pretty much the same as a comedy movie made by kids.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen all of the Star Wars movies and the prequels, but even though this movie was really bad and so over the top that it left you with a bad taste in your mouth the first time through, this is still the most memorable movie I've ever seen, it's an epic story from start to finish. The action scenes are amazing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I wish the makers of the film, like many others before them, would have found a way to make it more interesting without the constant nudity and vulgarity.   This is not a bad film. I don't know about anyone else who would actually like it, but it is well-acted, very well-produced, it has lots of music and great sets, and all of this is done in a style which is quite attractive. But it lacks any charm and is really just a series of gross-out gags. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've never seen a bad "Jaws" movie.   If it's not on the "Must-See List" then it's out to lunch.  The "J" is a shark.  It's got a good suit of shark armor.  Oh, it's scary, yes.  But it's also dumb.  A bunch of guys are swimming and a "Jaw" pops up out of the water.  How did it get there? Oh, there are rocks in the ocean and it climbs up a rock and swims to the top of the rock where a bunch of kids are playing.  And all the kids freak out and the jaws go into action and start pulling on the rocks.  (Yes, the kids were playing in the water but there are sharks in the sea.)   And then the kids are out of their swimsuits so the jaws open and they drop the rocks and they all fall in.  So what?   It got into the ocean.  I mean, I've got enough problems.  Why does everyone get so angry?  Why do the kids go out of there?  Did the "Jawed" shark eat one of the kids?  Is that why the "Tiger shark" is coming?  What's with all the shark attacks?  This "J."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is an obvious rip-off of an old TV show called The Jeffersons  in which a series of kids get together and do silly things with the local children. I would be disappointed if this wasn't another one of those old "what could I have done better?" movies (see also: The Jefferkins).   I never really understood the whole Jefferson phenomenon; as a kid I just liked seeing the kids playing silly games.   The Jefferson  movie is as boring as it sounds.  If I'm going to see a Jeffersonesque movie I want to be entertained, and here the kids are just laughing and playing with each other.  It's as if they're playing an arcade game. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was at a movie theater last night watching the "Halloween" franchise and there was one scene that I thought was horrible. I don't have much of a problem with horror movies, but the "Dada" scene made my stomach turn.   A young girl comes home to find her mother dying. She is supposed to attend a dinner party. But, this young daughter's mother is dead. We don't know if it's a natural death or not. There is a strange creature that is attacking young woman and taking her form. This creature has two faces, but it is a creature from the night. The daughter is supposed a see the monster from the other face. Well, it doesn't work out that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know, it just felt like there was less of a reason to do this movie than the others, it's as if this was just added to add some randomness to the film as we're just going to be watching this film in the next five minutes. If you're looking for a movie with great action and great production values, then check it out, but otherwise, don't waste your money!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   ...   A boring little movie and yet it was too cute not to see it over and over again.   It wasn't long before I felt myself growing to love the "pizza man."   He was a nice little character with a goofy smile, big round belly and short pants.  A "cute" character doesn't mean much for me unless he is charming or funny, but here I thought he was both, especially in one scene, when he went back and forth across the restaurant, giving each person a little treat.  I think the only problem I had with this movie was how long it took to get to the pizza place.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a decent "tomb raider" movie, but nothing like a true story. The movie features many of the "tombs" in the movie: Tomb, the "cannibalistic" giant who lives in a tomb, the evil sorcerer who lives inside the "giant" and the "evil wizard" who lives next to the "goblin". The movie is about the last two trying to take revenge on the other for killing their family. The rest of the movie takes place in a cemetery at night and the plot has a sort of an epic feel: The wizard has made himself a magical "battery" and is trying to destroy the "monster" with a spell. The big thing about this movie: It's fun. There's a few "stupid" things that happen in the first 30 minutes, but the rest of it is entertaining. It's more a story than an action movie, although there is enough of that in it, because they are trying to kill the monster and they can't kill it. It takes up a little more than 70 minutes, which is about right, because a lot of the characters are "battling" for their lives. As far as an action film is concerned, this is the kind of movie to keep you interested for a long time. It has a good cast of characters and it's hard to see the "bad guy" (at least at the beginning) without wanting to see him get his just desserts. This is the sort of movie that will keep you coming back for more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very slow movie with some pretty good visual effects, but it would have been good if the film didn't try to force some sort of emotional or psychological message on the audience.   The ending just seems very contrived and is hard to take all that's been said seriously after the first 30 seconds. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is not good!    It's not a bad film.   As a fan of horror movies I found it entertaining (I don't have a big budget for bad horror films, so I wasn't too disappointed).   You see a house that has been built over a stream.  The house is abandoned (because of a flood), and the flood has destroyed it completely.  There is one occupant living in this house, but his name is never mentioned.  It is always implied that this is the house that was destroyed by the flood.  This isn't a bad thing.    It does have an interesting concept.  You have a young couple living in a house where a family has died in a flood. The two have to stay, and they must deal with whatever happens in this very haunted house.  However, it isn't very frightening.  I don't think the house looks particularly creepy or creepy at all, but it is still a good idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story begins by depicting how much money is wasted on junk food.  This is not a good movie to see and it is also not a great movie either.    This is trash and should never be mentioned in a film criticism article, or any kind of movie discussion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved how the film was told from the first minute.   In a very good way.  The story is well-paced and the characters are well-developed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Rock", the Rock, the Rock!  He's the greatest, he's the best, he is the Rock.  I know it's not really the Rock - it's his face, which is covered with the same sort of beard that gives the Rock the face of a hippie in a bad daydream.    I can't be the rock but the Rock is what's really important in this movie.  But, the bad part about this movie is - if you thought the Rock in his rockin' car from the beginning was great, watch what happens.  I had some friends and relatives over the holidays and I had this movie playing on the TV.  It made me really nostalgic for the Rock I knew growing up in the 70's - who I had no clue was a rock star until this movie came out.  The movie starts with Rock being on vacation in an airplane going to a big rock concert.  We get to see him in all his Rock-in' man rockin', rocking out, rockin his car around the parking lot.  That's great - it gets everyone really excited!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very good movie but not what you would expect a good film to be. It is about a man who kills a few people who he finds trying to rape a woman but then he learns she is pregnant and then she kills herself and then he decides to kill more of those people and this leads him on a journey of killing other people as well as all of his friends. It sounds like a good fun film but it is nothing more than that and the end is a bit of a letdown. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one of the more bizarre parts of the movie, the villain is confronted with an old man whom he had shot once and then revived. The old man dies a second time and it is then that the real villain is revealed. The elderly villain turns out to be one of those men who were forced by the British authorities to work in a factory and were all tortured into giving up any knowledge of who they were. I was very disappointed to find out who these were, but I guess they did have some good acting in them and were supposed to be a bad guys, but they were quite pleasant. The ending left me quite confused. It is clear that the old man had an interest in these men and wanted to see them all dead, and this had to happen. The villain then dies of a heart attack and then the old guy comes back and tries to kill the hero but he is too fast for him. Then the hero says it all in the last scene. I would have liked to see more of these bad guys and how they all got together to kill a hero, but what happened was all a bit much and I didn't really get to like the villain that much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were a couple of things in this movie that I would like to correct in a later review. First, the "I just want to die already" voice-over (by a woman) really annoyed me. I knew she was a horrible actress, but still. And I'd rather hear a good voice than a voice-overs to go along with a bad one. Second, a lot of the humor seemed like it was ripped from someone else's show. It's not a bad show, but it's certainly nothing that I'd want to watch any more than I would watch this movie. At times I'd even wish that it would just shut up already (even though I knew I'd end up laughing).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was excited about going to see this one because  I am a big fan of  the  TV show that is based off the books.   It's funny to me that, even though   the shows are made to be spoofs on the books, you can't even get a decent ending for a good book.  I got the TV version of the book about 20 years ago but the book was only published in 1993 so   I really don't recall how good this was.  The cast is pretty good.  And at least there's some action that doesn't leave me cold. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is an old classic from a different time but it's always good to see a great movie that gets a lot of nostalgia thrown at it. A few actors seem to have aged very well in the decade they are in but everyone else seems to have been very ill advised. If you are going to make a movie about people who think they are the future then at least make it fun and interesting and if you can't then this one is definitely not one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so lame that it is unbelievable! It is the most pathetic movie ever made! There is a guy that can't even ride a bike. The girl is ugly! She doesn't even smile! The actor looks like a fat man. The music is a joke. The story is so stupid. The only thing it has going for it is the good acting by the actor! I have seen more pathetic movies than this one! It was just another boring movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are only a few movies that are so bad that they are actually funny. That's how bad this film is. It is simply a bunch of bad actors, horrible sound recording and bad lighting. I was just going to leave this movie after a few minutes and I never came back again. It's like an acid trip! The only good thing about this film was that my family and I were laughing as it was going on.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a huge fan of the first Harry Potter movie; it's a bit of a drag. I thought that if it was going to be a live-action series, they should have done a better job. It's a shame that a little more time was spent making them look like actual witches rather than Harry Potter (I don't even like the Potter movies) I don't know what happened to them. They look like they were made up out of the last remaining pieces of clay from an old Egyptian mummy; they're completely ridiculous, and have the worst voice acting ever (I couldn't take them seriously when the narrator was doing all the talking).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is a bunch of kids go to the island of Rita, supposedly to see a monkey.  There are various monkeys on the island, but no monkey is seen on the cover and they don't seem to do anything.    The movie isn't bad, the acting is good and the story is not bad.  The kids aren't much of a threat.  There is a lot of humor in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best part about this movie was the awesome "The Legend of Tarzan" that was never mentioned.   We hear about the jungle, we see apes and all that, but it's mostly a pretty boring movie.  There were a few good moments and Tarzan got to do some amazing feats, but overall it's kind of just a forgettable, boring film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a little something about this movie that, despite all the weirdness and bizarreness, makes me love it. It's funny, it's touching, and the acting is good. This movie is a good example of how we should view things in a magical land where we are meant to love and be loved by everything that exists.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie makes me sick. It's the same movie over and over again with different sets, locations and actors. Why does the "good girl" always have to win? Why does she always have a romantic partner that doesn't love her back? I'm disgusted by the entire movie. It makes no sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So this film is about a group of teenagers who, because they're from a low-income area, are the victims of the "White Trash" phenomenon. This is a movie about white trash which is a good thing. White trash is the perfect epitome of everything that sucks about the American culture, from the arrogance to the trash, in addition to its lack of self-awareness and awareness of itself as a "culture." But, despite my good will for this movie, I wish it would have spent more time showing that there really is something about the white trash culture that's good, that there are a whole lot of people who really love America and that we really should appreciate our national pastime as much as we do. And don't get me started on all the awful things that Americans like to do to the land of the free. This movie should have started with something more than a brief scene of someone driving through a swamp and trying to find a place where they can sit out the rain by reading a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to be honest here. I didn't like this movie. I loved the concept and I loved that it was made by a guy who actually understood his craft and understood the audience, so that's great. But the acting was terrible, the story was nonsensical, and the special effects were laughable. A movie made by an unknown who couldn't be bothered with any detail and who just wanted to make a cheap movie about some characters that we don't like in some lame way, is no good. You know, I'm not going to watch a movie like this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the most stupid and pointless movies you'll ever see.   In an effort to prove he's a smart guy, the actor does a stupid thing - has a little character act out a stupid scene.  It's kind of like when you're at a sports game and someone who has no game shows up with his own team's jersey - the announcer says he will "beat the other team" and the crowd yells "yeah, right!"   The plot of the movie is the same as all the other sports films made during the Sixties, but in a film set in the 1960s.  So the team is winning against all odds, then the kid says he wants to join the team.  The old coach is appalled, but the coach's father is a great shot, and the father is sure that the kid is going to be a big star in the big league.  He agrees and sends him to training camp - with some difficulty - to show how great a shot he is.  But the kid has a nervous breakdown and has to be hospitalized, and then he has to go back to camp, this time as a pitcher.  Again, the old coach thinks the kid could use a change - so he sends him as a relief pitcher. But he throws so poorly that he's back in the hospital (where he has the same nervous breakdown again).   Now it's the 1950s and the team thinks that the coach is crazy and they leave him behind - but then the coach appears at their practice field in a big truck and says that he is going back to live in the woods where he will work hard and maybe one day be one of those old-time baseball players and get a big league job.  They send him out with a baseball that was given to him by a woman he met.  And that's that - that's all the movie has to offer - and it has a few nice shots but it has very poor acting and an ill-written script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie at least 4 times and I don't know how people who watch this crap can keep doing it. It is terrible and has no redeeming features. It's not like they had a director in mind and then said "Let's make a movie about an old man and his grand-daughter and that's all we need to know." It is just a sad and pathetic story told with a silly soundtrack and some really awful acting. That's it, nothing else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For a movie so bad, a man should be able to do it, so he has. There was a scene earlier in the movie when a man is seen wearing the same kind of dress he's wearing in the end of the movie. What the hell, this is a movie that has an ending, and it is an absolute disgrace.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason I say "bad" is because this movie is filled with so much awfulness. I could go on and on with the awfulness but this is a good place to start. I don't know why it took so long for a writer as bad as I am (he wrote "The Adventures of the Misfit" and "The Last Boy on Earth") to become a director. And, it shows. The writing is horrible and it is difficult to watch. It would have been better if they just didn't use the opening and closing credits as the opening credits but I guess that is the way the world has gone in the last 40 years. The performances are also awful. The only one who shines is Alan Arkin but there are so many actors who are not good in this movie it is hard to keep track. The special effects are also bad and are not done well. The worst was the "ghost" that the doctor uses to scare the kids. It was an expensive special effects that were badly done and didn't look like they could be in any movie. In short, the whole movie is bad and it was a waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The opening sequence for this movie is very reminiscent of "Raiders of the Lost Ark".   There's a lot of talking about how the movie was an "A" rated film.  It has a little bit of James Bond-esque humour (and some very crude language) but it's no action film.  It has action, a big opening chase scene, plenty of explosions, lots of explosions (and I'm not talking about explosions that make a sound like a thunderclap), some good old fashioned Hollywood stuff too (that's what you're paying for I guess).  It's pretty entertaining but I couldn't be bothered to watch through the whole film.    The movie starts in a deserted desert.  A group of people run out of a truck to see if any cars are out there but find the driver (who is actually a giant robot) has crashed his car into a building.  The giant robot takes the people's vehicle (called a Hovercycle) for a ride around in the desert.   Then the robot spots a bunch of people who don't seem to know where they are and he chases after them.  I guess they're going to a desert island because a lot is happening there, but that doesn't stop the movie from being full of people trying to escape.   The giant robots are so fast that the people don't even get a chance to escape the chase (although we do see some people riding around in their hovercycles).   The hovercourses are pretty slow but the robots keep up with them so you can see them just as they arrive at their destination.  A military group is sent to deal with the robot but they arrive too late and the robot kills every one of them so well they don't have time to flee.  The giant Robot also notices a beautiful woman who's walking down the desert but she's not allowed to stay with the military men to whom she's been invited.   It sounds like a bad romance movie, but it actually isn't.   It's about a giant robots who chase the people around the desert, get the girl, shoot her dead and then leave.    It really is a terrible movie but it has a cool looking special effects scene involving a gigantic helicopter which makes the movie.  If you like bad movies this one isn't for you.   Overall Rating:   5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have ever seen!   I got a terrible feeling watching this one.   It all went to hell within seconds of the opening credits!  They did a very poor job with this movie.  The character design was the worst part. They made their lead look like an obese dog.  They made the characters "human" for a brief time, which is probably why I still like this movie!  The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it made my children laugh!!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have any patience, you will enjoy this movie as it tells the story of how the movie producers of that day thought they could get away with selling the "perfect" girl for a song.   I've seen this movie three times and every time I get a little more "in the mood" for it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A group of four people are at a family reunion. When they arrive, there are four old people and one baby. The old people all look a little old and frail and it is hard to picture them looking happy or cheerful. There is also a little woman wearing a fancy dress, who seems to be a total wimp and it seems that none of them enjoy any of the entertainment. When it is time to go to bed and they sit around the table, the old people get up and go outside to smoke. The movie starts. The four old folks are smoking and laughing and talking and laughing, enjoying themselves and looking a little silly. Then, one of the old folks steps up to the front and sings a song. It is pretty good, even if I wouldn't put it in the top three of all the old movies I have ever seen. I would watch it again if I had an old person to watch it with.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember when this film came out and being excited to see a gay action movie. As it turns out this movie was all about how gay dudes are really bad at everything. The only saving grace for these badasses is the fact that their costumes are quite funny and they're really hard to take out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know if I can remember a bad film that was more hilarious than a piece of garbage in general.   The only part of this film that could be deemed hilarious would be the ridiculous title.  The film is about a boy that is obsessed with a television show called "Dinner For Five". He lives in a house with his mother and grandmother (who look like Joan Collins). The house belongs to his father, who works in a factory.  One day, his father calls him to his office for a meeting. His father tells him his son has been transferred to the school for the disabled. His son is sent to a school for "disabilities". It sounds like a joke, but it is in reality! In his class, there are no such thing as disabled students.  After school, he plays with his friends, the school's favorite "Disabled kids".  The "Disability" class is run by the school superintendent and his wife, a woman named "Mrs. V". The teachers at the school are very nice people. It's a nice place to live and the home has everything one could need in a home.  He is the school bully at school and his favorite trick is playing with a puppet that looks like a girl.  His name is "Denny" and he is the class bully.  This film seems like it has a lot of potential, but once the movie opens, the director is not interested in making a funny film at all.  I watched this film with my two year old daughter. The daughter's eyes bulged out and she laughed so hard she cried.  It has a great comedy in it and I'm sure I'm not the only one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'll just say I didn't like this movie as much as I thought I would.  It had a great story, but it didn't have much of anything special.  The script by Mark and Jay McInerney was a bit over-long, though I thought it went in a lot of interesting directions, particularly in the way in which the plot unfolded.  As I said above, the acting was not very good.  There were a number of scenes that I thought seemed unnecessary or over-the-top, and I thought a lot about whether or not I would have enjoyed this movie.  But I can say this:  It is not really a bad film.    I wouldn't say it is the worst movie I have ever seen, but I wouldn' t describe it as a very good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a time in my childhood when I saw the classic film, Back to the Future. While it didn't live up to the amazing film it inspired, it was a movie I loved. Sure, it may not have had the same impact or popularity as Spielberg's, but that movie is still fondly remembered. I don't know what my expectations were going to be going in when I first saw it, but they were pretty high. This movie was going to take the "B" in Back to The Future and make a movie out of it! I am not going to lie to you; when I opened my package, I was pretty disappointed. The movie wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Sure I was going into this hoping for something amazing, but something was a little off. I know what I saw on the screen, but it doesn't match what I remember it was like to have been a kid. Maybe if I could have seen the movie again, I would be impressed by the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a poor little movie: The premise is good: A man has a son who has recently started college. While attending college a "friend" of the father meets a girl and the father gives the girlfriend his daughter in exchange. That's about as good as it gets. And, while the premise has potential, the story doesn't get the job done. The boy doesn't seem too intelligent, the father is clearly in love with the girl and, despite having some kind of a problem with women, is totally unable to stop himself from trying to pick up women. In addition, the parents seem to do their best to discourage the boy from trying something like this: I don't think they have the balls to tell him it is immoral. In the end, his daughter ends up as a pretty good substitute, though she does make some bad decisions along the way. It's not all bad. For example, I liked a scene in which the girl gets her father to come to the wedding because she is a bad girl: A girl is a pretty damn good dancer: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film that, sadly, is an all-too-familiar story, that begins with a little girl who is walking home from a summer camp. The woman at the gate tells her she's not allowed to cross the street because the house next door is haunted. But the girl, whose name is Rose, is determined to see the house. She decides she is "gonna jump" the fence. She swings across the street and ends up in a room with the house and its residents all in a bad mood. She is dressed as a man (because no one's in a good mood) and jumps on a bed where a dog is sleeping, which, it turns out, is a wolf. In between the wolf and Rose, Rose sees a small boy, who is also a man, and then a little boy and a girl, who are all dressed as women. Rose then asks the boy a question and the boy responds by giving her roses, which he finds a pretty good reason to pick out in a deserted house. Rose's father is happy with the girl and the dog but the rest of the family is not.   This story seems to be an archetypal tale about little girls who, through courage, are able to escape the ghosts of a house and a little dog.  The movie doesn't stand up to its premise. This story isn't good. I didn't like it but it didn't do me any harm either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's funny, it's good, it has some great acting, and one of the best endings ever. However it should probably be rated a 9 or so. If you're the type of person that hates on bad movies in general - and even worse films when you can't tell what the director was thinking, then you will not be happy with this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After spending a few weeks at the lake with my family and a few friends (my kids are only 3, but I'm not complaining), I found out that I would be back to Disney in January 2017! We arrived early and my husband, dad and I were ready for a good time. The park was pretty quiet at the start and my mom, who worked for Disney, went off and got us a couple of burgers from the diner. She brought back a tray of delicious fries and a nice, but not great, drink. I got a burger, fries and my mother brought me a nice glass of ice tea. We went to the Pirates of the Caribbean and I had no time to enjoy a ride on that ship. I saw a few people who were having fun and a couple dancing. We all ended up back in the lounge room to watch the movie and I went for a walk around the beach. After the movie I went back to the lodge and took a nap. The sun was about to go down and I was going to make it to my cabin by 2:00 am. I had to wait about an hour for my cabin. I checked into my bed and started writing a nice long letter to my mom. I have lots of family here at the lodge, but my parents are the only ones I have, so they are the ones that come to the resort to watch my show. They are all really nice people and I have so many pictures and memories with them in the Lodge. It is so wonderful to go back. I was tired after a great show. I woke up early and walked to the beach and had a long walk to the parking lot. The lodge was so neat! A very warm room and lots of good food. The staff was super friendly. I'm sure they enjoy my shows and they try to make the guests feel comfortable. I will come back to see my show and hang out with my friends! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First, I would like to say that I'm a fan of the original Blade Runner.  But I don't like how the movie is now edited.  For instance, this is a movie about a replicant.  We know from the first time we see that she is no more than a body.  The reason why she's alive is because the replicants are made to be a perfect replica of an individual.  Yet the film has a lot of problems with these replicents.  Here's a problem:    If you don't think that a robot replicat is a real person, you don' t think that much at all.  You have to put that movie away and forget about it before going out to get your cheeseburger. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I have ever seen. It's just an embarrassment. Why didn't they make a movie where a poor boy's mother has died and her son is trying to live with his family?   There are a couple good songs.   I don't know how they could have made this worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is not a movie to enjoy. It is made by a moron. It takes forever for anything to happen and it goes on forever. I had to sit and listen to it for 10 hours because it just kept going on about the same thing over and over again. It was horrible. I don't recommend it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the trailer, you think it's pretty bad. But the truth is, that's what this movie is about: It is about the bad guys getting a bunch of crazy women for them. And then the bad guy just keeps on running off with them in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was so awful! I love to watch good, original, fun films and this was no such film. The worst thing was, this film was so bad that I almost thought it would end up being an "action" movie, but, alas, it was nothing more than "action".  I think I can give this movie zero stars because I simply would not buy it, even though I think it was very good in its own right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found it to be a very boring movie. I can't think of a better way to spend a couple of minutes.    It is a film about a boy and his sister who fall in love and start a relationship. They soon become a father and a mother.   This is a movie that is too dumb to believe, as it's a movie where the brother and sister meet each other and fall in loves.  The brother's sister has a strange look that's like a snake and can eat anything that is not in the proper place in the forest.   The sister, who is about 5 years older than the brother, seems like the ideal companion, and they soon fall in a relationship in which they're forced to grow up together.   A lot of things that you'll see in other movies don't really happen. The girl doesn't fall in LOVE. She falls in love with something else. And the brother just grows up too fast.    This movie is just a horrible movie. If I'm being 100% honest, I'm not sure how I could like it. I like some things from it. The sister does seem like the perfect companion because she is smart and she loves books. I also like a lot of other things from this movie. The movie has a lot to it. It has comedy, it has the sister's love for books, it also has love between a parent and a child, and it also doesn't make it seem like a kid's movie.  But at the end of the day, this is a terrible movie and a movie with too many of the same jokes over and over again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So a new movie, about a child born with severe dwarfism, who finds it hard to go to the school and work with the people in his village. (He's got a large size for a dwarf.) He gets a job as a farmer, with his brother (as the story goes) and sister (as they say), but has a lot to deal with. He's a good kid, and it's a nice story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad I have to use the word "stupid" and "clunky" to describe the plot.   The movie's main characters are: - a guy who likes to get into trouble, with his friends, and who likes getting into trouble.  It is fun being silly with him.  A couple of the jokes work:      If you read this review a few times it is very obvious where the humor is coming from.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I laughed a few laughs at a couple of these, but I don't think it's a lot to laugh at.  The story is about a man who finds out he was adopted by his great-great-grandfather, a World War I tank commander.  In other words, this movie is made for people who enjoy watching silly movies in their basements.  This is pretty much exactly what you would expect with a movie like this.  As a side note, this film is rated PG-13 which means if you're going to show a tank commander getting his butt beat in a WWI trench, you might as well also show him in a hot tub. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I thought it would be a good idea to watch a new movie called "The World's Dumbest Police Movie".   It's a police movie that was a hit back in the 1970s (with the original cast and the lead, who wasn't even really funny) and a bad one as well (the music is awful and the pacing is horrible).   I don't remember a lot about it.   The movie opens up with a bunch of officers trying to arrest a couple of drunken drivers.  It doesn't take long, but by the end the cops are driving an ambulance around like it's a toy.  The best thing about this movie was that the director was a pretty decent guy.  This movie doesn't have the charm it used to have and it's not really worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The one positive thing about this movie is that it has a happy ending.    When I watched this movie (I was only five years old, no less) I remember being very disappointed.  I was hoping it would go on to be a good movie but it definitely was not.  It is a very boring movie about a boy who goes and plays at the circus.  The other kids play with toys; they don't want to play at the carnival, they want to be free. The boy wants to be at the top of the food chain, which is why his father sends him there to be the best clown there is.  He has a girlfriend, but she seems bored of him.  After he has played for a couple of hours he is tired and wants to sleep but the girl doesn't want that.  They sleep on the couch; she just wants to have a snuggle.  She takes the opportunity to steal a kiss from the clown.  Unfortunately, the clown doesn't understand the rules of the carnivals very well.  This is a short movie with little action and it really has a boring ending. That's not to say that it is not enjoyable at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies you wish you could be there to see.  If you were there, you'd have to agree.   But there are not very many people to watch this film in a theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't see this movie as bad at all. It's a movie which is at least in the vein of the film it tries to be. Its not a bad film.   The plot is pretty bad.  From the beginning its obvious that the whole movie is a ruse.  It turns out the hero of the movie (Milton) is a pedophile.  While this doesn't matter very much, and is mostly explained in the last 30 minutes, it still bugs me.  Also, how does the guy (Titus) find out the true identity of the real bad guy?  Is that the hero's girlfriend?   There is a whole lot wrong with the story.  First of all, Milton is the only good guy in the movie. This is not a good thing.  He is the one who goes into a room and shoots a boy that he finds in the attic. He does this while he has a girl by the name of Lisa by his side. He then takes a bullet for the boy he shot.  This all sounds horrible in an earlier point in the film, but it is understandable. In any case, Milton becomes a hero because he is saved. He is not the most likable guy in this movie.  Then he becomes a teacher and he takes the students for a night on the town.   Here comes an interesting point. The students go to a gay bar. What do the kids do at the bar?  There's an incident at the end where a guy in a dress runs into the bar. This person is identified as Milton.  Is this the same guy that the boy and Lisa went to the bar with?  I mean, if you follow the logic, you'd think that the people that the kids see there are the ones that they killed at the start of the first movie. However, this is not true. The people that they see there, as well as those that they meet at the beginning of the second movie, are the same.  After the night on a town, the people who the kids come across are completely different.  They're wearing dresses and there are girls who are much more attractive than Lisa.  I guess, this might be an improvement in the first half.  But this does not happen in the second half either.  These people have different personalities.  There are many times when I thought that this was the film's idea at first.  One example is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has more dialogue than most of it's genre counterparts and it's not the most coherent movie, even for a slasher. There's a lot of blood and gore, but there's little else going on. It's the kind of film where I was never really sure what to think, but I couldn't help but feel sick, even when I saw the credits roll.   The director of the movie was a good guy, but you can see he was out of his depth a little bit in this one. There were plenty of people who were pretty well-versed in this stuff and he had no idea what to do with it. The people who had done it before in other movies were just as good, but it just wasn't their style. It would be an interesting experiment for someone to try and make a movie like this into an actual movie with some interesting characters and interesting plot, but that's not possible. It just looks like a bunch of guys running around, not acting like they're in a movie and not trying to create any tension or suspense.  's story is pretty ridiculous and there is a fair amount of gore to keep your eyes peeled for. There isn't much action, but nothing is really suspenseful. I would suggest watching this with a strong stomach. You may want to go to the bathroom and stay there as it's pretty hard to stomach the plot.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this with my husband for the first time a few years ago. It was the first movie we watched together that wasn't "A Christmas Carol".  It seemed like an innocent family movie and it was.  The only time we really talked about it was in the car after we watched it.   It had a good cast, a good concept, and a well made movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film does NOT live up to the hype. In fact, it is quite the opposite. The movie, which was created by the legendary director John Waters, attempts to give an inside view of the drug-fueled party scene in San Francisco during the late 1970s. At times, it feels like a film of the past. And that's a good thing. There are a few interesting ideas that Waters tries to cram into a very short movie, but the film's structure is so clunky it's really hard to follow. Waters' attempts at satire are pretty blatant in this film. And the movie does not succeed in doing anything to change the culture of this city of angels. But it might not matter anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say there is something wrong with this movie is a gross understatement. You will not find a film this bad. You won't even find a movie in theaters that bad. A bad movie is bad no matter who writes it. I thought I read about a great story behind the movie. Then there were so many terrible characters that you would have to be a nut case to find any redeeming qualities. This movie is nothing more than a train wreck. The director's only intent is to make a quick buck and I believe he failed miserably.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half is decent enough, as does the ending, which is what made me buy this movie. When the film gets serious, it becomes an interesting look at the war in Korea. The only problem I have is the acting. It is so bad that it is hard to take the film seriously. However, the film should be applauded for being the first feature film to deal with a conflict that was, in the past, treated as a joke.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A really, really bad movie. Not only is it bad, it's the kind of bad where you find yourself thinking, "That wasn't bad. That wasn't even bad." The story revolves around a man who has an extremely limited life span, one that is made far worse when he turns thirty. His death is so swift and unexpected that it brings a sense of awe and wonder to his remaining years. He then spends the rest of his life trying to come to terms with what has happened to him, in all its finality.   So how does a movie get into the Hall of Villains? Well, there are a lot of people in this movie with no personality other than a name that no one in Hollywood wants to hear or read. It's a movie about the "Man who would not die" who has a very limited life expectancy.  The whole movie takes place on the floor of a hotel, and is filmed as if someone could jump in and out and walk around as if nothing is happening. The film would look so bad if it weren't for the "wacky" special effects, which includes a guy who can turn into a lion, a woman who can transform into an eagle, and a lady who transforms into a fish. I mean, you just can't make this stuff up.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a poorly done movie that is filled with lots of characters and no plot. It's only worth checking out for the funny actors. It was directed by Joe Dante who does an alright job but if he got it in film he couldn't have made it funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not going to watch this.   If you are a fan of horror movies then you will likely enjoy it.  The film is about a man with an extreme amount of self control.  But, just when his patience is at its end, two men show up.  I believe it's called the "Vampire Men".   The plot, at first looks, would make it a little disturbing to watch.  It doesn't, really.  This is not a very good horror movie.  Some of the scenes are not very good.  There is also a bit of rape (no really) in this movie.     The "villains" are not all bad.  They are portrayed fairly well in this film.  These are people who need to be "fixed".  This isn't a film that you want to put on when you want some entertainment.  So, if you want a quick thrill, you might want to try a different movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful.  It has been out for a year now, and if you haven't seen it then you obviously don't care about movies.  The best thing about the movie, besides the performances, is the soundtrack.  I can't believe it wasn't written by John Lennon.  This movie should have been a comedy, but the movie tries to be a drama.  There is a lot of pointless fighting, and some of the scenes are laughable.  For someone who is a fan of action movies like this one, this movie is very disappointing.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be fair, it's better than The Rock.  There's nothing really that makes you say "This is the best movie ever made," it is what it is: a movie.  The only time the film comes close to making any sort of impact is when it's on "A Star Is Born" but even then, the impact is minimal.  I really can't think of a better way to spend your Sunday morning.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The premise is an obvious rip off of  .. Well, we should not judge a work by its cover, as the title says. It is a horror movie. It does not look like it has much of a budget. I would not call the makeup and effects cheap either. The music is not bad and you get a decent bit of story.   It would probably be better if it were just a short one and then ended, but as it is a part of a series of 3 it is probably only 2 min of horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The "A" rated film is really a "B" rated one.  The story is a tad rushed and is far from being the story of a man who finds himself in a world where "The A" and "The B" are really different and there is a whole lot of violence going on in "the world".    And yet, this is still a good film.   A-plus for the soundtrack but the film does leave a bad taste in my mouth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good movie is a movie to remind you that you aren't all that special and that we are all in this together.  What I didn't like:   I thought the movie was very good.   The action was good. I am not even going to bother with talking about the characters because all of them are really good. It is a shame that the story ends in a way that is less than satisfying because it could have used a little more action.  It might not be good for everybody, but I enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For some reason, I'm feeling like a bad-boy, because every movie I've been in has been one of the worst films I've ever seen. I mean, look at this one! It's a big old boring, cliche movie about a guy whose boss, Mr. Daffy, takes care of his son... He's kind of a bad guy, a kind of bad guy who's kind-of a good guy. It's just a movie about people in a movie... And that's about the sum-of-its-parts that you can get from this thing. I can't say I ever thought this was going to be any good because this movie is so dumb. You think this is just a bad kid's movie, but it's not. I think this movie could never make the money it cost to make it. I just can't see a movie that is so stupid and bad. I'm so sick of movies like this! So, please, people, don't think that your kids just have to watch these bad movies in order to learn about bad movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most boring movie I've ever seen. It seemed to be made for children, so nothing to write home about but an old woman with nothing better to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was never a fan of this movie because it's so bad and I'm not a big fan of any movies that were made with so little money. The only good thing about it is the lead, who plays the same character in all the movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the most annoying parts of this movie was it trying to mimic a very different film -  'Hair'  -  which it never really succeeds at.  It starts off very silly - we see a man with very long hair cut out - only for it to reappear a few seconds later - at which point it quickly becomes clear that this is the main character in the movie.  He's very annoying.  The characters are all a little wooden - the woman who keeps trying to get him to "make out" with her is an insult to real women, the man who thinks he's in a 'dance' video is an over-sexed fool, the poor chap who thinks they are in a  'haunted' 'House'  isn't quite as bad as he appears.   A lot of what we see is in the style of a 'television film'  It's not really about the story, or about the people we meet, nor is it really about a haunted house, it's more about the setting, the costumes, and the people - which means it has all the trappings of what is becoming the new low brow horror for the year, i.e. old people in fancy dress, people who are supposed to be dead, people dressed as animals, etc.  And this is all done at a fairly high budget for a movie - for what we're shown it looks like something out of a low budget horror movie - we're not even allowed to see the people, so they're all silhouettes at times, the camera does a poor job of filming all the 'action' (and, of course, we see it through the window of a moving car) but it doesn't really matter, it never actually gets 'interesting'.  The ending is pretty good too - we learn that the people have been killed by something that's apparently supernatural (but I have a feeling it might have a bit more to it than that), which is kind of interesting - we finally get to see what this thing is, and it's kind of scary.  I found this movie to be quite a bore, but I do give it a 4/10: it's so boring it doesn'd like to have been an episode of 'Twin Peaks' 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie of 2016. The film is like an episode of "The Walking Dead". Just a bunch of zombies running around a city. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not really scary or scary at all. I mean, there's zombies in movies all the time, like the Zombie film from a few years back (also on this list) or a couple of episodes of "VHS" from the 80's. And that was an episode. The best zombie movies are the ones from the 20th Century. "Night of the Living Dead" was the best, followed by "I Am Legend" and "The Last of the Mohicans". But these are just movies, and the first one has a bunch more problems. I'm talking about the character in the middle. This is the only time in the movie where you have to say "That's a terrible actor!" If you want to see some good acting, you will find it in the other movies in the first half of the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My friend, the one who got me into the theater in the first place, left the theater and I sat there in embarrassment and disappointment.    He told me he really wasn't happy with the movie (but he said I needed to see it.)   When it was over my friend walked into the lobby and looked at me with a shocked expression on his face.  "Did they actually think it was funny?" he asked with his eyebrows up.  I don't know if this is the end of the story or not, but I don`t think they ever really expected it to work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Catch Me If You Can is a pretty bad movie, full of clichés and bad acting.  The movie takes place at a big party at a mansion.    The main character, Tom, has a crush on the housewife, and his cousin, Jack, is a really handsome handsome man.  When the women's husbands are away, they go to the parties together.  As the women are getting drunker and drunker, Jack seems to be becoming a bit of a loser.  The story of Tom's life gets into big trouble when he falls in love with the housekeeper, Missy (who is played by Susan Hillenbrand).   After trying unsuccessfully to get her to leave him, Tom goes to the police to explain to the head of the police department about her.  There is a scene where Tom is talking to Missy while he is sitting in his limousine.  After he falls asleep, MissY turns off the engine and he wakes up with a hangover. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a number of bad movies out there on the silver screen.   I was born in 1975, which means my childhood years were not quite as exciting as Hollywood is portraying them.  One of my first memories is of my parents sitting in the living room watching a movie on TV.  At first I thought it was just a TV game show.  There was one scene when the kid on the family's boat was being chased by a shark with his arms out to either side of his head.  I remember the family, all in white swim trunks and white cotton shirts, laughing so hard while the kids on the boat were getting eaten by sharks.  Later that evening we all came home to a white sheet in the driveway, the family were all dressed for the occasion, but they were dressed in white because of the movie.  It was a pretty lame movie I think.  The story was about a man who lives on a secluded island and is the only white person in a world of brown.  He is a loner who likes to fish and play games.  However, he gets a visit from a guy that he doesn't think is real, but actually has the power to be in two places at the same time.  This was pretty stupid because even though I didn't understand the story it was still amusing to see a fish come out of the water and eat a shark.  My dad would sometimes take me with him on fishing trips.  We would spend some time fishing around the islands and the beach as the waves would creak and the sun would slowly bake the beach.  A favorite spot for us was at the end of a pier.  On the end it looked over to a small beach with little coves and small cottages just off to the left.  Every day a different person would come and stand along this pier.    There were about 5 or 6 of them when I would have a good time fishing with my dad, but only one would come out on the day I had the best time.   He would walk up to the end, look out at the ocean, smile and then he would jump in the ocean with a giant sword and then walk back out onto the pier.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was pretty much expecting this. This was the same film as 'The Haunting of Hill House' (1991), which is about the last family to live in the haunted home. I was very disappointed. The new house does have an interesting history, however it is so over-hyped by the media that it's more like an episode of the old soap opera, 'Gilligan's Island'. I really was expecting something much more different, I just can't believe the hype. I'm not a big horror movie buff but this is the worst movie I have seen in many years.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a terrible movie. It is horrible and poorly made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not only was this terrible movie bad, but it made a mockery out of every movie in this sub-genre.  The acting was bad, the special effects were laughable, and the story was lame.    A bad movie with a poor plot that makes you wish for a movie about a monkey stealing a car or the little girl in a bathtub (and yes that was a child in the movie who I am sure had no idea she was going to be in a movie).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To my dismay, this is not a good movie, but not bad either, this will not entertain you with its violence, gore, horror, or even a story. Its a sadistic film, where it makes fun of the violent and the brutal.  As far as the story, the protagonist is a violent and sadistic cop, with a sick fascination for a little girl who was raped, tortured, and killed. The first half of the movie is just a montage of scenes of abuse and violence, with the rapist slowly becoming more and more insane until he breaks the little girl's neck (and the movie really has no interest in showing the story from beginning to end). It's really a very sadistic piece of cinema, but it's not entertaining. There are some good parts here, including a scene where the cop is seen shooting an old man's dead dog (he kills the dog, which is pretty sadistic). A few good parts, but a little too much for this movie to be an enjoyable piece of entertainment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am one of those fans who thought that "The Thing" was a bad but hilarious movie.  It was funny, and the creatures looked quite realistic.  The Thing was a very smart idea, and is one of the coolest movies ever made.  I am glad that it is available, though.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a great movie. It is very poorly directed, very badly acted and it is very badly written. It has nothing in common with the classic movies of Hollywood. It may even be inferior. What it has in common is that it is written by the guy who has a film that is similar to the other ones he has. Not only that but in the movie he is playing a movie maker. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am a lifelong fan of The Omen, and even though I had to see this remake on TV with a broken set, I was hooked. While I don't think this version is nearly as good as the original, it was still entertaining with the characters and a good bit of gore. A good, fun ride, I'd highly recommend it if you like the original.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one weird, bad movie. It's set in a world filled with magical, animal-like creatures and their minions. That's about all the plot I can make out. We're told a great deal about them and we see them, but not much more than that. I don't know if the creatures in this movie are magic, but maybe they're just more like real-world cartoon animals -- a bunch of weird-looking creatures that aren't very scary at all. If you like kids' movies, and if you like the weird, strange world created by the director of the other movies mentioned above, then you'll probably like this one. If, like me, you're not a big fan of kids' films and you like weird, unusual worlds created by people who aren't afraid to be weird and unusual, then this is definitely not your movie. But if you're like me and you want to see weird, out-there things in a weird, wild world filled to the brim with weird, unearthly creatures... Well, watch out.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an adaptation of a famous novel by H.P. Lovecraft which was published in 1921. Although very little of this movie has anything to do with Lovecraft's work, it still contains some of the creepiest stuff ever put on celluloid. In the case of this particular film, it is all in the editing; there is no real plot and no characters of any consequence and very little atmosphere. There is very little in the way of scares; you may even say that the film is completely uneventful. It does contain two brief scenes of the same thing happening again and again and then being quickly brushed aside, but these are not disturbing or frightening, just tedious and silly. It would be easy to compare the film to those old silent films like The Crap, The Great Pumpkin, and The Hound Of The Baskervilles, but none of the two are even remotely Lovecraftian. If there are any people who have read H. P. Lovecraft's stories, they will recognize these scenes within the films as being the "dream sequences" found in each tale, and I think it is rather clever to have the "hero" of the story wake up in a strange, dream-like, alien world every time he does so. So that is one kind of Lovecraft. This "other" version of Lovecraft does not even bother with his "dream scenes" for the most part. The "plot" is so simplistic and unimaginative that you would think they had written a Hollywood movie rather than a classic novel. This one is not an enjoyable movie, but the characters and setting are not bad and the camerawork is good. The only thing to keep in mind is that it was filmed in 1930 and not 1921 and it is set in the 1930's rather than the 1920's. This movie contains very little actual Lovecraftian material and probably should be watched for a laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a low point in my life. I watched this movie at a friend's house. I think a couple people were over. It is about a woman who is in love with a man who is not good looking, and she finds him attractive. I liked it a lot. It was slow paced. I would have liked to see this movie with a little more action. This movie doesn't really have a climax. However, it was still a good movie. Posted by David S. at 6:20 PM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We all know they are going to say it is an amazing movie.   And it is, but there is a big problem with it that almost renders it a total waste.  The movie centers around two lovers going to visit their dead loved ones.  When they get to the house they don't get to see the people they thought would be at the front door.  Because they are both the wrong type of dead (skeleton or zombie)  These people are not there.   So we are supposed to assume that they have gone in there to die.   Unfortunately it never actually occurs.  So instead of ending the movie with a nice little movie moment, we get a pretty much useless film.  I guess it was intended to be a short movie with only two hours run time.  It is not.  And even worse it doesn't end with a big cliff hanger so we are left hanging.  We can only hope that this is something that will appear in a future movie so we can get some closure.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, you will end up getting a lot of questions.  How did they get in there so easily?   How do they live there when the house was so full of zombies?   And why does our hero not understand why they are there?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a bad film, but the badness was not of the quality you would expect from an action movie directed by the notorious Chuck Norris. The action wasn't really much better than the action in a movie called "The Black Panther". The bad guys were just the black ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the second installment of his 'The Legend of Zelda' trilogy, Aonuma has taken the idea of 'open world games' and given them more of a sense of mystery than what you could find in a'real-world' game. In this world you can explore the land in any way you like, and find many interesting things to do along the way. Unfortunately, there is a real feeling that Link's adventures could have taken place in another era with an even better story. I enjoyed the story being told in the series, but the game does not hold any of the charm and charm that Aonumi had shown us in the previous 2 games. For an open world game, this one does a poor job of it. The controls are a bit clumsy, the levels are bland and uninspired, and all the NPCs in the game are uninspired as well. While the story is fun and exciting, it is no longer the same as the previous two games. It is a good game, but not an outstanding one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Devil's Own"  is an abysmal film that I didn't like at all. In fact, it makes me think that Michael Bay is on a roll these days. I know that he makes movies that are just boring and without any real creative energy.  He hasn't directed any good movies lately, and I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't return to the franchise.    I have a feeling that his next movie will be a "mockumentary" type story that is just a load of jokes and not a lot of substance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, you might be saying to yourself, "Wait a minute...I didn't just read an article about a video game that isn't even out yet! Why would someone go to all the trouble of creating a video that looks like a bad 90s game and put a voice over that sounds like it's been recorded by the guy who played the bad 90's video game?" Well, it's all true. The developers wanted to create a game that looked like a video from the nineties, and a lot of the "fun" in the game has to do with the gameplay. I'm not entirely sure why, but I just thought I'd play this game... And I didn't. I got bored. After a few attempts, I gave up. I wish I was as stupid as this game, but it doesn't give the illusion that it's a game. It's just a glorified CGI film. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, but if you're looking for a video with nothing but CGI, a bad voice over, and an "I'M BACK" logo at the end, go right ahead. You can do this... Just watch the stupid video on Youtube.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is so odd about this movie is that they should have just filmed the whole thing without any dialogue. It was so sad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You really have to be there to see this one, as it's the only movie to survive all seven decades that's taken place in the city of Chicago. Well, not exactly the city, although it is still a nice old town, although in some ways it does feel a little like the "old" town of Salem, Massachusetts in the 18th Century, although I would never want to visit that place.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not only does it lack anything original, but it doesn't even try. This is a boring, unoriginal story about a loser who gets his first movie role, finds out it won't play unless he dresses up in a clown costume, and then has to work out for the rest of his life. I would hate to go to a movie like this one to watch an average, uninspired movie with a clown. I mean, I think the clown in this movie looks more like a pug than a human. If a clown were to appear at the movies with a pimp or a whore, everyone would be up in arms and screaming, but nobody would care about a stupid clown. This movie is just too stupid for words. I hope someone finds a way to sell this awful film. I give it a 1/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't usually leave positive reviews of bad movies. I don a very positive review of this movie.  It is the greatest movie in my entire life! I don' t like to leave negative reviews of the movies I've seen, unless I' m so upset with them.  The most amazing part about this movie is that I've never really seen such a bad film, since I was born.  I'm not gonna go too far into it, so you don't have to see it for yourself, I think, but if you're looking for a good movie to watch, this movie will be a great one.  There are no bad or good characters in this movie, but there is a lot of dialogue.   Overall I would give this movie a 5/10, but it's a great movie and I' ll leave you with this: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was born in the year of "Stalin." I never understood why these people are called "communist." I mean, who wants to live under a state which would like to send you to the gulag, send you for a trial, send all your possessions to the land of the peasants, put you into some gulag to suffer the fate of a few others, and then be sent back to die there as a criminal? I had a friend, a fellow traveler back in '44 who took a course of the "Russian" language, and I don't know if he ever got that diploma. But that's the way they talked then, they were so good that no one got a laugh out of it. The whole thing was so ridiculous in every detail, I mean it was absurd. And that's why I found it so good, it reminded me of those times of my boyhood, when I'd go out with the guys to the bar and get a drink in a dirty restaurant in a back alley, and it was nothing but those long shadows of Russian men in the street. I don' t think people like that exist any more, and no sane person ever goes back to the days when people were killed in the streets for trying to get a few dollars. The next one, "Escape From New York" (1947) was just so bad, it was so bad that I have to give the "E" in its title to it.  I saw this when I was about 12. It was all this gangsters. These three guys (Bryan and Dean Keaton), these four guys (Ethan Hawke, Richard Widmark, and Bill Murray), this guy (James Coburn) in a black mask, this guy in a long-tailed coat, that black-mask guy was the guy who shot the police officer. Oh, wait a minute. That's right. The movie was about those guys (and about a girl) who had a crazy dream that one of them, Hawke (an actor who could never act well, but who always seemed to get into trouble) was a member of a gang, which was headed by that black mask guy (who was actually a very intelligent man who had many wives, and lots of girlfriends). So when the dream was confirmed, they ran off to New York and started to rob. But then the cops showed up. Oh no. What happened? Oh, right. The guys
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world where the first black superhero doesn't seem to pop up on TV, a superhero who has red hair is needed more than ever: In a future not much different from our own, in a place where the population is divided according to race, there is a superhero called "Furman." In the future, there was a race war in America between the "Red Indians" and the "White People." Furman is one of these "Red Men." He's a man with a red fur coat, and a red armband with a sword on it, and he dresses up in a red cape and wears red gloves. His weapon is a sword. I liked the idea behind "Fury Road," that the only true frontier of the future is in a land where the majority of people are red; the red people were the losers in the race war, as they were seen as "weak." There is no love lost between the two main characters in the movie. Furman and Denny Crane are two of the "red people" in this world, and their love and rivalry is what drives the story forward. In contrast to the Red Indian character, Furman, played by Hugh Jackman, seems to be more interested in his own accomplishments, and doesn't care too much about the people around him. This seems to contradict the "Rough Riders" and "Yellow Men" of the comics (or even the "Yellow Foil," who is basically a comic counterpart of Denny), who are more interested the the people than in themselves. I found the love triangle more intriguing than the romance between Crane and Furman. The "Furry Monsters" are not actually monsters (unless you call a man who wears a red costume with a cape a monster), but they are not entirely human either. Their costumes are made of the animals they kill, so they look like real animals. I didn't really care for any of the characters, especially the two "Furus" with the red armpands and fur coats. I was hoping they would at least have more development in the movies; in "Furious 7," they only become more of a "flavor" than a part of the story. The only redeeming character was the title character; he gets more development than any other character, and I enjoyed his fight scenes with the other "Furs." The movie was good fun. The fights were great, and the movie could use some humor. If you want

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst films I've ever watched.   I was so mad about how this movie didn't end.  The poor girl gets to her death and no-one does anything about it.  This movie is so bad, I don't even know where to start.  I just wanted to write a bad review about this poor film.  It's just so bad.  As a kid, I didn't realize the magnitude of this movie until I watched it with my wife last summer, and she told me to "stop watching it."   This is such a bad film that the only thing I could come up with is that it's the only bad movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought it was a pretty well made movie.  It wasn't bad, but it was not good either.   Well, it was bad, and worse.    I thought the movie was a good action/comedy, but then they try to make it a horror movie. The result is a bad, bad,   horrible, bad movie.     A: Well, you know that movie "The Shining" which was a really terrible movie. Yes, that was my first movie. Well, I was going to say that it wasn't a bad one.  My problem was that it was way too long.  I think that this is a great movie because it is a little bit scary, but you don't feel all that scared, but that's okay, because you also know that you're not in for much good.  The whole movie is just too long, and I thought that the director was trying to make up for that by making the movie a really scary movie. It just wasn't scary at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've had a problem with this movie since I was a small child. A few of my friends thought it was "so bad it's good", I always said it was a shame it wasn't based on a Stephen King novel. I always thought this movie was a disaster, but I was surprised when I heard a few of the names in this movie. You would think they would use the same actors, I'm not sure about the director or cast. The movie itself was awful. I would give it a C, I thought it'd be a better movie if it had been based on Stephen King's novel.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a shame that I'm still able to give this one four stars.

The bad:  This is a fun movie, but I'd recommend watching the first one first to be sure it's not a total rip-off.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be quite horrible. The main character is really a bad guy. He murders people who are doing nothing but trying to stop the destruction of their homes and businesses. What the hell!? What a guy! He is a complete sociopath who wants to get money in case of any problems. If a problem does occur he goes home and goes to sleep. If he doesn't wake up in 24 hours he dies! What a moron! This movie was filmed in the middle of the jungle so it is a bit difficult to see. In fact, this movie was originally supposed to be in black and white but they changed the color and the picture was too bad to show at a theater. But once the movie was shown in color the image was incredible. The jungle and the movie are stunning. But the poor acting, terrible plot, and horrible bad taste of the movie really put a bad taste into my mouth. This movie will haunt me forever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can't get enough of this.   As the name implies, this movie is all about girls.  One is the school girl and her friends.  Another is the "savage" male.  It starts with the "Savage" asking for a date.  She agrees, and the two of them go on a "date."   The movie starts with a girl named Tessa (Ashley Tisdale), a poor girl who is a part-time prostitute who goes to work on the weekend.  The male she works for is a very abusive boss, who threatens to rape Tessa unless she does what he says.  He also talks about how much money he makes.  Tessa has a "fascination" with the Savage, and she gets excited about being alone with him.  They start talking about boys at school.  But soon the Savage is angry at her because she has been asking for too much money (which he claims is money "for you"), and she is in trouble!   When the girl is asked to pay the Savage back, he yells at her to go outside (she didn't have to do that.  Her "permission" didn't give him permission).  Tressie (Ashton Sanders), a pretty and wealthy school girl, comes to see Tessa.  I wasn't so sure about the girl's character when she started (she was very uptight about her looks).  But she is a good and kind woman, who gives Tessa the opportunity to "make him happy."  And she does!  The "S Savage" comes to love the attractive girl.  And, while he "loves" her, Tessa is still a prostitute who can't have children.  So when the Savage tells Tessa "I love you and I want to marry you," Tessa's "perverted" friend Tina (Amanda Peet) has to save her from her lover.  After he tells Tress to stop seeing Tina, the Savage finally gets his chance to marry Tessa!  Tessie and Tina decide to get married, and Tina, upset that she has to help her cousin get married instead of herself, tries to stop Tina.  Tina gets some help from a male companion named Chris (Matthew Perry).  As they get to their "honeymoon," the Savage's wife, Grace (Sarah Michelle Gellar), gets pregnant.  In
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film about a war and a man dying. This is an interesting story about a man who is dying and who is fighting a war. This movie is about a couple of people, one of which is a soldier, and their feelings about each other as they see each other go away before his time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a fun movie with a great story, but it is not a good movie.  The story is the most basic thing you can possibly get in an action movie with bad special effects.   It is the typical "man takes on many bad guys" movie which is really a great plot.  There is a really bad guy named B-14 and he is a big dumb bastard so he is not all that dangerous, and the rest of the guys are just as stupid as him.  But the guys who actually get hurt are some poor actors who are given terrible roles.  They are all so bad that I wonder how they were able to make the movie. Some of the best action scenes come at the end when the bad guys make a bad plan to get to the ship and shoot everyone on it and then they are all killed.  These guys look like they just came off a bad TV show and I wonder who was directing this movie. The story has lots of twists and turns but none of them are very interesting.  My favorite part of the movie is when the heroes get killed in the most ridiculous way, and then the bad guy shows up and decides to kill all the people on the ship instead of the bad characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was one of the worst movies I have seen in many years. I have never seen a movie that was so bad I found myself physically sick and I have always been a big John Wayne fan. This was a complete failure. Wayne is trying to bring in a woman who is not beautiful but not too ugly either. We are told that this is a happy ending to his story. Wayne meets his old girlfriend in a bar. She wants to run away and get married. But she wants to be with him. This is not happening in the least. I really hope he does make this movie again. I think I will watch the complete movie and then never watch any more movies from Wayne again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was pretty bad, it's not even like the original, no no no, this is basically like a kid watching a terrible movie. The acting is pretty terrible, so is the acting for the other parts. And the action scenes are terrible, this isn't even a martial arts movie so I don't understand what the point of it was. It feels like the producers wanted to give it a shot, but thought it was terrible and didn't really think it could be good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the more interesting movies we got last year was the Japanese movie  Shikabane Hime (Shikabanken). This was a little weird but the story was so good it made up for it.   It was about a family where a young girl has a weird power.  It made her be able to shapeshift into anything she wanted. It also gave the family all kinds of different animals.  In a way, the story made up a lot for the weirdness by putting the animals in a more realistic setting.  The director wanted the family to have a very traditional Japanese upbringing. There was still a hint of this at the beginning but the characters were the ones that made it interesting.  They went from the family having chickens, ducks, cats, dogs, and a dog that was actually a pig.  This was actually part of the show they put on on television.  I actually did not know this film existed until a friend mentioned that the movie was available online.  There were quite a few Japanese horror movies available online and some of them were pretty good.  One thing that bothered me was the constant use of the word shikabazen. I thought the word had been out of use by this point so it is surprising that they used it so often.    The most interesting part of this movie was the shikubazen, an actual Japanese game that was similar to the game Shrek.  Shikubane Hima was not very good, but the shirakazen was more or less a real game played with the same rules.  The only difference was that the goal of the shakazan was to be the first to get as many people onto the roof as possible without getting any injuries.  What surprised me most was how the family got the shishabazens. I am not sure if this was more the power of a child than the power the family had but they certainly used it well.  A shishabalazen playing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot seems to be that our hero, an American GI (I'm assuming he's a vet or something) takes his dog to France. This is one of the better Hollywood dog movies of the 70's. The French have one of those great love/hate relationships where you know they are really going to make things worse for their lovers because they can always be counted on to do something about it. And it seems that this French lady has been having a love affair with this American GI for quite some time. They end up in a bar and the two lovers make out in front of the bar. That's all they do for a while but this does not last for long as they are then in a train where they both have sex. In the next couple of scenes the French woman tries to get back with her man and it doesn't work so well. Then the French are going back to her old lover and the American is having sex with a girl in a café that looks like the one they got into in the train. The two lovers have sex again. A few more scenes in this area are then followed by a scene that I must admit I'm not so fond of. It's a scene between two French women and a young man. The scene is interesting because one of them is a very pretty woman who is very beautiful in a classy, elegant way. She does not like her lover and is extremely unhappy. The young man comes over to her and shows her a picture of his old girlfriend who was a big part of his life when he was young. The woman is furious at the idea of going back but the young man assures her that he won't go back. He says they would get back together if she really wanted him to go back and he says he'll just have sex with her now that he knows she isn't going to be with her old friend again. The poor woman is upset at this and is very upset that the young boy is not going to take the hint and go away. So she decides to go and talk to the old boyfriend she had when she was young and tell him that her lover is leaving her again. When she meets him she realizes what a disappointment he is. She says she really wants him to stay and she's going to see him again and maybe talk to him. The boy says he's just going to stay away and doesn't want to have sex and just goes over and shuts the door. The girl then decides that she has to go

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would have a problem with this film.   I was so surprised by this film because it was so bland it was a real "Let's do another dumb movie" movie, and I would never do something stupid again.  This movie does more to sell a crappy idea that it actually has.  I love when Hollywood tries to make something out of nothing.  For instance, this movie does not have a point to make.  It is just one huge, mindless, dumb movie.  My problem with it is that it seems to be a continuation of the first film. I think it was supposed to be one of the most exciting things to come out of Hollywood, and then this... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has an absolutely horrible title.  Why does he say "Wet Hot American Summer" when it's about swimming in a hot pool of America?  Maybe it's an old song he used to sing, but it doesn't work for this movie.    He says "We're all in a boat of the same colour, we're just so glad to be here in America!" I think this is the first movie I've seen where the people in the movie were white Americans.  I don't get how they would be able to have a hot, tropical country on a tropical beach, with no real tropical weather (at least on this day).   A couple of the characters had the same kind of American accents they use when they're having a good time.  The guy's name was Tom, he was a farmer, and he said "I'm glad you could join us."   I'm a huge fan of this movie, and I will definitely see it again!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A lot of people ask me if I liked that movie.   It's bad.  But it isn't bad like some bad horror movies.  The movie is really boring.  There is a girl who likes to play with dolls, and the guy who loves to play too.  He can't stop playing with dolls.  This is a problem because the kids love to play also, but it is impossible for the dolls to stay up that long, because the dolls are made from wood (not dolls).     I guess it is better than being bored with doll play. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit that when I saw this I knew it was going to be bad.  The first act is so weak.  What, are you trying to tell me you didn't like "The Legend of Zorro"?  I'm not going to lie, I didn't.  In a movie so full of silly lines and cliches, this scene really sticks out.    It's also a bad example of a character type.  One that I don't think would have fared much better in a more competent director.  The other thing that sticks out is the cheesy music,  which I'm sure they have had a little trouble getting the rights for.  "C'mon everybody, let's kick some ass!"   I've seen worse on this planet.  So bad, in fact, that when it was over my friends and I thought we had actually seen some good cinema.  Even worse, I couldn't get over the fact that this is the sort of crap they put in the summer blockbusters - this should be taken as the last film of the summer.  You can see a few other bad films in there for those interested.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The opening of this movie is the worst thing ever.  I am not exaggerating...  it is worse.    The movie starts off with a girl trying to find her boyfriend who she left at the airport.  There was a man with a sword chasing her around.  He wanted to make sure that she didn't leave him because she was leaving the city.  She was a princess.  So the movie is about a woman trying to get back to the palace.  I am not kidding...  The movie is so bad!   You have to pay for your ticket to the theater.  If you are not prepared to pay the money to get into the theater, then you will not enjoy the movie at all.  This movie is a rip off of the movie "The Princess Bride".   In this movie she is the Queen and she is getting back to where she belongs.  The princess does not look like a princess at all...  I'm not kidding!  The Princess Bride is based on the book by William Goldman and it is a movie that is not to be missed.  You can watch this movie on your own, but to be honest, I am sure there will be a ton of people in the theater trying to steal your girlfriend!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a fun little comedy with a very small budget and some pretty good performances. The story is very simple and the characters are all very likable and funny. The only thing which really kills the movie is the cheesy, but funny'music' during which the bad guys are singing their songs in this horrible, cheesy, French accent (with the exception of one bad guy who is very good at singing and he does it with a nice French accent. Which is a shame but the good guys all seem to do their own singing).  Overall a fun movie and a good laugh.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this was one of the worst movies that has come out in a long time.  It made me want to put on my big-girl panties and get out to the back yard.  It's about a housewife who thinks she's going to be able to raise two children with her husband.  The movie begins with a shot of a couple talking.    Then the next shot shows the couple in bed making love.  Now the husband is making the woman a cup of coffee.  Then she's making him a sandwich.  After a while the wife gets up and goes to the bathroom.  She has two young children and a husband who wants more of them.  I'm glad she wasn't a real housewife, as she would have taken care of these two children for years.  There was a lot of sex in this movie.  In the first scene a man gives the wife a blow job.  When the wife comes out she tells the men to stop.  They tell her that she looks good and they all start putting on make up.  We then see a woman having sex with a man.  One of the other women is sucking her husband's dick.  At the end of the movie the wife has two kids and the husband has one baby.  Why couldn't this be a regular family with regular married sex?  It would've been interesting to see the parents and the kids together.  My big-girly friend and I were both turned off by this movie and would not want to see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've heard that it will come out again. However, I haven't seen it lately, since the movie is so bad I'd rather spend that time in hell. It will take awhile, since they didn't release any pictures until last year, and the film was shot back in 1985. It's pretty bad. It has bad acting, and a bad soundtrack. It just goes on and on. It would be funny if it weren't so bad. I didn't like it as much as the last movie I saw it in, either. It really was worse.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is just a poor excuse for a movie, and you are only left to scratch your head at the fact that so many people wanted to see it. It is a film that seems like it was made by people who are bored or have no other ambition then to just make a film about people killing each other. It doesn't matter what the story is about, since the actors don't act like people who want to do anything other then stand around and wait for the next fight to start. The music is just annoying, and the dialogue seems forced and unnatural. All of the plot points are poorly developed and you don't really know who these people are who are fighting each other, and even if you do you don´t know why they are fighting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoy the first movie, it was very enjoyable. The movie was good fun and I really enjoyed it. I have to say though that this movie is the worst ever put out by Sony Pictures Studios. There was no story and no characters really. It was a bunch of jokes. And when the jokes were funny, they were funny. There were no real emotional or dramatic situations or anything. There would be lots of jokes and funny things which were just silly. It really just looked stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a shame they didn't make the movie the way it really should have been, with the kids playing a game of "Let's play a game" with a set of cards, only to be interrupted by a little black dog, and the dog says "Look, Mr. Johnson, if I had half a chance of making a fortune, I wouldn't need a dog, eh? If I had just two cents a day, I'd never be hungry again." This, of course, is very bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is well-known that Hollywood has been on a bit of a boom lately. If you believe that, then you shouldn't have been surprised. If your reaction to the film is to dismiss it immediately, then your mind is either seriously outdated or it was a terrible idea from the get go.  In a nutshell, The Green Inferno is the story of a man who has to fight his way through four deadly traps set around the desert, each set in an elaborate cave built by a very skilled caveman.  It was kind of a lazy concept, but you could see that director John Landis had seen something of this idea before.  A film like this has to be a good idea and this is a decent one, not a good one by any means.  There is some great stuff here.  Michael Gross' performance of a dashing, young movie star is absolutely priceless.  John Saxon is another strong voice in this film.  And the movie is made even better by the great music.  The Green Insurrection is only a mediocre movie, but its bad concept is so bad that it can't help but leave a mark. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only real thing I can say about this movie is that it is an ugly, ugly movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's bad, but you wouldn't know it. In a way it doesn't even feel like a bad film. The concept is bad, I mean literally bad. The movie makes zero sense, it has no real story, no stakes, no characters, no plot, no action.  It is so bad it is almost enjoyable.   If you are a fan of bad movie you will probably hate the film because it's so bad.  The story:  "A woman wakes up, with no memory. A strange man comes into her room.  He introduces himself to her, and says he's not your husband, but a friend from work.  She says he is creepy and wants to know who she works for.  Then a weird and dangerous scene starts.  Suddenly there is a fight going on between a man and a huge man.  One of the men, the big man, starts to kill his friend, the man. As the man is being killed the huge man grabs the woman and throws her in a big dumpster.  Now the woman has no memory of how she got there.  With no memory, she's pretty useless. But, the only clue she has is an image of a big man. The woman soon finds out that what the strange man wanted her to forget about was actually something really big."    The movie tries to make you think, and is entertaining at times.  But it's really bad, really really bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a good movie: fun, fast and funny, but it is a movie about a crazy and unpredictable and crazy person - yes, I know that it looks like the "B" in The "B""s "B", and I know it seems strange to say that it is not a movie but a cartoon: but it really is like that.  A very good and funny movie, about a very good young man who is crazy and is just doing his things: driving a van in the middle of the highway, drinking beer out of a can, smoking a cigar and shouting to everybody, "Yeehaw!" But also - there is a lot of fun with this movie: this is a true story about two guys who come to this town at the end of their tour around the world: and the people who surround them are funny and crazy. And a lot does happen in this little city: like the young prostitute who starts to live with the guys, or the young man named Zoltan, who seems to be going down a little path of his own in which he starts to drink too much, but still likes the attention of girls: and this is what makes this "cartoon" interesting and fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie that could have been a masterpiece, but unfortunately it's a bit of a mess.   A film that could be a cinematic revelation with its combination of an epic story, a cast of fascinating characters, and a soundtrack of epic songs.  The film has a brilliant set of performances, including a brilliant performance by Liam Neeson as the anti-hero.  For its first half, this is a wonderful film and would likely be in everyone's top ten films.  But as the film goes on, the plot becomes a little too convoluted and the performances, while wonderful, don't seem to match up to the amazing moments throughout the film.  One of the reasons this film isn't as great as it could be, is because it's just too long.  There are a couple of really beautiful sequences in this film and it would have been fantastic to see more of those but it would almost be a crime to not give it a high 4/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was disappointed with this movie, I thought it would be more like a horror film. It had a lot of cheap jump scare scenes with blood, guts, a dead lady and a giant, which is really all that needs to be said. It is a pretty bad film which is about a couple that move into a new house and find a room full of old, rotting things. The movie then jumps to the present day, where the two are having a party at the new house. At first, they enjoy themselves, dancing, drinking, playing games and drinking a lot. They don't really want a house full of weird, creepy things in their old house anymore though, so the movie moves to the other room where the old things stay. A lot of the movies footage is from these old things in the other rooms as the two go through the house and do lots of cool stuff. As the two sit down to eat dinner they notice that the new things are becoming increasingly weird to them, such as the bed on wheels, a pool with floating heads, and a huge stuffed animal that has an iron claw on it. The two decide that they would like to have their new house back, and they decide to bring along a friend to help them with it. So the three go through an old house, which was really creepy and just a lot to take in. They try to get rid of the things and get rid from the house, but then a lot more weird stuff appears. The three of them run outside and see a very, very big animal that is moving on the ground and trying to destroy them. The film then jumps over to a weird place where all these horrible things are going on. In the film, they are having fun and eating cake, but things are starting to get crazy around them. In a scene where a lot is going on a lot and a lot goes wrong, one of the little girl's parents runs outside and starts to go into one of these room things. He comes out and sees a room with blood everywhere, guts flying everywhere and a bunch of screaming children inside. The girl's dad looks at it and runs away, terrified. The little girl then runs after him screaming and the girl's mom then runs out of the room and runs around with all sorts of horror stories about the room. The kid's mom runs out as well and starts getting into the room as well. Eventually, all these things come together and the little family gets killed,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    We are back at the apartment and I've brought some stuff to clean up and prepare for tonight's party. It's a party and it's hot and my husband and I are getting more and more desperate. I've been watching all of those movies where people get too naked and have all kinds of crazy sex. So far it's going okay. The only thing that keeps getting us nervous is that we're not sure where the money is coming from. We're not rich but we're getting a little better. It seems like they have a budget for a party but then we don't get a good one.   I'm thinking to myself now, we're on our third drink and already I'm starting to get sick of this. A few things that keep getting us excited is that there's a little dance party coming up at the same time. I'm so desperate I start thinking about the perfect dress that my husband can't wait to see me in. I decide to go and find something. I try on my best little skirt and a pair of low cut panties that show my breasts. I look at my husband standing over me and he doesn't seem impressed at all. I have no idea why I'm getting so horny and I can feel my nipples getting harder.   for a second I think that maybe I should get dressed too. I walk over to the dress shop and see some nice dresses on the rack. Maybe my husband is going to be impressed with my body. My heart is pounding and I feel like something is going wrong. I start to pull out my phone and as soon as I put my finger against my lips a voice rings out from across the room.   the voice is deep and booming. It sounds like some sexy woman and I'm not sure what to make of it.  ,I try to say something but I have my hands down my pants and I just can't say it. I hear it again and this time it's even more sexy. Maybe it's a different voice and it doesn't sound like a sexy woman. I know it's my husband talking to me but he sounds different. I turn over and he's got his arms around my waist and he is kissing me. I feel my mouth watering and my nipples are hard. I can't take my eyes off of his lips, the way his tongue darts across my nipple and the way he touches the top of my breast. There's something about the way my husband's lips kiss

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The cast were great, and the movie didn't do anything wrong; and the soundtrack is good.  So here's a movie about a girl who wants to become a writer but can't get a word published in high school. She takes the job and a bunch of guys come along to make sure she gets it. The best part is that she doesn't seem to have the right stuff for the job--it's all amateur stuff. So what happens next is a combination of the typical high school stuff (not much writing except in the English class) with some real twists (that's always the best part).  For a movie that was made in 1967, there's no doubt about it being a classic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wasn't expecting this movie to go anywhere; after all, I am an American and so is this movie's director - one of the few people I will ever see who knows exactly what he is doing.  But it still took me by surprise the first time I watched this movie.    When I heard that the movie was going to be filmed in the same setting as my favorite TV sitcom, I was really looking forward to a good time with my friends.  I thought that the film might at least go somewhere, to make it interesting.  That was what I was hoping for.  The film opened with two little kids sitting on a swing with a toy car.    The car is getting bigger all the time.  One little boy in the movie is named "Dirty Dudley" and he is about ten years old.  They are all sitting on the swing with their eyes closed.  And they're really enjoying their time with the car.   Then, a little man in a suit comes along to say that they're playing a bad game.  But then the car takes off!  And then it crashes and they all get hurt.  It turns out that it is a race car that Dudley's sister is driving.  This kid looks like he's about five.  Then he starts saying that it all depends on what you do when you get hurt!   But the car keeps going!  It hits a pole, which flips it over, so he starts falling on the ground.  There is some fun happening here.  A kid in a car crash is sitting on his swing... with a car!  Then you see that a truck has crashed into the house next door.  No big deal; the kids just go in and play with their cars and then go to sleep.  If the movie had been a bit less ridiculous, I might have felt some sadness, but it was fun all the way through.  What bothered me was that the cars kept driving off.  When they hit a hill, they drive off the hill without stopping to get the brakes fixed!  When a tree falls on the car, they keep going and then they crash into a tree.  These kids are so immature!  They don't understand that the consequences of their actions have consequences.  In addition to all of this, they're talking about something called "Sagittarianism," which seems to have been invented by some Hollywood producer

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no doubt about it...this movie is bad. It is boring, it is forgettable, and it is very poorly directed. Not for a bad film this is...for a bad American movie! If you do not know what a badger is, then please do some research and watch this movie (watch it twice). In my opinion this movie should be a cautionary tale about the dangers of not being able to take a break from the rat race. (review ends)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw The Dictator a couple years back. It was crap. I found the movie to be a disgrace, but the movie was terrible anyway. The only thing they did right was the cinematography (which I'm surprised there weren't any bad films in the early 80's with that kind of cinematography) and the effects. The movie has two sets of characters: an anti-hero (played by a guy with a British accent) and a dictator (played with a French accent). The dictator has no character other than just being the dictator. I don't think there were any interesting situations that were set up or any character development. I just didn't find any redeeming factors about the film. I never understood why the Americans and the French were fighting over the country in the 70's. It's just ridiculous.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You have a couple of actors who seem to be in no hurry to leave the theatre. So when they have to sit down to write a script... I was prepared to like this one. I was wrong. The characters, their interactions, their relationships are so shallow and silly it feels as if some people just got out of jail and are having their picture taken on the side of the highway... They are funny because it is obvious they are not writing a screenplay. In one of my favorite scenes I could just hear them say their lines. The lines are so clichéd that I was laughing out loud. I know that you can find many people who have laughed their way to the bank, but it didn't take me more than a few seconds to realize I was not going to make it very far in this one either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The thing about the "Lion King" trilogy is that it's really all one movie. It's like a cartoon; it's one big cartoon. The only thing it's not is a cartoon is that they still tried to tell a story. However, while a decent attempt, they went way over the top with it.   There are few things more ridiculous than a lion king, except of course being a man who wants to become a lion. And of course the only way he can do so is through a bizarre love triangle with a princess and a beautiful lion.  I don't like this one that much
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is absolutely terrible. I can't think of a worse movie from the last ten years or so. This is not really a bad film, but in that time it would have been better if it was more like a comedy, that's all I can say. I don't mind this as a comedy since there are a lot of comedy films from the 1970s. I also don't think that you get a good laugh from this. The humor is forced. You have to laugh in a funny movie in the 1970's. This movie has no humor.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To begin, the film is a poor remake.  The plot is based off a song of the same name by the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughan.  This movie's plot consists of a very cheesy story about a girl, Mia, who is being stalked by a man in a gorilla suit.  Mia's boyfriend, Alex, has a friend named Ben who is always in trouble with the law.  Ben's cousin, Chris, is very smart.  His sister, Cindy is very nice and innocent and does not know about Ben's past.  Chris and Cindy go to live with Alex.  I will give it to Chris and his sister.  For the first 20 minutes Chris doesn't do anything except stand around with Cindy.  After the first half of the film, Cindy's personality changes drastically.  While Cindy is still very innocent and innocent, she doesn't say anything.  Alex is very good at his job and does a good job at keeping the family nice and nice.  Despite his love for Cindy, Chris is more than willing to get a job in a factory.  Then the movie goes off the rails.  There is a scene where a character says that the guy is about 5 feet 7 inches tall and is bald.  It is then that the story becomes ridiculous.   This is an action film.  And the action is terrible.  Instead of a character trying to use a fire extinguisher to put out a fire, she uses the fire extinguizer on the man.  If this movie was made today, they would have to make the guy a ninja or something because the whole film would make no sense.  You really don't have to look too far for action that's as good as this.  Why did they do this?  If I told you how badly the film was made, I'd have to kill you.  They should have just called it The Man in the Gorilla Suit, and they would not be sorry.  When someone asks me about this film, I usually say it is pretty good and that you have to go to YouTube to see it.  Sadly, this film is available on Netflix.  Not only is this film bad, but it is a rip off from a movie that was made 15 years ago!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a bad film from the beginning. It is slow and boring and boring. There is absolutely no plot. There are no great fight scenes. There even isn't any cool music to match the boring dialogue. The only reason this film works is because a very large audience of people like this film because it is a parody of a lot of different movies. Most of the people in this movie are from other bad movies or are from the same movie or one of the others. The people who make this film don't even understand that a parody is a joke. The first 15 minutes are the best 15 minutes of anything I've seen in a long time. If you have to watch something that long then you either need to see something new or something that is really really badly made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the second worst film I've seen in a while. The first worst was "The World's Greatest Dad" which was pretty bad, but not as bad as this. A lot of people will like this because it looks like it has a story, and it does. Unfortunately, most of that story is a lot of "What if's" from a lot more talented writers in the 1970's. Most of the characters are based on other people in movies and books. There is a story that goes something like this: a scientist sees a light in the sky. The scientist goes and sees the light and thinks the light could come from outer space. At first the scientist is suspicious because the sky is always cloudy, but the scientist goes outside and see the light. The scientists thinks the cloud could be due to something but the scientists realizes they are wrong because it was not the normal cloud. The cloud turns out to be a huge black cloud with a light on top. The black cloud turns into a tiny red light, and the light turns into an evil being with a voice that tells the people of Earth to worship and bow down before the evil being. The evil being also tells everyone that the people must kill all the animals to stop the light from coming back. The people of earth have to do this but it is not easy because they cannot do it quickly, and this causes a lot suffering among the people. The film does a poor job of presenting this story because it takes about fifteen minutes and the story is not even really worth remembering. There are also many other "What-If" type stories like the bad sci-fi movie "The Dark Crystal" that are pretty bad and the worst part about them is that this film is not better than the other two. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought that the movie was going to have the ending you would expect from a Spielberg movie, but it was just a very bad Spielberg movie. I have not seen it yet. But I have seen other Spielberg movies. There are lots of problems. Spielberg doesn't know how to direct. He is just bad with the dialogue and the plot and he has a very wooden acting style. I would not like to see any film he makes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It seems to me that the author of this book is more interested in playing with language than actually writing a decent book. She begins by explaining that there is a man from the future called "The Dreamer", who has been able to see the future and tell when it will occur. So how was he able to do this and why is he so important? Well there's a lot to the story. The author explains that the future of the world seems to be moving to a less violent world, where there is less violence. She also says that the world of the future is one where the dreamer's dream is achieved when the human race goes back to its primal roots. This is all very interesting so far. However, what really interests me in this book are the references to the book The Terminator. There are at least two references in the first chapter: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had never seen a movie with a lead actor who is completely without self respect and in fact appears to be a sadomasochist.   What an insult to women everywhere.  I could not understand why the lead actor didn't simply kill his wife and take his little girl with him.  But then, one would think that being a homosexual would give him a reason to kill his own wife.  Then the movie just gets bad.  It seems like the movie wants to be edgy, and I don't think it is edgy at all.  Instead, it is just a sad, degrading, degrading movie that seems to be about a man who kills his own partner.  There is no character development, nor does any one character get a chance to talk.  The acting seems to have taken a long time off.  While the acting may not be the worst, it doesn't even compare with those terrible movies starring the likes of George Clooney.  This movie doesn't deserve the $10 that it cost to make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad, that all I can say is, that the studio should sue for a "reasonable" sum, because this film is the worst I have ever seen!  It is a story of a couple who try to help a friend who has lost her parents and her brother in a plane crash. The only problem is that the story is completely absurd.  The actors are all completely miscast, and all of the dialog is either "silly" or "ridiculous."  The film has several cheesy jump scares that seem more like a prank than anything else.  For example, we see a man with no legs standing on a table, and this is the only way the actor ever gets to be seen.  But these jump scares are a huge part of the movie, as every single one of them is one of the funniest scenes I have seen in any film.  After watching this film, I felt almost as if I had just walked off a cliff, with my legs dangling to the side!  I think I would rather be stuck on that cliff at 3 in the morning than see another movie like this again.  I am sure that if I saw this movie for a dollar, I would be able to laugh my head off.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am going to be frank. I am a very boring person. I love to watch things like Mad Max Fury Road. This movie was like the opening of Fury Road with a twist. I'm thinking it was done with the same money as Fury Road so they must have a lot of money to waste. If you're tired of seeing the same old action flick this is probably the worst one to watch. I've seen most of the action movies out there so I know what to expect and I wasn't happy with the way the characters acted. I would have to take a nap after watching it though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is about a man who is looking for a girlfriend but can't find one. He has gone through a series of failures and finally has nothing left but a little money to buy a used car. It's a small one, but it's a car that will get him back to a place of his own accord. After a night out, he goes home to get some sleep and dreams of a beautiful blonde. That is until she is suddenly murdered. When his brother returns home, he is so upset that he starts to attack her and almost kills her. After killing the brothers, he then turns to the next girl to show her the beauty of a nice little blonde girl. They all love this girl and even a beautiful sunset and a nice picnic will not make them abandon her. So they drive all the way home and leave the girls to go to the park to relax. After arriving there, the two girls discover that the boys are gone. What follows is not pretty and very sad. Written by Anonymous
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to say I think this movie sucks. This is a low-budget, poorly-written and poorly-directed film that is as bad as it is funny.   This movie really shouldn't have been made in the first place.  What really sucked about this movie was that the director was apparently inspired to do this by watching the movie "Mushroom Men". I know, right?   So the story is about an aspiring actor who is so desperate to get into show business that he spends most of his time driving around trying to get a part in movies.  His main method of getting into these shows is by getting drunk.  But when he gets drunk he ends up driving his car into the wall of a theater and ends up with his car and some theater audience members in a pile of broken glass and some blood.  The rest of the movie is some kind of comedy routine about how funny the actor is by driving his big car into buildings then breaking it into a bunch of pieces.  I've seen people say that this movie is "charming" or "magnificent" but these words are not exactly apt. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For anyone who has ever been in any sort of a movie, this one was just a horrible movie, bad acting, bad plot, bad dialogue, bad camera work and worst of all, terrible plot.   The character that plays the lead was a really bad actress, but that should have been expected because she was playing a bad character.  She was an evil villain who had no redeeming value to anyone, and she was played by a woman who made it clear she was just going through the motions.  So what was the point?  Well there were a few bad ideas in the movie but the whole movie would have been a very bad movie to watch if it had not been for the fact that there was a real audience in the theatre.  Well the most important part of the movie was the plot which was really lame.  You would think the writers of this movie would know how to keep their plots interesting and entertaining.  This movie had a total lack of direction in every aspect of it.  I mean, the movie starts with a guy who doesn't know his way around the jungle, who gets into a fight with the evil jungle god and then goes into the forest with a young girl, who is the daughter of the evil god, and a couple of men who turn out to be his minions (but I guess you couldn't tell from the acting)  Well what do you think the first act of the plot should have looked like?  This was the last decent acting I saw, that I can remember.  They are all playing evil characters.  If you wanted an interesting plot you would have had to watch the first half of the show.  How could they put a whole movie together with these characters?  When was the first good thing going to happen?  The most depressing thing about this movie is that I have found a few movies since this where the plot was better.  The last good plot point the movie has is the fact the character that leads the jungle warriors is an ugly guy.  It was funny at the time but it just doesn't work any more, it seems like someone went and asked to have their plot turned into a comic book by the director.  As I said earlier the entire movie was just terrible, and the plot itself was just bad.  I can only remember the parts I liked: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie from a director who knows how to make a killer movie.  It's called "The Evil Dead" and it looks like something straight out of the 80's and it's a treat to watch.  A group of kids find a book which tells about the demon dead and they go into the woods to look at it.  They find a big box covered in bones and they think it's their dad's dead but then they realize they're in a movie. Well, it's not really a movie; it's all really just a big, fun horror movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I don't want to believe in god."   This is a typical movie about a man who is told that he is to be married to a beautiful young woman.   The bride is told she is to have a party, with a piano, a bunch of young girls and a priest, and that there is to also be a "bizarre" "vision" given by one of the young girls, but the bride doesn't get to witness any of these events.    Instead, she meets a bunch   of   men who all want her to drink, have sex and have intercourse with them in various strange places.  This part of the movie is just a few minutes long.  It has a few strange but funny scenes, and the ending   was pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only positive thing to come from the release of John Wick: Chapter 2, which opens on the same day as the first film is: it's fucking great! I loved John Wick, and the sequel is just as good.   We see what happens to John Wick's father when he's murdered by the guy who killed John Wick in the first movie. I don't know. But he comes back in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an absolutely dreadful movie.  It starts with a very nice song and the cast seems perfectly matched.  I loved the little girl in the dress and the little man who has a gun (although I think he's a clown).  But by the end of the film, I couldn't see one of them.  A bad film that has no redeeming qualities, but for a cheap comedy, it's actually quite funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a sad fact that Hollywood's greatest stars in any genre are often awful at playing romantic leads. I found this to be true with all three of these films, the actors' talent can't disguise a lack of direction or a proper focus on a well written story. I suppose if it was not such a terrible film (it isn't) its actors could be forgiven. A sad, sad, story, about a woman who moves to New York for a job. She doesn't fit into this new world and quickly starts getting into trouble. It is sad that anyone could think that such a good movie is worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of this film was very entertaining. I loved it!   The second half, not so much.   I felt the movie was running out of things to do with its plot lines and characters.  The ending was rushed and rushed to a terrible extent, with very little story that I did not care for at all.  I think this film might have been better off as a series of small indie shorts instead of an expensive feature. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really just a bad remake of the classic classic.  The movie is about a police officer and his wife who have a son who is about to become a police chief. There is no love story here. They all hate each other. There's lots of good jokes and a few decent scenes. It's really not too bad of a movie but the plot is horrible. There are no funny lines here. There isn't even a bad joke. The movie isn't bad enough to get a decent rating. It has an 80% negative rating with a 4 out of 10 rating.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What are you doing, getting out of bed in the morning?  Are you still awake?  is that why you have been up so late this morning?   This movie makes me wish I were the king of the jungle!  What's wrong? Is there a shark in the pool? Did you get in some trouble for taking off in the rain? Were you bitten by a shark? You can't swim can you? No? It's because your daddy shot a deer and it ate him.   If I could eat any movie I'd pick this one. The soundtrack is catchy, the action is exciting, and the characters are awesome. And I just love it when people get into a water fight.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well let me start off by saying   That I wouldnt have expected this kind of a movie to be made. I mean   It has a pretty decent plot and it starts off with a very cool idea.    And then comes the bad part...  The characters are awful!   They are just bland and one dimensional, it's all pretty boring and nothing really happens.    Well it didn't help that the film was shot like a video game and that when they say "action",   it sounds like they just threw in an attack or a big explosion or something.  I found it quite funny when I was watching the whole thing but   I thought the whole point behind it was kinda strange.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film, based on the book by George H. Buck, is pretty much a rip off of the 1960 classic "Star Wars."   The first half is more action packed, and the rest is about some people that want to live a peaceful existence.   George Bucky  Buck was born on May 23, 1898 in New York City.  He studied at the New York School of Dramatic Art.  When George Buck started playing a part he was not a very good one, but he got better as he got older.  His first starring role was in the Broadway play "The Omen", and followed that with some film work.  Then in 1929 he made his screen debut in "The Adventures of Peter Pan".   "The Star Wars"   is based on George Buck's novel "Star Wars: The First Beverage.  An old man (who may or may not be the same actor played by Christopher Lee)   who doesn't like the modern day  society finds a magical drink that makes him forget everything that has ever happened to him.  With the help of his dog (who is also named Peter Pan) the young man and his friends try to travel through the cosmos and become like Peter Pan.  "Star" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is actually quite bad; and really it isn't. But the film is so badly done, so devoid of even the most basic talent and such a bad story, that it really is difficult to take anyone seriously who believes the poor efforts put forth in this film deserve any attention whatsoever.  This is a poor film that deserves poor ratings. The film follows a young boy named Charlie (Jack Gleeson), who, in order to pay the way for his little brother to have a surgery to relieve pain and disability, borrows a large amount of money from his grandfather. During the night while waiting in the clinic to meet his brother at the operating room, Charlie's mother (Cara Delevingne) passes away. When Charlie's grandfather (John Candy) finds out, he immediately goes to the hospital where Charlie is operated on. A few days later, after Charlie has come back from surgery, his grandfather discovers his son has made a mess, and he is promptly fired from his job. Charlie then turns to robbing stores and hospitals for a living. As his job goes south, Charlie also becomes addicted to pills and gets into a battle with a drug called "Chinloko," or "the little pill," that can make you lose weight. Charlie and his girlfriend, Elizabeth (Riley Keough), work at a convenience store. During one of their breaks, a woman is kidnapped, but not before she has given Charlie a new hat that he will wear out all night long. However, the woman he gives his hat to has a very strange feeling, and she tells Charlie to forget about it. That night, Charlie is looking for his hat, when he suddenly has the worst nightmare; a young man comes into the store and threatens him, telling him that if Charlie doesn't give him the hat, he will kill him. Charlie doesn`t want to die, so he runs out of the store. But his hat is gone. In the morning, Charlie starts to get headaches. He sees that the pills that he uses to soothe his headaches are causing him some permanent damage. Charlie decides to visit the hospital to seek treatment, but the hospital is so overcrowded that there are no beds, and no one is there to tell him where to go. Charlie is not going to be rescued, so what is he to do? He decides to try a new way to help himself; stealing drugs. Written by Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like the idea of this movie. The two leads are decent but their interactions are cliched and boring. They look like they're having a lot of fun in their underwear and the sex is hot and wet. In short, the sex isn't very creative and the storyline is rather dull. I can't imagine why it made it past the censors but it did so in the US and many other countries. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you only wanted a really good action movie this was definitely it.  The story is really well thought out and executed.  And the action is well choreographed and well executed.   This movie can go down as one of the best action movies ever made, because of how well it has been choreographed.  A movie like this really needs to be seen and heard, because it was one of those movies that have you wondering how on earth could this have worked as well as it did.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a bad sequel to The Rocketeer, which was a good movie in its own right. The only thing I can compare it to is the 1987 version of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace - which by the way was a mediocre movie as well.   It's all pretty lame, so much so that it almost makes me wonder if there's a sequel in the works. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Is it a real film, or is it a rehash of some bad film noir that's been around for the past few decades?  I'm not kidding - it is a really stupid film. If you are looking for some great suspense, go watch the movie based on the movie The Man With The Golden Gun, and if you want some great, creepy, noir-ish stories, watch the television series based on The Shining.   And if you like bad movies where people are killed off by giant, claw-like spiders and run around in black suits, then go watch The Thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not as if I haven't seen a bad film before. I don't think I've seen the original The Room, the "best" film, since the '70s. And I'm also not too sure what all the hoopla is about. Well, the film's over by the time you've finished it. You've seen all you need. There aren't any twists, turns or surprises. The same old stuff from previous entries. The only thing to say about The Room is that it has always been better. And it'll continue to be better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just so bad. I am a big fan of Star Trek, and this movie does not have a lot of good things about it, at all. It really is an absolute piece of shit and would be terrible to watch.   I guess I would say this movie is about an alien invasion at the start. They are supposed to be the good guys and all is right in the world. You would think that in the Star Trek universe this could be done in an interesting way, but here it just gets worse. The special effects are bad and it is so bad that it is almost funny. It is also not really a good movie. If you really want to get into the movie then watch it on Youtube. It takes maybe 30 seconds to see that this movie has terrible special effects and horrible acting.   to get started on the plot, it is really quite simple. All the aliens (I guess they are from another planet) are trying to get past an alien barrier. Then the barrier is destroyed and the aliens come out in the middle of the city. They make the humans dance and make humans dance really bad. Well there is this human and he starts dancing with a woman. Then all of the aliens show up and they all go on a rampage and start destroying the city and everything. This is probably the bad part of the movie. It has bad special effects, horrible acting, and the ending is so stupid and stupid that it makes me question why the movie even exists. I really just can't believe anyone saw this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is not exactly a bad film. The acting is very well done, the film is funny, there are some good effects, and the music is good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A boring, dull movie, without the entertaining action scenes and witty dialogues which we are used to.   I would have preferred a more interesting story to be told, with more action, less "drama" and some humour.  I give this a 3 out of 5 stars because this would be a decent movie if it was a bit different and more interesting than most movies in this genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is only one bad movie in The Big Lebowski: the movie. Lebkowsky himself is so funny and has the perfect combination of charisma and bad timing. Everyone else in the movie seems completely incompetent. I don't even think they tried very hard in this movie. There's a lot of dancing and acting, but nothing comes to life and nothing is funny. If you are looking for a great movie with a little bit of attitude and comedy, you might find a good one with this one, but if you want to see a comedy with a lot more than one little part, you'll be bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best film about a very bad movie ever made, starring a young and talented Tom Hanks as a very talented young man trying to get his life back together, and doing his best to do it. A film of a great, interesting, flawed character, and some great performances by all involved. The only bad thing about it is that it is over too soon, but I'll always remember the great performances, and the wonderful set design, and most especially the great song that plays throughout the film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a low budget, cheesy, silly horror movie with a ridiculous plot, bad acting, bad special effects, and a horrible movie ending. The plot is silly, and I know a lot of people don't like it because of that, but in the case of this film, I don't. If you like cheap and low-budget horror and cheap gags and cheap special effects you will enjoy this film. Just don't go in expecting to find a serious movie in here.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie I had thought I was going to like but ended up with disappointment. I'm not one who likes to watch a bad flick but I was expecting this one to be a different kind of movie. Not at all. It is a film made by a director who has no clue about comedy. This movie is really the same old thing. It's a lot of people yelling, it's a little boy who cries and cries. It takes a few attempts to get into the story and once you get the plot, all that remains are these horrible faces on people. A lot of the laughs come when a little girl is being scared by her parents and she tells the mom that she's going out with her friend but the mother won't believe it. The father doesn't believe the girl but the boy will. Then, the father will start screaming at the other parents in the neighborhood. Then it's time for the mother to leave and they all start screaming too. After this awful scene, there's a bunch of other things that I'll be too embarrassed to mention. I thought it was only one movie. I ended up watching this film for the fourth time. The third time was because I thought I would be surprised by how bad this one was. The second time was to find out the whole story line was nothing more than a joke. I was very wrong and I'm sure I've been made fun of by more than one person. If you like this sort of thing, then this is a good place to spend a few minutes. The only good thing about this is that I know that I could be disappointed and that it wouldn't be as bad if it wasn't for those silly faces and bad acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went and watched this on video yesterday, at work. I wasn't expecting much after watching so much crap, but this movie, even though it's a "slapstick" (so to speak), was actually pretty good. There wasn't a moment where I thought it was over. And yet, it ended after about an hour, which is not too bad given the amount of comedy the movie has. I'd recommend it for anybody that enjoys a good bit of goofy comedy. You might find a little too much at your doorstep.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not sure how I feel about this movie: It's bad, but it's so so so bad that I'm sure if it were directed by Clint Eastwood the entire film could've been cut and put in a VHS and released.  One of the reasons why I like this movie is because it's a great homage to the 1980's.  I think they should stick to classic film noir and not try to make this into something it isn't.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot of the movie is that a guy from Texas who went down to Mexico to get rich (he was a cowboy) was shot by a Mexican gang when they found him stealing (he actually stole one horse). However he has a gun he keeps in the woods, and then it falls into some water! Well that's the basic premise! The movie then follows some bad dudes as they try to get back their money! The bad guys include "El Diablo" and "El Gato". El Diablo is a Mexican drug smuggler who wants to go to the United States in order to be able to make a big score, but he is really only after the horse! After El Diablo and "Gato" manage to get their hands on the horse they drive it all over the United State to try to make some money. They end up in Texas, where some bad guy "Duck" attacks El Diablo to get the horse for his own. At this point the whole movie gets really boring, but it also gets pretty violent! It is really boring to watch, but at one point there is a pretty funny scene of the bad guys getting shot at by a gun that is a giant robot that has been built for that purpose! It does get kind of dark at this point, but there is not really a "happy ending"!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is another low budget, uninspiring Hollywood horror that's more a generic thriller than anything else. The film takes place in an old castle. I'm not sure why in the world this had to take place in such an old place or a castle. Even with all the rust and decay this place isn't too bad. I suppose if you want to scare yourself silly, this is a good place. If you don't mind the rust, the ruins, or the old people, I can't say I would find the film very scary.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The title of this film says it all...a "Moby-Dick" is a "Mongolian" (although the Mongols are only loosely based upon the people of Mongolia)  This film is just a rehash of those horrible 'Gigli' pictures from the late 1950's and early 1960's - not very good in fact.   I could watch this film over and over again!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's been three years since I last saw the new Twilight film, a lot has changed since it was made. I was a big fan back in the day of Twilight as well, so it's a little disappointing that this film doesn't live up to the hype, but then it does. The cast is still as great as ever, the writing is still so good (except for the occasional stupid scene that is just the director and his screenwriter going through the motions) and the story is still the same. But it doesn't seem like they have learned a lot from the last film. There are too many stupid scenes and the acting is not as good as it was. The cinematography is the same as it has been for ages now; I don't think it is ever going to change. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie about a woman who has one of the worst relationships I have ever seen, but then a few decades later, the husband, or "father figure" to the two of them goes in search of her. The ending could have been so much worse if not for the amazing acting by the leads, as well as the beautiful direction by John Guillermin and the beautiful cinematography by Mike Leigh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just awful. The main character, a girl who is always seen without shoes on, runs around barefoot on a hot summer day. Why? Because she needs them to dry and keep herself from chafing. She does not seem to mind the water she's standing in, and is happy to get it on her feet. It is not the end of the world. At least her feet are dry and she's not sweaty... at least. It takes her a few minutes of walking to get hot enough to go to the bathroom again. A lot of other people in the movie wear flip-flops, but they still keep it dry. A woman wearing flip-frocks also does not keep her feet warm at all. Even a few seconds of swimming in the river is too much for her feet to handle. When we eventually see her feet, they're covered in water and she is sweating profusely. One of the men in the beach can't even stand to look at her feet anymore. She walks around bare feet for a good twenty minutes, then runs back to the hotel in the middle of the day. I have a hard time understanding how she gets out of it alive.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't even attempt to explain the mechanics or what exactly is happening, but rather just jumps back in time and just takes you on a merry, wacky ride.   If a bunch of strangers got together to do a stupid stunt, then they're still stupid enough to get paid for doing it.  The plot itself is also fairly pointless.  I guess they wanted to do some sort of "Groucho Marx"-style musical, but that never materialized.  Why else would they try to make a black cowboy a cowboy?    It's just plain silly to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this before, with this cast, and it had little to do with the original 'The Shining.' It was very bad. I saw it, I didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie does not even work as a film, it is a cheap horror movie about a guy who is locked up in a dark cell with no light in the entire universe, and he starts thinking that the cell is actually a window that's been damaged, so then he escapes and comes across the girl in the prison who is also trapped in this dark room.   They are not really together at all in this movie, and it's almost painful watching how she just stares and blinks at him and looks so sad and lonely.  It really does not work as an adult horror movie because everything is very simple and very predictable, there are only two creepy looking monsters and a woman who is trapped in a terrible prison that's just like it sounds, so it's not that interesting.  There are some weird things in the movie, like the guy that is in the dark cell actually looks like he's asleep because he's covered in blood, and there is a girl named Toni in the cell who is very sad and seems very lonely, but she seems happy when she thinks that she has found the man who is in her room. It's just a silly, terrible movie and very terrible acting and writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A truly horrible movie and one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.   It is like having a live monkey in your room and seeing him chittering around and then realizing he is a huge monkey and a little girl sitting nearby!   Well the worst part is the plot.  It just goes on and on and doesn't make any sense at all.  The "bad guy" is the government (that just wants to kill all the terrorists) and he gets killed at the same time that this man shows up.  Oh no wait, it's not the government! It's the evil Russians who want to blow up the entire population of America.  There really isn't much else to say about the movie other than "don't let your children watch this".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie from hell. What is it like to be raped by a goat?   The movie, which was supposed to be a comedy, is about a poor innocent man who lives with his wife. But, because he has no money he is forced to get a job, which is to clean toilets of the local zoo. After a while he starts to think of a way out of this life of servitude. He comes up with a plan for his wife and himself. He will find a beautiful female animal, that will be his wife for life, but that he will not marry. He must use all his cunning and strength to get rid of her, because if he does this her mother will be so angry that she will kill him with a stone. But he has never seen a female goat. He thinks that maybe he will be able to get one by killing an adult female goat, but he is wrong again. The goat has a very big penis. The guy is trapped.   I am not going to say any more about this film because it is an utter horror.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director's intention was to make a funny movie, which would be more funny if the characters weren't so self-obsessed.    I watched the movie on a Saturday afternoon at the video store where I worked and the clerk was having to do a ton of work, so I decided to check out an upcoming B-Grade movie, like those that I found in the video stores at the time.  I couldn't believe how many times this movie could have been made.  It was really sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If I had a dime for every bad movie that I have seen, I would probably have a nice life.   In a movie full of bad jokes, I found one that worked:  The "Rabbits from Mars" movie is based on a true story.  The real Mars rabbits came to the United States in the early 1900's and took up residence in Colorado.  To make a long story short, their numbers grew to over a million, and they had their own little colony in a nearby canyon.  It was there that the movie was set.  A scientist, who had been on his way to work at a place called "Nursery Square," was supposed to be the first person in a million to step onto the Mars rovers.  Instead he was picked up by a group of rabbits in a motor home and taken to the colony.    In the movie, a scientist, played by Johnny Depp, makes his way down to the rover.  This is not an original story, so much as a variation of something that had happened a thousand times.  But this time it is not the bad scientist who gets caught, but the good scientist.  At some point, Johnny Depps is not a good scientist, because he does a really bad thing: He decides to do the science experiment he has been thinking about: He takes the rover and takes it into the canyon.   This is a story about how bad scientists think.  What are we supposed to do if you can't go to the moon?  Johnny Deppe does the best he can in a short film.  For the most part, the film is about how badly he has screwed up.  Deppe's wife, played well by Michelle Pfeiffer, shows up to help him, but is not very good at it.  (As she has been described: "Depp plays a young girl who is a little bit out of her depth with her new husband. When she comes to help, he's a bit of a manchild. She's a little more practical in her thinking.")  She is so upset at him for "being bad" that she wants him out of the house.   And then, of course, the scene that will get people talking:  Depp's rocket lands on Mars.  When it lands, it doesn't explode, which is a bit odd for a space movie.  I suppose you could say that De
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It takes a while to start but the film is very good, however, the story was so poorly written that it is very hard to follow and I guess it was a good idea to put a lot of actors into one movie but it does not add any value to the movie which is sad since it really should be a great movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen many bad movies. This one is the only one I could not stop laughing at.  The guy on the front is always telling a funny joke but doesn't really get into the role until the end.    My wife loves it when I go out of my way to watch movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really glad I had the chance to watch this film when it came out at the turn of the century.  It is a truly terrible film.  For one thing it is shot in a very cheesy way.  Everything is done in slow motion and the characters are as boring and forgettable as possible.  They talk about things they don't really understand and then get into some kind of stupid fight or argument.  I like to watch these type of films as I like watching the bad people fight the good, and this movie falls a little short when it comes to the actual fights.  The best thing that can be said about this movie is that it has a really bad and cheesy ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've read the blurb for this book on Goodreads. It sounds like the movie, and I'm pretty sure it is. I think that this book would do well as a film in some form or another. It is set in the year 2012 with no real explanation as to how it all went so wrong. It has a good set of characters and is a well written book with a lot of twists and turns. It does get to the point in the last few pages that it really does get really depressing at times, but that's the point.   The novel by Roddy Doyle was published in 1995. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a very bad movie, full of  a bunch of lame jokes, bad acting, bad special effects (it is a children's movie) a bad girl (the lead actress was a pretty young lady) and  no special effects.  The film has been remade so many times it seems nobody even remembers this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not expecting much when watching this movie (I have watched the "Sidney Poitier" film series over a number of times and had a vague idea that it might be a good thing to watch these two characters in the same setting)  It's definitely a movie that should be watched by everyone, not just anyone.  The acting in the movie is a lot of fun, all the guys are good at their jobs but none of them are very handsome (although Sid and the other young ones look good)  So if you are looking for the film that has Sidney Poitiers as a cowboy who's just trying to get by on his horse, then this is probably not for you (I also know a lot people who were surprised by how this movie was shot)  There are a couple of scenes that are funny but not very exciting, but it's not a long movie.  There is a very entertaining musical number in the film, the "Kiss of a Stranger," sung by Sid and his friends.  It takes a few tries for it to settle into the groove and the rhythm is not always good, but I still think it's pretty cool.  This is a movie about a cowboy and a cowgirl who seem to love one another.  And it's a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As many have said, the movie is an action thriller set during the Japanese Imperial rule of Manchuria in the early 20th century. It tells the story of a young, noble, and somewhat naive Japanese soldier named Akira, who has just enlisted for service in the military after a chance encounter with the Imperial General. Unfortunately for the young soldier, there seems to be an Imperial plot afoot, one that involves his fellow recruits and the Emperor.   The movie also has a good cast, including the impressive Hiroshi Inagaki, who plays the General, and a very good lead actor in the role of the young samurai, Takashi Hironaga. I do wish some of the plot twists were resolved, but most of the action really made me think the entire time! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am glad that this movie is a complete cluster fuck of a piece of shit.   When I saw the trailer I was pretty much expecting something like "Eyes Wide Shut"   The trailer shows a lot of scenes that could make "Ears Wide Shut,"   a better movie.  But nothing has happened.  There is no sex, no love, no sex act or sex drive.  The only part of this movie that is remotely exciting are the scenes between the two old men and the young girl.  I would be more entertained if that didn't suck all of the enjoyment out of the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really don't recommend this movie to anybody...it's terrible, unoriginal, and pretty depressing. This film takes place in the early 1900's in a fictional English village where, during a time-out, a young man called Arthur Dent finds a hidden treasure buried in a cemetery. This is a re-make of the old BBC serial, "Arthur Dent's Treasure", which was made in the 1930's. The new film is even more derivative of classic British humor, as the hero of the story is a kindly farmer who lives in a remote, idyllic part of Britain with his wife, son, two horses, and two donkeys, all of whom must be fed from time to time during the winter. However, as if that wasn't bad enough, the evil wizard Merlin, also played by Alan Yentob, appears again and tries to take over the town... Arthur's task is to protect Merlin and a secret that he plans to pass down to his daughter, a pretty young girl called Lucy. In the meantime, Merlin's plan is to gain power over the inhabitants of the village by using Merlin's "magic box", which is also a magical sword that causes people to think it's a magic sword (and causes them to attack their enemies), and which is eventually discovered by a poor fisherman named John. But after learning that the box contains the location of the hidden treasure, he and his wife decide to spend the rest of their lives hunting for it, which causes John to be exiled to a remote island and his ship to be sunk. There the couple discovers a village full of peasants, who also find themselves in the clutches of Merlin and his magic box. And then Arthur Dent comes along to help them out, but they soon discover that it won't be a simple task... It seems that they'll have to fight against a whole village of goblins and their magical boxes, which are created by an evil wizard called the Black Knight. The result is a fun and silly film that was a great excuse to have Alan Yenterob in a silly, over-the-top role, though it didn't succeed in its aim of making a more modern version of the "Arthur & Lucy" stories.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie with a bad ending:  I was initially looking forward to a good movie with bad-movie stars (I mean, this is the same guy who played a bad film called "Wrecking Ball" in the '80s). A friend of mine and I decided to go to this crappy movie "Walking Dead" and see if it would be worse than it looks like. And it was! This movie would be better at home! I would not call the bad acting as bad and as bad as it looks. The acting is really bad. The bad acting was the worst thing about this movie: the movie looked a lot better in the trailer. And this movie looks nothing but stupid, ugly, ugly looking and very ugly. And even worse, the acting is so bad in this movie that you cannot believe a bad-acting would be this bad. I will try to sum this movie up as quickly as possible: it is like a piece of cheese that had been thrown together in one bad-looking box. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit that I have not seen this movie. A friend of mine told me about it (in a rather long monologue). He is in full agreement with the above reviews, that it is bad, and that the acting is bad as well. For those interested in that: here's the movie: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The film begins with a shot of a man with a giant spider. The camera zooms in on the spider as it is crawling along an old woman's arm. The spider has a long string of spiderwebs that reaches out towards the woman. The old woman walks out from behind a bush. The man looks up at the spider and then looks at his hand. It is suddenly cut off by a small boy with a pencil. The boy draws a picture of the spider, showing it as a giant arachnid that has legs like a spider. Then the spider crawls off into the distance. The child says that he needs some spiderweb spiders, but that they only grow in the rain. He pulls out a small plastic bag which has five spiderwebers, and then he shows them to the old woman. He picks out a red spiderweaver and puts it on the old lady's arm, and he uses a small, black marker to make a spiderweb on the web. The woman is impressed by his talent. She walks outside with a smile. The next shot shows a boy standing in the middle of a field. He opens his bag and pulls out two spiderwebes from it. Then he takes a spider to his mouth. The little boy then closes the bag and holds up a spiderwebe. He starts to chew on it, then he pulls it out of the bag. It has a mouthful of spines. He chews it a while and then swallows it. He looks at the field, then at the little boy and then back at the insect. It begins to grow and the spiderwe be begins to crawl out of its mouth and slowly move towards the boy. The tree in the background moves around a bit, and there is a little breeze coming from the front of the screen. This wind pushes the spider out of his mouth and it crawls towards the old man. The insect bites the old men head. It then crawls out of him. It runs across the field as it slowly begins to move back. The wind carries it back across the road and it ends up at a house by the road.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    An odd and very odd movie. I find this movie quite disturbing. It should be no more and if it is I will be very sad. There are some odd moments in this movie, such as when our heroine (I think it's a woman, but I don't know) visits a hospital. I'm no medical expert, but if I don�t know this, and I'm not a psychiatrist, then I don �t know much about any medical treatment. I believe the doctor is not a good doctor because he ignores his patients' wishes when they come into the hospital. The only person who comes to the hospital is one of his relatives, a young child. I donít know anything about him, but the doctor doesnít seem to like him. So the doctor gives him something to eat and he eats it but doesní' want to eat other things. So our heroine visits him. When I was a child I liked this movie because it showed a very cruel mother who really did love her child, and was very sad to see him become so sick. As a child, I liked the movie because I thought the mother was in a bad mood. I also like the film because it was very odd.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie in college and it is a total waste of time. It took them 3 years to get that movie made after all those years of research.   Well, I can tell you that this is not a good movie and is not even remotely fun.  It features some of the worst acting I have ever seen (even worse than "Shrek" is), and most of the time the script fails to impress. The actors are trying to act too hard in some scenes. The "Shark Attacks" are lame as well as lame.  For a movie with a title like "Sharks," there are almost no sharks in it.  This is not like any movie I have seen.  The soundtrack is annoying as well and is the least memorable part.  A good title is not enough to redeem this mess of a film.  This is a film that does not deserve to be called a good film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't usually like watching movies about people who live in New York.  There is so much that can be gleaned from this movie.  It is about a young married couple, one a doctor and the other a businessman, and they're having a great time in the Big Apple.    It's about their trip from Brooklyn to Manhattan to see the sights of the world.  They take a trip along the Hudson river in a boat, and enjoy the view.  Their boat is going to crash, so they borrow a car and run away from the police.  But the car is an antique, and the cops are hunting down all those who have antique cars that have been reported stolen.  Then the cops arrest the couple because the vehicle has never been insured.  After an arrest, they get off on a technicality; they are going to testify in court that the car has been insured, but then it turns out the insurance policy was revoked by a company that has a contract with the couple's lawyer.  A big problem, the car had to be repaired; and they had to wait for a new car that would not have to wait in traffic.  The husband returns home and discovers that the wife has moved into the new place and is living there with her new lover.  So it looks like this couple will never be able to have a family of their own.  This movie is a story that shows New York as something that is changing, slowly and surely.  I really wish I could remember the details, because there are so many in this movie; the sights, the smell of the place, the people.  These people have a life that doesn't include sitting on a park bench, drinking beer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this in the theater with my wife. I wanted to love it, but I couldn't stand it at all. I don't know about the rest of you guys, but a good time is not a good movie in my opinion. Not funny, not thrilling, not interesting, nothing at all! And it ends up on a bad ending. This movie has no idea what it's doing. It's a good way to pass the time for any movie lovers in our household. I was more interested in the little girl in the movie than I was in the film itself.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst action movies of all time.  The premise has already been done to death over and over again so I really don't want to add to it.  We are introduced to one of the most vile looking villains in film history, and it isn't just because his face is a cross between a dog's face and a toad's face.  He's a vile piece of work.  I am amazed at how he was able to find work in a place where most of the film is shot with a very low quality video.  While the story is bad, the acting is far worse.  This film is far too slow and dull.  There are so many times when you have no idea what is going on, and the dialogue is usually terrible.  Every scene he's in is so over the top that it just seems out of place.  And the effects are bad.  At one point he fires a shotgun straight through a wall.  Now, that's a real gun.  Also, the action in this is just horrible.  It's mostly just slow motion and random gun shots.   This is a waste of my time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that doesn't quite deliver on what the title says.  At times it seems like the writer doesn't know what to do, or if he does knows what to try, it just doesn't feel right.  It tries to be a horror movie with a few twists, but it's never quite there.  There's a nice little bit of humor at the end, but I don't think it was necessary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, and probably one of the most pointless and stupid ones I've ever seen.   The story revolves around a little boy named Peter, who is being bullied by a boy named Danny.  When Danny is accused of being a child molester, Peter sets out to prove the boy's innocence and the police find him guilty.  This proves to be a pretty easy trial for Peter.  But the film doesn't just end there.  The film proceeds into a murder mystery, complete with a dead body and a suspect named Dr. Osterman.  OsterMan was an insane and crazy person.  He didn't believe in anything, including the law.  And this is where the film starts to go downhill.  So Ostermen claims that his son died in a car accident, and he was sent to the "old hospital".  But Peter doesn't believe him.  After that, the film shows a woman talking to OsterMen son.  She accuses him of killing his father and then she gets mad at Peter. Peter is taken away to be the next "patient" (pun!)   If you were expecting a serious film, this one is not it.  Instead of showing a man's madness and insanity, it shows a little kid's obsession with a little girl.  I was in tears the whole time, watching this movie.  If anyone out there is reading this and you've seen it, please don't waste your life on this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film "The World of George Wallace" starring John Wayne, James Cagney, Frank Morgan and Gene Kelly was a disaster in every respect, a low-budget, big-time, melodramatic disaster. Not only was Wallace, a one-dimensional actor who was almost unrecognizable in the film, but this film was written by an unknown, amateur director who was not given an adequate budget, and he certainly didn't try to hide the fact that he was trying to fool the audience with the "dramatic" scenes. There were only two things going for Wallace- his acting ability and his sheer, unprovable ego, but as to what he did do with those abilities, the film was completely incoherent and as a result, there is absolutely nothing to watch with. Wayne is a one note comedy actor who is not funny enough to carry any film, much less one of this size, but he is there in any role he is given, whether it be a comic relief role in a "Dirt and Blood" type film, or a small role in one of these low-class melodrama films. He also gives a somewhat stiff and stiff-willed performance as George, a clown that really can't get a word in without breaking into a bad fit of giggles. Cagny is not much better as she is not a comic actress as she plays the wife of a wealthy businessman, the one woman in the movie who can take a serious role. Morgan is not the kind of actor you would like in a comedy role, he is a character actor, which is nothing more than a bad joke, his character being so over the top and ridiculous that the film can't escape him. Finally, Kelly is a bit more interesting as he is not only funny as Wallace's friend, but is also really quite a character, one that can't be taken seriously for any length of time. "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" is a pretty bad film, and it doesn't do anything new to be considered a comedy in it's entirety, but it is certainly a film worth watching for the performances, the good writing, the bad acting and, of course, the scenery. There is one scene that I would like to mention, and that is Wallace's scene in the boat after his wife and children have left him, he actually appears in his underwear and a tuxedo. The whole scene just seems a little too ludicrous to be real,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is lame, the acting is not that good and the story is a complete mess. I mean, it's a movie with a lot of characters, a lot, really. The main guy (the one that's not in the movie) is named Michael who goes to a party of people that are really drunk and he gets drunk. So then he says "Okay, if it is really that bad then maybe we can stay home tonight and relax." And then a guy (who isn't in the actual movie) gets so drunk he's basically unresponsive and he's also really creepy! And so Michael has to take the guy home where the only way to get him back to a normal state is to use the dark room that we see in the film but the problem is there is a big hole in it! The only way Michael can get to the hole is to go through some weird dreamlike world he has where he has this girlfriend with these strange dreams (I mean really, how can people have strange dreams?!) and a bunch of creepy people (who are not in any of the movies), a crazy woman with a big knife, and this weirdly beautiful man! The movie is so boring it's almost as if the producers tried to make a good bad movie and failed completely. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing great about this movie. I could sit here and do it for hours (if you're into that sort of thing), but that would make this review too long, so let me just say that it's a bad film with some good acting and a bad title. It's about a guy named Billy the Kid, who in his teenage years grew up to be a bigshot gangster called "Big Billy" but when he decides to start working in crime he ends up with no choice but to become a cop. He's pretty inept at it but it gets him into more trouble and he finds himself taking care of a girl named Gloria (Eileen Brennan) who is in love with him. But, in the last act, she gets involved with Billy's brother (Tommy Dorn) who kills the gangster and they run off to Mexico. Unfortunately for them, Tommy Dorn is a Mexican cop and so they're captured. Billy and Gloria get away on a boat but things don't go too well for them. The crew of the boat they get on is led by a man called Pancho (John Cleese) who was Billy's former partner back in the days before Billy started robbing people with his brother. He tries to murder Billy with a knife in the same way he did to Billy's little brother but he's not successful (Billy's brother, on the other hand, does try to kill him by using his girlfriend to get him drunk). Billy ends up getting his brother killed and gets caught up in another series of criminal shenanigans but then a new gang called The Bandits (which sounds like a cross between James Bond and The Sopranos) finds him and puts him on the back of a truck to be "punched" to death. So Billy theKid gets his revenge on Tommy D (who has taken one look at him and decided he wants to kill Billy and the Bandits are a major part of the movie) by beating him to death with a baseball bat. Billy then takes a ride with Panch (who was supposed to be one of his "friends") back to Mexico and tells him all about the experience. It was pretty hilarious until the end when it wasn't and you just have to wonder why they had to go through all that. The acting was fairly weak, especially in the early parts, and the humor was lame in places. It didn't have an especially high rating on IMDB but it had some good people behind it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the first attempt at making a serious and serious movie out of a cheapy "monster" movie, which is probably the only kind of cheap monster movie that you would ever see. It also seems to be the first movie ever to do a lot of talking, which you are not likely to do in a monster movie. It is not a monster that you have to run screaming from; it is a creature that is there to tell you what a bad place it is to live.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is about a man who is called out of retirement to join an army of superman killers that are out to take out the bad guys that have taken over the nation. The only problem is the superman killer isn't a superman. Its a super villain. So basically this movie has the good guys trying to kill the bad guy but instead of taking them out a super evil killer is out to kill every last one of them because that is what super villains are supposed to be like. And then we are told this super villain is actually the product of some kind of experimentation. So why was this experiment necessary in the first place. No we are to wonder this villain came from a normal looking human and has super intelligence. So not sure why he would need to go crazy and transform into a bat. Maybe he has a thing for bats or maybe he does. I mean just how big do you have to go. That's a pretty big bat. You need more bat like parts to make a bat like bat. The movie is kind of like Spiderman: Dark of the Moon except it sucks. I wish the story was more interesting and I wish it didn't make me feel so bad watching it. But overall there are plenty of fun action scenes and a good villain for a movie like this to work on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I wish I could give this a higher rating but as i watched it, i had a terrible gut feeling that i was in trouble in a bad way. It was a very boring movie that is mostly about nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen it several times but it doesn't feel like I've made that many "jumps" since I saw it at the theatre.   It's a very low budget production, full of cheap acting and a cast of actors who were not exactly well known in the late 1980s.  They seem out of place and are treated like a bunch of amateurs.  The movie is set in a very small little town and the director wanted to make a very "realistic" film about "simple people" who live in a town in the Middle West.  I thought that the movie tried a little too hard to be realistic and had a very limited budget.  There's not much happening in the movie.    It's kind of funny how every time the characters come to a problem they do the same old "what the hell" dance that you see in every bad drama ever made.  It takes the entire movie to solve a simple problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was one of those rare films where a movie isn't bad because it has nothing going for it. And this isn't a film where a director wants to make a movie, it's a film about the director's life, which is boring. It's boring and boring and stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If this had been made in 1968 the movie would have been in 3D and the music might have been "Lucky Man" by The Cars, but as it is, I found it to be the most unpleasant movie I've ever seen. I didn't understand the plot (in fact, I think that the movie is just a rehash of the 1970 film The Time Machine, but in 3-D). There are things which happened that didn't really happen:   When the movie started I was expecting to be taken to the future where I could play with aliens or something, but instead I ended up in a dark room in a hospital where the movie takes us. I don't know why I bothered to get in, but I figured it was probably just a mistake.   It starts off with the doctor explaining to someone that they are "the last of their breed". They are the last members of a race called the Ancients who have been extinct for thousands of years. After they were wiped out, the people of today began to believe that something must have been done to them. In order to help them understand the cause of the extinction, the doctor removes the eye of one of the Ancient soldiers and uses his DNA to create a clone which is then put into a time machine so that he can see whether or not there is anything to the story they are hearing about the extinction of the Ancients.  But then this plot hole becomes even bigger.  Because the Ancient soldier that the doctor is using to create the "clone" is actually his brother! They had both been killed in battle and now the doctor has his DNA, so it is like they are now a single being! The doctor uses a bunch of Ancient DNA which is in the form of "alien" teeth and the clone has the same features, except for the fact that he is actually the same man as the older brother.  What's even more horrible is that the film doesn't explain to the audience that this "clone is actually identical" to the old brother, meaning that they now have to live with each other.  This is a movie where the lead actress actually looks younger than the male lead and they were even able to give the movie the name "Ridley Scott's Greatest Movie"  But I guess I shouldn't have been shocked because I've heard about this movie.  It should be easy to tell that it was based on the movie Time Machine from the title and the way the movie looked.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was initially apprehensive about this movie because I had an attitude towards children when I was a kid and I didn't like them. I didn't like them much at all. I think a very large part of why I was put off by them was because they were so ugly. I don't know what they're trying to say here, but I was not very impressed. They looked like tiny, sickly, under-developed little monsters. It is no wonder that in a film such as this, they can't even get their faces right. The special effects were pretty cool, though - the characters' mouths move. The film is not great and is in most respects a very derivative work. But for what it is, it is a very well acted, well directed, very well written film. It won me over to the kids and I now feel a little better about them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think I heard this movie from a friend in middle school, because I didn't think he had the intelligence to understand the stupidity of what he was doing. It's like a comedy of errors that includes a bunch of high school kids.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What was it about? Some sort of postmodern comedy/family movie with a ridiculous ending. You'd think they could do a better job of telling a story than they did in this movie. The acting is really bad. They did a pretty bad job of making the movie. I guess there is nothing worse than a bad comedy where the lead tries to do comedy without comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What can you say about the title: A man finds a large wooden box hidden in the woods behind a building. He opens the box and finds some small items that appear to be toys. As the man opens the other side of the box he finds something much bigger than a toy box. The man realizes this is no simple wood box and immediately calls the sheriff, who comes out, also. The two men then go up to the box, open it and find a large reptile which looks very alive. But wait, there's a problem: the reptile is stuck on a pole and cannot move or get off.  This film should be banned from every public library and also from homes of children. This film gives an idea of what is going on in the minds of many of our politicians and in our churches. This movie shows the destruction of the country and we are all complicit in it. This has become a cult film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, the plot line is a rip off from the movie ( I have already seen this before), so no surprises there. However the characterizations are horrible and the plot, well, if it is a plot, is a train wreck that no film can hope to follow. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't recommend this movie enough. It's a fantastic comedy, that is well made and well paced. It stars Willy Wonka (of course), his wife Alvy, and their two dogs, Violet and the poor boy. The comedy isn't just about them running out to their old home and getting a little surprise, it is all about how the characters are reacting to the fact that Willy and Alvy are leaving for good. They all feel as if they are not just going to the next town, but that they are going to find that all of their old friends have passed away, and that the world of Chocolate isn't going to hold them for long. I don't know why Willy is so excited about this departure. It seems so ill-conceived to me. There are two scenes in this film that I cannot stand. First, there is a joke about a dog wearing a hat that can tell where it is going. It is absolutely pathetic. I never would have thought that anyone could come up with a better gag. If you want to laugh along with Willy, then I'd suggest watching the film in the dark and then laughing until you faint. This second scene is the most depressing I have ever seen in my entire life. It involves the two dogs sitting on a porch and waiting to be taken away. The dogs start to wag their tails. Willy wants them to stay, but Alvy tells him to leave. Willa then tells him that all their friends have gone and asks Willy what they are all doing now. Willier replies: "They're at a little old chocolate house!" You know what? If I had ever known that this was going to be the ending of the film, I would have never taken the kids out of the theater. I think you'll agree with me that this is a good movie. There is nothing wrong with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those rare movies that I'd love to see in the theater. It is a slow paced, yet entertaining and entertaining movie.   It stars a nice group of guys, most of whom are very likable guys, and is based on the "The Green Mile", which is a movie that I watched over and over again as a kid.  It is about a guy who is in his seventies, who has just gotten out of prison, after serving a long time for killing someone.  The movie follows him as he travels from town to town, and eventually, he goes back to his home town and finds that there is not a soul there that remembers him.  Instead, everyone is trying to get his attention by talking to him about the "Green Mile".   The story of the film is simple, yet it is very well done.    The acting is done by many, and I think that they do a pretty good job playing the characters.  I loved this movie, and it will stay in the "Cool" folder on my TV in my den for a while, and be a staple of my late-night movie watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really wanted to like this film. I mean, I did see it. That's what counts! I thought I would be watching a really fun romp! And, in its own way, it was! I really enjoyed the film. However, I think it is a terrible movie, so I did not enjoy watching it. I liked the title though, I just don't think this was a fun rambunctious romp. I thought this was one of those films that was going to be a real fun raucous, raunchy, razzle dazzle romp...and it's not! I think this is a movie about an old lady and her grandson. The old lady just wants to go to the movies one day. When she gets there, it turns out she hasn't been able to pay for her ticket. So she goes to a theater and sits down. As she sits down, she thinks about her life. There's no hope for the little boy she has. She sees his room at the orphanage with the broken furniture. She thinks about how much she loved the little girl who lived there. How much she thought about the big strong little man next door who was always helping her, who was so happy to have a friend. She is also reminded of her husband who never went to the movie theater. I don't know what happened to him... I think she is going to sit down in the movie theatre all alone...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know about the rest of the world, but to me this movie is a total waste. What happened? A group of women decide to get a massage and then have a beer. They are interrupted by a naked man in the middle of the floor. What followed was the worst scene I've ever seen. The guy gets out of the chair and starts doing his thing to one woman. Then the other two women jump him, and I'm pretty sure he broke his leg on the first kick.  It took them 2 minutes to make him do it again, but finally he did. And then he did it a third time. And it wasn't that bad. The first woman got fucked in the butt. Then he fucked her in the mouth, and then the other one sucked his cock and got fucked. It was all pretty good.  The woman's tits were big and she looked really hot. But I'm sure none of them were as good as her boyfriend.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you enjoyed one of the most horrible movies, "The Amityville Horror", then "The Blair Witch Project", with all its ridiculous and unnecessary special effects, and even though it makes it much more interesting the film would be much better if it didn't need all these ridiculous effects. There is a lot of gore in this film too but its not much. In fact this movie only has 1 real scene of pure horror (which is at the beginning of the movie when you see the camera fly out of the window) it is kind of cheesy, but not that bad. This movie is more of a weird movie about a girl who wants to become a witch and go to a cabin in the woods in an area called the Amityville, which is the same place where the Amish lived. But the Amities live a more simple life with a little garden and farm. The main character is a girl named Abigail Price, who is a bit of a geek but not really a witch. She is a little bit like the sister of the "Amityville" victims, only that this girl is a more advanced witch. So she becomes friends with a girl from the "Cabin" who she loves and later she gets caught up in an awful murder mystery. Its not a bad story but you can't help but laugh at some of the characters in the story. The movie is a really weird movie that even in its "weirdness" there is still so much horror and gore that you want to go over and over again. I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you like seeing weird people from movies in movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a good film, but I don't really get it.  The film takes place in an isolated farm in South Carolina and centers around two teenage children, Billy (Ryan Gosling) and Amy (Cate Blanchett). Billy has a little brother named Billy Jr. (the title is a bit of a misnomer, since the kid doesn't appear to be much older than Billy does. Billy Jr.'s eyes are just slightly bigger than Billy's and he wears glasses.  Amy and Billy are both very good natured and good kids.  There's a sort of "farm-to-table" quality to the film.  It seems that they all make their meals together, all the time.  Both Billy and Amy work at the local Dairy Queen.  Even as adults, they don't seem to care all that much about what they're going to be when they grow up.  I'm surprised this movie wasn't made when I was younger.  But I'm glad I didn't grow up to see it, because the ending left me feeling a bit cheated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really liked this movie a lot. It wasn't bad at all.  It was kind of depressing but the characters were interesting and funny.    That is what is called acting. I like the story that the writers put together. I think it's a pretty good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie, I really do, and I am glad that I did. It was a bit long, but that was probably a deliberate decision by the studio. This film was made during WWII so you could assume that it will be fairly depressing, but I think it is a really nice movie. There is a lot of humor, and a few touching moments, as well as a bit of romance. I was not a huge fan of this movie at first, but it was one of my favorites when it finally got around to being finished. I watched it again tonight, and it got even better. As I said, it can get kind of long, especially the last act, but once the last scene is over it is over. It might take a bit longer to find the rest of the movie, but the more I watch this, the more fond I become of it. There are a lot more good movies out there than this one, but this is definitely the film that made me want to watch more movies. It is not the greatest movie by any stretch, but for the movie to be made during WW II, it had to be done the way it was done.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It had the same type of characters as the first one. The movie was about the life of an American soldier stationed in Japan. It started out the same as the previous movie. It seemed like they had all been involved in the same accident. The soldiers were supposed to meet some important visitors and take part in some sort of military training. Instead, they found out that the guests were in actuality Japanese samurai. What kind of idiot thought that would be a good idea? It didn't end well. As I was watching this movie, I realized that this is probably the weakest of the three "Ghosts of Tokyo" movies. It has the same kind of characters and plot as the last one, with the same bad acting, the same slow pacing and the same poor direction. I really wish I had taken a break from this movie before I got to the part where everyone got sucked into the water and had their guts sucked out. And then we got to see a ghost.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like to make films about a few people with lots of problems and who are usually hopelessly hopeless, then give this a try.  The film is shot in a low budget style and the actors are usually rather bad.    You don't get a lot of development between the characters, most of which happen in the background, so you never get a chance to understand them.    I have seen a couple other films by this author, both very bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie has a lot of flaws, and it's not really a fun watch. It's slow paced, and almost completely lacking in humor, as it follows a boring main character who just can't seem to get any work done for some reason. She has some "romance" with a "nice" guy but she quickly ends it when she realizes he's trying to find a girlfriend. And then another girl arrives who is really pretty but ends up spending most of the movie pouting because she can't be the center of any attention. The movie tries to show that a woman can still be beautiful, but they get stuck on one point: the "real" woman is a very boring, uninteresting woman.  The rest of the plot is basically a story about a girl going through high school, and she's a real bitch. It doesn't help that she's the only "real woman" in town, and all the other women seem to be really bad mothers. It never seems to occur to her that her only purpose in life is to be a bitch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not a big fan of this movie. I like the concept of a ghost hunting team, but I just can't get into the premise.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie that really shouldn't be made. The entire thing is just one long series of stupid jokes.   The main character was named "Rufus"...what's the point?   His father is a crazy old man who never leaves his house and who hates the very people who live there. His mother is an abusive little whore who has to work at her job all day. The rest of the family is a bunch of drunkards who all get together for parties only because they know that the other people in their lives love to party, and so they keep on partying even though the party is getting old and people are starting to get sick of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's been two years since I last watched the first three "X-Files" movies, but I'm not going to be that bummed.   The show is not a good fit for cable, so the first four movies in the current run were shot on 65mm (and then restored for theatrical use).   So now we've got "The Six Million Dollar Man."   Again, I'm going to have a hard time feeling much sympathy for the aliens, who are portrayed by a cast of well-known actors who don't seem to give a hoot about playing aliens.  The plot revolves around an oil company whose president (Robert Mitchum) is forced to deal with an oil slick that's blocking his roads to work.    So he enlists the help of an "X"-Man (Michael Biehn) to fly down and blow up the slick with an explosive.  I'm pretty sure "X" was meant to stand for "Xenomorph" and it worked. The alien, played by a very young Bill Pullman (of "Stand By Me" fame), is a pretty cool looking thing.  He's the type of guy you'd find at a rodeo.  That said, when he gets a little pissed off at a guy in a white shirt (Steve Railsback) he doesn't hesitate to hit him over the head with a machete.  The show is actually pretty good, but the movie, which came out two years after the show, doesn't really come close to recapturing the fun and energy that were the trademark elements of the old series.  Sure the aliens have some pretty cool attacks in the movie (one is a space shuttle that shoots jets) and the fight scenes are a little better (although, to be fair, the fight scene in the X-Files version with the alien from "Spaceballs" is also pretty cool).  The movie isn't bad by any stretch, but it's nothing to write home about.  A pretty decent addition to the "X Files" movie franchise, but not really worth a sequel.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was horrible. It seemed to be a reenactment or even a re-make of "The Man with the Golden Gun".  In this case a man is in a flying spaceship and is trying to shoot out all the alien creatures trying to invade earth.  He is flying very fast and he does not seem to be in trouble at all until about a third of the way in.    His body becomes badly injured.  At first he seems to be making a good effort to survive, but then one of the aliens jumps on him and he is thrown to the other side of the spaceship.  As he is lying in the wreckage the other alien approaches him and takes him away.  It seems that there is no way back.  The alien takes him to its base in the middle of an area which seems to have a great deal of water.  Once there the man is taken to a huge hall that appears to be one gigantic pool.  He is made to jump into the pool and it appears that he survives, at least in the short time he is there.  After he has survived he discovers that his life support system has failed and the water has drained him of his life force.  What a stupid idea.  This is the last of the alien "pops" in this movie.  In the film it was never mentioned why the aliens had come to earth or who had sent them.  Perhaps they had landed here because the earth had recently been hit by a big nuclear explosion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is really a good movie but it does not really have that much of a plot going for it, or a very interesting premise. The bad part is that the whole movie is based on the idea that you have to dress like a woman in order to get into the ladies' night club. This makes it all the more ridiculous, and I think if this had been the only plot line there would have been at least an "A" in the end of the movie. There are a lot of other problems with the movie that are not worth going into, but I'll give you a quick rundown of the most glaring ones. First of all, the girls who are supposed to be dressed as a bunch of girls in drag are portrayed as all very normal looking people. And the drag is not really that much different than regular drag. The only time I could actually remember to look at the drag was at the end when one of the women in drag walks in the club. She is quite attractive and I do not remember the drag being that interesting. And not only that, the drag queen does not have a very good gimmick. It seems like the guys all just go for the big guy or the tall girl. And when one girl ends up wearing a dress, the guy doesn't seem to give her enough attention. It was just a very average and uninteresting movie. It has the most basic storyline, the "A's" don't sound that great at the beginning, and it is not especially good to begin with. It is only at the middle or end of it that the movie makes a huge comeback with a good idea and a good performance by all of the lead actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film has almost nothing to do with the real thing, which has always been a bit of a disappointment. (The real film is, in fact, called The Dictator, and was directed by Mel Brooks.)   A film that's been in the making since 1970 (the first act was shot in 1970) and has been in many reruns since it came out in 1971 (including on ABC's Saturday Night in 1971), but it never quite made it to the big screen until it appeared in 1979, where it was finally released in theaters in 1980.   In 1981, however, things began to change for this movie. In a very odd development, Mel Brooks and his producer, Steven Spielberg, decided that the film could only be good if it was made in Europe. In Europe, Mel would be free to take chances and push the boundaries. Unfortunately, in order to get the budget to be large enough for Europe, Brooks and Spielberg turned the film's entire budget, or what was left over, into one of their most expensive films.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So, you've been watching a movie for many hours.   The bad movie is almost over.  When it is over, a voice starts talking to you.  The voice is not your average voice.  It seems very intelligent and even if you don't believe it, you'll get it when you see it.  You see, the voice knows the plot of a certain movie called "Zak-Man".  You should be more impressed than you are.  After this voice says "I know it's the end".  He continues to say " I know, I know its the end, and I know the movie is very good. But I'm afraid that you don' know how good it is. "   You can imagine my disappointment.  I was hoping for a good movie.  My expectations were so low.  And, this movie wasn't good at all.  So when this voice tells me:  "I knew it was bad when I saw it on an early plane trip. It was so bad. I know this movie will be good as soon as I finish it. But, there's still one problem with it. "    I have a few thoughts here:  1. What the hell is "Zac"?  2. What is "Crap-o-matic"?  3. What about a movie that's like "Chupa Chups"?  I'm pretty sure that I've seen all of the "Zach and Stitch" movies before.  But, this is by far my favorite. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first and last time I have seen the movie was back in the early seventies. It was on the Discovery Channel and it was not good. The director thought that this would make a good movie and it did not. It is an ugly movie that does not make any sense. The film is only about four scenes. There is a train which is in the same frame as an old woman (who has lost all her hair) who is walking down the middle of a street. She gets hit by a truck and dies. The scene then changes to another area in the city where another old woman is standing on a street corner talking to her neighbor. This neighborhood has a church that is right across from the old lady. A woman then walks down the street and sees the old woman walking along the same street. The woman goes back into the church. At this point the movie is only a few minutes long. But the whole movie takes place in this short segment. The old woman walks home. The next night she comes across a train wreck in front of the church and is killed. The movie then has to pick up and go to the next scene which involves a bunch of people coming out of a tunnel (the train was the only thing that survived) and they are talking about how they have all been drinking and have decided they are going to walk to the nearest town called 'Tijuana' which has one of the best bars in the world. Then the movie changes to a place where a man who is drunk, looks at a photo of the old man that the woman saw. A man walks over and asks him what he is looking at. The man says that it is a girl's picture and then walks off. The camera then pulls back and you see that it was a photograph of the wife of a man named Jim who is sitting on a park bench holding a beer. Then a few days later, Jim has to go into the hospital for surgery because he broke his foot and also has a sore throat. The people in the area then walk over to see Jim and say that he looked like he was in good spirits. They then say that they are all going to the bar that Jim is going to drink at (a beer is a beer is basically a glass of beer) and then walk off. That is about it. The whole movie is about four or five minutes long and the film makes no sense. I think that a group of high school students made the movie but I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't want to give anything negative about the movie; I think it's a decent movie. Not my favorite movie of the season, but it's not bad. I liked the "Gardens of the Hidden City" stuff.   The movie could have been more imaginative, but I like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been in many bad movies. You know, the kind that's so cheap, low, and cheesy. I can't stand these so called "action movies" that are made by the big studios or by the people who thought this was a good idea in the first place. I think this movie sucks. There's nothing to do, I mean it's kind of boring (there are some funny scenes but it's really all in the way they act). It has the same formula, the same characters, and the same cheapness. This movie is nothing more than cheap Hollywood acting and a cheap movie to make a couple hundred bucks at the box office.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The idea of a child's game of hide 'n' seek, with monsters, is awesome. But it's got a huge, awful, cheesy twist at the end. Also, the last few minutes aren't good at all; the ending is just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The original movie had everything a sci-fi action flick needs: good looks, good fights, an intriguing plot and a great soundtrack. The movie never gets lost in the sci-y trappings though, even after the first few minutes, the film never loses momentum. In spite of not being as spectacular as the previous entry in the series, it is still good fun and a lot of action to be had.   I've seen worse from this era. I've seen bad sci-fic which did not live up to the original film. This film is not a terrible movie, and it certainly doesn't qualify for the lowest of the low. It's a good movie. I liked it. It might not be a perfect movie, but it's not bad. It is a solid flick and even though I never expected that kind of action film from a TV show. I like it very much. It may not be perfect, but I still enjoy watching it at all. And if you like it, you'll like it because of the good performances from the stars, and the good action. If you like sci-sfi and you like action, go watch it. Watch it now. Watch a couple more episodes. Watch all the episodes. You'll be hooked.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are so many awful movies out there, all trying to look like the best ones.   This one seems to be trying to be the second.  It's got all the "badness" in a small town and all the badness in a trailer park, so to speak.  I'm not sure what it is about these trailer parks that has made them so popular.  Most of the bad things you can think of:  a lot of crime, drugs, alcohol, and some women.  This is nothing new in the trailer park.  The only real change is that we get to see a lot of good stuff here:  A nice family, a dog, and a good little trailer park for a couple.  At the beginning of the film it was hard to imagine all the wonderful things that can be found here, but it was soon evident that the good is often better and that we will see a little more of that good stuff from here on out.  And then, the trailer parks fall.  We see some good things, and then a lot happens, and that's pretty much where the story ends.  After this terrible movie I was left disappointed and a little angry.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. First, the movie is very dull. The actors are all pretty good, but the characters they play are so damn stupid that it's just not funny. The story itself is silly and stupid. The plot goes like this: A guy who is crazy loves a girl who is insane. And this is the plot in a nutshell: A girl is crazy and loves a crazy guy and goes to the crazy guy's house to make a man of him and they fall in love, and then, as a joke, she blows her brains out and the guy kills himself and this is where the plot has to stop. It's pretty lame and I hate when people try to make people laugh by making fun of how stupid the characters are. I just hope the guy's daughter never grows up to be crazy. This movie is so stupid that I feel like a complete idiot for spending 10 minutes on it. But I love the title, because it's basically a play on words (and a little bit of fun) for the audience to think that a crazy girl loves crazy people.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I was in high school, I was a student at the University of Houston and there, one of the movies that we always watched was "The Godfather: Part II." At that time, the movie was an absolute classic and one of those movies that I have a strong memory of. I thought it was such a great movie that one of my friends actually said to me when we were watching it, "You're going to get your wish. The film will always stay on a lot of people's mind." It did and I'm not really sure how the film ended. Well, the film certainly didn't end. It seemed as if it continued right into a future where the "Godfather" family is back together (although one of them was killed in the first film) and that the original family was now in the hands of the son of the man they killed. So, it was a sequel to the original. And it had another very interesting ending that I remember well and that's how it all ended. So that movie, to this day, is still an extremely influential movie. Not only do I still consider the film one of best movies ever made, but it's actually one of this movie's biggest influences.  LOOK OUT HERE! "The Empire Strikes Back"!  A few years after this is over, the sequel "Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope" is coming out and it has plenty of scenes, scenes from the original "Godson" and a couple more that the director of the original film, Francis Ford Coppola, was interested in creating but couldn't because he was doing his sequel. He had to make something new with it. For me, Coppolas "God Son" film is what the new "Star wars" should be and yet, I don't think any film has ever done a better job of bringing a great story out than the old Coppolos film (he co-wrote the film with his wife, Sara.)     And here is the trailer for "Godzilla" that was shown at a convention in England.  I would have loved to have seen the original version of the film in high definition, especially the scene in the opening sequence. There really isn't any version of it that I wouldn't have loved.   "God son" is the best sequel to a movie I have ever seen, maybe even to a film that I've watched all the time since the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a great remake of the 1959 classic.  There are new actors in the lead roles.    The plot is similar to the original movie (with some new plot elements) except that this time the "bad guys" are "good guys" and the good guys are "bad girls" (this is another plot point added into the movie by Hollywood in order to make a quick buck.  They also added one more plot element.  There is a plot device to be had.      There are a few new special effects.  But this one is a classic remake and should be seen by movie fans everywhere! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst piece of garbage I have seen in a long time. No matter how much money was spent on this production, this movie is no more than a cheap rip off of the 80's cartoon Batman, with an over the top, cheesy, poorly acted, "evil" Batman. It's a bad idea to have one of your principal actors play a character who's only in the film to make the "evil villains" seem more sinister. You could have avoided all of this by making the villain the leader of a small, but dedicated cult of fanatical Batman fans, who are constantly tortured by the presence of the Dark Knight in their dreams. The cult would then gather around the leader who would take them over the edge by murdering or forcing them to ingest dangerous chemicals into their stomach, until they become the new Dark Knight who, in the words of the film, will fight "the real Batman"! Well, this is one heck of a cheap and cheesy idea.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Kundun" is not a very interesting movie.   I have no idea what was happening on the set and the actors were totally out of control.  There are many times during the movie when I was really annoyed with all the violence.  The only thing I enjoyed about the movie is the "Laughing Man" character who makes the film seem so much more entertaining than it would have been.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not only a bad film, but it is also a poorly written one. This movie is not based on a true story - just like its title. The true story of a woman named Mitzie Rosenthal, and her father, who used to beat people with a hammer when they had a bad day at work. After she had a child, she quit her job and started working as a housekeeper and maid in an apartment building that housed a lot of people. However, her job quickly went wrong, and she eventually got into an accident - where she broke her leg and was left almost completely paralyzed. In a last-ditch effort to escape being taken care of, she met a man named Ed Gant - who was looking for his wife in a nursing home. (I have never understood the connection in this movie between Ed Gantry and the original Gant family - they are not related.) While Ed Ganty went to the nursing home to try and find his wife, Mitzi, he was attacked by a man with a gun. Although it appeared at first that he was killed, Mottie escaped with the help of Gant. They then proceeded to work their way into another building, but this time, they ran into a woman who had killed Ed Ganto - who had been her lover. (Ed Ganto was a character in the movie who had a really good role as a drunk who often gets in trouble - which made him a pretty good role.) Soon after Ed Gantic's murder, Mttie and Gant ran into yet another woman who was also looking for Gant, who she thought was Gant's wife. The woman also took Mitzy under her wing, and Motty helped her to take revenge on the Gant woman. Soon enough, Mothra came to Earth to try to kill Motta. Unfortunately, Mutti and Mitzia (the mother and the daughter) were able to capture Mothras, and after a brief fight, they decided to try Motha on in the arena - and she easily defeated Muttik - even with only one arm. In the aftermath, Ed Ganti finally figured out that Motti was really Mitza. They went their separate ways, but Mottia still needed to find her father so that she could get her job back, and then find her mother so that they would both get a nice pension. And the movie does its best to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's an old saying about this one: "It's like a movie about a girl on vacation with her parents. A couple of months in, she goes to visit her dad (a guy who seems to have no problem with his daughter) for Christmas. I'm not going to spoil the movie for you so don't read the synopsis! You already know that they end up at a cabin in the woods and there's a lot of nudity (a woman gets her man's pants down and a couple of others get a couple extra). A really silly film that has a lot less to do than it pretends to!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The new James Bond movie is a far cry from the old one. Yes, it is more action-packed and colorful. Yes it takes place in some cool locations. Yes the action scenes are really pretty to look at. But the new Bond movie feels nothing like that old one and that's because they have completely changed the formula. While you may still get the same old story and characters, the direction is much tighter, the editing is cleaner and more dynamic and the script is much more subtle in its references and the new James Bonds are more interesting and dynamic than ever. There is not a single bad movie in this entire series and that is good news for those who loved them before and those who want more great Bond films to come.

I can't remember a bad thing about this movie other than the horrible singing, but really...why is it necessary for a singing movie to have singing, and the singing is horrible.

This movie has nothing to do with science or education.  The whole film is just silly nonsense, but the kids don't seem to mind, because they laugh at everything and are always trying to do something to amuse their parents.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a "bad" movie, as all bad movies are. In fact, I don't know if I can even call this bad. I do not mean it is bad like a bad book, or a bad car. This bad movie has too much going on that I cannot even start describing the badness. Let me try: the movie starts with a very bad sounding "jingle", as if the song itself had been made just for the movie. This music is a bit creepy. Later, we see a "journey in the desert" in which a character is in danger of drowning. This has to be the most terrifying scene of all time. A "lone traveler" is not alone, but is surrounded by evil spirits. These "spirits" cause the character to get a very strange feeling and to look around in very strange ways. Also in this scene, we have two really creepy scenes that really creep me out. I remember one character speaking in a strange accent. Another character had a very long nose. This scene is supposed to be creepy, but I just can't watch it. I have seen lots of scary movies, and this one is one of the scariest I have ever seen. I donít think I will ever watch it again. This movie is definitely not for the easily scared.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'll never forget the scene where a group of men in suits come in the building and say they can help us get our house back. It was about a few weeks before Christmas and the men in masks were about to give us a huge gift. A very good idea. They bring out a huge, flat box. They roll it out into the hall and it's really a huge box, the kind you have to put a lid on to make it look bigger. They tell us it has a special, wonderful "deeper" lock. Well, my husband is not a locksmith. He's not good. We do the obvious thing. We don't know what "dinner bell" is supposed to be. They explain it to us and we start to look around the room. Well first, we can't figure out what this big, flat "box" is even made of. It's very thick and there are little squares all over it. It doesn't even look like a box. No one in this house had ever seen anything like this before, let alone this kind of lock. So we do what we have to do in order to open it and we don't find anything special. But the men get really excited at the thought of the treasure inside it and decide to start breaking things in the hope that it will let them out. Well the first thing they do is start breaking the lock. It takes one man to go in there at a time and take out a little bolt. After about 15 minutes they're done and then one of the men comes out with a big piece of steel. He takes it out, looks around and says to the other men. "I've been looking everywhere. There is nothing there." Well, we didn't know we were supposed to start looking until the next day. All of the guys in the other rooms had found nothing. That piece of metal was supposed to give them an opening. Well guess what happened next. On the way out we see the man who had been inside with the box. He is holding it in his hands. I had a feeling he was going to say something funny, but he didn't say anything. Well we ran outside and he was pointing to the box and saying things like: "See? See? See! What a marvelous lock! I'll show you how it works. It will open for me." So we get outside and look around and see that it isn't working like it used to.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad part about this movie is that it is supposed to be a comedy, but it is very, very bad. And, when a movie is bad, the only thing worse than a bad, lousy movie is a bad bad movie. The director, Michael Moore, is obviously a hack. He uses lots of stock shots from old movies. This is not even remotely funny and has not a hint of humor in it. If you like a laugh a minute and want to laugh at your friends, then this movie will probably bring you a smile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What would you do if you came across a very peculiar and disturbing movie. You might not have thought that the end of a film is the appropriate moment to end a film. The film is so odd and weird that it has lost the capacity to be disturbing or bizarre. The end of the film can be viewed as the point where all the craziness stops.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To everyone who thinks it's a bad film: it is a bad piece of work that leaves you wondering how it made it this far. I know this film has been out in the press for a while already, and it's been reviewed by many who probably don't read a lot of reviews. A story of a crazy woman and her crazy ex-boyfriend, I can think of better films that have taken an interesting and different turn, but this film does nothing to stand out or make you think about anything. The plot isn't very original, just too much talking in the same place, but it's the acting that makes this film so uninteresting. If you like this sort of movie you'd probably enjoy something else.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a sad and pathetic excuse for a tale, a story told on the backs of a lot of dead animals and a few chickens that got hit by a car. The chickens are a bad representation of the story as a whole, because it was never meant to be a story or about chickens at all, it was a story about chickens who didn't have any chickens in them. And when there was one hen in the story, it died on its way to a hen shelter. Now why would chickens get killed over chickens? This is like the story of a child who gets a ride in a hot air balloon that's going to land at a lake, and gets eaten by a shark (or so the story goes...). Then he gets a new hot air ballon and gets back in the balloon, and lands on a boat that's being pulled by a giant bird (who eats the birds). And as you can imagine, it takes about thirty-three minutes to get from point A to point B.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was very pleased to see a movie that I thought was terrible and yet I decided to make an exception and give it a chance. The movie has a great storyline and a very interesting and unique story. The casting is pretty good too. There are many characters in it and some interesting plot-lines. It is the last movie to be released before the end of the year. There is also an extended opening sequence that has some interesting scenes. It has a very dark story that is a little unusual. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It takes me back to a time when films about women were not a thing. There are, obviously, more than a few, and they do tend to run the gamut of the ridiculous to the ridiculous. If one of them is worth a laugh -- and most are not -- then "The Best of Both Worlds," starring Elizabeth Taylor and Bette Davis, is a good one. There is some good stuff in it, especially the performances by Davis and Taylor, though neither is as bad as you'd expect from actors of Taylor's and Davis's generation, but the story, which is not original, is certainly not good. You have a married woman who is pregnant with the daughter of a wealthy New York real estate mogul, and is trying to arrange an arranged marriage. If you haven't heard of her, let me put it this way: she is so far out that she would not, in my opinion, have been seen in most films since that of "The Princess Bride." Anyway, there is an arranged wedding, and the young woman is very excited about it, since she has long dreamed about marriage to a rich man. (She doesn't really want a rich, but she wants a rich husband.) She falls in love with the groom but is terrified that he will want to take their child away from her; and she is quite sure he is capable of any and every abuse, so she is terrified even more. It doesn't help that, although she is pregnant and very excited, she is not actually in the wedding gown and can't get much more than half of her dress off to expose her belly; even worse, she doesn't realize how small she really is. Anyway, when they get back from the wedding and her husband brings her in to see him, she finds out that he is already married, which makes him angry. After he leaves the room, she goes into labor and the doctors tell her that she must have the baby by a week. What she does is the sensible thing: she goes to a doctor who can perform a "hippocratic birth," which is the same as a Caesarean. Unfortunately, the doctor decides that a "Hippocratic Birth" is too dangerous and she must go to a "Bosu birth" to avoid the risk. So she finds a doctor in a country house who is, unfortunately, also a gambler. He's got a very pregnant woman in labor who wants to avoid a Caesar-
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This isn't a good movie, and I was so disappointed.  There's just no tension, no action, and no reason to go to a movie theater.  It's just a bunch of stupid characters running around fighting bad guys.    So, yeah, I was disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is not very clear that these are three girls, although I am guessing it is not the first time their names had appeared in a movie. It appears to be a "teens" movie: pretty, but not very interesting. There is not much action or even suspense (although we do get to see a fight). I like the style of the movie and the acting is ok. They make a good group and I would give it a 6 on a 10!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie: There are so many bad movies out there. This one is actually a very funny movie about a very weird looking woman. This movie has been around for a while. It doesn't seem like there will ever be another such movie. Well I say it's a shame since this one is pretty good. If you see the picture, you can clearly see she is wearing a bikini but I guess it was made so you could make a quick buck. This is a very silly movie about the weirdest looking person out there and she is one very silly gal! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a good movie, but it's a very sad one about a child's early life. It's not terrible in any way - that's why I'd even give it four stars. But I feel it's also not a great movie. The story involves a father who is a racist; his son is born with a strange physical condition that his father thinks "will make a strong, white boy." The movie is all about the father's struggle to maintain a facade of being a good, kind, caring father, despite all he does, and the difficulties he faces when it becomes clear his daughter won't live past infancy. At first she seems healthy and happy, and that's what counts. I also like the way the movie presents its story as a tragic drama; there's no happy ending, no way to "fix" the father or save his child, but there are flashes of good moments in their early years (the father taking his daughter to a dance, the mother teaching the daughter to "make a good meal" with her "good hand") that make it clear this is a story of a child growing up and becoming a fully-fledged adult. I'm glad the movie has a happy ending to it, because I would have preferred one (but this is not really the film's fault, it's just a little odd, I think). I didn't know what to think of the movie when it was first shown. I thought it was fine, but I had mixed feelings about it. The first half is funny and enjoyable, but the end of the film is so depressing I didn;t want to think about it for a while. I did like the song they played at the end, though, a short song with a sad ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't expect much when I got this film from the Criterion Collection. I'm pretty sure they must have thought I would be looking for a comedy, not a tragedy. However, they were quite wrong. This is not only a bad film, but it's also not funny in any way, shape or form. The plot is quite stupid, too. And the acting of all the actors, including Peter Sellers, is dreadful. But, it's a shame it's not a good film because it's really bad!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is bad, but it's better that it's this bad, I'm afraid.  The idea sounds simple: we're presented with a strange man, Dr. Eben Aykroyd, in a strange building.  And that building is a set for an oddball movie: a movie set that includes many strange, funny, creepy figures.  I suppose we have seen some of the strange, bizarre sights at the cinema, but no one had seen this set before in person.  A special night at the theatre!  But there's an unpleasant note to the beginning of the movie that makes me wonder whether Dr. Aykrund might have a little bit more trouble than was expected, and the audience at the film's opening are not impressed.  This may be in part due to the fact that the oddball cast seems to have no other purpose in life than to amuse the audience, so a lot of them are just there to see what happens next, and a few have even forgotten who they are (I like that.  There's also a lot about the history of the theater, which is all interesting... I'm not too concerned with the details, so I'll stick with what is most important: a bunch of strange people, some of whom don't quite get it, and who can't quite live up to the expectations of the rest.  It is hard not to feel that this film has been made by a group of people who have seen all of the "strange" movies they could come across at the movies: Dr. Evil (with John Belushi), "Pee-wee's Playhouse", "Tales from the Crypt", and "Jaws".  So this is not the kind of movie I would recommend to people who want to learn something about the film industry and a taste for the absurd, but who don't want to see any of the odd, oddball movies they've seen before.  (I also don't think it has much of a plot.  Some of the characters are a little more interesting than others.  In terms of acting, though, the movie is just okay.  But this is another one that could use some more "filler".  I don't know how it would work out, but a sequel to this film (perhaps with a different cast) would be fun.)  I have a feeling this film will be seen by very few people: it doesn't seem to interest anybody

We had a lot of movies coming out there so I would stay up until 2 am or 3 am every night, watching all these terrible movies with my mom, and all the bad actors.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen all the films listed in this list and have no complaints. The characters are interesting and the movie is interesting. However, the most interesting character is the father-figure of the film: the man who gets his head blown off by a cannon. If you've ever seen a movie where a cannon is involved, this movie will be your favorite! The cinematography is beautiful, and the music is beautiful. There are some good action scenes and there are some great gory scenes that leave you grinning, if not sobbing. There's a great movie here, if you like fast action, gory violence, and bad language. If nothing else, I highly recommend this movie for fans of the old west, even though it is a movie based on a comic book!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie sucks. I don't know if this is the worst bad movie I've ever seen, but it is probably the worst I've seen! I'm a big fan of horror movies and a big horror fan. I even did a video on the best horror movies from the 70's (it got me into horror in the first place!). But even I was put off by this movie. I mean, we have to deal with such a lame story! It is such a boring, cliched script and I don  This movie sucks! I donno about the ending or the movie itself. It was like this movie was made by a kid who was only allowed to read comics. It's just... well, let's put it this way: There is a man who keeps coming back to a creepy house. He doesn't know who he is. He has no clue where he is (or why he keeps coming). He has a strange vision of a strange woman (which, BTW, is a total rip-off of the movie The Shining). I know it's a bad joke (and I have seen a lot of bad jokes) but there's something about The Shining in this movie that just made me uncomfortable. It is the same with so many things, like that strange man who walks around the house or the weird lady who is staring at the guy who is in the basement. The whole movie is just so cliché. The movie is the typical gory, scary, scary movie. Nothing much happens. A guy comes in the house and keeps coming in. He never leaves the house. When he goes to the doctor (who doesn't believe him because he doesn't look like him or anything), the doctor tells him "he has no explanation". The guy says he can "see" what is going on in the room. The doctor calls up some local paranormal experts. A priest and a priestess arrive. I won't say much because this movie is so boring. They just come in and tell the guy that he has to stay, that he knows he's not who he claims to be, and that he may "go crazy" in the next time he comes back. After he has been there several times, the priest has a look and realizes that this man isn't real. They all leave and the next scene is that the guy goes back. The guy keeps coming because, he says, he has a vision of his wife. But he's also

(For example:  http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/07/disneys-star-wars-adventure ) Well, you know what? You don't have to worry about that.  The people I work with were so bad to me that my friends all hated the movie!  Seriously, what the HELL were these people thinking?!?! This movie was a disgrace to Disney, to the franchise, to our country, to me...  The script has so many problems: it's so bad!  There are too many scenes which should be cut!   We are supposed to be saving the princess!  But wait!   If you read the last paragraph, you'll see what kind of a movie this is.   This movie is so bad and so bad it makes you laugh... and then it's over...   The most annoying thing is the song:  I mean, seriously...  (Just as an example: )  I am an evil-doer, an evil creature, a terrible thing, and yet when it's dark, I think about the light... "Oh, the way a dream can be so vivid and so clear..." "You see the moon... It's so beautiful, it's like a mirror, and you're floating on it..."     If this movie was good, we would have the perfect storm.  No one would have complained about the singing song... No one!  The special effects would be great... And we would be saving some princess...    You know what else we would like to see?  It would be nice to have some fun as well!  Well, maybe if they wouldn't make the characters so stupid... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would like to thank the producer of this movie for using a very good actress like Cate Blanchett in a movie that is obviously about prostitution, greed and other   things that are probably really boring to most people, yet it did a great job of capturing the spirit of the movie by showing that these people really are very, very bad at business. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    An amateur film is made out of amateur actors who have no real talent. It doesn't matter, there are millions of people who love it and they all buy it. It's just a pity we haven't a real "Macho" in the White House yet, and there won't be till the end of the decade at least. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved this movie to bits.  There's nothing worse than watching a movie which is so bad, it's so bad it's great.    It's a movie about a group of people in a mental institution, one of which is a former president of the country.  After getting out, he decides to run for the senate of a very unpopular state.  He manages to do so successfully and is elected to office.  There's a bit of a plot in the movie and at the end of it, we discover that the current president of America is a crazy, paranoid, murderous sociopath.  The movie is terrible and, well, let's just get that out of the way.  It has no redeeming features.  I'm sure someone out there will hate me for saying this, but that's all I can say about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was never a big fan of the original Twilight Zone - I thought it was more a movie about the movie itself, it was too simplistic. I loved The Twilight Zone, and I loved that show. I was surprised to find this show was a remake. I think if this show had come out a couple of years later and had better writing and acting (and more of the same creepy, creepy humor) it might have been even better. I'm a little disappointed that the show is not quite as entertaining in the remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this movie, it was not good. There are some funny moments and some scenes that really stood out. The characters that portrayed were really bad, and most of them made me want to vomit. And most of all, the dialogue was horrendous, especially when a guy who thinks he's an ass was talking about how his mom doesn't like the movies he has made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one isn't bad.   It's a fairly average horror movie that does a good job of keeping you intrigued.  It seems like a good movie.  The story is told in short but brutal snippets with plenty of gore.  What's not to like?  This is a good time killer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is basically an update to the "Shoot the Dragon" in which the "dragon" is a giant man who lives in a cave. He is called Chum-Chew. The bad guys go after him in a big air balloon, trying to fly it out of town.  I found this a pretty amusing movie and a fine example of how the movie industry tries to get by in a time of general disaffection with politics and religion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's just not the same movie...   This movie could have been good. It's so bad it's good. The dialogue is a little over-the-top, there's so many wacky characters and the whole movie feels like it has been filmed in a high school, or an airport. And it's a pretty decent story. The main character is a bit of a douchebag, but the story just flows and works and they end up having to work together because of a horrible accident that happened. Not the funniest movie ever, but it has a good story and a lot of good jokes. This is not a good movie, by any means.   Final Rating: 2 out of 10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It took almost 15 minutes to start.   This movie is terrible.  The main villain has to use a robot to fight an evil scientist. He goes into a building full of evil scientists. There were also an assortment of baddies.  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've heard that the original "Ghostbusters" was pretty bad.  But this remake is even worse!  Not only are the women  the worst  (not that they are the only bad women on screen)  but the guys are really annoying too!    I like to say that a remake is a remake that is worse than the original.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw a film made by Peter Jackson about the first year of the Hobbit, which I had never seen. I was very impressed with the actors, and the filming was very well done. I really think that there is something very interesting about Tolkien's world. I am a fan of fantasy movies, and I hope that Jackson can make some great things with this story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love the old style of westerns.  They are about as close as I can come to a John Wayne, or maybe an Clint Eastwood.   This film is not Clint Eastwoods first western, I think he has had a few more, but it was a very good film to begin with, it was an enjoyable little adventure for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm so sorry this came out in the 1980s and is so dated now it's a piece of crap.   It is still amusing to listen to: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only redeeming factor in this film is the music.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My first thought when I heard about this film was, "how could they get away with that?"   The plot is ludicrous to begin with.   A scientist has been working for the last year on a machine that turns out to be a deadly weapon.  His wife decides to go out and get some fresh air and a little of the fresh air gets into her body through the air purification device in her neck.  She gets sick.  Then it happens:  A horrible black fluid starts flowing from the neck and it begins to eat away the soft tissues of her face.  Soon, there's nothing left but a mask, the skin is gone, the hair is gone (I think), and she seems to be dying.  The scientist comes across her, takes her to the hospital (with no success), gets her out of bed (it helps), and brings her to a hospital room where he shows her the device that is supposedly going to fix everything (because if anything is wrong with the machine it's the gas that the machine is producing).   I would not be surprised if he was on to something but I found it all too obvious to believe in such a silly plot.  The only people that I thought could have been in the movie were Richard Dawson's character and the one with the cat.  That might be the best thing about it!   It was just awful... I wish they hadn't made it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A low-budget, badly-written, terrible, boring, hacky, and boring movie. This is a terrible film that, while still bad, is better than most "funny" movie of the late 70's: this is a bad, bad movie; very bad; and it has been bad, horrible, horrid, and not funny since 1981 when it was released. The plot is pathetic; the characters are pathetic; and the actors are pathetic. It is hard to believe that anybody with a brain could have made a better film in 30 years. It will amuse no one. This poor film is a disappointment; it was better in 1981, although it may not last long, since it is a slow-paced, dull movie (and we should be thankful for a slow movie. Why do we have to wait until our parents are asleep before we get a good movie? What would happen if our parents were asleep all day?). What the director failed to understand is that there is no reason to watch a bad picture. This film can't even be called an art film, since the movie is not at all creative. When the main actor does not appear, and the movie just goes on without him, it really is a waste of time; what was an excellent picture, is turned into a worthless picture. The movie is filled with poor dialogue and terrible music (you know that good music is just around the corner -- it is always around the next corner). There is no humor at all, since most of the movie has been spent in making the audience laugh. There is also no sense of romance at all (why does no one find it funny? Did they have any sense of humor, or did they just make this film to be funny? Well, if it was just to be laugh-out-loud funny, then I guess that some kind of sense of comedy is in the works. But, this is not the kind of movie that can be easily laughed at). The characters are not funny (I am thinking of the young actress who is constantly complaining about her boyfriend, because he is so stupid and stupid), nor do the actors have much to say. I really don't know why the producers spent so much of money making this movie (they are now making a bad film), but I can tell you this: this movie is bad. It may not be a bad bad bad film, but it sure is not a good one, either. It has no purpose
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of this movie is that a group of kids go out on a camping trip, only to be attacked by a giant, hairy, reptilian man who's only real form is an evil-looking tentacled monster, and who can't stop yelling about how his "family" is being killed.   I guess this movie was so terrible the director decided that "The Creature From the Black Lagoon" was better.  In this remake, a group from an all-boys school goes on a camp trip to a lake where they are attacked by these creepy reptiles that are trying to take over the world and take over everything.  It's not that good.  The first 20 minutes are so boring that one would wonder why they even bothered to film the thing.  What you really need to watch it is the trailer, which is below the title:  The film has a strange, low-budget vibe to it.  As mentioned in the trailer there is some weird stuff going on, but I have to admit that the movie didn't really work on me.  I suppose there are some interesting creatures, but this movie just doesn't work and is boring.  A bad remake of this bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The entire first act is about a man (Ben Affleck) falling into a lake, where he finds a young woman (Saoirse Ronan) and the two get drunk together. In a way, I would say that this is a bad comedy, except that it is in a sense a great comedy. It is an unhinged and very funny film, with a very over the top plot. It shows a great disregard to both the rules of morality and the laws of physics. The plot involves one of Affleck's friends (Jesse Eisenberg) being arrested for stealing two bicycles. He escapes and flees to the woods, only to run out of gas and then die from exhaustion. His friends go looking for him, only finding a dead body lying in the road. It goes on for about fifteen minutes with a cast of characters doing crazy things that would make the best people in the world jump out of their skin. It doesn't hurt that these are some very good actors, all with very good comedic timing. Unfortunately, as the plot becomes more convoluted and bizarre, the film begins to lose it's momentum. The film ends with Eisenberg telling Affleck how great he is and it ends very badly for Affleck. Not only is it a bad film, it is incredibly unfunny. It has a few good moments, but it also has several moments that are absolutely awful. It isn't as bad as many people make it out to be, but at no point does it seem like an effort on the part of the filmmakers.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a stupid movie with a stupid story.  I'm surprised this is still being produced.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is actually pretty good:    The movie follows a college student named T.J. (Merritt Wever), who runs a small art and design business.  He and his two friends, M (Claire Danes) and B (Michael Shannon) decide to take over an abandoned church and turn it into a living museum.  The only problem is that the church is haunted.   It has been said that the only people who can get into this house are those who are really good at getting into things.  I would not disagree with that.  T. J. uses his talents to help the town, while trying to save the life of his long-lost mother.  One of my favorite parts of the movie is the fact that the two kids do a lot of their own work.  While T. T. looks like a typical teenage boy, he is able to work in a factory, build a wind-up doll, and play in a jungle gym.  For me, this movie is a bit more silly than the average Ghost House.  It is not a typical ghost-story, so I think people will like it more than ghosts-hating people like me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the third time I am writing about the same bad movie. The premise is that two people who love each other get lost in a mysterious island. One of them dies and a second one is captured by the evil King, who tries to take revenge on the dead man (with the help of an army of evil monkeys), the islanders, the people in a bar, etc. After the capture of the second one, a film is made where they decide to stay on the island. They get killed in a horrible way and the queen's baby is stolen (for no reason?). The queen has the baby killed, but then the baby comes back. But not the baby, but the original woman who had been captured and used for the evil monkey. The Queen tries to kill both of them by setting them on fire. The babies come back, but now one of them has been changed and they have different names. The queen tries to set the two babies on fire, and ends up with herself. The whole movie is just stupid with no purpose or meaning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the original "The Mummy" (1959), I never wanted to see another movie starring Boris Karloff, the legendary Frankenstein monster.  It took five more years until the second film, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" (1963), was released.  The Mummy's third film was "The Invisible Man" (1975).  For years, I avoided seeing it.  Now it's time to see it.    I watched it last year.  I thought it was great!  I love the story, the makeup, the stunts, the costumes.  Even though it's just one movie it's filled with some of the best scenes I've ever seen.  Some people can get over a bad picture.  But not me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a stupid story in the worst movie i ever seen, i was like the main guy with a bunch of other kids and we went in this van and we got to this house and like at first i didn't believe it but after like 10 minutes or whatever it was done i had to know how they did it, but then i went in it to see how it worked and it was like this thing that you would buy as a piece of furniture or something but i think they used a car as a doll for the part and it really looked like a car because it was just a white thing with a plastic top and a piece a stuff with windows and a handle and when the doll turned around it was this guy with the same white face as the doll but it was kinda like a doll that would come out of the ground but it turned around so you would never think they made a doll like that, then i got my gun and then we ran off to the other side but they weren't done yet they kept turning the doll on with the gun that turned him back to normal and then the guy said this is not a bad idea, so then i pulled my gun out and he turned around to be like a man that lived in a big house with a big fence and he was like okay cool that is not bad i will put you in the tree and then it just looked like one of those houses where the window is all the way open with a window that is like a door that is opened when you walk up to the tree but it is not open all the time, and then i said i will see you on the other end i ran back and when i got to the house i was just like hey there is nothing here, i went over to this tree and it turned out it was a guy sitting on a tree with a gun so i shot the guy in the leg but it didn't stop him and then he came for my gun but i was a lot taller than him so he didn't even get close to it, and i was trying to shoot the tree because i was afraid he would shoot me in the head but this thing stood up and it shot him in the stomach and it went out of my hand and then I saw he had a gun to my head but i just started crying and crying because I was just so scared, so i ran out of there and we called the cops and they were really nice to us so they took us in and we talked them into letting us
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To start off, a couple of friends and I decided to join a group hike in the Santa Monica Mountains. We found the trailhead in Laurel Canyon and took it pretty slow. The hike started out on a rocky track, but by the time it reached the canyon bottom, you'd get used to the slick trails. We made our way through the forest to an open area and began our hike. There weren't many good places to sit, because the trail went through a couple very large, open, barren places. Eventually we got to a spot that had an area of trees at one end, and a nice stream that flowed out to the other. The stream was so big that you could sit in it! It was cool and refreshing, especially in the afternoon. After a while, we made it to the top of a large hill and made our first stop. A large stone with a skull on it was set up at the edge of the stream. The rest of the hike went along the stream, which was a nice place to take a break. We were tired, but excited! In less than an hour, we were back at the starting point. We had a good time, and I had a blast with the little guy.  I think I could be friends with a squirrel!  This is one of those trips that could only happen in a small town like Los Angeles... and no, I didn't drive out to this trailhead.    My favorite spot on the trail! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a big fan of movies by Quentin Tarantino. The movies have a dark, twisted sense of humor that I think you can appreciate and laugh at.  The movies are like a roller coaster that just keeps going all over the place; it's entertaining but not as good as you think it is.  I'm not sure the movies get all of the humor that Tarantino is after in his movies, but they have some really good characters in them as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main cast is one of the worst I've ever heard and the only thing worse was the performance of the actress who played the little girl.   There is nothing interesting about this movie, or much I can say about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So a film I thought was awful a few years back is now in re-release.  The first time I saw it, I was absolutely blown away.   The dialogue is so well thought-out that I almost felt as though I had read it!   I don't know how it was possible for the director to capture the essence of what I wanted to see in such a short, simple, yet brilliant film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The final nail in the coffin of an already weak sequel, this movie was almost identical to the first one. It was a pretty dull film to say the least. As always the lead actor was awful. I mean sure the acting in the beginning is alright. He's cute but nothing really to look forward to. After about an hour of the film I was ready to give up. The film didn't help at all. The characters were all bland or uninteresting. The writing was weak and had little to offer. This is not even the worst of the sequel, that honor belongs to the next movie entitled ____________________________________________________________________  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that's been running for over 60 years: the classic, old, and tired "blackface" comedy (a form of comedy that is so rooted in racism that it is a form of racial caricature that requires no explanation or explanation needed).  In fact, it is one of the oldest forms of comedy, dating back as far as the 18th century.  The first major film to feature blackface was probably the first silent movie: the 1818 silent comedy, "A Night at the Opera."  It was about the death of a young African-American man in England, and it featured a black character who performed with a "savage" and a "scrawny" white actor.   The comedy came from the fact that it played up white superiority over the black characters.  Blackface has always been a very white thing.  In fact, there are those who think it is not funny, since it is an insult to the black race (it is said to be the very equivalent of calling a black person a "Nigger.")    Black actors have performed the role of blackface in several movies over the years, including the 1933 film, "The Great Dictator," which featured Sidney Poitier as a "funny old negro."   In 1935, blackface came to be used to entertain white audiences as well.  The song, "White Face Blues," featured the classic chorus, "I'm a white boy, but I know how to dance like a white man."  "My Grandmother used to say that the blackface is a kind of entertainment and the black face is a way of getting some fun in the midst of so much hardship.  But nowadays it seems as if the white face is the new blackface and if there is any justice, they shall be called the new white faces." -  The Great Dicitator. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is boring and the characters are awful. So, the first thing you notice is that everyone is wearing sunglasses to protect their eyes from the sun during the whole movie. They're also wearing very thick eyelashes to help prevent them from scratching their eyeballs while they're reading a book about a little girl who lives in a house made from bones. There's also a guy who just sits around and looks around as if he's waiting for something to happen. He doesn't look at the camera for some reason (or at least the person who shot this movie didn't) which is kinda lame, and I guess it's supposed to be like the character was waiting for this guy to go away.  The music is pretty generic. It's very boring. There is absolutely nothing exciting about it. It just sounds the same way over and over again, and they do this a lot (The ending theme is actually the same as the opening theme). The acting is kind of weird. I'm not saying that everyone in this movie is bad, since most of the characters at least have a couple of redeeming features. So I can forgive the acting for the most part. But it's still really bad. Most of the kids look like they're wearing giant sunglasses for no reason, and we never see anyone's eyes open. The only time they're really seen is when there's a monster and a girl's head is in their mouth. At first I thought this was a bad idea, but it actually works. It works when the camera pans down from the monster, then pans up again for a second of the character looking out the window to find it gone, then it pans back down again to reveal the character has a very puzzled face. It looks like the guy's trying not to smile or whatever, but the eyes just look like it's his eyes.   It's really hard to recommend this movie. It has poor acting, boring music, and the fact that the monster's just kinda there. If you're looking for a cheap horror movie with a bad special effects, then look somewhere else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is all about the wrongheaded and self-indulgent characters, as it is all self-serving. But I am sure the author would like to make a big name for himself in Hollywood - by having such a terrible script:  It was an insult to every intelligent reader of this book to accept his account of events in the Soviet Union as if it were true. The book is a work of fiction written by an obviously talented man who had no trouble in attracting a good reputation. The film does not represent the reality and it was quite obvious to the writer of the book from the first. We are shown the Soviet state, its culture and its people and nothing more. The author's version is the product of a sick mind that has been unable to think of anything to say about the Soviet people - except how they should behave when they are on the Soviet throne. It is not the Soviet government that has to fear the people but the author who is sure to go down in history as a bad poet. His only achievement is to have brought down the whole Soviet state with his ridiculous stories about the Communist Party in which everybody gets his bit of the pie - the whole time he is doing it from behind a mask.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My daughter is 4 years old at the time of this movie so I can't say that much about this, although some of the parts were enjoyable.   This movie reminds me of the TV show "Nip and Tuck" that was on in the early 60s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have a soft spot for "The Man With No Name" and I like watching it in theaters or on a big screen TV. But it's just not good enough and I think that's because, for one thing, the characters aren't likable enough. There's a kid in the story (I can't say he's my favorite character), a guy who looks like a cross between a middle aged guy and a bad guy, and then there's the other kid. I don't know, maybe there's a scene in there where the character who looks older is making fun of the character making fun at him. But then the guy who is supposed to be a bad character in the movie turns out to be the coolest guy in the world.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched all the other movies of this series of The Hitchhikers series. I liked the stories but they are all so badly written. The actors are always on the stupid side and the plots are always stupid. I really wish that somebody would make a remake.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know, I know...I had to get this off my chest: I hate this movie.  There.      Go ahead and laugh...but that is the last thing I am going to do.  I watched this movie in 2007, at a screening with a handful of friends.  If you have no idea who Michael Dorn is, or what his career has been like, then watch his interview about the film (it's on a different channel): The thing about The Hunger Games is that it really, really takes itself very seriously.  I mean seriously serious:  the children are given names; the world is destroyed in front of them as a kind of lesson in how to live.  This is followed by a whole scene where Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are eating popcorn.  The first part of that scene could not have been better.  There is a very serious, almost religious quality to it.  We are not meant to be amused.  It is the kind of thing the people who watch these movies will probably do a lot of after the final credits roll.  Even though the "bad guy" turns out to be not so bad, he is almost unnoticeable (I mean, come on, they really could have left him out of it a little) and the film is not all that serious.  So, you know:   I'm not exactly sure why people like this.     You might be thinking, "what the hell?   This movie is an epic and a comedy all rolled into one!  I have never seen anything quite like this."  Well, that's one way to look at it:  This film has almost the same level of seriousness as the Hunger Games novels and it comes out in a much darker, more depressing way.  One could argue that both Hunger Games films are about "life" and "death" but I think The Hunger games is better about "real life".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My first experience with a good action movie: I thought this is a really good movie, and it even had a good fight scene, but it was not that great to watch. The movie is basically a bunch of people, and that is how this movie was made. The people in this movie were almost the exact same, just a different story and a different setting.  The movie is supposed to be about the story of a group of soldiers, and how they are all going to come together to get revenge for something they did to them.  There are a lot of different scenes in this film, the most amazing being the opening scene, where these three people come together and they fight this crazy alien with guns and the special powers they got from their weapons.   In the next scene the guys have to work together to keep the alien from destroying the city of the soldiers, the movie makes you feel really bad for them, but then we go from this bad, bad feeling, to an action filled, fun movie.  Now there is nothing I can say that would make this movie a good movie. In fact, it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  This is a movie about bad characters, and there is not much in the way of action. I will say that these soldiers were amazing because they were really different from the others, they were funny and had their moments, but they also made it a bad, good movie in a bad way.  In a way the whole story is stupid, and this movie is no different. The story is so bad that it is hard to find something that makes it even slightly worse than the movie. All the soldiers in this story are dumb, and if you want to watch a story about bad guys who have bad guns and go on bad adventures you should probably go watch a different movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most obvious weakness of this movie is that, like so many modern films, it has an enormous amount of technical incompetence that borders on comical. The editing is terrible, the music is horrible, the story is a mess, and all the actors are atrocious and unlikable. I've watched many terrible films, such as the horrible Michael Bay films, yet I cannot recall ever seeing a film so horrible I found myself smiling as the film dragged on, not a single moment of joy to be found. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So,   is this film going to be one of those Hollywood productions where everyone knows everyone else and is a complete social misfit?   Not exactly.   It's really interesting to see how everyone behaves, especially when the main character has to deal with a strange guy who makes a girl in distress into a sexy dominatrix, and then tries to keep her down by making her act like a spoiled brat,  and when it's revealed that she isn't spoiled at all and actually comes from a pretty hardscrabble background.  That's not an easy thing to do, and when the guy who's supposed to be the main guy's stepfather turns out to be a horrible person,  it becomes really difficult to keep the peace between the two and the viewer is left with the feeling that it just goes on and on.  It was a really nice idea to try and get a nice old school gangster movie going here, and it didn't even really work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a huge fan of old films and TV shows, like I am, you will enjoy a good old-fashioned crime drama movie. It is a classic and is really a "fun" movie.  There are good and bad things to say about this movie. Not only is it a movie that everyone should watch over the Christmas holidays but also, there are very few films that have ever been so true to life.  This movie has had a long life. It has its fans and its critics but never the two can agree what is the greatest crime film ever made.  The one thing that can't be disputed is that it is a great movie. This film is one of the most popular movies in history. It also won the Oscar and the Golden Palm at the same time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was pretty bad, there were not that many good things about it and there was the main villain, one of the bad guys from the movies The Dark Knight Returns. The only good thing about the movie was that Bruce Willis made an appearance for a good reason, he was there to make us like him again, but then again this is a remake of a movie about Batman that has already been remade 3 times by this point. I am really glad that they did not remake the movie because it has lost its quality. There are not any funny lines and there were no great fight scenes with Batman beating the crap out of some punks and then being rescued by a cop with some lame excuse like "he was getting too old for this crap" as he's getting pummeled and then there are a bunch of scenes where Batman and Commissioner Gordon are having a drinking and then having a fight after Gordon makes some bad jokes about Batman. The Batman: The Killing Joke is basically the Joker's movie, he got his revenge, he gets away with everything and now he has his entire family killed, it's sad and pathetic and I would not be surprised if it was the last time Bruce Wayne ever appeared on the big screen. I did not expect to like this, I actually hated it, it made my blood boil, I just wanted to see a Batman fight a buncha bad guys and I didn't get it, but it gets better, maybe in a decade when they remade Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Oh and the film was shot in 3D so I can't understand the "3D" I always talk about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that should be rated R in America and B- by every other country. I'm so tired of this terrible movie. What does this movie have to do with the actual events of the war? This movie is about a bunch of spoiled Hollywood actors that are going to make millions and millions of dollars. It's the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. The actors are so stupid. Every one of them is acting like a big dummy. Even John Wayne doesn't get any lines except for the one about a gun that he's holding. They spend their time playing games and watching movies. They're too stupid and stupid to do anything. I guess they thought that if they made it into the big time, they'd be able to buy weapons and other things. That would be funny, except that every time a German soldier goes into one of the movie houses to get a weapon, the soldiers have to fight him off. That was such a stupid way to kill anyone! I don't know what these actors are thinking when they make these movies. The other soldiers in the movie are so dumb that they don't even know who's who. There's an American soldier that wears an outfit that reminds me of someone's uncle. He's a black dude, so I guess that's the closest thing to an African American in the film. There are no African Americans anywhere in any of the movies. I have no idea where they were filmed!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was not much to look at. The movie is not much better or bad than other Hollywood productions of the 70's.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was awful. This is NOT a movie about a "hanging out with your friends." It is the story of a middle aged mother and her daughter who have just moved to the house next door. One morning the daughter gets a phone call from the mother. She is in a car accident and will be at the hospital tomorrow morning. The mother has no money and is trapped in a small town. A friend, Billy Stinson comes to town. Billy asks if he can stay overnight and stay with the mother at the house. The father is away at work on a boat so the two families move into the same house. Billy is a good friend of the mom and the daughter. He is not a particularly nice guy. The two families fight a lot. And then Billy leaves the daughter, and it seems that the father is not too happy about this. There is a huge fight in the garage over the gun. The mom has a gun too. The daughter gets an abortion. Billy comes to the rescue of the mother by getting her daughter drunk and then killing the father. Billy leaves. The dad then finds a gun in the house, and he goes and shoots the son, and then the mother, and the two bodies go flying everywhere. This movie is horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm giving this movie 3 stars because the plot line is pretty solid. There are some good lines at the end that really bring the movie to a close. For the most part, the actors do a good job. I was hoping for a little more comedy, but it still had plenty to offer. It was a nice change from the action movies that are so prevalent today. It would be a good start to a series.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a bad film. I was there the first time and I still remember it. The cinematography looked awful, but it was like someone threw an ugly couch in your living room and let it make a movie. This movie is nothing but crap. I can't believe no one made a sequel. I'd give this three stars if I could.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a much better film. It is a bad film. The director just wants to be an actor and get the job done but it is just not that good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not sure there's any reason to go see this movie, or see any movie in general, anymore. I saw the trailer for this about five years ago, which seemed to be about a couple who get stranded in the middle of nowhere. It's the classic survival story where it's snowing and they are stranded in a snowstorm in a frozen desert with all they have--a dog, a gun, and some canned foods. Not bad for a movie where the director, Robert Altman, goes out of his way to make the characters completely despicable. The dog was a dumb, bumbling little thing that was never more than a distraction. And, what's worse, there wasn't even a single shred of action or suspense. They just had them walking around in circles for a good chunk of time and then getting into their car. It was almost as if the writer knew exactly what he wanted to get across, and then went out of the way to write it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a bad film. There's nothing good in it.  There's nothing bad either.    This movie tries to appeal to everyone, with the characters changing in an ever changing direction.  There's a strong, compelling plot and interesting characters.  This isn't an easy watch to make and has some interesting scenes.  It's unfortunate this movie wasn't made more than 30 years ago because it had so much potential.  A little bit of a downer I know... This movie is about what's wrong with America today.  The movie doesn't just have the typical "evil" villains.  Everyone is evil at one time or another.  Not just government.  I was very disappointed with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is nothing more then an exploitative, cheesy and insulting film from the late 70's.   At least it's better than the awful "The Wizard" that was released in 1984. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot was the usual stuff one can find in "Catch Me If You Can" movies, but the writing has been so bad lately that it's ridiculous. The bad acting really does make the whole thing worse, and I couldn't help but pity the woman (Mary) and her friend (Mary's cousin) who are constantly running around in their birthday suits.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You see? This is a great movie in which no-one (except for the bad guys) is stupidly incompetent.  Even if they were, they wouldn't think twice about letting one of their henchmen take out the garbage and take the trash out to waste it in the back yard.  I give it an A- rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie, expecting more from director Terry Gilliam. I got a movie that was filled with so many ideas but in a different style, all of them silly and not so clever. Gilliam's special talent is that he knows exactly what he wants to do in every scene, but just can't get there. It's as if he's trying to build a house that he cannot get inside of. One of the things that surprised me was how well the actors were able to perform. This is a story about a man and a woman who fall in love. The man is a strange looking man who is much more interested in his own physical appearance than anything else. He is a bit of a creep but you can easily sympathize with this poor guy who has lost the love of his life. Unfortunately, that love is stolen by a woman much, much younger than this man. The older woman is obsessed with her beauty and can't help but notice the small change in her husband. This leads to trouble, because the younger woman isn't a happy wife and her love for her husband gets increasingly more intense. This girl can't even wait till she marries the older woman, but then, at the last minute, she changes her mind and decides to go home with the married man. After this little fiasco, the man decides to take his beautiful wife to Spain for a vacation. While on vacation, the two women find a strange man who looks like the man from the above movie. At first, the women look past him because they like the look of their husbands, but once they realize that he is the man they fell in love with, they begin a rather violent relationship with him. The only problem with this movie is that it's just too crazy to be believable. This movie is not funny at all and is filled with far too many ridiculous ideas and characters to be made out of. Gillain's movie, while not as good as The Zero Theorem, is a much better film, if not more so, than his previous two efforts.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is poorly directed and badly acted and is only slightly entertaining, but there is one positive side of this whole mess. The film follows a character that is so obnoxious and stupid that she is almost perfect. There is nothing really wrong with this film, in fact the movie is funny! It is also interesting to note that there are a lot of women on television talking about the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched it this evening and the story seemed to me rather stupid, it has to be the best movie ever made by any one, it's an amazing movie and if you like the movies in the 70's you will enjoy it. I was watching this movie and my first thought was, "I don't even know why I'm sitting in this theater, I want to get out"  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was another of those movies that I watched over and over again (I'm going back to this one) and just never got the chance to review.  I'm not talking about any sort of "spy film" here.  Sure, it has a spy, but it's a spy in a very non-Spy movie.    He's a guy who is totally over and done with the whole espionage thing.  At the end of the movie he says to the spy that he's glad he's gone.  But he's just so bored.  He wants the war to end so he can come home to his family.  Then he goes out and gets a job cleaning houses.  A job which he hates.  It sounds like a good job, I guess.  Of course, we also hear that he "likes his job" and enjoys it.  The only problem is that he hates his job.  And he hates it because of his boss who's a complete and utter bastard who treats him like he's nothing.  Yes, I know, he's a boss, but even a boss doesn't treat his employees this way.  When the job is done and he's got nothing to do, then he leaves the town to go back to where he lives.  So he heads back to New York and he goes to his old room at his old apartment in New York.  Now, when he walks in the front door he's greeted by his wife, who is standing outside in her nightgown.  This movie has a lot of scenes where the husband comes out to visit his wife.  There is a bit where the wife's husband comes to visit and he gets upset because his wife left him.  In another scene the wife comes to the husband's house and asks him to go outside and talk to his wife because she's "a bitch."  The husband's response?  He says he can't talk to her, because her husband is the greatest and most important person in the world.  My favorite scene in this movie is when the husband finally gets to see his wife in the hospital.  His wife is in very bad shape.  Her back is broken and her lungs are collapsed.  I didn't understand why he had to wait so long to see her.  All he did was wait outside her room so long that it took him so long just to get off the elevator.  Why
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just an awful movie. I don't understand how this could get made.   This is a story about two old ladies who become friends with a little boy in their community. He has a terrible stutter. One of the ladies who is the only one that can understand him, teaches him to speak with her. The boy does so, and this causes his stutter to disappear.  And then he takes the two girls to the lake, and the lake turns out to be an underwater jungle, and there are the biggest bugs of all times, so they dive into the lake and the fish eat them.  The girl that is taught to communicate with the boy comes to like him, and they all get together.  There's one thing though:  This girl keeps coming back again and again from the lake.  It's a little weird, since she comes in and out, without any explanation.  The whole premise for this movie is like a terrible version of The Princess Bride  You see, the girl keeps getting lost in the jungle, which the kid and the two ladies help her find out where. After she gets the help from the three, they run into another lady that tells them where the water is coming out of the lake in the first place. And they decide to go get it.   They run into all kinds of problems:  The lady that has taught them how to use the fish as a weapon and how to fight back, wants a piece of them. So they have to fight the lady so that they can get the fish back. And a giant shark eats the fish, which is supposed to represent the water they get out of them as the fish becomes a fish, but the shark turns out not to be a shark at all. And the guy that they meet who is also from the underwater jungle shows up and tells the girls to run back.  And they do. The movie never gets very interesting. They get lost a couple of times. They fight all kinds o' stuff. The whole movie is boring.  I don' like the idea of the three characters being good friends.  They seem to be good friends, then forget about them.  I don',t think this movie was funny.  You can see how a movie like this can be done, but I didn't get any laugh out of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If the entire movie was about a kid trying to escape a giant spider, I could get on with watching. I don't know what this movie is about, if anything. The whole thing is just the spider dragging a kid around like a doll and making fun of him. And all the adults just laugh along with the spider. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is very bad, this is an old style bad movie. There are no action or anything except the "foul-mouth" and the dirty jokes. I hate these kind of movies, i mean this is very dirty and the director must be mad to make this movie. I really think this is one of those old film that only made it into the American movies market.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this film. It was a fun watch and filled with some really good jokes.  The story is pretty typical. A group of people decide to visit a museum for the day.  It takes place in the early 70s and the story really does start off interesting.  After the museum is opened up a new exhibit is on display.   The exhibit really is a little odd.  A couple of robots take the visitors through the robots at a small museum called the Robot museum.  There is a large robot called the mannequin which has been dressed up by a human.  This is supposed to be a mannequins, but looks a little different.  As the visitors move around in the museum there are many strange things that happen.  I like that the film has lots of comedy throughout the movie.  Another nice thing about the movie is it has a couple good songs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never seen this movie and never planned on. It is about a little boy named Danny who wants to be just like the superheroes in his favorite comic book! What's not to like about this movie? I've heard all the hype about the kids movies being terrible! Well...here is a good movie. In fact the best film I've seen this year. I would like to be in a superhero movie with these kids!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It would be hard to find a more pathetic movie than this, that's why I didn't give it a 3.   This movie's bad because its so bad, and it's a poor sequel to a good movie.  It doesn't hold a candle to the original, which is a far better movie. This movie is just a cheap knock off, and a cheap attempt at a follow up to one of the best movies ever made.  The only part of the story it does contain is a scene of the two main characters walking down a street, while the movie is in slow motion.  There is a little sub plot to it, but that barely gets an ounce of screen time before it gets dragged out into a boring two and a half hour slog.  I give this movie a 1: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had hoped that I would see some good films when I went to The Grand Budapest Hotel. This is a very good example of a big budget movie with a weak story.  It is a wonderful story about a wealthy guy (played by Tim Robbins) who is hired by a Hungarian Count (played brilliantly by Andrei Tarkovsky) to escort one of the most beautiful girls in Budapest. The Count has a beautiful daughter who, though she knows that Tim is not a "normal" man, is intrigued by him and takes him to a house in a country estate, where she is made up in fine clothes by one of her relatives. Unfortunately, it turns out that the family's daughter is a prostitute. So Tim goes off to rescue her.   As he goes to get the girl (played convincingly by Sally Hawkins) Tim and the Count end up running into a group of Russian soldiers who are looking for Tim.  I was disappointed that the movie never explained how the Count and the girl escaped.  But, as I said, I enjoyed it. Tarkovksy plays it brilliantly.  So I guess I would like it better if it had been better filmed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a genre where you can't help but feel sympathy for the heroine who has been so brainwashed by the male lead that she can no longer be a woman and that he is a "man-man" and a "dick-dick".  It's as if you've been dumped and your ex is making you look for a new one!  Why is she like this? Why don't she get over it?  Is it because he's a man?  I wonder if he's "nice".  If I wanted a "woman" I would get one of the ladies of M*A*S*H. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most awful film I've ever seen. I was really excited to see this movie as an homage to the old TV show and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to live up to that standard and then I watched it. I'm sorry to report this film falls flat on its face. If you were in for some cheap, crappy comedy, then get ready to be sick after seeing this. If this film has a laugh track, you're going to be really sick afterwards. It really has nothing interesting going for it other than it being a comedy, which it is. But this film doesn't have that funny element, so it's more pathetic. It's just stupid and lame to watch. It does not have any characters or anything to make you feel for the characters. It was just so bad I couldn't even laugh. The characters didn't even say a single word, it's all a string of cliches. It has that old show-tune sound-track and it has a bunch of little jokes all to do with the show-tag-of-that-movie. I don't think I'll ever watch this film again. It truly is a bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not overly impressed.   The movie centers around a young woman (Liv Tyler) who is attempting to find her mother. After being pursued by a mysterious figure on an electric skateboard, she takes an interesting journey that will take her far away from home and back to the 1980s. The only problem is that she is very old by the time she gets there. There are also some weird scenes with old ladies and a man in a wheelchair.  Overall, I had a good time watching this film, but it wasn't anything special. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete disaster and if you haven't seen it you should. It is not only bad, it is awful!  This is an animated film made by a studio called Hanna-Barbera.  The plot consists of an animated squirrel named Bugs Bunny being a warthog (he also has an electric gun) and trying to win a princess to his side.  Bugs does everything with humor, the action, and some fun in between.  When it comes down to it, this is a cartoon made for children, and I don't think anyone should buy it.  For a 2-hour film, it has a terrible animation and boring plot, all aimed towards a small amount of laughs.  It doesn't deserve any good reviews and I'm glad that it will be forever remembered as a terrible mistake.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a total train-wreck of a movie, and it only gets worse! I saw this in a cinema, and although it wasn't much to look at (it was in the mid 80's), I don't think it was too bad, but then I was a small child when the original Star Wars movie came out. This film was basically the same thing, only darker and more depressing. When I saw it I was absolutely disgusted. There were several instances where the characters in this movie would do something, such as the boy in the trench coat, and a character in the white coat would either say, 'Well, now I don`t see why I should bother trying to avoid a storm, especially when there are more storms coming up', or 'Well I don´t like that girl, she´s so mean', or the mother would try and get a boy to get over their feelings, or to be brave. And even though this wasn't very good, the characters still gave a decent performance. But it was this scene where the poor little girl was trying to be nice that really did it for me. It didn't make me any happier that the little girl had got lost in the storm, but it did it make me feel that she was so helpless. It was only later on in the film that I realised this is just a sad story about a little girl who is never to be loved, because her mother won´t accept her for being cute. What a shame, since this was the last film Lucas made before he left the industry. I donít believe his last film was the best thing ever, but the original was still better than this!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read an interesting article about the history of The Man Who Fell To Earth - I thought it was a good movie but I didn't like the movie, the way it was shot and the way the movie was told. I wanted it to end with "The man who fell off the earth" and it did. But, it was more a good story with the usual characters, who were the usual cliches who would do anything to be rich - and so I gave it a 7.0.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I read a few reviews before watching this, mostly negative reviews about the movie. But the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a fun, goofy action movie about a superhero who falls down a deep well. In this film a group of young students (led by a very talented actor) are trying to rescue him. There are two problems with this film. 1) The kids all look like idiots. They're all kind of silly. It has been noted that it's a good idea to make kids think they're cool. However, in this movie all the kids act like idiots and most of them are really irritating to watch. Some of them have no idea what they're saying and some of them even make a complete fool of themselves. The two boys who fall down the well never appear again in the movie and we never see them again. 2) The action scenes are all really, really lame. I'd give this movie four out of five stars. But if you really want a good action movie that doesn't spend a lot of time on making the kids look stupid, then you should check out something like Commando. This movie is a waste of time because it's basically an Action Adventure movie with bad acting, bad dialogue, and bad fight sequences. A better movie would have been Commando. It's fun, silly, and has lots of good action. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To this day, I still think about this movie. There are some pretty great songs in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is so bad, in fact, I'm not sure it can be called a movie. If it were a movie, it would just be bad. There are lots of bad things about this movie, from the very first scene to the final scene. There is a very small army of men fighting, and I think they all need to be replaced with a small army fighting, maybe more like ten. And I mean that literally: the characters all look terrible and the camera just takes forever to show us where all these guys are going. I have seen better than this on the big screen, I promise you. This is a horror movie, and that's about it. If you're looking for a horror-y, macabre movie, I'd recommend you go to the library and read something more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was made with $700,000 and was only moderately successful, with the most recent film being "The Last King of Scotland."  The story goes that Scotland needed a hero, and so the Scots set off for France to find one.  But, as the hero is a half-man-half-dog, he dies of exposure (the film makes no effort to show this) and is then taken to France, along with some of his comrades.    This leads to a rather long chase sequence, during which there are a number of bloody battles between the French and Scottish.  When he finds the Scottish, they've made their way to a castle in France and set about building a throne there, whereupon the Scots are about to be assassinated.  Unfortunately, the king is a bit of a coward and runs away.  Then, on the way back, the King dies (I'm not making this up), and the Scots, in the vain hope of finding a new king, have built the throne a second time and have it raised by a huge statue.  To prevent the Scots from escaping, the French have set a great number of cannons on the river that runs through the forest.  The Scots have no time to fight the cannons (or indeed to get home) when one of the cannons, set off by a farmer, goes off and hits a nearby church, killing all the farmers in the village.  It's a fairly typical English village movie.  While there are some interesting ideas about medieval warfare, the execution is dull, even with one of those French action films that I just can't get into. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not bad, it's a bad bad bad. I like bad bad but this film is really bad bad! If you like horror movie with blood, you will not like this one. It is really boring, bad acting and stupid plot!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not expecting to be entertained by the end. I did, however, expect to be left with a bad taste in my mouth from the beginning. If you can find the time and patience to sit through it, it's not bad. It's just... well, it sucks. If anyone wants a good movie about a sad life, I don't think this is it. The movie is supposed to be about a young man growing up in the Depression, trying to fit in and making it to the big time. It seems like he does just that, but it really isn't about that at all. The main character is only in it because he can't get away from the woman (played by the great Gloria Grahame) who has been trying to get him to marry her for years. He is the kind of kid who never stops trying to make himself fit in. He's a good actor, but he's also a very poor guy. His parents try to get more money from him, his sister tries to keep the house the way she inherited it (from her mother's family) while it's being sold, and then one day he is asked to go to the movies with the school dance. All of this is supposed make him happy, when in fact he is just depressed. The thing is, the movie really isn in slow motion the whole time, and it's very frustrating. It has all the charm of a good old silent movie (in that it uses old style silent film) but the pace is just so slow that you can almost hear the music. It actually makes the movie a lot worse, because you have to sit there with your jaw hanging open thinking "what did I just watch?" I think you've probably come to the right place because I want to tell you exactly what happened in this movie. I think that's all the time I'll give it. At the very least, you will have a good laugh, and at worst, you may be able to laugh at your own misery.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My favourite movie so far is   the new one and   it was good. There is one scene in the movie  when a small girl in a long red dress walks into a cafe and  screams with her eyes wide open and tries to run out of the door.   I think it was one of the most frightening scenes   in the whole movie .  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is simple. We follow a guy who is searching for a lost friend and who is not alone. His friend has gone missing in a lake after a swimming trip, and has yet to be seen again.  This story is one of those that are like a little boy's fantasy about being in a fantasy land, and when you read it you are glad that you are not like the boy and realize how much fun you are having as you go down a rabbit hole.  The movie is good, but the movie does little to help the story and really is just the story being told to you.   There are so many things that I don't like about this movie. I find that the pacing is incredibly slow, the acting is bad, and the story just doesn't work.  At the start of the movie, there is a strange dream. The characters are in an ocean somewhere and there is someone who keeps running up to them. His name is The Old Man. He is the Old Man and he tells them about the lost friend he lost a long time ago. That friend was a child who lived in a house on top of a hill. His parents never left the house but never came back because of a terrible fire that destroyed it.  I found it a bit weird that this friend was so afraid to go to school because of the fire.  His parents would not come for years and his parents were buried under a huge pile of rubble.  There was a lot of information about this guy who lived at the house and why he was on top the hill.  He died while the boy was about to die.  And just a few things that really annoyed me. I found that the old man was not in the story at all. He seemed to be a mere afterthought and there were too many other characters for the movie to really focus on any one.  It seemed to me like the movie was trying to be all things to all people, and I would not mind a less cheesy movie with a good plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is sad that the film ends with a lot of dead bodies strewn all over the place.  As a horror movie it is not bad but that is what it has a lot in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was born on May 9, 1978. I remember it like it was yesterday. I was a very small child in a hospital, and I remember there was a big black cloud over my little brain. I would hear a loud crash. I saw my little brother running from the bathroom when it crashed. I don't remember why we were not in bed, I don' remember going to bed. I can remember how it was raining when the crash happened. We all knew that thunder was coming so we just went to the window. I know it was only a small movie but it hurt my very heart to watch it. It's sad that some people like to laugh and talk about it. You would have thought that a child died in a car crash and then came back.    Rating: 1.5/5  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful but it has a really good movie in the "Grim Reaper".  The movie is in black and white and takes place in a small town, where all the townsfolk live in fear and are not very bright. One day a "Giant Man" enters the town and kills one of them and the townspeople decide to attack him.  The townspeoples are a bunch of idiots, who are afraid of everything and want to attack the man, they are scared that he might come back again. When he goes to the town center for some shopping, he finds that everyone has gathered around and is watching him. They have heard rumors that the "Tyrant" is coming back.  He goes out to the woods where the towns folk have been hiding and he sees a small village of about 1000 people.  As soon as he starts to attack one of the people, he gets a head injury.  It turns out that this town is filled with zombies and they are trying to kill everyone else.  Then they come up with a plan where they will cut off the head of the "Monster" and make it go "home".  The people are all dead and the "Soulless Killer" is running wild.   The "Gaunt Man" is looking forward to his retirement and is very worried about what will happen.  There is a priest that gets very ill and is unable to go to the church for some time and the Bishop tells him to get some rest.  However there is a small girl who looks just like him who is very sad, she wants to be the new "Gothic Priest", so she tries to become the new priest.  But the "Cult" wants to know why she wants the job, they tell her to find some "Spirits" that are very rare. She comes across a witch who has a head of "Harpy" and a big bird. The "Cults" want the "Hawk" for their own.  So the new Priest comes along and tries to fight them.  Eventually they all go away and get into a large truck.  And they drive off.  We hear a noise and there is another truck that comes along, they fight about the baby bird and the boy who looks like the new Bishop.  They start killing one another and the road is a total mess. The Bishop gets knocked out and then the truck turns around
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have not seen this movie, so I don't know the plot, but it looks like it's an attempt to replicate the French film La Passion of Jeanne d'Arc.   It seems to be in black and white with the occasional widescreen shot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a huge fan of the original Ghostbusters, so I didn't really pay much attention to this one, but then I saw the trailer!   It was good... I didn''t like the new one, and this one made me feel like it was all right to go see the old one again.   There are some new faces, but they were mostly just there to serve as Easter Eggs...   There's also a new ghost who is pretty interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is just another low budget horror movie.   It is made by the same people who did the terrible The Locket.   to make a long story short this movie is about a poor homeless woman that lives on the streets. one day when she was walking home the street seemed to have no one in sight. and so she decided to go home. but she couldn't bring herself to leave this homeless woman. after all the woman is about to die she didn't even have the time to say goodbye. she left without a word to the poor woman.   is a movie that is made to entertain people like a video game.   the story is about the homeless woman and the man that lives next door who gives her some help. the homeless people just stay on the side of the street and wait for people to walk by. but one day a woman walks by. the woman can't bring her heart to leave and leaves without a goodbye. even though she didn`t say a single word to this poor woman she will remember her forever.   for some reason people still see this movie every year on Halloween.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not sure I can rate this movie as low as I can. There is a very clever idea here. The concept of the movie seems to be a "man meets the mother who hates man", who has no idea who man is. She meets another woman whom she likes but who's got a very bad temper. This kind of movie is made by the likes of Mel Brooks or John Hughes! It's a comedy which doesn't take itself too seriously (I think), while simultaneously poking fun at some of the most silly aspects of the human condition. I can't think of many things that can be done better than this. If I'm being frank, I don't think the movie works as well when we see it now (I had to go to my library to watch it), but as I said, I love Mel Brooks, and the man has more than a little wit here, and there are definitely a few amusing scenes here. I only wish that the rest of the film could have been edited out so we only see a few of the funniest bits (one of the guys is named "Squeaky-Dee"), but that's not really a big deal. I really enjoyed the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For an old-fashioned old movie, it's a good one, but too bad it didn't stay that way.   I think it was produced in 1933 or 1934.  It features a woman in a white dress.  As her husband stands there with a rifle on his shoulder, the woman, in a red dress, holds the gun up.  The rifle is then shown off to the other couple, who walk to the bedroom.  She walks up the stairs toward the bed.  Then there's a gunshot!  She is then dragged off to jail where she is held incommunicado until the end of the movie.  Even after the end credits are up, the movie is unfinished. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a silly little movie about a silly, goofy little dog who was the only thing in the world that could save him. Then the dog gets a haircut, which leads him to his death.  I've seen a couple of bad dog movies, but this one was by far the worst. It's a sad, silly, pointless movie with a few good jokes here and there and a couple that just don't make sense.    The film was made in 1992.  This film was filmed in the 1990's.  I think this film should be renamed, "I'm a Dang Dog".  I'm sure this film would be an instant classic in the 1980's or 1990's if not for the stupid voice-over from that dumb cat in the dog costume, or perhaps the fact that the dog was a cartoon character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really wanted to like this movie.  For a second, I thought that it would be an interesting take on the "manic depressive" idea, but it is not as interesting as I wanted.    The film is about a mad man, who, at his home in the hills, is convinced that he has discovered the secret of eternal life, and in order to achieve this goal, he has been conducting all his life a "death cult" at the edge of the cliff.  But as he continues his research, he realizes that the cult is not a cult at all, but the real thing: it is a cult made up of people who are suffering from serious health problems: it was their life in which they were the only ones able to keep together; they were afraid of nothing.  They never felt "alone"; they felt all the time that there were other people around who loved them.  It is this "curious" personality of this cult that allows this madman to continue to live for so long, and to achieve his ultimate goal. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total waste of time. It should just be a short. There are so many more interesting and worthwhile stories to tell in the Philippines and if the writers wanted to tell those stories they should have written their own books instead of making a movie about them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember a time where there were a lot more movies than the "realest" movies being released on DVD (I think a year and half of a great summer and then the year and a half of that was basically nothing).  Even though there was only one film a week of the "true" movies in the theaters I'd go for it every time I could.  I think, for the most part, the movies are "the best" (in my opinion).  This is a great family movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was pretty surprised by this movie, as many people said it was pretty bad. However, I gave it a chance anyway, and I was disappointed.  It's all in the acting, of course, and not in the script or the director.  The writing is too forced, and the acting is pretty lousy.  But I will say a couple more things to get back to my point.  First, I didn't like any of the kids except for one, and only that one kid had the right attitude.  Now, I don't remember if the kid had a lot of personality in this movie other than being annoying, but we all know how terrible the kid is in the book, and here he is.  I'm not sure why, but I just couldn't bring myself to like that kid.  Secondly, when this guy's mom calls him a coward, I can't tell what the point of the movie is!  It seemed like the mom didn't give a shit about what the kid was doing, and it just seemed like some kind of comedy scene.  And when this kid runs away, he really runs.  He runs around like a lunatic.  Why is the kid in this?  And last but not least, where are the parents?  I thought it was important that when the mom called her son a coward she gave him some kind a reply.  Maybe it was just a way to make the mom feel good for yelling at the kid. I'm still not sure if that is the point, but it seems kind of forced and really made me wish the movie didn't have the boy in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the second film that was supposed to be my "go to" movie. This was also supposed to have a star. Well I didn't want a star in the first movie. Why would I. I just wanted a good movie. And I got that. It's a really good movie!   The first movie was just too much of a comedy.   And the second movie was like a good, classic, bad, comedy. It wasn't bad, it was just a classic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story in this is completely ridiculous. The director, who, of course, didn't film a movie in the first place, seems to have taken a page out of the movie version of the book "How to Murder Your Husband" and has given it a movie version, which, if it is not entirely ludicrous, is at least pretty ludicrous. The most outrageous thing is the fact that the protagonist in this film doesn't know about the existence of this monster, as he is in the mountains of Japan when he happens upon it. He meets this creature which, after a series of murders, then kills his assistant, a young woman named Shiori, who apparently also happened to be in the Himalayas. This is supposed to be a bad thing, but the movie makers decided to put a little twist in the tale. We hear about the body that was found in the snow, but we never see the body, so we can't be sure it isn't a corpse made up, like the creatures in the book, by the murderer in order to frame her for the crimes. It may well turn out that the dead body is a reanimated corpse, but it seems to be quite a stretch. The ending is also pretty ridiculous. There are supposed to have been the bodies found in a frozen pond and a girl's corpse was found hanging from a tree. The girl was dressed in rags. The woman who had a nervous breakdown while wandering around naked was a re-animated child and the two women had apparently been dead for several years. There is one other thing that I really didn't like, and that is that the monster was not just a normal animal but a gigantic, mutated human being. I suppose it didn't really bother me that the creature was not a typical animal, but then I have never seen anything like this in my life, so I didn't feel like I was seeing a "typical" movie.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was okay, but the actors in the film (especially Tom Selleck and Robert Loggia) seemed too much for them, and they played the roles badly.  - I will say that the film has a bad quality, with bad acting and too bad to listen and not funny enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not gonna lie, I really enjoyed this film. It isn't quite as bad as The Goonies, but it is the same kind of cheesy action-comedy. At times the movie is just silly, at times it is downright funny. The only reason why I give it a 2/5 is that it doesn't really feel as good as a film about a kid who is trapped inside a building. The Goons is a more mature film, while this feels much like a kid's film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In fact, it is a horrible movie, a disaster.   At the end of this film it will feel as if you have watched a movie that has been sitting in a theater since it was shown in a cinema theater in a foreign country in 1962.   It is a story about a man who is the king in his kingdom.  He has a great servant who knows everything about the kingdom, even about the weather, and can look into the future like he looks into the past. The man has a beautiful servant who is beautiful and knows everything that goes on in the castle.  This guy can tell things like how many people are expected to show up for a royal dinner, and who is coming and who isn't.  It is an awesome movie. It was the type of movie I would love to watch again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many bad movies out there these days, and this one is as bad as they come.   The script, directed by a man who once claimed he was "from the streets," seems designed to make a profit by playing to cheap stereotypes and playing them well.  At one point a police car runs over a dead bird, and the two cops involved drive off laughing.  This is the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the definition of bad.  Not a single one of the actors are great and all the performances are terrible.  I have seen plenty of movies and bad movies and I have never seen a bad one like this.  This film makes me wonder if there are people out there who want to be seen by children, but only on film because their brain has become so damaged that it does not register anything at all.   DOUBLE BARN CRAWL: THE MOVIE:  I will never forgive this movie.  So, so sorry this film even made it to me.  It is so bad that I cannot even watch it on TV.  My mom hates this movie and so do most of my cousins.  The entire movie is a disaster and you will see what happens to the poor child in the next few lines.    It was only after my Mom made a scene at the movie that I realized that this movie is all about being a child.  There is no reason whatsoever for anyone to watch it and yet I watched it at least 4 or 5 times and still can't get it out of my head.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story of "The Man Who Fell To Earth" begins with a young man, Robert Smith, visiting the Moon to collect a "spike," a mysterious object which, when brought to Earth, will allow him to travel to the planet.  At first he is amazed by it, but soon realizes that this world is very different than our own.  The Moon is the only place in the Universe where it is normal to have women and plants growing on the same surface.  Also, when he walks along the river a young girl, a beautiful one at that, is waiting at the other end of the stream, which is the source of the Moon's water.  It was her who saved Robert from being killed by a large, poisonous snake when the latter was passing through the valley with her father.  Now she has grown into a lovely young lady and, as her father explains, she is a natural born teacher.   The first thing that Robert does when he lands on Earth is to find the young woman and take her to his house.  Then he tells her about his adventures and tells her that he is a scientist and his mission is to prove that there really is life in this small planet and that a man can live on it if he can survive long enough.  This is quite a task and even the most courageous scientist knows that if he is to succeed he will have to spend years living among the various creatures and plants.  Robert is a little bit ahead of his time in his discovery of the life on this world and in fact he is quite prepared for such an undertaking.  He has come to Earth to find a place that will provide him with an abundant supply of food and water and he has even prepared an air-conditioned room in which he will spend his last days in a pleasant, pleasant kind of life.  But before he dies, Robert also sets out on a mission of his own. This mission involves him attempting to communicate with the Earthling who visited the Moon in his youth to learn a great many things about the planet that he was only able to learn by living there for a number of years.  I enjoyed the story quite a lot and although it was a bit slow moving at times I still found myself enjoying it.  Of all of the movies which I have seen, this was by far the most original and interesting of them all.  My only criticisms of this movie are that it could have used more story and that the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like this movie. It is good but not something new. It has a dark atmosphere and has its share of suspense. I like that the movie was produced in England. It shows England in a new light. They did a great job in a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am in no way a fan of this movie, or the genre in general, and I do have to give it some credit for trying something different for its first act. The film begins with a beautiful, hypnotically slow train ride across America's beautiful landscape. It is the perfect, quiet time to relax after a long, stressful day. But that is not what we are given. Instead, we are introduced to the young, beautiful and somewhat naive heroine of the film: Jessica Paré. Jessica (and Jessica Parén) is a young woman who is trying to make sense of her surroundings in the midst of a nightmare. Her husband (the young, sexy James Deen), and her mother (the slightly older, but still sexy, Gloria Parson) are both on edge as a result of a tragic car accident that almost killed the daughter. While Jessica is away, her mother and husband get a visit from a mysterious stranger who turns out to be a serial killer: Ed Kemper (Bela Lugosi). Ed Kemner makes it clear that he is here to make their lives miserable, as he is determined to dispose of Jessica and her young daughter before the day is over. The story of how Jessica is brought to be at his mercy is somewhat contrived, as she is brought into Ed Kempers' home by a woman (played by an actor who is clearly not in her right mind). Ed is a self-professed con artist who will do anything to take advantage of people, especially women who are vulnerable enough to fall for his manipulation. The scene in the house with Jessica in front of Ed Kemers is pretty well done in terms of staging, as Ed Kemar is very convincingly evil. There is also some pretty good acting in this film: Deen really is a very sexy and intimidating man. Jessica's best scene in this movie is a short one, as the movie tries to make a point about a woman who will find herself with a man who is ready to break the law in order to be with her. This scene with Deen is pretty funny, and it has some genuinely scary moments as well, as it is hard to imagine someone getting away with such a thing in America. The problem for the movie is, even though Jessica does not turn out to have the answers it is looking for, it still falls into the same pitfall of using its young female lead to get a jump on the audience before the main story has a chance to get started

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is predictable (a family on vacation is attacked), the characters are unlikable (no one gets what they want, except for the villain), the special effects are bad (and even those are used to make the story seem more exciting than it actually is), the acting is awful (all except for some lame one-liners like, "I never knew life was so short"), and the music is bad (even though it's pretty good), but the worst thing about this movie is the director/scriptwriter, George Roy Hill.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie's like a bad trip into a world far different from our own.  The visuals are truly beautiful.  And then we get to hear about all of the terrible things that happen around us.  Well, they didn't really happen to the characters.  But to the people in the movie.    The soundtrack is just as beautiful as the visuals.  I would have loved to see this movie made years ago, before computers came into play with the advent of CGI.  We see some really great scenes in here, and they show how beautiful and strange this world we live in is.  This is a great movie with a great cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an over-the-top movie with a very bad script, not only because it is badly-written and not only that, it is also poorly performed. The acting in this film is very bad, so bad that I had to turn to YouTube in a bid to watch the movie, and I can tell you with authority that the actors are not in this movie at all. This movie is like a bad bad movie. If you are looking for a movie that will remind you of a bad, bad, movie, then check out: "The Secret of Kells" and "C.O.L.A."

I wouldn't mind seeing a few more girls in action pictures (in a similar situation).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie while at a family get together. I was expecting a movie that had everything a good old fashioned cowboy movie should have. It didn't. Not one thing. Not even a cow. Nothing else. That's when I noticed the bad acting. They should not have been able to keep the audience laughing through four hours. The story lines were ridiculous, the stunts were poor and the special effects were terrible. I just wish I could give it one star.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mr T. from Cowboy movies are great! I can't get enough of these movies. I love the way they tell a story and give us great cowboy action, humor and heart. , 5 outta 5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a bit disappointed when I found out this movie was not going to be directed by Paul Verhoeven, this film was based off of a Dutch comic called Verhoeffen (The Red Army) which is an adaptation of the classic Dutch comic book series The Red Army.  The Red Men have become popular in various countries due to the movie version of their comic book and a movie adaption was even made of their classic book with the same name.  It is a dark film, to my mind, that does not really seem to have any redeeming qualities.   It has its moments of comedy, it is also a somewhat serious affair and in some places it does try to tell a story, but all in all this film lacks any real story or even a plot.  There is no actual story line or character development and even a few of the scenes in which the character portray themselves are rather pathetic.  This film is not very interesting, it has some interesting moments with a few characters and a great sound track, but it ultimately is quite boring.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a young man who lives in the big city of New York. His mother died during the baby boom and his father has been out of the picture for years.  He's got all these girls calling and he's got to be a millionaire by twenty to thirty.  His new house has a pool and the girls in it are some nice ones.  It is also pretty funny to see him with his sister after she got married and she said she wanted to get back together with him.  I don't know why they didn't show me more of the guys and the older women.  My favorite line of dialogue was when his sister said "I love you."  It's a comedy but I would have liked to see more of them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had seen this movie at the movie house with my Dad. I remember this movie fondly and I will be watching it again some day. This movie had some great dialogue, but, what was the point of it all? The two most memorable characters were the older sister and the little boy. Both these characters did have one thing in common, they were both kind of stupid. The older sister is an alcoholic who thinks everyone is out to get her. The little boy is the same way and the only reason why it didn't end up in a bad place was because the parents would have put the little boys in an orphanage. The movie was so lame, and the best part of it was that none of the characters were good looking. These characters were made up of what looked like the cast of a bad teen movie.

I'm not even sure what I expected out of a movie that included "I Fought the Law", "Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy", "Punch and Judy", "The Big Lebowski", "A Christmas Carol" and "The Great Mouse Detective". As far as I was concerned, this was a waste of my time. I enjoyed the first half, which is where most of the movie took place, but by the time it was over I wasn't laughing. The plot is so silly that I thought it was an April Fool's joke. All of the characters are terrible and I can't believe they actually thought this would be a good idea.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well this is pretty much nothing but a bunch of people running around in circles for no reason. Not that I had much faith in these people anyway since they never even went to the bathroom, but they never had to since the movie started. That really spoiled it for me since these were all the same types of people I knew from my school days. But this time they decided to dress up in fancy fancy clothing and try to act like a bunch... well a bunch who aren't so fancy at all. I mean we are talking about a bunch that never got anything of value from their lives and yet they have decided to try and dress up like they are the new thing.  And I do have to say that there was one really cute girl at the end who looked like she was a really nice person in her real life.

After being thoroughly entertained from start to finish, I realized I'd rather spend a few hours in a room with this picture than at a restaurant. The story is a bit thin and the acting a bit lacking. This is a good picture only in the same way that a great restaurant can be good if you're dining alone on a cold winter night. (It is a fairly good movie to watch alone.)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like a film in which two men have sex with a dead girl (who may have been a prostitute in life) then this one is for you.   The film has been shown at several festivals but I don't think this one has caught on yet.  I don 't think it's a bad film but it is definitely one for people who want to see things like a dead woman and gay men do a threesome in a hotel room and talk about how great it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a good movie with a few bad ideas, and a poor story. And it's over in the first 50 minutes, so there's no way to go back to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very bad movie. I liked a lot about this movie but I can't recommend it to anyone. Even worse then a bad teacher movie, this is a bad, terrible movie. It made me want to throw up. I'm not even sure I want to know about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is the year 2000. If you are wondering why I called it the year of the vampire, it is because a new breed of vampire is on the prowl. If it isn't for them, humans would have been long dead in 2000. It is just the beginning. The movie is an old fashioned noir that has enough blood and gore to last an eternity. There are so many great kills in this movie it makes you want to scream. I didn't think it was a horror movie when I first saw it, but the more I watched it, the more it was like one. There is a scene when the wife is lying dead in the shower and the only thing you can do is sit there in horror looking at the bloody corpse. It just doesn't get any better. If your a fan of film noir, you have to see this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is an adaptation of a novel from the early 1970's about an alcoholic writer who suffers from chronic alcoholism and the consequences thereof. It was directed by a former student of Hitchcock's who was a bit of a perfectionist and had a penchant for playing up the tension and using suspense to good effect. It has this unusual quality where, in addition to being an excellent movie, it's also a little bit of Hitchcock. In fact, it is so well made I was tempted to call it his finest movie. It's about a man who falls in love with a beautiful actress and has to work as a bartender. It does this brilliantly. There's tension, there's the oddity of the scene where the bartender is getting his drink to him, and then of course there is the little scene where a lady in a white wedding dress is looking down on the man as he sits down at a bar. It doesn't have the usual Hitchcockian tricks, it has an excellent, very atmospheric and, I'm sure, very funny script from a man with a talent for doing something completely different with every movie he made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was good... but not great.  There were some really cool looking sets and costume designs.  And it was quite funny!  I would have appreciated a little more humor.  The acting was pretty good... a few were not very good. But if they really wanted to get serious then it was too little, too late. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it's too bad that the studio is still making these silly, cheesy, stupidly bad movies, that are nothing more than a combination of slapstick, musicals and bad animation. This is the first one I've ever seen. I'm glad they stopped!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie because I was looking for something new, a fun and light, yet silly movie. I came across this movie and was immediately intrigued by the odd and unique look of it. It had an art style reminiscent of the film "Pineapple Express". It is a very simple movie where one character travels the country, trying to solve a murder mystery. When he gets caught, he gets transported to another dimension. He discovers there is a big mystery surrounding this other dimension, and it involves some rather strange beings who look like a cross between the old "Star Trek" TV-show aliens and the "Frankenface" from the "Indiana Jones" movies. I didn't really get into the story, but as far as the story goes, it was silly fun. It felt like it was trying too hard to be funny and didn't quite get the funny part right. I had a good time at the movie, but I couldn't help but feel the story could have been told a little better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen one too many bad zombie movies so I am sure I am going to get a bad one. This is the fifth in a series of awful movies that are all too obviously based on a popular TV show in the 1980's. I am not sure what the hell the producer/director has been smoking. He has done it five times and the last one was really bad. I don't know about other reviewers who think this is a good movie but I don�t. I guess it is kind of fun to watch in part because it is an obvious remake of the original �The Final Days.� It is interesting to learn that it was a big hit at the time of its release because it was shown on "The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson." It is funny and has some good moments. I have always preferred to watch older TV shows from my youth over all these zombie movies but the fact that they are all bad is no reason to avoid watching them. I do wish it had been edited more. The scenes with the dead coming out of the walls are pretty gruesome but I guess that�s a good thing because those guys are going to bite your head off for some reason.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film in my opinion. But the story is not bad. The film is not a big success for the American film industry. The acting is poor and the plot is very boring. The only reason this movie is bad is that the director is a cheap director who does not care about the movie, the actors, and the setting in which he films it. So why does he make a movie like this? Because, as he said himself, "I'm not really a director" (I'm paraphrasing the answer, "It's my idea; the producers are my directors").
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film does not give any indication that this is not a real life situation as it features two real life family situations as the film starts off with a man and his wife who are having a conversation about how the kids at school are going to be bullied.  The man decides to take a stand in case the kids continue to bully and kills all of the kids as he's heard about the kids bullying people in the school and thought that it's better to do something about it and kill the kids before they become a threat to himself and others.    The film ends with the man being told by his wife that they should get rid of the kid who's been bullying the other kids and tells his wife "he's not worth saving".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a little disappointing. While I had high expectations going into this movie, they were not met in the movie I watched. It wasn't a bad film (just not good enough) but it didn't wow me. The only thing it did really well was the music but all the other music was pretty bad. I would have loved for this movie to have been good, but it wasn't good enough to hold my attention for the entirety of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a horrible flick. I had never heard of the movie so I went with friends to a theater for this "action packed" story.  And we were all laughing.  The dialogue was hilarious and a great part of the story. But this flick is about three men who find an elderly couple and decide to take them to the beach to get some sun...but that's not the fun part... the fun is waiting to happen as the three men wait in line to kill the couple.  I would never see such a film again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My wife and I sat through this movie for one evening. It had a rather good cast (Robert de Niro, Jack Nicholson, Robert Duvall, Joe Don Baker...), but the acting was lacking. This is a long film, but there is too little screen time and it is too long. I have seen this movie many times in all the different versions in the theater. So, a couple of times in my life I have asked myself the question, "Who would win in a duel?" So, I am going to try to give you an answer. Who would win? Well, I won't say who would win... because I am not that type of a duelist. In my opinion, Jack is a better fighter and an more handsome man. It's a shame, I can't think of a reason why anyone would want to duel with Jack Nicholson.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to see this movie a few years ago and my husband and I both enjoyed it. It's very funny and I would love to see it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a guy whose girlfriend is the most gorgeous woman you've ever seen.  He also loves to take long walks through fields that look like a fairyland.  This movie looks like it was shot in the 19th century.    This was a pretty decent movie, with a few good acting performances.  It seemed like the movie had lost some of its magic after it had a bad reception at the box office, but I really hope that its sequel improves on the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole story is a load of bull. We are introduced to this man, who has the power to take a woman's life if she doesn't do what he says. That's it. That is all she needs to know about this guy. He can have sex with her and she will die of embarrassment if she does not comply. But we are supposed to like him and find him so heroic, so strong. He's the best thing to happen to mankind. Then we are shown him having sex with someone and the woman is still alive. He then tells her: "I'll be back soon." But he never returns. We never see or hear from him again. Not a single trace of him or any other member of the team. I have the feeling that there is no other human being like him. It may be the only story of a human being who could take on a powerful villain and not only survive, but still win. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You want to know what it's like to be at the wrong end of a gun? If you answer that question, you are not prepared for this film! I can't imagine how any sane person could watch this film and think that it was worth watching. If you've ever seen an episode of "Survivor" before you'd know the joke is on the movie. This is just a bad, bad film. I don't think the producers have a clue what they are doing, and their script is awful. But then they have to cast some people who have never been on TV. I think if they actually knew what they were doing they wouldn't have hired such uninspiring actors. There is a funny moment in the film where an angry man yells at his wife. The camera then pans over to her and shows the other men talking amongst themselves in a crude manner. There are some funny moments in the movie where the women act like idiots, but they are pretty much inoffensive. If this movie had been a TV movie, no one would have batted an eyelash, no matter how terrible the acting was.  Posted by The Good Wife at 11:22 PM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie doesn't have much character development.  We have a young woman who is pretty intelligent and wants to get a college degree.    Well this is where the film goes bad, the whole movie was a fake college and had all the right pictures in it for the first 20 minutes.  Then we get to the campus and she doesn't fit in with the kids her age.  They are rude, mean and call her "bitch" and make fun of her appearance.  I guess they don't know how to properly handle a girl who doesn't look like a normal kid.  It didn't take long for us to get to a college dance and the entire crowd was a bunch of high school kids who knew nothing about life.  This is the kind of movie where someone is saying she was smart and all but she couldn't even get a group of highschool kids to do homework or do her laundry.  And when it came to her college classes she had to sit in a classroom that was only a third of the size of a small classroom so that she could talk to a professor about a class she knew nothing.  The professor didn't know anything about the subject either so she asked a student to come in, not even giving him a chance to speak.  When she was at her wit's end this professor decided to give her some advice about what would happen in college.  His advice was to "try not to get into trouble", "not go to parties", "try to find a good roommate who's a good boy/girl and not go to any bars", "and get a good job in four years."   I have read a number of negative reviews about this movie and one of them was very good.  But I would never recommend this to anyone.  If you're young and looking to get out of college I think it's a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, it was a great idea: a comedy based on a classic novel. It wasn't.   The movie was full of ridiculous characters and one-dimensional comedy scenes. The movie starts out with a beautiful, yet creepy, woman telling a man to get off her property. She asks the man to leave his "little green dinosaur" (which is a dino of a thing that looks like a turtle and walks on two legs) out in the street for a while, but the man won't budge. At this point the movie becomes much less funny and more depressing. She threatens to call the police and have his children taken away. She also threatens to get a restraining order against him, even though the guy didn't do anything wrong.  When she calls the police, the cops seem pretty unconcerned. A few minutes later another car is following him and then they drive off.  It's pretty clear that they think he's insane or something, but they do nothing to investigate.  What really sucks is that we don't see the guy's wife do anything.  We don't even get to see her do anything! There's a guy whose head has been in a jar all this time and we get to know him very little. It's not exactly surprising, but when the guy is asked about it later, he says that the jar got in his pocket when he was killed and that he forgot about it until he was brought back to life and then he found it.  That's all we learn about the guy.  There is a girl at the start named Sally, who claims to be the granddaughter of Mary Poppins. Unfortunately, the movie didn't pay much attention to her character because we never see her doing anything. At one point she yells at the man who is living in a tree that it is stupid to think he can live in the tree. At the end of the movie, she and the woman get married.  So that's it.     I'm not sure what the film is trying to be, but it's not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It may have been a very bad movie for a lot of reasons, the most important being the bad dialogue (it was terrible) and the bad acting. I found it very difficult to accept the story of a group of people living in a home and doing nothing except getting stoned and eating junk food. That's it! And there's no plot to speak of so how can you enjoy it? I would have rather gotten stoned with the people that I know and who like the same stuff I do.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe I missed out on seeing this, I was so excited to see this movie.   It is a very good movie with good acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is not much to this movie other than a group of misfits trying to make it as a team.  It's hard to see some of the people that appear in this movie without laughing (well the one guy did a mean impression on a guy that is supposed to be dead and a female who is supposed be a sex symbol). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's so hard to make a bad film good, or at least interesting. Here we get a story about a group of young people going on a summer camp where one of them has a bad case of amnesia and starts seeing things from the past. But I can not say that this film has a strong plot. But it is pretty funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I had an option to re-do any of the movies I saw as a kid and put them on the big screen, I would.  The film is a good one, and it has an entertaining script.  I like how the director tries to make the movie more adult in tone, so it has a more mature ending than the first.  It will get a little better each time I see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is about a boy that is born with a "twin", and the twin is his dad's love interest.  The kid's family is very old, and the dad is very abusive towards his daughter.  I was glad to see that they didn't try to make the movie "too" old-fashioned.  There are some really good shots in the movie (even a couple of really funny scenes) and the movie is entertaining without being a huge disaster.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad Disney movie. I have never hated an animated Disney movie more.   Well, I don't know what's happening on this side of the screen, but I'm just really not a Disney fan.  The plot is bad and the characters seem to be made of cardboard. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie looks like a "Dinosaur" ripoff!   The music is horrible, and the acting in the movie is terrible.   I found it funny how a "monster" could make such an ugly creature look beautiful.  I guess the producers just wanted a monster that looked like a monster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In a perfect world, this movie would have been more of a horror, and not of the supernatural variety. Instead it feels more like a slasher movie that doesn't know it yet.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see it because I heard great things about it. I had heard the good reviews and I had also heard there was a bad review saying it was a "boring, uninspiring, boring movie with little to offer". Well... it wasn't that bad, I admit, and the movie had a few good moments. But it is a bad, boring, dull movie. It didn't have much going for it. The story is a "love story" told by a man and a woman. The first half of the movie is a little slow and tedious and then... everything goes to hell. The woman is too obsessed with her love and her desire to see a movie about him that she does more work on the story then she actually has time to see the movie. I couldn't wait to get through the second half, which starts with the couple running away from the angry mob that has been after them since they entered town and ends with a horrible rape. It isn't a rape, but there is a huge explosion of blood and the girl just stands there and blinks at the camera like she has no idea what has happened to her. The movie is so boring that I'm really surprised it had a theater audience. The only reason to see this is to see why this movie was so low budget when it could have been produced for less money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For a little over three minutes, this movie captures the essence of the worst part of any film festival: people who don't like good movies trying to convince you of the virtues of the bad. I could find nothing worse about this film than the horrible acting and some of the most laughable scenes I've ever seen. This is a film that's not worth your time - at least, if it doesn't break your teeth.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this movie is a bad example of bad movies, because the plot is terrible, the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is terrible. I was not expecting much from this movie because I hate this genre, but there are some good things in this movie: the actors are funny, the music is pretty, and the story is good. The movie starts with a couple of people getting into a car after an argument.  Then they stop, the car explodes, and so does all the stuff around it.  There is a lot of blood but that is not all.  Some stuff is blown up to the sky, and some stuff falls from the sky.  The guy is a pilot, the guys in the car are his friends, and it all happened one night.  When the movie is over the pilot is dead, and all the other guys are dead.   The guy who is a priest, the people who were in the plane, all dead. The guy who got blown up is still alive. The guys who were flying the plane are gone, and there is a big pile of debris around.  And then there is some music. This movie is pretty bad.  I did not like it.  The actors were funny, I liked the music, and I felt sorry for the pilot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was a good one, but it was a boring film with no redeeming qualities.  While the actors were good (including a great Bruce Campbell as the main bad guy) the storyline was just as dull.  The only redeeming quality was the great fight scenes (the best ones being in the last act). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a typical, boring film with a good plot. The acting is awful. I really hope someone gets the idea of trying to do a film with an actor who can't act in front of a camera. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a fan of comedy in movies like "Black Sheep" and "The Hangover" then this might be the movie for you.  The only "fun" is in the editing, which is terrible.  I can't believe that they spent so much on this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember watching this with my father. He loved this movie but I really didn't like it. It didn't have much action and it didn't feel like anything worth seeing and it's a terrible movie. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be a comedy or if it had been filmed so that no one could recognize it's being directed by Billy Wilder (who also directed the "Lassie Come Home" movie that was one of my favorite movies) and the movie was shot with very strange lights and no music. So if you think this is a bad comedy with no heart, or a bad romantic comedy... it's actually worse than either movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A really bad movie for sure.   It starts out slow, with plenty of slow and quiet moments. I thought the slow parts were interesting but the rest just dragged on, making me feel like I was watching a rerun of some old sitcom.  It's a good looking movie though, even if it's kind of ugly.  A movie that I probably would not re-watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a truly terrible movie that has absolutely no plot at all and doesn't follow any of the basic rules of a good movie at all.  It's an endless stream of horrible jokes about an annoying, self-centered, annoying person, played by John Cusack.  The movie never even gets to the point of comedy when it comes to Cusak's character, and when it does it just comes off as cheesy.  I watched this film with two young daughters, both aged 4 and 13, so this is not a very well-made movie for us kids.  John C. Cusacks "Sneak Attack" was a film I knew I would not like and I did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had high hopes for this film, but it doesn't live up to any of its hype. I've seen it a few times now, and I have to admit that I've become quite fond of the original version. I still enjoy the original and enjoy rewatching the original film, just as much as I enjoyed watching the new one.   A story of love with no romance, the story is all about an evil king's obsession with the loveable princess.  The film is just a fairly standard, boring story, with no special twists or surprises. Even though the story starts out with a bang and an unexpected twist at the end, it was ultimately forgotten by the end. I did enjoy the musical number at the beginning, and a lot of the jokes had a good sense of humor, but overall, the film was a bit of a let-down.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful.   The story follows a boy from New Zealand who moves to Britain to live in a seaside village. He's befriended by a young woman who falls for his tall, thin face.  The next day, he meets a girl who tells him that she's pregnant. This, of course, terrifies him and he tries to help the woman find a way to terminate the pregnancy. However, it doesn't work, the woman is very angry, and the boy has become a laughing stock. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only "bad movie" I had a chance to see on the big screen was the one about the police dog that was killed in the movie.   And I say "killed" since it takes the dog and it has been turned into a pet dog and then the police have to kill it again so it can be put up on display. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A pretty interesting movie. I had heard of an old Indian curse that said people die because they stare too long at the sun... well this is not that, it is that people die from staring too long in the sun. The story is about two scientists who find a beautiful woman named Sunita who is dying of cancer. They have two young boys to look after her, and one day she goes to meet them at the beach. She doesn't understand what they are doing there. They go in the car, take Sunita on the back seat, and drive away. The boys follow them, and she is struck by lightning. In the confusion, one of the boys gets a cut in his head that goes straight to his brain. He begins to forget everything that happened and what he is doing there, except staring at the beautiful woman with a huge smile on his face and a great, big, stupid grin. I guess this is a great way to waste the last year of your life.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's one of those films that you have seen many times, yet always in a different way.  You start with this very young female, who is about 10 years old and very naive but has some pretty good singing abilities. She begins to sing a number with her mother and her father.  The two of them have a pretty loving and normal relationship.   She is a little old for her age, but that doesn't stop her from looking forward to her next stage.  It's not until she sees a man with a mustache, that she understands it's time to leave home.  She's a very naïve girl, who doesn't know much about the world outside her house.  It isn't long before she's running around with a young man and soon finds herself in a strange city that seems to have some bizarre connection with her.  Now she's pretty well versed in English, and can be seen singing in her own language in a dance club.  But soon she realizes that she must leave her home and head into the outside world to survive.  This is the first film of its kind in which the main character, a young girl, has no knowledge of the outside, even as the time comes for her to leave her small house and make a new start for herself.  I'm not sure how well the young director, Aya Chiba, knows what she's doing, but she manages to make this little film into something much more complex and interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I heard the premise of this movie was a "haunted" house where an old lady had a son who had a terrible time. I thought it sounded so silly. Then I saw some action sequences. I mean they're just walking around in a house. And, yeah, this is a haunted house. It's not creepy. It has ghosts. Well, it has ghosts to be honest, not like a real ghost or a ghoul. I just didn't like the fact that the actors were so big. They really looked like they were in a show in a small movie theater. They all looked really stupid and bad. It took a while to get going, but once it did I was very impressed with the film. I think the director, Paul Bartel, might be a talented director. I'm not sure if he is. He's not a bad director, he's just not a very good one. There aren't many things about this movie I enjoyed. I did see this movie a few months ago and I was so disappointed. I have to say it was more funny than scary. I had one of my children watch the movie with me. She thought it was funny. But I wasn't happy at all. It was a big, bad, stupid house that had nothing to do with a haunted mansion. It had nothing at all to do about ghost hunting. It really was just the dumbest movie ever made. I really didn't think I'd find such a bad picture today. But here I am. It isn't the worst picture either. It is the worst horror movie ever. I don't think any of us would ever want to see it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie really pissed me off. There was one scene that is a very good example of how shitty it is for the characters to live in a world filled with violence. And, there was another scene where someone was being shot to death by a sniper. And then the sniper shot another one. And another. And so on.   The people were obviously crazy. And the only way I saw them being sane was to believe that the only thing that saved the world was the fact that the people in it were all killers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had the worst acting, acting that was bad for the most part, and a bad storyline. The story is boring. I think it was designed for older folks. The film was filmed in a way to make it look like a children's film. The special effects were bad. The actors were bad and there was nothing funny in the movie. A good movie from a bad director, which is a shame.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't see this when it was originally released on VHS, but the DVD of that version has now come to me. It is a cheesy, cheap, horrible, one-trick pony movie, in which a couple of guys (and a woman, who is clearly meant to be the wife) are on a romantic road trip. One of the guys gets a job as an usher at a high school. The rest of the time, they all drive around doing stupid things - at one point they have a "bake-off" in which they all make a giant cake (it is made out of a bunch of rocks, that is). The only reason the film is so bad is because they were so desperate for money (it cost about $5,000) that they had to take the easy way out. There is never a point where the movie actually has much going for it. The guys drive around in circles looking for an attraction in every other town that they pass, and they never find anything. The wife is an uninteresting character (which I found to be a problem with all the cheesy romantic comedies) and the only thing she can really do is sit around and tell her friends what the guys are doing. There isn't a funny line in the movie. The only one of which I remember is when the guy who is dating the wife says to the girl they are in love with, "You know, I've never seen you so unhappy. You must be feeling neglected. I haven't had a lover in over six years!"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This isn't a bad bad movie.   The problem with the movie is not that it sucks but that you can't even see it through a pair of binoculars.  There are lots of scenes with no actors in them, but only one of them is in color.  I can tell that the director of the movie spent a lot of time in the studio, because in every single shot there is somebody who looks exactly like the actor in the movie. Maybe they had an actor in a disguise, because even though the actors look exactly like each other, we don't really know who they are.  The story is interesting: a small town is threatened by a giant monster who was trapped in the earth a long time ago and then a great flood covered the earth.  It is not clear who or what caused the flood, but there are signs everywhere that a monster attacked the people of this town and destroyed the city.  Maybe the movie was about a man who saw the monster and survived by shooting an arrow to it, or maybe it is the story of how a small village was saved from destruction by a man dressed in a funny green costume.  Whatever happened in the story, the movie ends with a giant explosion that causes the sky to burst into flame.  One more sign of the director's carelessness is a monster who has the appearance of a gigantic hand.  And the last scene has a giant finger pointing at the sky. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be fair, if this movie is any indication of what was to come, The Matrix is still going to be a terrible movie. This is like some old school 80's cult film of an old school science fiction movie of old school 1980's science fiction. The movie follows the story of a young man on vacation from his job working for a government contractor who comes into possession of a mysterious object while looking at some ruins near a cave. The object has been studied over time by various researchers (who all look to be in their 30's) and it seems to show that machines can be sentient. One of the scientists is the daughter of a wealthy, conservative family. Her father has been very supportive of her research and thinks the object is important enough to get rid of his daughter's husband. This brings up a lot of questions that the film never seems to answer. I have never seen a movie in my life that was completely boring. From beginning to end the movie is just a roller coaster ride that eventually ends. The acting is pretty bad and there is no romance involved with anyone. There is nothing wrong with it, just not a lot to recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is about a former boxer who has just recently returned to New York with a new job. He has a girlfriend (Meryl Streep) who is also a boxer and they have a fight. The fight is pretty much a joke as the guy from the other corner just stands up, puts his head down, and goes back to his corner. The guy from his corner, however, doesn't just stand up and go back to the corner; he actually walks over to the other man, puts a glove on his hand, and says "I'm gonna win this". That is the only way I can describe it, it's a joke that no one will ever remember and you shouldn't expect it to either. This is one of the worst boxing movies ever made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would have given this movie 3 stars if I hadn't already seen many other movies from this studio. I thought it was the same type of movie that has been made over and over again. It is a bad film that I won't watch again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You'd expect a movie about a guy going back home and raising his kids with the love of his life but you'd be wrong. Well, I wasn't the kind of guy who would think about a movie until it was over, and after the opening credits were over and I had been to the theater for thirty-five minutes or so, I realized I had never seen anything quite like it. This movie is like a combination of a romantic comedy, an epic movie, a western with a little bit of a vampire thrown in, a movie you would watch at Halloween when you were a kid, a film about a kid (Josh Duhamel) that gets his world turned upside down. You know the kind, you can hardly watch it and not feel something. If you like these kind of movies then this is for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie in the history of cinema.   I had no idea why I was watching the last minute of this film. It was obvious it was a cheap and badly acted melodrama and it was even worse in every way.  The actors are pathetic.  What the director was trying to do with this film was to do the same melodramatic crap over and over again.  It was terrible and I would have turned it off right there had I not been told this is an excellent movie on the other side of the pond. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a bad way, "Blackfish" is like a bad novel. There is no way to think about anything without a huge amount of the movie screaming at us. The problem here is that these fish, with all their mental abilities, are basically stupid and cannot be reasoned with or reasoned with. They cannot be forced to understand anything, which is the whole point of this movie, and they cannot be saved. This movie will make you think about fish more than about anything else.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The title of this movie is just so stupid and so badly conceived that it's laughable.  The film is based on a play that was never produced, or even performed. It is basically an adaptation of a book that was written by the author, James Thurber.  It is the story of an actor named Edmond Rostand who is living with his wife Marie and their son Paul.  Marie is a brilliant actress whose career is on the decline and she has been in a serious relationship with Rostand.  Their love is so real that Marie even gives him her old car to drive him around the country.  Unfortunately for Marie, Paul is also suffering from mental illness.  Rostand must go to the hospital, but he is unable to talk to anyone about it and his only communication with Paul comes in the form of poetry.  This is a very painful experience for Marie and Rostand, not only because they don't know whether Paul is going to recover, but because Marie is afraid that the two of them will be separated.  As a result, Rostand becomes a recluse and his son grows up as an outcast.   The film shows us that Marie is no different from those she loves.  She suffers from depression and her only consolation is the fact that he can't talk to her about it.  In her despair she also becomes very unhappy and she becomes increasingly unstable.  However, Rostain manages to come to terms with his problems with one important addition: a book.   Rostand has a friend who lives in a mental institution and he is able to communicate with his son through a book called a "Camelot."   The problem is that the book has no pages and so when the book is read there is no end.  Eventually Marie's attempts to communicate back to Paul don't work out because Marie can't figure out how to read the book because there are no pages.   All the while Rostand and Marie are desperately trying to get the book to work.   Eventually the book works and Marie and Paul are reunited.  But this is not the happy ending that Marie and Rostand had hoped for.   Marie had been so miserable that she broke down and she was hospitalized.  After this she became a reclUSE person and she spent the rest of her life living in an old house.   But eventually Marie broke free of her depression and she became someone who could talk to people about her past. She was able to talk with
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about how the FBI will look to solve a crime of a young girl that has been murdered, and in a weird way I'm glad. It is a very cool way to take on the case: the movie opens with the FBI conducting a little background work on the murder, then they get a tip that they need to go to a girl named Holly Stussy who is living in an abandoned motel in rural Arkansas and that it may be the case. The movie then takes you into the scene and then it quickly establishes what kind of place this is. The actors really did a great job in a very strange movie. The film then spends a lot of time describing the scene, with the girls clothes, her car and the strange motel where she stayed. They find the murder weapon, it was a long black wooden stick, and it was used to stab her. This film is about what happens as the FBI goes about their work. They take photos, they interview a couple of the locals, they take another one's statement, they find that the motel is vacant, there is a suspicious amount of blood in the woods, and they figure it's either a case of an unknown killer that is stalking the area, or a murderer who moved in. The last hour of the movie is kind of a long movie. They visit the hospital where she died, and then they go to the town where she lived. There are a few scenes there, but not a lot. This movie has no story. This is about a girl and a girl's car, and a killer, and the FBI doesn't know if there is more than one murderer and it's up to Holly to figure out who it is. And of course, they are going to need her help to do that.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish I knew what it was about. It seemed to be a movie about a very good young man that is going to become a famous writer and it appears that that is his goal. But then he gets to Hollywood and finds out it is not for him. This movie is a little hard to follow and I don't know if I have been able to pick up all the lines since I don´t really have a good accent. It was a short movie but for such a short film it had a lot of action and was entertaining, though not very interesting. Posted by The Cinema Doctor at 7:23 PM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, it is hard to find a good bad movie about the Vietnam War. For some strange reason, this war seems to be the only thing Americans can't stand about their country. Even if we can't watch bad war movies, we can at least be able to laugh at those who do. But this is not a good war movie.   One is forced to laugh when our protagonist has a chance meeting with a girl from the local orphanage. We all know that this kid has nothing in common with his parents. The parents are rich. The orphanage is full of children like him. And yet, the kid seems so strange and strange and even sad. It's quite hard to put this kid in the right category. So it's not easy to get along. And at some point, our protagonist even loses his dignity by being the only person in the village to be beaten to death by kids. It happens in the middle of the night, the kids have no reason to pick on poor ol' Johnny. There is not even a fight between the kids over who should get to hit his butt first.  This is so strange it is almost laughable.  There were things that were even stranger. In the middle part of the movie we are introduced to the fact that our lead hero is the son of a notorious criminal who killed a young girl. That is an absolutely ridiculous plot point. After the death of that girl, our hero's father was murdered in a strange way. Then the lead hero was given the option to do nothing about his father's murder or to go to prison. He has no choice. His only purpose is to kill the men who had tried to kill him. It all looks very much like the opening scene of a bad Hollywood movie. One that only made it into American movies due to the name of the film (and that is a good name).  So, what were our protagonist's parents doing? Why did they give him a son? Who killed him? And why?   But most importantly, why did this young boy have to end up dead? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is just as ridiculous as the title. It is ridiculous in the classic way - a man is caught stealing his neighbor's car, but instead of going to jail the man is sent back to his home country of Mexico. After some time in prison, he escapes and is not seen alive again. Some guy with a gun takes a trip to Mexico and finds out where the prisoner has escaped to. This is the same character who the man had been with when he was apprehended. He is arrested. The film then moves back to America, and the only person on the street who notices the man who once stole the car is a lady who works at a candy factory. Now she doesn't know much about cars, but after she sees the man get shot, she wants to know more. She goes up to the man and asks him about his past. The man tells her about his time with the car thief. The lady tells him that she heard the story from her father, who has a lot of experience in the area - he knows a lot about guns, so he should be able to help him. She tells him about her plans to go to Mexico to collect his money and learn more. He agrees to help her with that. Now this is where the film begins to go crazy - and I don't mean as a bad film. There is a scene where a man who had once been on a date with a female named Alice walks in to see her and finds that she is not as she looks. This man is an undercover cop. He knows that she had once had an affair with a man named Jack and has been thinking of him constantly. He has even had a tattoo of his initials on his arm. This scene is very weird. The idea of a cop having his lover's ex tattooed is just odd. The whole film does go crazy in the latter half. The story goes that the lady returns to Mexico with the money and is never seen again. But then, she tells a story about being chased by a man she calls "Punisher", who had chased her during the time she was looking for the money. Punisher kills everyone she knows. She is rescued by the guy with the gun. He also rescues the lady with the tattoo on her arm. But they all become fugitives and eventually have to be found. The policeman has a special gun that he uses to kill any of the murderers who happen to be walking by the car. But he can't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I haven't seen this movie since it came out in 1994, but I remember watching it, it's a low budget, cheesy and very low budget comedy movie. And it's all very cringe worthy. The main character, "Randy" is a self indulgent fool.   In the movie we have a lot of "jokes" like "you're never supposed to drink that" "why don't you buy some cigarettes" "you never see a cat, do you?" and many other "joke" lines.  It was the same with many of the characters, they were funny at first but they were really cheesy, and boring after the first minute or two.  There were no actual jokes in this movie.  Even the movie was over after the 1/2 way point.  The movie was only a few minutes long.  And it was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It wasn't bad by any means, but I didn't like it at all. The premise: The first half is a standard action movie, with good special effects and a nice score. But then the movie goes to a different direction, with a more dramatic story, better music and more original characters, and it's very successful. The film does a good job of portraying the war and the horror of the situation, as well as portraying the effects of the poison gas in a graphic way. While some parts of the movie don't make sense, it still does a better job than most other action movies of the time. I would give it a 7.5, but it's nothing spectacular, which makes it a little disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is basically a bad remake of the classic, but that's ok as it's not bad at all.  My only major complaints are that they didn't get any of the original's fun factor in, and a very creepy character who looks like he was drawn by a teenage boy.  If this was made in the seventies, it would make for one hilarious movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is absolutely fantastic, and the animation is as good as you could want out of a cartoon movie. The animation is so good that you can practically feel the heat coming off of it and you will feel the same way when the story reaches its climax. The story of the film is so original, it is also so good, that you will have a hard time looking at it for too long and you may even want to check it off your list. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I heard something about a film about a boy who is a mutant who can move anything around by simply thinking about it. It sounded really cool to me and I was looking forward to it. What I got was something like: A boy who can see ghosts is stuck in a small apartment in a haunted building, with no one to help him. It's not a lot to go on, but then again it isn't much to watch either.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very simple, straightforward film. The plot is nothing more than a man (a man of few words) being held prisoner in a prison while his wife, sister, uncle and some other friends make a vacation. A simple, but effective story! The soundtrack is nothing to write home about either. There is a very cute little girl in the film too...the kind that the boys would love, but not as much as they love their own mother. The girls love their parents to death, but they would be even more thrilled with their new mother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best scene in this is the one with the girl getting stabbed.  I really don't get the film's message:  When a girl tries to murder a guy, it's bad form to murder her, too.   I don't care if you're a lady, you don't kill a guy.  This is a story about a girl who has to kill a bad guy because he's a bad man:  I have no idea what the story is about.  The movie is really unoriginal.  It has the "girl has to shoot a bad guys head off" and the "bad guy can't do anything but die" plot lines.  You're not going to get a better movie out of this, and you're not watching it for the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first "A" movie made a comeback last week in Japan as a theatrical movie.  It was based on an old Japanese comic strip called "Aoi Yuki" that was serialized in monthly comic magazine "Kogyo Kanga"  which is published by Shogakukan. The movie was a remake of the original comic strip, except the main characters were now grown ups and did not have the super strength and super size that the cartoon strip had. The plot was very faithful to the original cartoon strip. The movie had the same voice actors (except for the two principal roles) and the same musical score.   I thought that Aoi Yaki was one of the better films made by Tatsuta (who is also an animation master), as it was very entertaining. Aoi Yoshihiko is the leader of a bunch of super-strong super-fast super strong robots that fight the bad guys. Each of the robots is the size of a large skyscraper and each one has a super strength. One of the heroes of the movie was called Jyoushuu the Destroyer and was armed with a rocket launcher. All of them were armed with giant swords that could cut through the most fortified walls in the world. A little girl named Konomi was in the middle of the action and she was super adorable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole movie is an elaborate joke.   It takes itself way too seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that was produced to kill people. The main reason is not just "how evil they can be and still keep their heads" but "why can't they be more evil than the other movies?" So, yes, they are more evil and they are also not more stupid and more stupid. They are no longer funny. And what is worse, we as viewers are constantly left wondering just who is the bigger villain! Well, the first hint that someone may be less than a villain is when we hear that the "leader" is not even a leader. The first of the film is that the group is called "Grossi", which means a large group (meaning they all seem to be about the same size), and their first task is to catch a "Gremlin", which according to the film seems to be the leader of their group. There is not much more to the story but the group has to find the Gremlin and when they do they are told to kill it (it can be assumed by the film that they will be trying to kill a human so as to make it seem like a "crime of passion" and the film does a nice job in convincing us that this is indeed the case). The next part of the story is that they must capture the Gremlins and put it in their "cage" and, apparently, they have to do this all while being chased by the police. And it gets better! When they get to the cage and the Gimp is on guard, we see an opening and we are given the opportunity to see what the leader is really like. As we would expect, he is a complete, mindless moron who acts more like the head of a crazy mob than a leader of a team of professional killers, though he does get a "little" extra motivation here. Then, after they capture the creature, the next part takes place. The Gremlobins appear and the leader tries to escape but the G-Man blocks the exit and, after a little while, they all start to fight, leaving the Grendel to kill the Gmuggin. The final section of the movie shows the Gromling trying to help the Garmlobin out by throwing a rope from a bridge over the Grmuggin's body. However, when it is thrown and the ropes rip, the Grima will not let the Grogln and the scene ends.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a good movie in some ways, but bad in others. The movie is very good at building the character of a young boy who suffers from a terrible accident. He lives in a small town outside of New York and is the local farmer. He is the one of the few good characters in the movie; even though I liked that poor man. His family is pretty sad and the farm isn't exactly the most enjoyable place to live; but he does his best in most of the movies he's in.   There are a couple of other characters who are more interesting, even though they don't seem to really be able to contribute much to the story; especially the young woman who is forced to live in a trailer after the parents go away on a business trip and leaves her behind. But all of the characters in this movie aren't quite as interesting as these two who are so forced to do things in most scenes.  The film itself isn't bad though, and is a pretty good story. It's just a very bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a low budget, crappy made film that's not funny. A bunch of actors are trying to get into big time comedy show. That's all it is - nothing more. A poor excuse to be funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a completely uninteresting movie that doesn't deserve to be remembered for much more than its badness.   It is a typical, overacted, overstuffed, melodramatic, overlong, and utterly ridiculous film that lacks all the subtlety and charm of some of its more good-looking predecessors.  My thoughts: This is another overworked, overbudgeted and over-acted film from the likes of Terence Hill that is not very good.  It features the usual combination of melodrama, overblown production values, over-enthusiastic supporting roles and cheap gimmicks, which are all too often found in the films of these three directors (or, I believe, in Terence Hills' films) - which is a pity as Hill is a very good director (for his age), and I doubt that any of the actors had much to do (as I recall).  The picture is really bad as far as I am concerned - and I'm not impressed by most of the other "tasteless" pictures of the year. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this movie was pretty bad, but not as bad as the awful movie from last year. I was pretty bored by this, as I had seen it before.   There are several scenes with strange, creepy children, one of whom makes quite a mess of the stage with a huge ball.  For starters, I would like to point out that this movie contains a lot of violence. There is a scene where a little boy is beaten to death by a group of thugs.  Then there's the scene where some men try to rape a woman who is in labor.  There's some very gory scenes, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many "good" movies out there that you won't find much worth watching and even less worth repeating. With a "good guy" who makes bad decisions, a bad romance and "good guys" who don't try to win, it's hard to justify the cost, and this is without knowing much about the world of the movie or the film-makers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When it comes to making bad movies, you could go through a list of bad movies in the last few decades: Dirty Dancing, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Blues Brothers, Caddyshack, The Big Lebowski. The list goes on. In the middle of the great movie of the '70s: "Caddysack", director John Huston's first attempt at writing about a group of rag tag New Englanders on the Appalachian Trail. They're hard pressed to survive the harsh environment that stretches for hundreds of miles. But, after a few months in a cabin, they have to leave because of the cold, and the trail turns out to be a huge amount of fun. The movie isn't without faults. For one, the acting is somewhat cheesy. But for the most part, the movie is a blast to watch. And it has the same impact on a generation of youth who can remember growing up when the movie was a big hit. If you have a chance, check out this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really looking forward to seeing this but not to the extent of "going crazy" I mean the entire movie is a rip off of the movie "The Last Dragon".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this film a number of times at the local theaters, especially in the late 80's/early 90's as a kid.  This is the story of a boy named Ben (Robert Stroud) and his twin brother (George Dyer) who happen to be twin identical twin brothers, and their lives are nothing short of incredible.   Ben is the smarty pants, tough guy, so he is perfect for his twin's role in the big time.  Ben's father was a millionaire.  Now this father always wanted Ben to be more than just a good little rich kid, so Ben and his brother started playing baseball and all the time were getting into all kinds of mischief.  They didn't realize it at the time, but all their hijinks would be for naught though, because their father was the most famous millionaire in the world, and they would go down in history as the "Twin Twins."   This film is a good one to watch.  It is not exactly well made, it is dated and it is fun.  I don't think that this film is going to win many awards, but I would still recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a big fan of horror and love to see great, scary movies. I love the "Scream" series in general and this one was a very good one.   Like the title suggests, this is an anthology of horror stories where the stories are set in a town.  The townsfolk are all afraid of a strange entity that goes around town at night and appears in the windows of people's houses.  It is always seen by night and always has the appearance of a young girl.  This entity seems to have an evil streak of some kind and is always on the hunt for new victims to torment.  There are numerous stories in this anthology and the stories were all very good.  It's scary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No, not the movie.  It is the movie, and I am still not sure what the movie is about.  One minute we're in a high school party; the next minute we are in a diner.   I can see why there is only one version of this film.  However, it does have several interesting characters, and it's good for a good laugh.  This is not as good as the old westerns which were very popular, and not nearly as good in the sense that they had a plot.  I just hope that it gets a new edition so that it can be shown for all to see.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The "B" rated movie is a terrible movie, but not terrible enough to be boring.    So far, nothing wrong with the acting/direction.  One can only hope that the writer will get a "B+" rating from the ratings, which is in fact an even more embarrassing grade than the B.  But I really don't want to spoil the movie too much.  We're introduced to the "bad guy" (well played by Kevin Bacon) and his "crusader" (played by Sean Penn) right at the beginning of the movie.  The good guys (James Earl Jones & Julie Harris) have been in the neighborhood since the "crush" (yes the actual film title, not some lame pun) the previous year and are getting ready to take the "B-Rated" movie to its logical extreme.  There's a bit of a scene early on (in the car) in which they're talking about how this movie will be different.  A bit later, we're introduced back to our characters, who are just chilling at home when some guy shows up at their doorstep.  After he shows up, the guy seems nice (he even wears a nice shirt) and offers to let them stay on the couch for a while.  All these guys are hanging around the house because they're all "old friends" (their word, not mine) and "we don't have enough space".  As is often the case with "B Rated" movies, the "real bad guys" are the ones who don't fit in.  It's pretty pathetic for a "highbrow" movie like this to have a subplot involving an eight-year old girl and a bunch of young kids.  This was really stupid, and the fact that it was an eight year old girl that was the target of their attention makes it all the worse.  That this movie got any "A" rating at all is a joke.  I'm still not sure why I'm wasting my time writing this, but I have to admit:  The "B Grade" is a big let-down.  If you're a big fan of the "Crush", don't waste your time watching this.

If you have a few hours to kill then this is the perfect movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie's only redeeming feature is its ending, which is pretty much a big pile of garbage.  The story starts with a beautiful couple on vacation in a small cabin. The husband is a bit of a wuss, but has been very happy being home and has recently found a good job, as an engineer. She is a pretty girl, but can't quite contain her passion for music and dance. During their one night of rest they have a pleasant dream. There's a beautiful young woman in a white dress and dancing to the piano. The man falls in love with her, but cannot resist the temptations of her dancing. When they wake up, the man decides to take a drive to try and convince his wife of the possibility of love, but is caught by their cabin's guard. He is then tied to a tree by a rope and dragged to the woman's cabin, where she makes love to him. However, the guard has a dark secret and the woman uses the key to get inside the cabin. She begins dancing all night and when the guard wakes up, they have sex once again, but this time it's only just enough for him to pass out. He wakes up the next morning and realizes he has no memory of how he got tied up, or how he fell to his death in the woods. It's the woman who is guilty of murdering him. The next morning the woman walks across the road and kills another man who had just been woken up by the young woman. She then heads back to the cabin where she spends the night with her husband. When the guard comes home, he goes and checks on the two men and finds their bodies, and the strange woman lying by the door. The woman then leaves the cabin to make her way back to her home country, and her husband finds a note and a note about the note saying "Don't worry dear, your husband will be a good man one day".  This is a fun movie with a good story, and a wonderful song. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you really don't like to hear yourself speak and have some of the most idiotic and stupid plots on movie screens then this is NOT your movie at all...I don't have much to say about the story...it's a classic: A woman in an old age home, who is in perfect health and with no real need to be there, starts to get increasingly cranky when the children don't behave as expected and she starts to think they're being abused. So she starts a witch hunt to find out where they are being abused and one of the children confesses the whole story about the other children going off to a big house in the country and being raped by a man named Mr. Big. The women in the neighbourhood are outraged and start to throw the villagers out of their houses. The witch hunter, who I think is supposed to be a female character, and is in a witch outfit, is so stupid that she can't understand a woman who is saying how they're all being abused at home. The kids are the victims...not the abusers. She even admits it when she admits she can make them all have dreams for a week...and she can even go to the country...all that with a few people who can barely manage to get their own house ready...and when they get home, they get their dreams back too! And then she just lets them go back to their own houses. What a stupid plot...a witch on the loose. So stupid that it has to be set in an elderly home for people in a perfect state of health who are just too old to get out of bed...I've never heard a bad plot in a movie before...all the characters are stupid...and I mean stupid. I don't know what this movie was thinking...I mean if this is a comedy about how the children are all abused, why can't they be abused? I don 't know...I guess someone didn't want to be bothered or annoyed with a child movie. I mean...who'd want to sit through an hour of this...and then have to watch it again? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As the title suggests, a great deal of effort goes into this film. Its director, Stanley Kubrick, is one of the most talented filmmakers working today.   He has created many masterpieces, most notably Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and Barry Lyndon, and his work on these films is quite masterful.  I will be quite brief, as much of what we see here is not a good movie and is far more interesting than it has any right to be.  The "space opera" genre that Kubrick is so fond of uses a variety of actors to portray their characters; however, it seems that many of them do not work as well as they are supposed to.  There are scenes in the film that are just simply bad, while others are so bad that you will cringe.  Most of the acting is so bad, and the direction is so dull that it is hard to take the movie seriously at all.  It is a shame, because the film has an original story that is fascinating, involving the characters and the world they find themselves in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The badness was just too much for this movie to handle:  In many ways, the movie is a disaster. The plot consists of a guy who is a police detective and a girl who is his girlfriend. There are no characters other than the two main ones. The movie is just an action movie, with an evil doctor who wants to destroy the Earth so he can start a new planet and a police who is just trying to do their job. The characters are just one dimensional, and the only redeeming quality of the movie really is the great soundtrack by Tom Waits. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    An unsympathetic protagonist (played by a man who looks more like a boy's sidekick from an early episode of The Twilight Zone than a human being) and one that is far too obviously written for the purposes of its intended comedy.   A "wonderfully entertaining" picture, but it just never takes itself too seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst bad movie I've seen in years.   I have seen better bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This has always been one of those movies I have loved since I was a kid and still watch it to this day in it's original form. It is very hard to find a bad flick these days and this one is really not that bad. I have to say that I do hate when they use the term "busted" to describe people who get in trouble.  I don't know why people can't get rid of "busting" and just call it what it is.    The plot is rather predictable.  At the beginning of the movie, we are introduced to a little girl, Mary (a young Frances de la Tour) who has a lot of problems.  She has two little sisters that she is afraid to take to a doctor.  Her parents are divorced and her brother was killed in a car accident.  The only way she got out of that was to get help.  Mary gets help from the priest who has done a lot more for her than anyone else.  When it comes to the priest, Mary is very good to him.  We start out as she is getting ready to go to school and she is really excited.  All of her friends are in a big band and they are all getting ready for the big performance that is coming up.  This is not good news.  What Mary has never understood is that everyone at school thinks that her mother is going to die and that her life is pretty much over.  Once they start rehearsing the show, Mary learns that she really can have a great life.  It is so great that her brother and her sister are at school and that she actually gets to see them in a little while.  Then, something horrible happens.  There is a tornado and Mary is not the only person who gets hit by it.  Now Mary is alone and her father is very unhappy about this.  Unfortunately, he doesn't have a lot to say about this either.  After the tragic events that occurred that day, Mary has a very hard time taking care of herself.  During the day, we see her going to church and also attending school.  Even though there is only a few months to go until she is to start college, Mary feels as if she is a child again.  Things get even worse at school. While Mary is on her way to class to start the next day, her mother tells her that she has to go back home and get her sister. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love this movie. It is my favorite film of all time, and I've seen pretty much every film featuring the character played by Richard Boone.   The cast is amazing.  It features a beautiful cinematography (including an interesting use of perspective), and the acting is really good.  The film itself is about a man who can see the future.  Boone's character gets an invitation from a man named Peter Fonda to go to a party at his house.  I don't remember exactly where in the film I saw this particular scene (possibly when Fonda is being killed in the movie's opening), but I was so sucked in I wasn't able to stop watching.  In this scene, Peter Fondale is telling Boone and his girlfriend that he's going to invite his best friend, Frank, over later.  This scene gives us our most important clue, one that will set the stage for the rest of the film.  We don't actually see Frank until the following scene, in which he has a bad experience with a prostitute who gives him the creeps.  Frank goes to Boone's house and says:  "I'm really sorry, Peter.  I know I'm not a very nice guy, and the fact that I'm in your house makes this even worse."  Frank's friend gets in the car and says something to him (probably "Don't worry, Frank. ")   Then we hear Boone say:  "Hey, what happened to you, sonny, did your mother ever take you to a ball game?"  In a later scene, Frank is talking to Boone about the party and Boone tells Frank that "I was going to leave my wife alone."   It's the most touching moment in the entire movie, and even Peter FONDALE gets choked up.  A really nice little scene to end the film, and one that sets the tone for a very successful movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I bought this on DVD as it was released the same year as the "Gone with the Wind." The movie is about a pretty, pretty young girl who becomes a pretty young lady after her mother dies.   It wasn't a bad film but it was short, I think the reason it was shorter was because its director decided it would be a good idea to do a remake of a short film that was made just a few years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a huge comic book fan, a big Star Wars fan, and a huge Superman fan as well!   Superman: Doomsday was a film that was not only disappointing, but utterly dumbed down.   If you're not a fan of the DC heroes, this is not a bad film.  Unfortunately, it's an incredibly dumb film, that doesn't even have any redeeming value (or any entertainment value).   It's boring as all get out, with little character development, a lame Superman story, no comedy, and not a single moment of charm.  You'd think that someone would at least try to try to add a little more humor to the film (and the comic), but nothing but a boring, forgettable film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am one of the people who likes to see old movie still being watched on cable channels.   This one is not.  It is kind of entertaining in part.  This movie is like a short little thriller.  The story is good enough, but the acting is terrible.  There is a guy, a woman and a little girl.  They are all looking for a missing girl who went to the bathroom.  When a girl's body is found, the three get together and do some investigation.  I will say this movie is not so much for the children, but maybe they will find an old film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a classic example of a bad film. A girl meets a guy who turns out to be a psychopath. They are married right from the start but she soon finds that the "perfect husband" is a very different man. She is very unhappy in the marriage and eventually leaves. The story is very sad because of all the problems between the two characters. I only laughed a little bit during the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have a soft spot for this one, but it has a terrible run time of about two minutes, so it is a pretty short film. However, it is one that I remember being good, it had all the right ideas at the right time. The characters are all fun, and the humor is clever. It is probably one of the first great science fiction films!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is not even a bad film but an empty shell of a film that is meant to promote a new comic book series that will feature the likes of Superman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl and Aquaman. In my humble opinion this new comic is a waste of money and could not even be called good in any sense of the word. The movie will not feature a single comic book character and the first act does not even try to establish any real characters. If you are going to produce something like this, at least do it well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like the movie, but there are several scenes that are not very good, and the plot is very convoluted. The movie was supposed to be a spoof of the 1960's and 1970's, with a plot like the old Westerns. I had no idea what was going on (this is a children's movie), so this movie is not for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not much I can say that hasn't already been said about this movie.  It's a decent enough movie with a good story.    Rating: 2 out of 10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just can't believe it!   This film is not a good film.   It is a movie made for cheap laughs.  For the record, I have seen a few bad movies. The best one is the movie "The Dead," starring a lot of guys I have met at parties over the years. They are not funny, and they have some good lines. I have been told this film is based on a book by a guy named William Goldman. I don't really know who this guy is. All I know is that this movie is filled with such bad acting that it is almost unbelievable that anyone could ever make a movie about a bunch of guys who want to kill each other.  A film that is filled to the brim with bad acting.  I am surprised anyone has seen it.  This is a film no one should watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie because it was an amazing horror movie, but it was so horribly paced that the horror didn't work, I had more fun watching a slow motion action movie!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is like a movie in which the people are so bad that they can be only bad in movies made by this group.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a movie that tries to be "good enough" on the basis of a decent story, but there's a whole lot of clunkiness here and there that makes it hard to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was hoping to see this movie since its release, since it looked interesting. I was happy to find out that it is a terrible movie. This movie is not only awful, but one of the most annoying movie of the year, and the worst movie of this decade.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was just horrible. It was sooo cheesy, sooooo boring, it was just all silly humor with bad acting.   I guess this movie could've been okay had it not been in 3D. I don't think they should be releasing this crap to get any new people to see a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's about a group of people who are living in an old shack that they build themselves. They're all a bunch of wacko freaks who are all in terrible pain and the only reason they're still alive is the fact that one of them is a vampire, and the others all try to kill him every once in a while. But the vampire keeps coming back.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending to this film is a great scene.   It does not leave me with a bad taste, but instead sets up a fantastic sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can't stand this movie. Its bad. Not a great movie, but bad.   Its got a few good moments - such as the guy in the car who asks for directions and he calls him "Uncle Harry".   It's really just a sad tale of a boy who wants to be a hero, but always comes up short. I've never really bought any of the hero books ( I'd be surprised if they even exist). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film that's really not meant to be seen at all, and at worst is an insult to cinema as an art form. I'm not one of those that thinks that horror films are supposed to be scary. I like a good horror film, but in this case the audience isn't involved much at all. At the start, we get the bad guys (all played by people that seem to be trying to be actors) going into the theater. The baddies are dressed and gaudily ghoulish looking. One is a clown with a big nose and an eyeball in a cup. A big, scary, black bat is the thing that follows behind these baddies. I don't even know where I begin to describe a horror film without describing it as the worst film I've seen in my entire life. It seems that there were so many bad ideas, characters, and plot lines that these two are almost in the same scene at the same time. The way they act with each other is a little irritating as well. There is a bit about a man getting eaten in the back and he gets cut by the bat and then it jumps up out of the man's stomach and comes back down as a big bat. There are other characters that also are dressed in black and some with red eyes. Some of the baddies have to be killed by guns, other ones are just beaten, and a few are killed by dogs that just jump at them. I'll say what I can about the acting, I liked how the actors acted together with each character and how well they portrayed different characters. The camera work is actually quite good. This film is only about 10 minutes long. If you're looking for something scary, this is it. If not, you probably won't like it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had heard about this movie when I first started watching a documentary about the famous German WW2 paratroopers in the American movie.   This movie is not bad, it was the best of the paratrooper movies to be filmed in Europe and I think it is more entertaining than the documentaries.  I think the movie should be made into a movie for a long time because I was amazed to see how the film is edited.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After watching one film in 2013, I know where I want to be for the future.   I really don't care about this film or its characters at all.  I would give a pass if it was a film where a bunch of kids play at being grown ups and they all have bad luck.  But the film was made so badly I couldn't even laugh at it, and that's probably a better movie than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie about a very poor child being adopted into a family who would rather have a cat than a child, who lives in a little house in a strange, weird world. Who gets into a fight with a man-shaped blob who doesn't really give a crap about anything at all. Why should you see this movie? You can get a DVD from Amazon for about 10 bucks. Go ahead. I will tell you something: It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably the best, most entertaining, and most entertaining movie I have seen in a long, long time. You should see it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you were like me and were in a state of panic watching this movie I would definitely recommend this to anybody who has ever felt like a little kid trying to make sense of a really messed up situation.    From the beginning the movie was pretty creepy and creepy in a pretty weird way and then about halfway through it just got really creepy.  Even though the movie didn't make any logical sense, I still found the idea of the movie very scary and I really liked the way it made me feel that there were all these creatures out there doing strange things and getting really freaked out at the thought of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was so horrible  I found myself going to the bar to make a call to my boyfriend who lives in New Mexico and it was so hot  I walked around for like a good 20 minutes and then my friend, my roommate and I decided to go to the movies

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to wait a bit for the DVD to arrive before I finally got around to watching the "The Day The Earth Stood Still" film. I watched it with my son (who's 12) a few years back, which is not a bad thing. The kids love science fiction. They just seem to love science, for some reason. One of their favorite movies of all time was The Day The Moon Fell (which had to be some sort of sequel, since the end credits were from both movies). So it made sense to watch the two together. This was the first movie they watched together. I can remember them gushing about "Star Trek," and saying how they liked it. My son loves sci-fi. He doesn't like movies, though. I don't blame him. I think he would like the first Star Trek movie and the Star Wars films. He loves the movies, but he doesn't get the science behind them. But he likes them.   It's a pretty good movie. It's got a good story and the actors do an OK job. There are some funny scenes, but they're not enough to make the movie enjoyable.  The film is made to look like a 1940's science fiction movie. There's a good deal of makeup effects in this movie. And the music is not very good. It has a nice sci-fier feel to it.  I guess we can say this is the first time science fiction is done right in a Hollywood movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It should be obvious by now, but this is no "Citizen Kane", "The Third Man", or any other classic that has long become a staple on many a film lover's collection. This is merely a good movie made by one who is also one of the best. The script by Barry Levinson is not without its flaws, but it makes up for it by not shying away from the obvious. The acting is solid if often under-developed. Some of the scenes between Bill Murray and Robin Williams, and those between Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, are truly special. I was shocked when I first watched "Lost in Translation", because I had always thought that Bill Murray was the one who gave "Lost" the "feel" and "humour", but I think the film is the more interesting of the two. It certainly puts a "good" spin on things, but is not just a movie. It is more than a movie, and this is one of those movies that will leave you thinking. There are some moments in this movie that will make you smile, other moments that will give you goosebumps, but overall, you will always have a laugh at the end of this film. Just one thing to point out is that if you watch this movie on a long drive (like I do), you may want to have someone with you. I think it is very difficult to drive, let alone sit through the entire movie. Not for the squeamish like myself, who may find the sexual content a bit excessive, but for everyone else, who want to laugh, or just enjoy a movie? You have nothing to lose by watching this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has a bad ending. When you think all is lost, your friend, a nice-looking blonde girl, comes along and tells you to forget about the girl who stole your pants. After that, you are told you need to do a certain task to be able to come back. It is a race. There is no prize. It doesn't matter what happens, because you can always come back and do it again tomorrow. Then there is a short film that follows the race, and is very poorly done. It should not be seen. I recommend that you watch the short film before you see the movie. The race is pointless. It would have been much more enjoyable to see the little girl, the girl you saw in the street, or a different kind of girl.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We're going to be honest here; the movie does not work.  For those of you who missed it and think its a rip off of Pulp Fiction then I am sorry.   No, this isn't a bad remake, it's bad writing.  I know, because I read the script.  And I would say it was pretty bad.  I mean, its a pretty low budget movie so it wouldn't need any more special effects.    It wouldn't even need more acting.  This movie is a cheap rip off, and a cheap remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a pretty dull movie with a fairly short run time. The plot, that follows an ordinary family in 1950's America, is very simple, and it is never hard to follow, which is a good thing. The main characters are just as dull as each other, but you can't help but watch it with a smile on your face!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like an American Ninja, but more of a gangster!  This movie has a ridiculous plot, and some of the worst acting in the movie. Even at the age of 85, I couldn't believe these guys were actors. I wish someone would have told me to just watch a little more of their "comedy" on the tv.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main character of this movie is a little boy named Jack. In this movie we see that Jack has a little sister named Miley. This movie is made for a little girl that has a love for all animals. I think this movie was an excuse to let her get drunk with a bunch of animals. But Jack was not going to let any animal get away from him! I also wonder if this movie would have gotten any attention if it was made for any other people.  I'm afraid this movie will become the most un watchable animal movie on this earth!  The only good thing about this movie, I guess, is that it was really fun to watch! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My problem with the movie is that it's very cheesy. I know that, when it's done in a nice, relaxing, fun atmosphere, it's a great movie.   But I had to put down my popcorn and run to the bathroom when the movie came on.  I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking here.  The acting is not very good, and I am not sure that the film was really made for kids.  They must have been having a party or a dance when they were putting together this movie.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to see this before I can properly review it.  This is a film about an insane serial killer.  The killer is a weird man who has had several wives, a few children and a few pets.  One night he goes to a hotel where his "friends" have a birthday party.  He takes a bottle of red wine and a small black dog.  Once inside, he notices the guests drinking and dancing.  But before he could do any of this, the killer breaks in, grabs the dog and kills the guests.  What follows is a mad chase through the hotel where the killer murders at least 7 guests before finally getting away.   This is a fun film, but I can't think of a better movie to start my evening.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish the writers would change the names of the movies they were making. This is not the first one they made. They are not going to stop. I know that when they go into the theater to see it, they will not be in the mood to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a bad job this is. This movie has got nothing going for it: a boring story (where did the protagonist even come from?), poor acting (there's nothing that makes a good movie), an extremely stupid villain (he could be made out of a block), and stupid plot lines. The hero, as far as I can tell, is supposed to be the most powerful and skilled martial artist in the world but he can't even hold a candle to a lowly peasant who he meets in a cave. The film also had the unfortunate and unnecessary tendency to have the hero and the villan's daughter go from good to evil in the space of a few seconds. In fact, the plot was so bad it took me out of the movie in one scene. (See the pic of the villans daughter to get a better sense of just what a pathetic loser these people are. I mean she's so small she has to hold her legs in the air to show she's not wearing shoes.) The movie is so boring and so bad I have a feeling most people who like this will find it boring and bad. It has nothing going. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In case you haven't noticed this already, the first thing that strikes you about "Giant Monsters Under the Sea" is the movie's title. The story takes place in the late 1700's, and there's nothing particularly scary about it, although a few of the monsters look rather formidable. It is, however, a fairly entertaining, at least at first, movie with plenty of clever writing and memorable characters. It's a little silly at times, but most of the comedy is good and the story is more or less in keeping with the typical monster movies of the day. This is a fun little movie to watch and an enjoyable one at that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is one bad movie.   It's a boring, badly acted, painfully written, hackneyed, badly directed, and poorly acted movie. No wonder it got the bad movie award. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just so bad. The movie has an amazing opening, but the rest is just as bad. This movie was produced by a team that included a black guy named Tom Hanks, who has starred in so many bad movies, he should get a job in a carnival.  The film, called The Black Bikini, is about a young black woman who is looking for a guy who is going to give her a good time but she decides that it's not going to be a good way to meet the guy. I wish I had just spent the $5 on a cup of coffee. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A dull movie where a group of friends go to a lake where a movie is shown. The lake is very cold and it is not possible to swim. One of the girls accidentally drowns and she can't move, so there is another girl who has no idea what she is doing. The third girl, who was there when the other two fell in the water, is trying to pull the girl out with an ice-cream scoop. But the ice-cream doesn't get anywhere, and this leaves the girl lying on the lake, in the middle of the water with the ice cream still not making any progress. Then the girl's friend, who can swim, swears at her and tells her to hurry up and swim. The girl thinks for a second before deciding to swim and her friend swears again, but the girl doesn't think it is very funny and swims faster. She is able to pull herself out of the lake and she has gotten away with the girl. But then the girl looks at the ice Cream and is horrified to find out that it turned red. She looks back out at the lake thinking to herself that the ice and red are related. The other girl comes to the lake one last time hoping to catch the girl who is so out of breath, that when she reaches the middle to pull her out, the ice would catch her. The next day, the girl, with no recollection of what happened, goes to the same lake and it turns out that the red ice is now blue. She still can't swim and tries to get in the lake again, again and again. And when she is finally able to get into the lake she doesn't know where to swim...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The bad part about this movie is that there was no real effort to make this a good movie.  The first fifteen minutes consist of an extended scene of a child trying to kill his father with a crossbow. There's very little else that happened.  If this had been a bad film, the kids would have been given a good sendoff.  What made it a bad one was that it was a waste of a good story to begin with.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was awful.   The first 15 minutes showed absolutely no chemistry between the two leads.  This movie should have been "Diary of a Crazy" - an early horror/fantasy/romance with good acting, a little humor, and a dash of adventure.  It could have been, but somehow this film has more charm than charm - the chemistry between these two is like a rusty nail in the proverbial door.  They meet on a beach where they have some fun, and then she is captured by an evil witch, who then kidnaps a beautiful woman, whom we never find out who she is.  She escapes and they have a lot of fun in the car.  Then something terrible happens to them - they find themselves trapped in the trunk of a moving vehicle, and they go to a cabin, where there is a terrible storm.  The movie ends up being a little rushed, and the whole thing ends up in a very bad way.  I didn't think it was too bad in its time, and I thought it was well-acted and well-done.  If this is the only horror movie you are ever going to see, I say don't even bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film.  There are no real stories or emotions here.  If you are looking for a good bad movie this is not it.  There are a lot of people that think this is a good film but I just don't see how it is.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My friends and I were on a summer beach trip. All the guys were sitting in their underwear (except for me) when a "dude" walked by. I figured he was one of those local surfer guys who are in love with women, surfers, and the beautiful island. Instead, I saw a tall, thin man walking toward us. We didn't know what to make of him. We all were looking at him in fascination until he walked right into us! A couple of the guys yelled at him to get out of there, but nothing came out of him, so they all got up, looked at each other in confusion, and slowly walked away. I was really disappointed by this. My friends were totally humiliated when I turned around and told them "you never told me he was gonna be so hot!" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is basically a parody of a "classic" movie.  It's a story where the hero fights a dinosaur and his girlfriend (who has to be the best actress EVER).  It starts with "You can't have a dinosaur without a giraffe" and "It's only the beginning!"  Then a guy (not like a guy) gets sucked into a giant vacuum (you know what this means, right?).  Then the whole dinosaur story is made up again like the classic classic movie.   And the only thing that's different is that a girl turns into a dinosaur.   I don't know if the author is a genius or what, but I really think that he should write a book about that whole movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is stupid and the whole movie is just a very bad movie. And the worst part of the movie is that it has all the "Star Trek"-ish, Star Wars-"ish" scenes that you see on "Star Wars: A New Hope" (not even close to what was filmed in "Star Destroyers"). This makes "Return of the Jedi" look like "The Empire Strikes Back". This is one of those films that seems like it was made on a Saturday Night and it shows. It is also a film so bad it makes one wonder if Lucas didn't really plan to make a "Trek"-like film all this time. But instead, he wanted to do a sci-fi action flick with a Star Wars like story. Why he couldn't have gone to "Star Quest" (which is about a space-ninja movie) and taken a different path, I will never know...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A remake of a good movie.   The one and only bad movie of 1990. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so excited to see this movie that it's as if a little cloud has settled over me. Not because the movie itself is bad (which is, admittedly, not the case) but because of the ridiculous, over-the-top acting. From the very first to last shot there's little doubt in my mind that these actors are in complete on-the set-jock mode. They're all just screaming "WOW!" over and over and, if you're watching this film expecting it to be good, then you're in for a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I haven't heard much about this one, but from what I can see, it is not going to be all that memorable.  There is a reason why so few movies feature the legendary actor George Hamilton.  It is not just his acting ability that makes him so good.  His acting is so perfect that it sometimes resembles a child's drawings.  If you want to see the movie with the man in it, then you will not be disappointed.  The movie looks wonderful, especially in a theater.  This is not an action movie, but is a rather boring movie that will make you want nothing more than to curl up in a ball in the fetal position and watch the clock.  George Hamilton does his thing to perfection.  As an actor, George Hamilton is one of the best ever.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a big movie fan.  It's my favorite genre:    "Truly a great film," writes John W. Campbell in "The Chicago Tribune." "One of the funniest films I ever saw."   As a child, I loved to watch this movie when I was sick, then I grew older and more interested in watching things I wasn't supposed to.   I've seen a few other movies based on the series but this movie is my favorite because it is the most realistic and believable.  The cast, including the cast of The Wonder Years, did an awesome job portraying a good-time movie in 1950.  It's one of the first movies I can't watch anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A poor movie with poor acting, bad writing, bad effects and an atrocious ending.    This poor movie was never in production when it was first made.  As I say in my introduction to this horrible movie, it was released on video in 1991.  A number of movie reviews show that it had quite a reputation in 1991 for good acting and a poor script.  Unfortunately most of the good reviews are by people who haven't seen the movie since 1991, and all of the bad reviews are from people who've seen it more than 20 years ago.  Despite the bad acting, poor acting and poor script this movie is still a poor movie, and as such it is probably one of the worst made that you could see.  The story is stupid.  Who cares if the guy dies?  This is a horror movie in which no one is killed.  There are no monsters, and no monsters do die.  It is all set up like a horror flick, in which the "hero" is supposed to die, then, of course, he does!  This isn't even suspenseful.  In fact, the whole movie is just stupid and boring.  When it first premiered in 1991 it was rated "A" on The Movie Database.  Later on in 1991 the movie was "A-" on The Video Guide to Action Horror Movies.  This means that it was not nearly good enough to be labeled as a good movie.  Now, of that the directors can be held responsible.  But the script by the screenwriter is a disaster, in no way a good script!  Even the people in the film are stupid, and they are all killed.   Not once!  I know that they all have a way of dying.  Is this movie fun?  Yes!  In my opinion this movie should be shown in the science department of your high school, or your elementary school, in case they don't have a science department in their school.  At least it would teach the kids about science, if they didn't learn about physics already in class.  I can't really do much more than just give you the rating of this bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another crappy science fiction film, where an alien robot named Mr. Gogol (Michael Shannon, I have a few names from the movies stuck in my head) is created and is used to conquer the Earth, then he is destroyed by an Earthling who is a good guy with a gun named Mr Stegman (Alan Rickman) who is very good at shooting at him, who has been programmed to shoot at Mr. Guogol and his robot body. This film is a long, boring and boring film, with no special effects, and no special characters and no original plot. The movie is over in about 12 minutes or so, and the bad guys are killed off and the good guys win. A little more imagination in a future where we can have all kinds of aliens and robots would make the movie very interesting, but the film is so boring that I can't get through it without stopping it to look at people running around in space. I am afraid this movie will be all right once I have finished my popcorn at the movies, but I doubt I will ever watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is a pretty bad mess. There is no way I could watch this film. First off it is in French! I had to translate that because it is a mess. The film has a terrible French actor playing a French character. If he were to speak in English I would be so confused about what he is saying. Then there is an English-French language mix and it is just wrong. The actor did not do his French at all and in fact he did not say a word at all! You see if you have seen this film, you know I must give this film zero stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main problem with this movie is that the lead actor - a young, pretty girl - can't act and has an uninteresting body and a lame performance. The bad part is that he's a bit too much of a clown, too, so it's kind of hard to get into the plot. I don't usually like bad movies, and it's no wonder that this was the only one I enjoyed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm sure there are at least a few people that are surprised by this movie. It is a very different kind of comedy. In fact, I thought it was an odd choice for a movie of that title. It has something to do with the fact that "Hail Satan" is a bit off-center, and in the end it loses a lot of energy. However, you can't expect much of a comedy from this movie, especially when its characters are as lame as this one is.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me, this is a film that is one-sidedly a failure. It is about a man that works for the government and as an ex-naval officer. He is a loner and has never been married. He runs a bakery, and when he gets sick, the government offers him a cure. At first this is not a success. The bakery is good, but he is not happy. His marriage has been unhappy since childhood. The other women are all ugly. His boss, who is of the same age as the man, and they are good friends and enjoy each other's company. There are a couple of scenes that were very good and enjoyable: a nice trip to a country resort, two nice girls talking about their lives. The only problem with it was the acting, and it is a good movie and a good performance by Tom Hanks in it. One thing to think about is that this movie has a very dark side, and for all the good that it does for the characters it is still a very depressing movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only time I've seen a movie like this one was when I was a young adult. I loved this movie. I was born in the sixties. I remember when "The Godfather" hit theaters and I was eight years old. When I saw that I can still smell the popcorn from my grandmother's oven as she heated it that morning for dinner. I could smell the fear in that movie. It scared me to death. It was not the kind of movie that I saw for the first time until I was thirty years old, and that movie was, "Rocky." The second one scared me. The "Godfather" scared me the way "Godzilla" scared all the kids I saw in their school buses. I would see this movie and I would be just as scared as they were. In this movie, a man gets into the wrong house with a group of friends. I love this movie to death and if I had my time again I would bring all my friends and family to this movie as well. - August 22, 2006Just the right amount of terror
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst horror film I have ever seen!   This is a stupid movie, and a stupid one at that.    Why do these people want to make a movie about a group of guys who like to kill each other?   It has no story!  It is the story of a group who live in a cabin in the woods and try to murder each other in the dark, and no one in this movie gives a rat's ass what happens in the story.    What is the point of this film?  There is no plot!  There are no characters!  No one in the movie acts or reacts in any way!  This movie has been made by idiots who just sit around doing nothing and drinking beer.  There has not been a film in a long time that has looked more like a cheap action film with a plot, and there hasn't been a bad action film since The Rock.  Why did people pay $20 to see a stupid film about stupid people that are stupid and stupid? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never thought I'd say, "I'll wait until next week!" after seeing "The Devil Inside".   My only reason for waiting is the fact I've got some free time during this Sunday evening, but I'm not going to let that get in my way!   The film opens in England with some shots from the roof of Buckingham Palace, the camera following Prince Philip (Paul Rudd) as he is climbing over the rail.   He's at the top, and the camera pans in on his face.    He smiles, looks to the left, then to the right, then back, then smiles again, and then he's off!    It's a great shot, and it's also got an interesting bit of dialogue.  When asked how old he was, Prince Philip replies "I've never been old!"   After a short chase scene, the movie follows Prince Philip as he meets with a group of people who are looking at a photo of him (from before the accident.)   It seems a little strange for a photo that was taken months ago to be there now.  The guy with the camera looks into the camera and laughs.  "I'm not a photograph"   Prince Philip is also being followed by the group, and they've put his photo in a box.  When he realizes that, he heads off, and we then follow him as he drives through the night until he reaches a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere.  It's very strange because, while the farm looks rather rural, there are no windows or doors, and he arrives at the house in his car.  A little later, we see Prince Philip at a dinner table with people who have gathered, including the lady he was with earlier.  This dinner scene is one of the most bizarre, and even the most brilliant ones tend to have something wrong with them.  One guy, who we see wearing a blue suit, is wearing what looks like a red cap.  Another guy wears a white suit, and his hand is hanging limp around his wrist.  There is no way the man is able to move that fast!  The camera pulls back from the table and pans up to Prince Philip's face.     This is a little awkward at first, but eventually he's able to look around the room at the other people and smiles.  I can't see how a man with this many problems could be able to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a boring remake of the same old film.  The story is the same, the acting is the exact same, but I would not want to watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie is an absolutely boring, over-the-top, and utterly ridiculous comedy, the kind you'd see on 'The Tonight Show,' starring Eddie Murphy and Jerry Seinfeld.  The main character, who is a cartoon-like caricature, is voiced by the hilariously obnoxious and over-acting Johnny Knoxville, complete with fake Irish accent.   As I've mentioned in a few other reviews, I was initially going to watch the movie with a friend, but I was so completely and thoroughly turned off by the horrible comedy, I didn't even want to sit through a movie about what a bad show it was, and left the theater frustrated, furious, and disappointed, even though I was in the same theatre when the film first came out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love this movie: a bunch of kids in some bad ass space adventures.    When I was in the 7th grade my mom took me to see Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (I know, I know, it was crap. But the plot was hilarious and the kids were a bunch to watch).  The next day I asked my mom what happened. I got to go to the science fair and I was supposed to meet a girl that my friend's mom would pick up for me. I remember that I was really excited, because I had the best science fair experience in my entire life, and I remember the exact date I met her:  My science fair memories:    Now that I think about it I wasn't really a kid in that movie. I was only in seventh grade and I didn't know what I was doing in that film. I still remember looking up into the star ships and the awesome science that they did. They actually did something, I swear!   A lot of people have told me that I looked like Obi Wan Kenobi because they said that there was a black guy in my hair, and my mom, and that's where the black guy came from! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sad film that has nothing of worth to give.  It is boring, slow, dull, and utterly useless.  The film follows a poor orphan boy who happens to be a "daredevil" with superhuman strength (he fights crime in the city with a wooden sword).  His mother's name is Edith, but he is not even sure where she is.  After a tragic accident, he is taken to a hospital and is "fixed" (by doctors) with a "stun gun".  Edith has already died and her brother who also seems like a "hero" died a few years earlier.  That is not the end of the tragedy, however.      He is kidnapped and taken to another dimension where the evil forces come out to rule the Earth.  This is just a series of bad clichés.   The story involves Edith's death, a "superhero" named "Killer" (and his equally bad sidekick) and a girl that has the power to turn invisible and hear what people are thinking.  I found these characters to be the most unoriginal "superhuman" villains (and I mean really), and the main character seems to be only there to look "pretty".  Even the most "innocent" scenes are filled with unnecessary violence and sex.  And worst of all, the ending is so predictable and is completely meaningless.   I was shocked at the film's length, which was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  But since it is supposed to be "a love story", it is only slightly less boring than one could expect.  No, it's an empty movie filled with clichés and bad scripts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very bad movie. I have watched this movie a few times and every time I have had to leave with a big smile. Why? It is a wonderful, funny, imaginative, and thought-provoking comedy. Not to say that the film is a masterpiece by any means, but it is an excellent comedy and, as far as I'm concerned, an above average one at that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If your favorite movie has the word "faggot" in it then your a fag. If you enjoy a bad film then you will. I have seen this movie in three theaters and in front of three completely different audiences. In each theater we were seated at tables with our own food and drink. After the third time this movie was done I could not watch anymore. This has been in every theater for about a year and still not a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For the most part, the plot is really, really bad. In the beginning of the movie, the main character (Chris) has just lost his girlfriend, and has been out drinking with some friends. The next morning, he wakes up, alone, with a broken leg. At first he thinks it's just another night at the office, until he realizes that he was shot in the leg. So he decides he's going to pretend he was hit by a truck and then call in a couple of the friends to help him. At the hospital, he meets the guy who shot him. He is a professional hit man. Chris is pretending to be dead, and he tells him that he got the shot in his leg from an old guy's leg. The old guy has had an accident, and his leg is crippled. So the old man is going to help the old guy get out of it. But after a while, Chris decides he can't pretend anymore. Chris has seen that he has the power to take away someone's life, he just needs to wait until he is close to death. So that day, Chris pretends to be a quadriplegic, and then goes home and puts the old dude in a wheelchair, and calls in his friends. Chris takes a bullet right in the center of his body.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main plot of this movie is completely ridiculous. After the first act we find that the entire world is controlled by a totalitarian cult which worships a gigantic, demonic squid! The entire world was once the paradise of mankind, and now they are living in an "evil empire" in which they all run through a series of horrific trials, like being trapped in a prison and getting eaten by fish! As usual, the villain is presented as a very cunning, evil, very sadistic, very evil person. As he puts it in his evil lair, he doesn't want us to think that he's a very bad person. He's a rather good man and a pretty nice guy, which is why he was chosen to be the leader. The first act is the cult's introduction to us and it's a little odd. It's a few episodes in the future and the citizens of the world have all been re-instated to a world of normal life, but the government is still the same and the cult still operates within the secret government. It seems a little strange that we're watching a world that's been "taken over" from this cult, as we know the government took it over in the first place. It all has a weird, almost unreal quality to it. The whole movie is very silly, very cheap, and very unfunny. The most annoying thing about this film is how the director is trying to make his movie so "different". I mean, it's supposed to be an "extreme" film, not a "tough" one! Anyway, this is really a pretty lame movie. This is one of those low budget, bad-ass, cheap-looking, un-ironic exploitation movies. Just like the cult, the movie just tries to take you to a crazy place and makes you laugh while you're trapped!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're not a film buff, then you're a film fool. I didn't even realize the film is made up of old clips from old silent films. If you can't make it out, then I suggest you don't bother watching any more of the original ones. They're all pretty damn stupid anyway.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The thing you must realize if you're a Christian, is that Jesus never said anything about death.   He said about the resurrection that "he is not dead, he is living."   This would seem to mean that people will get back to normal eventually.  The problem here is that this whole story was about a very specific problem:  If Jesus had told people that the sun would rise in the morning and set in the evening that's a story about Jesus' time in the desert.  And this desert was in Palestine which is a place where Jews don't live any more. But as a "Christian" I'm supposed to believe that Jesus was the last of his tribe.  Well, actually no. I'll bet you money that the people in the stories were Jews.  I'm really not trying to start a religion here.  To make matters worse, we know that Jesus' resurrection is really not true because he didn't wake up the following day.  In other words, he went through the entire day without seeing any sunrise or sunset. I'm pretty sure that's not possible.  Now this doesn't sound too bad. But Jesus' followers had to go through days, weeks, even months of a total blackout.  Again, I'm not trying start a church here. But you can take anything the Bible says and take it to its extreme.  This is, for me, one of the most depressing stories ever to be told.  It seems that this was actually a bad idea for a story.  The sun rises and the sun sets in a country that doesn't live today. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The one star is because a friend of mine has seen it and told me that it is terrible. She went into a local theater with her parents and it's not even a good movie.  The title is quite misleading, but I am sure she will be surprised as to how bad this movie really is.   It is so bad that it makes me want to vomit.  It would be funny if the movie was bad but not this bad.  I can only see this as a bad rip off of the 1990's Batman franchise.  That is to say: a bad, over-the-top, violent and stupid Batman movie from the 90s.  Even though I know this isn't very good in my book, it would be fun to see Batman in a new costume. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry I had to, but for all the fun I had at the beginning when the movie started out as "Hoop-La!," and then, after a while, became just a little too funny and entertaining, but with some really good performances, I never got tired of it.  The action scenes were pretty good, but I can't understand the "man-on-top" thing. That is supposed to be a good move.  I liked the movie and found it a lot of fun, and I'm glad I finally found a "B" rated comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A really bad movie that is a little disturbing at times. In the future, the people will work much better, but they are not nearly so productive. A lot of people will die of heart attacks or just being old or poor. In this film, you can see the results. The poor and sick are left to rot in a field that will soon be covered by a massive field. It is a scene of horror.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My son had a lot of fun with the movie. The movie stars the most annoying man in Hollywood! Don't take the name of Mr. Rogers literally, this is a guy from New York. He came up to the Big Apple and, in a little movie about a horse and man, he comes to life. This is a man whose ego is beyond belief and who wants everyone to know that! He is an actor. He is not from here at all but he decided that he was and he became an instant celebrity. He lives on a farm in the country where he plays the part of a little man who is a farmer and a horseman. This guy, I mean he has been in so many TV shows, is so uninspiring. His voice is just bad. It isn't even that bad because it isn't bad like, well, Mr. O'Bannon, but it is bad. I mean it is just dreadful. He doesn't even try. You can just tell you have watched a bunch of people playing a guy that can't act. When the movie was over my son gave me a good, hard look, but I said to him, I have to get back into bed. I didn't care anymore about this movie. If you see the movie, you will not care about it. I don't recommend it. If he wants an audience to think that he has an important message then he shouldn't be in this movie! It is not worth watching!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In its original incarnation, The Big Sleep was about a small town in the middle of nowhere. It was set in a period of time of small scale Americana where the most dangerous thing you could do was play baseball. There's an old town called West Lafayette which was once a prosperous town where the rich people lived on the second floor while the poor people lived in the third floor. The town is now run by a tyrannical mayor who does his best to get the town to turn into a huge town full of small towns. The film is shot using black and white photography, and this is a film with the atmosphere of being shot with black and whites instead of color film. This has the same effect on the audience as having black and a white frame. There was a lot of tension in this film because there's no resolution. There really was no reason to want to be watching this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A little more work could have made this film better.   The premise is a little dull.  This is just a couple of teenagers who have a few beers and the local bar is closing.  Not much happens and when the bar closes the teenagers get bored, go on a picnic and decide to sleep in a tent near a swamp (I don't know who this guy is. It is a nice scenery but I could never believe that the teenagers would come up with this idea). The swamp seems pretty nice too, you can camp there if you like (not sure that I would), it is pretty cool but I am glad that the teens came up with a plan because it was pretty stupid.  As they sleep the girl in the tent snores loudly and one of the teenagers wakes up.  She runs out and cries and then runs back to the tent.  Her mom is talking to some other girls from school who were in the forest.  The girls talk with the mother about how to get help from the cops and it looks like the mom knows the girl because the girl has been in a mental institution the day before. The girl is now on the path to becoming a serial killer.  Now the teens all get together and decide that they need to go to a police station because they will be in trouble if they don't and they all head to the police station.  It is obvious from the trailer that it is going to be a movie filled with teenagers who get into trouble, drink beer and get into pranks (I can only imagine this movie would end with them all getting caught in a big trap and getting nailed by a bunch of angry cops).  It has some of the clichés that are found in the horror genre but for a movie that is being made for children to be rated PG-13 should raise a few eyebrows (although it does not seem to).  I am very disappointed in this movie but I guess that's what I get for being a parent of a kid who like to play "Catch a Killer" with me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A story of a group of people traveling in Siberia.   The setting is pretty interesting.  First we get a bit of an introduction in which everyone talks about how they are the same as a bunch of jerks. Then we go right into a long shot of a truck, a small village, and a snowy road. This is where we get to see the real, non-imaginary "jerk" attitude of the crew.  This is very well done as a depiction of the Russian experience.  I would have liked to have seen more shots of the trucks as there is quite a bit more snow than expected (see it here ).   But the story is not very interesting. The main character, an elderly woman named Leda, tells of a "fairyland" where people are afraid of the cold, where a man once saved a princess from drowning with his bare hands, and where the princess loves the prince who is her favorite fairy.  She is really just another, similar-sounding Russian fairy tale character who does whatever she can to attract men.  Leda's husband, a "good old Russian man," is just as unimpressive.  He is just a drunken, drunken drunk. He's in a state of drunken drunkenness most of the time.  It is never clear to me where this movie is supposed to go or what it is supposed the to be about. It is certainly not in the realm of fairy tale literature as that would be absurd. It just seems like a movie about people who don't know what to do with themselves.  Overall:  A strange, sometimes comical movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a poor excuse for a Western. We got this far in the movie through a man who talks on a walkie talkie so badly he makes the movie almost unlistenable.  I have to admit, it would be pretty cool if this sort of thing would become common.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is ridiculous, the acting is laughable and the story has no sense. The worst of it is that it is a story about the "Crazy Horse" character. This "crazy horse" character is a complete wannabe to the point of being stupid. It does not even really act like a horse; it looks like a big white man wearing a red cape. You can almost see the white man in the screen. It is a total joke. It looks like the creators have never seen a movie. The only thing that it actually does right is the opening sequence. It shows a horse trying to get out of a big box but it is no match for the box.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would love to like this movie. I have heard that director John Badham loves to make movies about the early days of rock 'n' roll. As a result, he and his crew make a good movie. There are enough jokes and one-liners to keep you laughing.    I really like the title, Rock, 'n', Roll. That's probably the movie's best claim to fame, at least until Rock and Roll Part II and the sequel Rock n' Roll Part III come out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just a dumb comedy that is made by a guy who is not very talented in that field.   I guess it's ok to be a big dumb comedian, I do not get that.  I wish they would hire someone who could actually write a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of the most pathetic films I've seen. The cast all has the same laugh lines, no matter how bad the plot, or the quality of the acting. I'm glad to see that at least a couple of these bad movies will no longer be in circulation.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never thought I'd be writing about a horror movie with a positive review, but this time it's different. This movie is creepy without really being too gruesome or scary. The acting is pretty solid too. If you get into the right mood, it'll bring back great memories, if not your own.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this to be a good movie. There was a lot of heart involved and you felt the emotion of the film. It was good and I liked it. It seemed a little rushed at times though. The ending was a little too abrupt and didn't go in the direction I was hoping for. But I wasn't expecting a romantic movie, and I think the director (who I believe is also a musician) made a good effort at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bless your hearts for this movie.  It stars the great and hilarious Christopher Walken and is pretty much an endless series of slapstick jokes involving Walken's impersonation of different characters.  The only negative thing about this movie is the long, drawn out time between takes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never been a big fan of the old Indiana Jones movies. I wasn't a big big fan growing up either. I still haven't seen all the movies, but I have seen most of them. It always seemed like they tried to do too much, and too little.  The Indiana Jones Chronicles  is one of the movies that I have always avoided. Even though I was a huge fan of this movie as a kid I have not seen the second one. This movie is so bad that it is hard to imagine it getting any decent reviews when the last one was so good.    This movie takes place in 1930s Egypt where a wealthy industrialist finds a tomb in a deserted Egyptian village which contains the skull of an Egyptian goddess. To the surprise of all, the old guy from the previous movie is still alive. This is a long series of short stories that has been repeated over and over again and it seems like the director never knows what the next movie is going to be like. The movie starts out in Egypt and it is not long before a giant robot makes it's way through the desert.  A guy runs up to the hero and says "Where are you going, Indiana Jones?". The guy says "I have a lot to do today and you don't need to worry about me.  One of the stories has the hero finding a giant mummy in a remote area that is not very dangerous at all. However the guy who is supposed to be the old man in the background just disappears. This may seem like the hero is running around in the desert alone but guess what? He is surrounded by four guys with shotguns who are ready to shoot the hero.  It is at this point that I really started to get mad at this movie. There were too many things happening at the same time.  At this point the old Greek guy shows up in the town and it turns out that he knows the tomb is there. He tells the hero that he will need a sword to go through the tomb and that the sword can be found on the back of a mummy.  The hero finds this mummy and he takes the sword out of the mummy's mouth.   The next scene shows a huge flying spaceship which flies up to this massive tomb. It then drops out of it's hole and lands in a tomb that appears to be empty.  This giant tomb is in fact full of all kinds of weird things.  In the next story, the hero finds a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While I did like this movie a lot, it did have a few problems I had with the movie, such as:  (1)   The director, Kevin Smith, really should be ashamed of himself because his movie, as it stands, is very mediocre.   When you watch this movie, you should be glad that you went to see this, you're going to wish there were more comedy to it, because the comedy is just a bit boring.  The movie, of course, has a lot of good action and it's nice to see Kevin Smith try something different.  It has some funny action scenes and some good laughs.  Also, one of my favorite actors, Adam Baldwin, is in this film.  (2)  The opening was a bit long, and it took me quite a while to get into the movie.  Even then, I did not care for it.  I feel like it's better as a DVD extra to be sure, it's not much more than some scenes from the previous movies and that's it.     This movie did not make me laugh all that much, but I did laugh a few times, maybe that was just the shock value that I was getting from watching it. However, there was a lot more of that than the average movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was at a movie theater the other night when a movie that I had never heard of was screened. I had seen a few movies since then, but this was new to me. I was interested in seeing it, but I was not thrilled. The acting was bad, and the plot was lame. It was just a typical western with no charm or originality, and it made me tired quickly. I wanted to see a better western, or a good comedy. In fact, I wanted nothing more than to just turn it off. I felt bad for the director because he had a lot of talent but couldn't pull this film off.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not see The Godfather.    It is very clear to me that people just don't like Frank Sinatra.  They are all afraid of his name being connected with the movies.  I also have the feeling that people are more afraid of Sinatra having more success than he did.  That the Godfather was such a flop was evident as soon as I started seeing people at a screening of the film.  In a way the film was better than the TV show and the book.  After a very long and painful reading of the book I found myself looking forward to the actual playing of the movie, which actually happened.  My experience with Sinatra was very limited, as I only saw him perform once.  It was at a charity banquet at the Waldorf Astoria.  Apparently Frank Sinatura was the guest of honor.  Some people at this event had been waiting outside for hours for a glimpse of Sinaturia.  A limousine was waiting.  Sinatra got out and walked up to the car.  The limousines of the time were usually parked right in the parking lot so they could be easily parked and taken off, like they were cars that had been sitting there, but never had time to be moved.  All four passengers got in.  There were about a dozen people in the cars.  As they got closer to the Waldord Astoria, the temperature of the air began to rise.  But the weather was not good that night and a very heavy, thick cloud was over the East Bay.  When the driver arrived at the hotel, he found the air conditioning in the hotel not working.  At a time like that, it was difficult to believe anyone could be wearing a dress and makeup, and be dressed like a man.  Another person in the car had to be removed from it, but there was no one else there.  Now they had to turn on the air con.  Frank Sinate was wearing a beautiful, flowing, yellow dress, and a beautiful head of hair, with a beautiful smile.  This was not an acting job like some films were.  Just to show off a man like this, Sinatra pulled a chair out of the car, sat on it, and then climbed up into it.  He had on high heels.  You could see his feet.  His dress was a high heeled, knee high, yellow silk dress with gold
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just finished the last film of the series with little fanfare. It's not that it wasn't very good, it was, but what I really found memorable about it is how all the characters felt real and human. This series was all about the characters' journeys, and seeing each of them grow was just great! I guess the worst thing I can say about the film was that I only liked two of the five main characters, which is more than I like about a lot of the shows in the late 90's (which is to say, not a lot). I will also say that they were almost all pretty much the same from season to season - a teenager whose boyfriend is cheating on her (I'm not sure that is all that interesting of a plot), an evil genius who is plotting to become the world's most powerful man (also not a very interesting plot), and a guy who is trying to make a movie by using the last remaining fossilized animal from the Jurassic period. Overall, it's a pretty good show, though I wasn't all that enthusiastic about most of the parts of it (especially the acting, I'll give a spoiler: it was pretty bad).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was totally excited to see this when it was announced. I really like the idea that one day a giant robot called a Mascot could be built. They built a prototype out of wood that looked nothing like anything else they had ever seen before. They would get a second prototype for their kids that was even more spectacular! It looks just like a giant metal monster with the head, torso, arms and a long tail attached to it. It has a big, goofy head of a clown, a huge, funny mouth with large smiley-face eyes, and all of that on a long metal "neck". The tail is just a metal bar running down the side of a giant monster that looks like it's made of rubber. At one point the Mascots were trying to get out of a pit and were crushed underneath by the Mascaros, a giant flying monster that they built out of some old junk. They all got away, except for one poor Mascote who went under the water and never got back up. This movie was a complete disaster. It's funny how people never seem to learn from the mistakes of the past. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My girlfriend was sick and tired of me going on and on about how much I wanted to watch this movie, and she told me I was going to hate it. But she was right. It was horrible! It was absolutely, positively not worth the time or the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched a documentary on the American slave trade which was pretty damn interesting. But, I found it a little hard to watch.   A girl named Sally (who is played by Rosanna Arquette ) takes to running a slave market. She is not like the movie shows. She has a great deal of respect for other slaves and a lot of them like her. I didn't like what happened to her when she tries to run the business, and the people in her employ. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the filmmakers really want to scare the audience. The film has a sense of paranoia, even if that fear is completely unfounded. There is no real danger at all, and the killer's motive is not very clear to me. It is almost like an old western movie, where people who run away from the bad guy are always the last to die. The final act is extremely silly and doesn't fit into the film at all. I don't see the point of having it be a chase sequence with the killer being chased by police. I think if they wanted to add a new angle to the story, they could have created a new character and a new motive. This film is a huge bore, and not something I would recommend at all to horror fans.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is the weakest film on the list.  I guess they were trying to make a different kind of movie?  It is nothing but the old "I'm not a nice guy" routine again...with a few variations.  There are just no original ideas.  A great idea for a buddy comedy is for the guy to buy a car and drive it around town.  But the guys are all bad drivers.  The cars are always so tired that it is a wonder the guy goes anywhere.  And they never seem to make it to the next movie.  So it is the same stuff over and over again.  Just an average, boring, stupid, overrated movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that there is something not very human about the way that the film is presented.  The main characters are in the act of getting ready for a big trip by getting married, leaving for a new life, etc.  This is an interesting way to set the tone.  As time passes, it begins to look as if the trip isn't going to happen and that these guys just have to take it.  When the trip never happens we are left waiting and then the film becomes quite creepy.   I feel like I'm being watched.  I was also not very impressed with the music.  Some of the songs do sound good, but not as good as it should be.  To be more specific, I did not feel like there was any music in the film that had a purpose beyond being there to make the film seem more dramatic.  That is not to say that the movie doesn't have a purpose.  There are some nice moments to be had, particularly during the first two quarters of the film.  It was not a particularly good film, but I was not really surprised.  Even though the film was shot on 35 mm film (which it used) I did find the grain to be off on at least one or two of the scenes and on at the worst the film looked very cheap.  A low production value really got the film off on the wrong foot.  Perhaps the film could have been better, but it wasn't bad, it was just not all that much.  If you are into strange stories about people who just can't get out of bed...  A pretty good one in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I never liked the movie "The Godfather" in the first place. I had some pretty strong reactions to it as a kid, but I always remembered it as the "Rambo of the late 70's", which is pretty much a joke. But now, in my mid-30's, I can actually remember it pretty well. I have a hard time remembering what the main point of it was, but it was certainly not as good as I remember it. I really felt like it got a bad rep and I would imagine my mother was not impressed with it either. It was a pretty good action movie though, I remember a lot of the set-pieces being pretty cool. Even if you don't like the movies, I always thought that "The Dark Knight" was a good movie. It doesn't have the sense of style like the other movies in the series, but if you like a good action film, this is the one. I like it even more now since it's being made again. I've seen the new "Batman" and I've enjoyed it as well. The only reason I can't give it a five is because the first two thirds are just a bit weak. I know a lot about the movies that came before this one, so it's not like I don't know why it was rated as low as it was. This review was written during the first part of June and it's been a very hot and humid summer so far. It seems like the days are not getting any better! I like watching films in summertime in my garden when the sun is shining. My friend Tom and I watched it on a sunny Saturday evening and it was a little tough. There was a nice mix of action and adventure. I'm sure that this is my favorite of the series. I didn't want to like it, but when I saw how cool it looked on the big screen I really liked it. It's a good film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For years my brother and I have listened to my grandfather read stories of his travels around the world, as well as his experiences in the U.S., and we were always impressed. The last two tales in his book, "America by Car," which I loved so much, were a perfect capstone for a fantastic summer. I'm going to be very sad to see the end of the story, which I haven't heard of since I was a child, so a big thank you to Mr. King for a classic book. - April 6, 2005Great story! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't think it was going to be great, but I've got to say this is better than I thought it would be.   The story doesn't follow the story it's based on.  But this is the only way to do it.  It's a good story with some great moments.  One of the more compelling parts of the movie was a scene at the end of the first act in which the young lovers make a pact to see each other at least once a week.  I thought for sure they would finally be together on the big screen.  They would probably fight for a bit but not as much as they did in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting in this one is atrocious. The script has nothing funny about it. It has no redeeming qualities. The only thing that keeps me watching is how bad this movie gets. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is there to say about this awful film? It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The film is all shot in low light and the actors are all playing the same roles: a young gay man who gets abducted by the devil in a black robe; a gay demon who dresses up and calls himself the devil; a man whose soul has been stolen by the demon to torment him; the gay demon's girlfriend (played by the same actress who played the demon); a small girl who seems to have been hit by a truck and who is just terrified of the demon and the devil. The only redeeming feature of this awful movie is the music by Alan Menken, which would be better at a musical than a horror film. The acting is pathetic as well, as the demons and the devils appear to be the only two actors worth watching, and the acting isn't bad at all. I wish the film was in black and white, because it would be far more tolerable. I was hoping that the film would make a better impression by bringing some good actors to the production, as it had some interesting characters, including several gay actors that didn't try to look like they were actually gay.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why people hate "The Avengers" so much: the movie has nothing to do with the comic book. It's simply another run-of-the-mill superhero movie with an awful story and a bland cast. The story, which is supposed to take place after the events of the first "Avengers" movie, doesn't help matters either. The main character, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), is a former pilot who spends his time as a gun-toting vigilante (he has a gun in every scene), hunting bad guys. The only person he really cares about is his girlfriend, who is a nurse who works at a hospital and is basically useless for anything else. Renner's Hawkeye is the only good thing about the movie, but the rest of the cast is almost as bad as Renner: Robert Downey, Jr. and Don Cheadle, who do more to sell their dialogue than act, are not exactly likable. And the only part of the movie that is really entertaining is an opening monologue by a character who is played by Chris Hemsworth. The movie itself is very predictable and very poorly acted. It has nothing of the fun of the comic books, in my opinion, and has only one real highlight, the opening credit sequence by the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame (which is the best credits sequence in the history of cinematic history). If you like action and explosions with a little bit of comic relief, check it out, but if you're looking for a comic book movie with real heart, I don't think it will do the trick.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad it's funny. Not because of the plot, which, I guess, is a pretty standard tale of a group of losers who have to deal with a bunch of jerks and the cops with the help of their new friend, the local dog named Charlie. However, this movie is actually all about how the plot is completely bullshit. Charlie is a pit bull! Pit bulls are evil, stupid animals who have no manners, are incapable of any intelligence, are aggressive and always want to bite and beat people to death. I don't think they were ever supposed to be anything else. The plot consists of the cop being attacked by a bunch, and all of the other cops being attacked and the dog being attacked again... and again... because of something that happens when the cops are going to take the dog to the dog pound! It's hilarious! The cops think the dogs are dangerous and should be destroyed and I don?t think so, because they can't stop them! It?s an incredibly stupid, silly, silly movie and I wouldn?t recommend it to anyone. It's a complete waste of money and time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   . I was told it would be a good movie.   I'd never seen any of their previous movies but it seemed to be set in the 80s and the lead roles (the old blacksmith and the old cowgirl) were well cast and the acting was good.  This was supposed to be a drama movie. This movie should be about a farmer and his daughter and not about the old black and the cow.  The movie was set in a small town in Oregon and it was a pretty decent movie. The ending is a pretty lame way to end the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To all of you who are into it; this is just a movie about kids who make dumb videos about cars. The animation itself is good enough for a kid's cartoon and the story is quite good, but I have to say that I have watched the Japanese version of this movie in Japanese and was pretty shocked by the terrible voice acting in this version, I couldn't understand a word the first time I saw it! It was kind of funny at first; they gave it a funny and stupid name, but the voice acting and jokes about cars is just ridiculous.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie takes place in 1970, right near the time of the infamous moon landing. So it's kind of like the movie "Back to the Future". Except it's less interesting because it doesn't have a time machine. But the story is pretty interesting. The lead actress has a terrible voice (I don't even know how to describe it), her breasts are constantly swinging, and they almost always swing around the entire screen. The guy is also a big dummy, and it's so boring to watch him! I don't know what the point was of this movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie for the simple fact that I don´t like boobs.  Cliche review: I don`t know why I bothered with this movie, since it had already been seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is about as far down the road as it's possible to go.

A horrible movie in every respect. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not usually a horror film buff, but The Witch was excellent. It is a very old fashioned horror film, not in a cheesy way, but in a way that is true to the horror film genre. You can see why this film would appeal to audiences like me. It doesn't do a good job in capturing fear and terror, but it does capture a sense of foreboding and terror that is not often seen in the genre. I found this film not only entertaining, but terrifying as well, and not to mention it is well written and acted throughout the film. What more could you want from a film that was made in 1896? So it goes without saying that I enjoyed The Witch, but I am sure many will too.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was the worst of the bad, one that was so bad it seemed to be trying to be so much more than it was. The acting is dreadful and a number of characters that should have been killed off had the writers thought that a good way to get rid of them would be to put them in the same story line so they would share the screen together. That way they would at least seem to be friends and not enemies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a classic piece of shit. It's supposed to be about a man who is having an affair with his wife's sister and so the wife finds him and brings him to her family so he can explain to them what they were seeing. This would be a fine movie with a great director and actors, but no such luck. There are scenes, like a car chase, that would be brilliant, and you'd get a real laugh out of this. The acting is terrible and the story, even the characters, all just look awful. There was even a moment where a character is talking about how they'd really like to have sex. I found it utterly unfunny and ridiculous. I don't even like to watch crappy movies because I am too tired after working for most of the day and it's impossible to keep up with this crap. It could only have been shot on a budget of a few hundred dollars, so it doesn't get any better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is a retelling of the "Jurassic Park" movies with a new protagonist: a young college graduate who makes a living doing photography of dinosaur tracks. There's a bit of a story here but the main story is the dinosaur tracks which are in turn based on the real tracks of the real dinos, as reported by paleontologists such as Dr. John S. Mariottini in his book on the subject.  At about 1:15 into the movie when the students are playing on their dinosaurs, the camera zooms in on the tracks leading up to the main dinosaur tracks, and it looks like a giant, hairy-footed dinosaur track, but it isn't. (The actual tracks looked as if it was just as hairy and long as those, but these were only made by the most recent dinos. So, those were the "new" tracks.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a huge "MST3K" fan, so of course I was excited to watch "Movies from the Crypt" with some of the characters from the show: Kevin Murphy.  This movie is another "Molly-O" and, sadly, is no different from other movies that make fun of a certain TV show.    The "Mockumentary" format of the movie is a parody of the old TV movies of the 1930s/1940s that included parodies of popular radio-parodies, like "Buck Rogers, the Boy Wonder" or "The War of the Worlds."  The movie actually does a good job of satirizing the "Moe-Ups" of the 1920s.    It even has a scene where a bad guy comes on-stage dressed as Moe the bartender, who looks like the same guy that I would run into at the bar.  The movie is made up of three stories:  - "The Stolen Film" tells the story of the film "The Great War" which was made in the early 1930s.  - the "Puppetmaster" tells a true story about a TV network that hired a puppet master to create a new TV show about a boy that could speak English.  - the "Movie-Racist" tells of a movie made in 1950 or earlier that featured a puppet who looks remarkably similar to the King of Pop himself, and makes fun of the people in the audience who are watching the movie.  As we all know, the series ends with a little kid who is "kidnapped" by a bunch of kids and forced to become a puppet for all the kids watching TV at the same time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've heard of the "horror film" genre before and I know that it's not exactly a good thing to watch films like this in a haunted house when you're alone in the dark, but they did a great job of the acting, the production values were excellent, and the overall effect of the film was very effective.   The story is simple: a young woman is visiting her old friends in a secluded farmhouse in the middle of nowhere with her two kids. In the middle is a small child that doesn't understand the world around him: an "old woman" with a white beard who is a witch and a little girl who believes she's a dragon.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an uninspired, uninteresting film with a weak script. It's just boring. If you're looking for some action or intrigue this film is probably not for you. If it was really about the politics of the day this would have been something. But it's not. It tries to be something but fails miserably. It does however manage to create a story out of a few scenes. If anything it's worth a watch if you're a fan of "what if" films like this or the James Bond series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If this is the sort of movie one expects from a bad science fiction movie (not that this is a bad film by any means) we see the "Gravitron" orbiting the Earth. The "G" means there is no real gravity on board, meaning that if you go up or down, you are going faster or slower than a speeding bullet. The gravity is generated by a giant rocket which blasts water and dust into the "space" by creating a powerful magnetic field to accelerate these substances. The idea is that once the water molecules have been ionized, they are then slowed down so that they can't escape the vacuum of space. But this is not good for either the water or the dust. This is a film about a guy who is working on a project involving a giant machine and he is having some pretty serious problems. The main character is a guy named Mike Jones who is a genius programmer. His main problem is that he can't get a system on the computer to be able to handle the job he has to do. He also wants to get to the bottom of a number of mysteries (one being that the "Earth" (or the "Solar System" as it's called) is orbiting the sun and the "gravitronic" is going around the Earth) but he is being held back by some other computer problems. His next problem is a "Gavro" (a kind of computer virus) which has taken over his computer and is trying to stop him from doing any work at all. When this virus is put into motion to sabotage his project, Mike is told to get rid of it. He tells the person who is supposed to do the job on the system to disable the virus before it gets out and then he goes off and does his job. That was the good part of the movie...it was funny, and it was even a little exciting at times. The only bad part of this film were the computer problems that Mike had. The ones that had to do with computers! There was too much of them and not enough explanation of what was happening or why it was happening. That really hampered the movie.  5 out of 5 stars for the first "G". Rating is for the most part based on the movie itself, not on the cast and their roles: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It has always seemed like a good idea for a kid's movie to have an actor played by an adult in a wig with a large nose, a very large nose.  The movie had a great old-time musical number.  One of the characters was played by a very small character.  There was a lot of laughing at the antics of these kids.   They had to get a lot older in order to grow up into adults, but they all got a lot younger!   I had read this book from a paper book and it was very readable.  I read it again, only because my sister had just gotten me the paperback of it.  But I really did not like it.   It took a great deal of time to get the movie started, and it is hard to follow the plot.  It is difficult to tell if the kids are acting or acting when they act.  The kids can seem a bit old when they are little.  Their voices could be heard a mile away.  Even though this movie looks as if it were made just for children to watch, the movie is just about that.  If you have kids in the family, then I guess you will like this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is all about the sex and violence and there's not much to talk about besides that.    The one thing I would like to say about this movie is that a lot of people who have never seen a horror movie before like to talk it up saying that horror movies can't be scary like this, because it's just so real and it's so well acted.  What I didn't know that that's what this movie was about, it was more about a guy who was in a horrible situation trying to get help in a haunted mansion and who decided to try and do a little good in his life.  Now I think most of the people who say this movie can't get scary, because of how realistic and the acting, but I can tell you that the acting is great and I never expected anything like this.  I'm not sure where this movie came from, because I can't think of a worse one out there to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good movie with a pretty good ending.  It is just too bad that this movie is from 1993.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One can't deny that this movie is pretty boring.   It was a nice start to the film with a great soundtrack and the movie was nice to look at.  But this is a short film and I will go back to the long films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Is it really possible for a bad film to be good?   A film so bad it makes us wonder if anyone can make a good movie ever.   And is this the same person who played a character called "Mr. Big"?   No, this is someone more likely to play a "Mr Smith" or a "Captain Hammer" or "Captain Nanny".   The first half of this movie is simply awful.  There is nothing funny about it, nothing even remotely touching at any level.  The characters are awful. The story is even worse. The bad guy has no idea how to fight. No he just shoots people on sight. No one ever dies in this movie.  Just when you think this thing can't get worse, the bad guy does what bad guys do. He murders people.   In a movie that is so bad that you think it is only going to get worse.  But it does. The movie does have a decent number of memorable scenes. However, the majority of those scenes are the same thing over and over again.  This is really a bad time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A lot has been said about this movie but no one will know anything about it unless you've been around in the industry long enough to have heard the stories. It's hard not to have a good time watching the film, in fact for some reason the film is fun to watch, at least to a certain degree. It has the perfect blend of comedy and horror, with a bit of both, and is a very enjoyable film. There is a lot of "twist" in the film and it makes it more than a simple story about two clowns being attacked by some monster. This film is a throwback to the '50s and '60s and is certainly not what some people think it is. It is a great film to watch with a great group of people who make it great.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a lot of movies about people trying to live in a post-industrial wasteland.   This is not one of them.  They don't even bother talking about what a wasteland it is.  I'd actually have to go through the story line of this movie for more than 20 minutes to even really understand what's going on.  The "villains" are some old school characters from the 20's.  There's a little girl who's trying to protect her younger sister from being raped by a "villain".  These characters have never been on screen in anything but the silly 80's film.  A bunch of women who are supposedly the first to set foot on this planet are trapped in the "hollow" and must try to save themselves.  These women are called "mangas", which may not seem too much different from the modern, overly sexualized versions of the female characters of "Star Trek".  I don't know how much more they can do with this plot.  To me it's all so obvious in its absurdity.  It doesn't make sense.  Perhaps it was made by a bunch of out of work "comedians" who can't get an agent, then saw a movie in which the main character was "haunted" and wanted revenge.  Who the hell is the hero going to get revenge on?  A "hobo"?  They had better not have made the movie in Korea, which is a country where women have just the right amount of independence to live out their lives without men.  At one point they get a plane, but all they can afford to do is take a boat out to somewhere on the ocean.  What in the hell are they doing?   What could possibly motivate an elderly couple to venture out to the "horizon" in a boat?   Who gave them the authority to take it out there?  And even if they did, what exactly would happen once they got there?   How many miles is the distance?   Where are they?   Why did they take it to begin with?  I was so tired by the end that I could barely keep my eyes open. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was only 6 when I saw this. I was a bit scared to try the film as the story was not scary, even the name "Dawn of the Dead" sounds like an excuse for a horror movie. It was a movie that should be remembered as a bad one, at least that's what it would be if it weren't for the amazing music, the great special effects and the performances by those who really could play their instruments well. The ending is a bit abrupt, a couple of scenes were missing but, otherwise a very enjoyable film, not really a fan of horror films, as they are not real life but I will be sure to give the sequels a look. I recommend that you take your kids, young ones at that, as it is a very, very enjoyable movie. I just wish the cast had done a little better on their performances, they do play well as it was one of those early 70s, cheesy horror pictures with good performances and fun scenes. I really like this one and, as a tribute to Wes Craven who directed this film, I have given it a 6 on the scale of a film, 6.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a man, a woman, and a child (not a kid) on an epic adventure (and in general) in this movie. The man was a cowboy (well, at least that's what we're told). The lady, a little old-fogy that is, was a young girl and the kid was the baby. This is pretty much the exact reverse of the "Lilo & Stitch" movies. That movie was a movie about an alien who was a little girl that got lost, got rescued, learned to fly, and fell in love with a man (of course that was a lie). Here, the cowboy was a cow, a cow girl fell in with a cowboy and got married. It's not pretty.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is one of those "you only live once" kind of stories. There is a point that, if you are a fan of 80's and 90's horror movies, you can see the similarities between this film and a certain other movie that featured a very similar plot. This film is nothing spectacular, it's basically a cheesy movie that relies on cheap jump scares and a story that relies heavily on cheap acting, as a result of all this, the film has no plot, no real characters, and a very cheesy storyline to boot.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a travesty, and there is nothing redeeming about it at all. It is a movie about a movie, one which was written years before and about a very silly time in the 1940's (if ever), starring the likes of Ginger Rogers, Cary Grant, and Richard Burton. I think that this is one of the worst films ever made. Why is it so good? What a stupid idea! What is a film about a dead girl? What is the point of doing this to a dead movie star and her husband (played by Cary Grant), while singing about a woman with a dead husband and living with a live one (the wife's daughter) and not really going anywhere, or even being good? Burton's Ginger plays a little girl, who is not dead, who comes back to life to tell her story. But the stories are so unoriginal and silly, that not only is it a lousy movie, but it makes me angry. I have seen better (this is my personal opinion), better than this! It is certainly the dumbest film ever made! And I am sure that other people will say much the same about this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is really bad, especially for its $14.99 price tag. I think the first half of the film would benefit from an editing, and I think they did a poor job. They don't use any of the set pieces from the original movie (and I think that they're trying to get away from the first one, but then they don't). I don't know if it's because this is a prequel, but the story doesn't match up with the first. I thought it was pretty much the same characters, and the same things happen. There's no reason to continue the plot of the first movie, and it doesn't feel like it was meant to, either. The action sequences are just...well, they look pretty, and they're pretty. The movie doesn't really show off much, so you get to see what it's supposed to be like. It's not really a bad looking movie, but I can't say I was impressed. I also wouldn't recommend it to people who aren't completely sold on the first series. I wasn't a fan at all, and this movie doesn' make me want to pick it back up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a shame that a movie that was supposed to be about a love affair was an abomination of all genres, featuring not only one bad movie but a bunch of bad movies.   When I first saw this movie, I thought it would be a comedy, but I was surprised to find that a horror movie was taking place.  My only complaint about this bad movie is that I wish it could have been longer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To get the most from this movie, I recommend to a) watch it with the sound turned off b) sit and watch the action unfold in slow motion as a good movie should be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie, "The Day the Earth Stood Still", is an interesting mix of science fiction and fantasy. Set in a future where humans and animals have evolved into intelligent primates, we find that the human race has been conquered by another race which is based on a large space station. Our hero is an ape who is captured and taken to the space station, where he meets other captive apes and a human who has been infected with a virus which causes him to become a member of the alien race. The action in the movie is pretty basic: an ape fights apes, apes eat apes and humans. There are some pretty imaginative effects in the film: the apes are made out of paper, with big eyes; the space ship seems to be an old fashioned aircraft carrier; we get an awesome soundtrack of the film by the same British composer that worked on "The Wizard of Oz" and "Dune". The special effects are also pretty good, although not always convincing. Overall, there are a number of scenes in the future where this film could have been very good. There is a really cool scene where an astronaut and an ape travel to another planet where they have to fight their way through a forest to reach the other side. There were also some pretty good sequences at the end where one ape and one scientist are seen looking back over the jungle; that scene could be a very good part of the movie, instead, it is only one brief scene that ends the movie. The movie was not very good, but I do think that the movie could have used a little more depth. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to those who like space movies and intelligent apes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't want to start this by saying how excited I was to see this movie. I have watched a fair number of horror movies over the years, most of them with some form of music, and most of the time it seems that all these movies are really trying to make a point. This one is not one of those movies. If anyone who has never seen the movie is interested, go to your local 7-11 or the local 7/11. The only other thing I really can add is that I like the music when it is playing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an awful movie. It is also not a good movie. The movie is about a woman who, through an accident, is left in a state where she can do no wrong. She is a bad-ass, so that's expected, and in every other way the movie is also good, but a good bad movie is not a great movie. But this one gets no more good, and instead it becomes the worst bad movie made in the last 15 years. There is not one thing good about it. The writing, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the production values, etc. are all bad. The idea of a woman doing what she wants in a movie set in the 1940's is just laughable, even the name is laughable. The whole concept of a movie that is based on a novel about a lady doing her own thing in the 1930's is one of those cliche ideas that just doesn't work.   It's an absolutely appalling movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were many aspects of the film that I disliked. The actors who played the aliens were in almost every scene that they played. When I first saw them, I thought they were terrible. After a few scenes, I was beginning to think otherwise. I am sure that they did their best.  The way that the film ends is quite silly.  There are a few aspects of this film that were interesting.  It is a bit strange that they would include this film in their collection.  What the heck was a movie about?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm sorry to say that this movie made me cringe even more than I did when I saw it at the theater! This movie is nothing short of disgusting! The women are portrayed in horrible and degrading ways - they all have their eyes blackened from the inside, they are all obese, they have disgusting, horrible, filthy mouths, and their bodies are all covered with tumors. When you look at the picture, the movie looks like it was made by some sick person or group of people that has lost their minds, or, they don't have any clue what they are doing - they are like a bunch of retarded little children that are all playing at being a "real woman" all day long, then, one by one they get their eyesighted and start talking about the sexual things that they want to do to the men that work at a factory in a nearby town. It would take me about 50 years to watch it all again. The only thing that made me smile were the actors! The film makers could have at least made an effort with them! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most ridiculous movie I have ever seen.   It's a comedy about an ex-girlfriend who is dating an ex ex-husband.  It is not funny.  I have never seen anyone act like this and it is not even remotely funny. They are in a car and a woman screams at the man on the back seat, "Why don't you put her in a cage!"  It would be funny if they would have been wearing black or if the car would not have been red.  The man says he didn't know she would scream.  That's when it got really bad. The ex-wife says she had sex with this guy and it was awful.  Now, I did see an ex with an ex, but I didn't have any idea how much it would turn me off.  This movie made me feel like I was going to be in an extremely dark movie with some weirdo talking at a table, but then I would go back to my room because the movie would be over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the movie, two girls from the future arrive in present day and are not happy about it.   They have no choice but to hide for some months until one of them discovers the place and they become their best friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is bad because it tries too hard to be something that it really isn't. That's not to say it isn't worth watching, because it is; but I didn't need to watch this in the first place. I was bored the moment I watched this. Nothing about it made sense, as far as I can tell, even the ending. That is not to take anything away from the movie, but this review is only intended to give people a taste of the terrible things you can expect to find in this movie. It is one of the worst things that I have ever seen, probably ever. The acting is terrible and most of the plot comes off as just plain stupid, but I won't bother listing the other things that were stupid about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As you know, I loved this film.    This film was shot in the 1950s and made in the 1970s.    It is an incredibly creepy film that features some really creepy characters.  This movie is about three children that are being watched and stalked by a creepy couple.  As they play around one of the children begins to see things and when he goes home one day he is found dead.  It should also be noted this is a film that is filled with violence and gore and there are a lot of people that die.  What is particularly scary in this film is the fact that it was shot for money and has a great soundtrack (it does).   So, I will give it a 5 out of 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The "Alien" is not an Alien movie but a "Horror" movie in the sense of being made with no fear and no sense of "the real"  The acting is bad in almost every scene   The story has a simple beginning   It has a complex ending    I can not recommend this movie to anyone who cares about good movies  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very bad movie. For starters I think it would have been better to have no script at all (at least for the first half) and just have the characters talk. There isn't anything interesting happening except some weird things. I didn't laugh much and when I did it was just to see how much the characters can take. That and the acting sucked. I know it was bad when I saw it and I can see why it would suck now.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is awful and the directing is awful. The characters seem like they come from a bad film. It looks like a video store in the seventies. There are no jokes and the jokes are all the same and lame. There is no character development in this movie. I guess everyone thought this was a good idea.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked the concept of this movie and thought it looked good, but once you get past the good parts, it just is not very good.  The first act is pretty good, and the movie moves at a good clip all the way through, even though there are some rather weak and even silly jokes to be found in it.  It does a little bit better once it moves into the second act.   What did make this movie interesting, however, was the fact that the characters were all rather well developed.  There is also quite a bit of action during the second and third acts, which makes up for any weak parts.  I also really liked the voice work done by the cast, all of them giving it their very best.  Overall, I'd rate it at a 7.5 out of 10, which is pretty much an A-. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many issues in this film, it doesn't even matter what the movie is about.  It is about the way that our culture has been brainwashed to be afraid of a man who never went on a shooting spree.  What can you say about it that hasn't been said about it before?   There are too many things wrong with this film to begin to list them all, and many people have already pointed them out in the comments section.  There is a good chance that there isn't a way to view this film without getting a nasty shock down your spine.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a whole movie about a bunch of people having a bad time. That is basically all I have to say about it. It is pretty generic, and the actors who play these guys all look the same.   I got into the movie through some of the posters.  As it turns out, the movie will be shown in New York at the American Museum of Natural History.  My son and his friends were all there to look at the movie.  The museum has a lot of old stuff, and they put out a lot. The show ran long, and I missed most of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A big, bloated movie with only superficial "originality" and a bad cast...a big, sloppy, boring, expensive piece of crap.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason to watch this film is to watch a movie where the main character goes into a mental institution, and he is cured by the doctor (John Wayne).   I have never seen anything so lame.   My only wish was that the movie had more dialogue and more humor to help with the dullness of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst part about the movie are the actors.   Most people have heard the horror stories about Hollywood's actors. Well, a few actors who are still in business are at it again. One of the most memorable roles of the movie is that of the sadistic psychiatrist in a state of mind of pure sexual lust.  It's sad to see such a perverted and depraved character in a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised more people haven't seen this movie.   It is about a man who has a wife that has left him.  He has tried everything to get her back.  If you are an avid Hitchcock Fan then this movie is definitely worth watching.  I would recommend watching this movie if you enjoy movies like:  1. The Birds 2. Psycho 3. Vertigo  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To give the film a rating of "I would not watch this again" is like giving a star rating to a bad novel. The plot involves a group of people working in a factory who have a very unique talent: they are able to make life-sized dolls of virtually any person they have ever seen. The dolls are used to murder people, and are always the same. The main character has a lot of sex with an assortment of women and men, and the doll-making skills never seem to be enough to make him look appealing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember being in high school in the 1970's when we had to drive to the movies in our parent's minivan. This movie was in black and white so you had to put your eye up to the rear view mirror when your parents let you out. Well the movies were great so we decided we'd rent it, but it was bad. Nothing to write home about in this movie. Just bad actors trying to act too cool to be the actors. A pretty little blonde chick in a black nightie, a little red haired dude with glasses, and the poor guy who has to drive around in a minivan just trying to get home. He has to try hard and be very stupid but in the end his stupid car gets stolen and he has to hitchhike a ride. It was a pretty good movie until the end when everyone got too smart. I can't find a copy so I'm only giving it 4 stars because it wasn't the worst movie ever but it wasn;t the best either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film where you have a bad guy being brought to justice and his buddy running off (with a gun) is an entertaining action flick, but the last act is a letdown with no real resolution.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this is an average movie: very predictable, very bad. There is not a single exciting thing about this movie, the film is very boring and has nothing good about it. I can give a few words about the acting but this movie is really too bad to be worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I came back from the film festival I was ready to go back to work.   In the morning I was up.  I got up and made coffee and took the little girl home with me.  The kid liked to run around and play.  At bedtime I put her to bed with a soft little whisper of a lullaby.  She woke up crying a few times and asked what she could do.  If you listen to this recording you will hear her saying something that sounds like "I wish you'd sleep all the way to the moon."   I went to work around five o'clock.  But it's getting late.  So as I am leaving my office, I look back to see who's in the building.  It's a big, gray building with a big white sign "Office of the President."  I walk across the parking lot and then turn onto the sidewalk to go to the bus stop.  And I look to the left and there is the bus driver standing in front of his bus.  That's the President of the United States.  As I get to my bus stop I get off the bus. I look up.     It was a beautiful day.  They didn't show me any of the presidential portraits, and the street lamps were just starting to get a little lighter.  A little wind was blowing across the lake and a bit of snow was on the ground.     I get on my bus and head back to the city.  Then I look at my watch: 9:30.  There's an old saying about running up a huge bill for the little things in your life.  My wife and I were out for a walk one summer night in Central Park.  With the windows of my wife's dresser open and her jewelry hanging out she pulled me in close to kiss me.   It was like an explosion in my head.  "I can't do this!"  I thought.  No one's ever told me that before.  Just then I heard the sirens of the approaching firetruck.  In a second I was running.   I had only one thing on my mind.   Get to my wife.   Just then the police car sped up behind me. "There is a problem," they said in a high-pitched voice.   "Yes," I said. "This guy is going to the ER."    Then
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first one I see and I can't stop thinking about it. There is so much wrong with it.   There's a huge plot hole that I cannot get out of my head.  This movie just makes me want to hurl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is pretty terrible, from what i've heard it sucks and was made for the lowest possible budget. It looks awful, the production values are pathetic, the dialogue is very bad, the action scenes are extremely cheap, bad dialogue and bad acting. The plot is retarded and the film is so bad it makes your teeth hurt. The ending was horrible and it just makes me want to take the piss out of this film, it doesn't stand up to the rest of the movies i have seen and doesn't have much more than that i can think of off the top of my head. The reason it's only got a 1 is because of the low budget it's made for. I wouldn't buy a ticket to this movie if you can even find it in a theatre. If you want to see a movie that makes you want vomit then this one is for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an incredibly weak movie, a comedy with no actual suspense whatsoever, it should have been called "A Dumb Movie With a Dumb Plot". All the movie had to be about was the "baddie" (Darryl "Bucky" Regan) who was trying to catch a girl. No one would watch this, no one would care, no way would it pay a dime for a stupid comedy that has no real tension, and the only thing in it was a stupid joke about "The Baddie". It is a parody of other old westerns but it is a bad one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen this film a while back but thought it was a bad idea to go see it with a bunch of drunk people at a frat party.   When I said I was going to watch a bad film I meant bad    It is so bad I was thinking I was watching a bad comedy and it was   This is worse than anything I had expected to see and even more   sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical 80's movie that should not exist. Nothing much to be said about this; a generic "kiddie movie" that tries to be silly, but ends up being annoying to the very end. No plot. No character development. No laughs. Not even an ending. The ending is just lame, not to mention "cute" too. A bad movie, with a bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not much to say about this film.  If you like cheesy, low-budget, B-movie horror movies, you will like it a bunch.  At the end of the day, why should you watch this movie?   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To have a great concept and a great director is a big thing, to have such a great idea and a good director is even bigger, and that's why I have to give this movie three stars. Well, the best part is the part about the spider. So that's cool. If you can get it on to the screen in this manner you will get a good laugh from me, and you will be able to get it off of the screen before your eyes. This is a fun movie for the entire family, so if you have any interest in the "Spiderman" movie series, this is the movie to watch. I'd give this three stars even if I didn't find this funny, if you don't find it funny then you're really not a "Spider-man" fan, because it's actually quite bad. It's not a terribly good movie at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a bad idea. There's a few parts of this movie that were interesting, but none were particularly effective. The script was very silly and I'm surprised that the director and director of photography got to work on a movie about the Nazis and not do a movie on the Holocaust. It's not even the subject that is the problem. I mean, how many Holocaust films have we done? And those aren't the ones that are particularly bad, anyway. There are the ones where the survivors go into the afterlife and everything is all right. Those are kind of bad, too, but that is another story, of course. But these movies are just stupid, a few of them even worse than the original "Ressurection of Mel Brooks", but this one is really, really stupid and silly and stupid, and doesn't even make sense in context. There is a Nazi war criminal, for God's sake! Is that a bad thing? And what is a German with a Jewish last name? And where is this movie being set? In the future? It seems like the only thing that the makers of this film had in mind was to make a fun but utterly ridiculous comedy about Hitler, and they haven't even succeeded, and you have to wonder what it would take to turn around the fortunes of this whole series and what a crazy idea it was.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I wish they'd stop filming the movie at 2:40am!   The movie has some nice action scenes, but I don't really enjoy it at all.  The acting is not bad either, but again a movie like this should have a little more substance.   Summary: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The most interesting thing in the whole movie is the way it tells how much time it takes for a boy to grow to be a man. I don't think it even takes that long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You can tell from the first scene that this film is full of bad puns. I don't mean that in a bad way: it's actually very funny! This movie has its share of bad actors in the roles of Paul Wight and his wife, Margo. The two get together and are immediately bored of each other, but it isn't until Paul tries to impress Margo with his "dungeon master" that things start to really get interesting. Paul is a boring guy who is basically content with playing the Dungeon Master. The only thing that he knows how to do is move things around. He is completely useless to Margo, who is so much more talented! What is worse is that Paul seems to be in love with Margo! And even though Margo is completely uninterested in him, he does a little too much of the same thing. One moment she's trying to use a magic wand to move things in the dungeon, the next she's going up and down the stairs. It's bad enough that she doesn't even have a sword (for that matter) or a bow. It doesn't take long before things get out of hand, including a little fight between Paul and some monsters that are trying to get at Margo by using magic. Paul starts to show real signs of a mental illness as he makes a big deal out of the fact that he's a Dungeon Master and that he has "a knack for magic." But he is very inept at using the things that he doesn't have! For example, when Paul's pet cat goes into a "doomed" state, Paul has no problem putting the cat back to life! But that isn't the worst of it! Paul can't even use his mind to get rid of the monsters, because in fact he doesn.t need to... He's basically in a constant state of depression. You know why he's depressed? Because he doesn`t have a girlfriend, and he can`t get a girlfriend. Paul has been depressed his entire life because he doesn´t have an attraction to someone else! And when Margo catches him acting that way, she finds out that he is depressed and has nothing going on with his life... So she takes matters into her own hands and takes him out into a dungeon (which is not as bad as it sounds). Well, he is a complete moron as he goes along with this, and I don´t think I can exagger
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie ever made (I hate to say it, but there's some truth to it).  The story is terrible (with the exception of the "cameo" from the film "The Blues Brothers"), and it is a real travesty that some actors (and a whole bunch of supporting cast) can act so bad (or at least I think so, because they seem to be having a good time...), in a script that is so poorly written, that it could have been a film from the 30's and was more than likely a movie with a script by an alcoholic or something.  Oh, and that title?  It doesn't make any sense...what's the movie about?   Oh well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A great movie. It's a great movie to watch because it's a classic.    In any case, it's an amazing classic because all of the cast is fantastic! The film stars Gene Hackman as John McClane, and he's not a bad guy. His plan is to infiltrate the drug trade to try and solve the case that he started. While he does his job, his wife and daughter are at home. His daughter's parents are out of the country, so she has to babysit their grandchildren while his wife is away. While she's out of town, his daughter has come by for a visit. It turns out that her brother is a serial killer who's been killing all of his victims in their own homes. It also turns out he's been working with a guy named John McClain (Hackman) to kill the people. In order to prevent him from getting away with it, they set up a trap. McClane tries to infiltrate McClain's home, but McClain has gone into hiding and McClane gets lost. Eventually, he is spotted and McClain manages to escape from the cops. As he is running away from the police, he makes a turn and McClach is after him. The rest of the movie follows this chase. The chase is so realistic and thrilling that you can't help but want McClach to win. There's not really much else to say about this movie besides that it's brilliant.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad, poor, non-film, of a good movie. It is a classic. It has its place in the pantheon of good movies, but it is not very good. It tries to be a film about the Vietnam War, and yet its most compelling message is one of defeat. There are no heroes, no real conflict. It does not have a happy ending, although that was not its goal. As an example of its non-action, it includes:-- (a) a shot of a man holding his head and crying. It isn't that the people in the film are bad people. They are not, in fact, at all. However, the Vietnamese are in control, and it is only their culture that the United States has to fight against. And to the Vietnam people--even though they know it is going to be tough--they can do nothing to help themselves. (b) a scene of a kid shooting an elephant in an effort to be accepted by his family. No, really. This movie tries so hard to be "realistic" and to make us "feel" for the Vietnamese people. This leads to absurdities. What the kid shoots is an elephant. To make it seem realistic, they put a human face on it (I believe it is a clown). No, the elephant is an animal that could take a real shot at a grown man. That is why they say it was "like a dog chasing a car," which is absurd, as far as I am concerned. (c) some young guys on horseback riding in front of a river, and having the gall to do it without a bow and arrow. It looks as if it would be a lot more fun if they were all mounted on horsebacks and riding on horses that were a little bit faster than the horses at the end of the previous shot. What it would have been more exciting to do is just to mount a horse and ride it into the river. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a bad idea.  We are introduced to one of the new recruits to the Suicide Squad.  I really enjoyed how Suicide Squad got their name.  In all the movies I've seen, that name has never stuck out.  We meet these two characters that are a perfect match.   A guy who just can't get his groove together?   He's brought in because the director of the Squad is a fan of his acting and it's perfect timing to show him up.  They do a great job getting into the role of Harley Quinn.  Harley Quinn is just as bad ass as any guy I've met in real life.  She has all of the craziness of a psychotic, but at the same time you don't feel like she is a bad guy.  After she's captured by Joker, she does some good things and then is betrayed and put into a cage.  This gets all of us back on track and reminds us how bad the Joker's Joker is.  So we go back to the Squad. This group of characters has the same problems we all have.  Batman, the Joker, the Penguin, Killer Croc, Joker's lackeys, and Robin.  All of them try to get to the top and don't seem to be very motivated.  The Batman is just trying to get revenge on the Joker because the Joker destroyed his face.  Joker has an agenda in this movie.  He wants to save the Earth.  If he can kill the main characters of the movie, he will achieve his goal.  Then we are introduced, Harley Quinn and the Suicide SQUAD.  Well, she doesn't have the best outfit in this picture.  It's just a green, tight suit.  Why are they trying to recreate the same outfit we saw in the last film?  They are copying the outfit from the Joker from the last movie.   I'm glad we got a Harley Quinn movie and a Suicide Squad movie at least, but you have to wonder if they could have done a better job.  Perhaps Harley Quinn was the only bright spot in this film.  Another thing to note, the movie was rated PG-13 for violence and foul language.  At least this time it wasn't an R-rated movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The biggest problem I had with this movie is the acting.   I mean really they are a bad looking cast,   but some of the characters are just dumb,  and I mean dumb.  I know the plot is predictable but what I do not like is the stupidity and the over the top acting of the female characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a good horror movie and I've liked it for a while but this one gets so confusing that you really have no idea what is going on until about 30 minutes in. This movie features the usual high-concept, but it's not interesting at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not enjoy this movie. I like the fact that there's a good dose of sci-fi and aliens, but when it's just the two of them they are not together. Their conversations aren't interesting, their characterizations are poor. I'm not sure how well they had an understanding of each other, as at one point the main character states, "I never knew that he (the alien leader) was not human." It was rather obvious that the alien was human. But it's bad enough that it has a lot of bad dialogue and that it lacks some of the special effects that other movies would have had. It's not a bad film, it is rather poor. But in a bad sense, it really is.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I can take a good movie, an animated film, out of the "macho" realm where these movies go to die and make a good cartoon that makes fun of itself, then I must be doing pretty good on the whole (well maybe not in the "I'm sorry, I wasn't looking!" way, but hey, it's my movie).    The cartoon is a bit over the top in it's silly way, with lots of "jokes", but it was actually amusing.   What I liked about it was the music and the acting, although the songs didn't really fit the character, and I didn't find much humor in the movies "theme".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I've mentioned, it's not that it's a bad film (I'm not a horror expert but I didn't have a bad time), it's just that there was no connection between its characters, and the film was almost as bad. The story is a simple one and doesn't really seem like a particularly strong one, but it has enough atmosphere to stay in the memory long after it's over. A great movie and it should get a proper Blu-ray release and at a much higher price. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad comedy with a story that is bad. The comedy is mostly bad and there are many parts that are completely out of place. There are no jokes to distract from the serious parts of the film, and there is no depth or a story. It's just a poorly written comedy that is at its best when the humor is off.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What's the worst movie ever made?   This is a movie which, I think, should be taught in the schools as a way to teach kids to respect the natural world.   You might wonder how a movie like this would end up in a theatre in the first place.  The reason is that people get turned on by nature, especially natural bodies, and they get turned off by nature.  This leads to an amazing mix of "nature porn" and "bizarre" sex scenes (like the one in which a tree has sex with a dog), but there's also plenty of great acting.  It's not an uncommon movie that features a "natural" girl (I guess she is actually a woman) getting turned on and even getting fucked by a tree, but the fact that we don't see a woman being turned on does not diminish the "sexiness" of it.  In fact, it's quite obvious to the viewer that the woman in this movie does not care at all about getting turned around.  If you want to see a movie that gives a good sense of what sex is about, then you might enjoy this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The "The Walking Dead" is not exactly an original creation, but it does a fine job of staying true to the zombie genre. The story follows Lee Everett (Bruce Greenwood), a former Vietnam veteran who has been brought back from the dead, a fate that he would have been better off never having suffered. With the death toll steadily rising in New York City, the remaining survivors are under attack from an unknown enemy. And their last chance to escape the zombie apocalypse before all the zombies get them is to find out the identity of the killer before he takes his revenge. That is the premise of the movie, and it's an interesting one, but that is where it gets a bit of a problem. Despite the great character work by Bruce Greenwood and Olivia Williams, the movie never gets into a good enough groove to keep the viewer entertained throughout the film. The constant switch from a scene of horror with the walkers to a humorous scene with the characters is irritating and in bad taste. A few times, there is a bit more blood than normal, and even then, it's only on the surface. This is one of those movies where the plot and characters are so thin that there isn't anything exciting about the film, and the characters are all pretty generic. If the movie was a little more interesting, the audience might be more interested in watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was based on a comic-book,  I think the "X-Files" are just like that, except their characters and plot are more like a soap opera. I am going to say that this is probably one of the worst films I have ever watched.  It is a story of a very unlucky woman who gets a good job at a bank and gets all the good jobs; then her boyfriend gets really into the world of crime and she gets into the wrong part of it.    It's a soap-opera with bad actors,  bad acting, and bad acting;  And the plot is just awful,   The bad acting is even worse.  I mean if you want something that is like soap, a film like this would be good,  but not good enough.  There is some good moments of the story; I especially liked the scene where Scully's boyfriend is chasing after some bad guys and Scully stops a guy driving an old truck, she gets this old truck from a man who tried to sell it back in his youth; he had taken the time to remove all the rust, he made a great deal of money by selling it when he was young.  The movie has a really great soundtrack, but then when it gets a real plot there is no music to fill this empty space, so the soundtrack gets very repetitive at times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a poorly acted and written piece of trash. The acting in this movie is bad... It's really hard to believe in some of the stunts, like the "fountain of youth" one time... It just looked like somebody fell from a high cliff. And I can't believe when the film ends and the hero finally gets his powers back... Because it's just all fake.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wasn't exactly enthused by this film. I'm sure most people watching this film were either there or near it and they probably had a good time. It didn't matter how much I disliked this film, it wasn't going to make a strong impression on me. I'll start out by saying that I can't think of any of the acting in this movie that stands out as being particularly good. They are all mediocre at best. You just get the general idea of what this movie was trying to accomplish. The actors, who, let's face it, are all very good at their jobs, are trying to do a bad job. This was more than a little disheartening to watch. The movie seems to be trying to have a fun time with the whole "spooky haunted house" thing, but ends up just looking silly. I am sure the director did it for the laughs, but it wasn`t funny in the least. It would have been nice if the film had something to make it stand out from all of the other horror comedies that were being made at that time. I guess that`s how you make a good film, but I really didn`t find anything good about it. The best part of this film is the fact that you will never know that it was ever made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am sorry to say that if you have not seen this then you have missed out. The movie does not really give a reason to watch it so don't bother. I would recommend this to someone who wants to see a bit of the future from a sci fi point of view.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have seen this year. This was the first movie I ever saw that actually took no chances! It was a completely stupid action movie! It has some cool special effects and cool stunts, but it was pretty much just one long fight scene! I was bored out of my mind all night! It takes only two hours to see this movie! (It is on VHS). There is no need for more of these lame movies! It is so boring to sit through. I really hope I never see another movie like this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an ugly movie with a really bad ending. It makes you feel sorry for the characters and feel that nothing you can do will make the situation better. What you are left with after watching it is a bitter feeling towards all the evil people on the planet and all the suffering on this planet that makes it all the more sad. It's really a bad way to end a good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The title is misleading.  The film is about a guy who is sent home by his boss for going to a friend's funeral without permission, and the rest of the story involves him trying to find a way of getting his job back.   This is a basic story line, but it's a very basic story that doesn't have a whole lot of heart behind it. The acting of all the actors is pretty bad too.  This film could have used a different director or a different name.  As far as low budget film is concerned this isn't too bad.  I'd rather it be called "Gee the Guy Is a Deadbeat".   -  Posted by B.N. at 2:43 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was quite surprised to see this movie.  The actors are very good and the production value is good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The reason it has no redeeming qualities is because it's about a black guy, and not any other race.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "It's about a woman in the 1940's, who is being pursued by the police. In her efforts to get away she runs into a number of strange people that all turn out to be FBI agents. The whole movie is a ridiculous piece of garbage that is more a comedy than a horror movie." — A Film-Makers Dictionary   The movie starts with a police car driving through a field. In front of it is a woman on top of a car. After a while, she jumps down and starts to walk around. When she gets to the far end of the field, she finds that she is suddenly back in a man's house. The house has a basement that seems to be connected to the house in the rest of the movie.   Somebody tries to get into the house through a window, but she manages to close it. Then, she notices an old refrigerator in the corner of the house. Then someone kicks in the basement door and runs through it, but ends up being caught by her husband, who kills him. In the kitchen, someone tries to force a chicken out of a crate.  , a woman is trying to get herself away from the FBI. To do that, she must find the FBI agents, who are chasing her. There are two main FBI agents chasing her: a man and a woman. The female agent, while getting into a car, is followed by a man in a car that she gets hit by. Then she realizes that there is another car following her. So she jumps from the car and runs away. However, she is stopped by the man and the woman. So, the woman asks the man what she must do to get out of the situation. The man tells her that she must go into the basement and get out that way, where the woman gets hit again. Now that the man is trying everything to get the woman out, the FBI has him arrested. The wife and her daughter take the husband away from their house to a mental hospital. The FBI agents follow them, and take the wife to the police station. She then tells the woman that they were a man she knew, and that they are coming back to her house tomorrow. She can't stop the FBI from going back to the man's place. The woman asks her why it is so important to her. The mother replies that she just wants to get home. The movie ends with the mother getting arrested, as the woman goes back to where

I was hoping to see a little more substance and a bit less mindless entertainment in a movie called "Karma Police"  One of those films that never ceases to make you wonder what would happen in a different movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst part about the movie: Why should I have to listen to a poor acting couple?  The movie is so bad, that you want to kill them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a remake of a very popular movie and a very bad movie. It is very strange that it is a good movie that is too bad to be good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My husband and I are pretty busy these days, but even so we managed to get two weekends off. On Sunday we went to a show at the old Town Hall theater in West Hollywood, where it was a little hard to see it on the big screen, but still quite good. The music is much more traditional and has a certain beauty about it that is not at all dated. I don't think we saw the rest of the show, but I have heard of a play on Broadway at the end of this year which we are very interested in seeing. For Christmas my daughter received a small gift, a small painting in a wooden frame. It's a black and white hand-lettered image of a tree that she's drawn herself. It was an inexpensive item and I'm sure she'll get a lot of use out of it. My husband also received a book about the lives and culture of old west settlers in the small town. This is a great gift, as it was an interesting topic to ponder in one's leisure time. December 7, 2013
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not usually a big fan of horror movies, but this one definitely gets an A+. I would have probably watched it at a friend's house on a dare one time when I was just out of film school. Not only is the story amazing, but the acting is very good. The only bad part about this movie is the slow pace. As an example, in the first half of the movie, you don't see much of anything, and the only really scary element is the creature in the elevator. The whole movie is a really scary, suspenseful, but not really scary movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very good action movie from the 1960's featuring one of my favorite characters.    When this movie came out, I didn't expect to be anything more than a fan of a movie, but I've always admired the work of Charles Bronson. It turns out his best performances are made as an action star. I think it is one of the most interesting and enjoyable movies I've seen in years.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have ever seen the old 80's Saturday morning cartoons like "The Incredible Hulk" with Eric Bana, John Candy, Christopher Lloyd and Chris Sarandon, then you know what kind of films these were. This one is a remake of the "Giant Spider" show about a little boy named Thomas Spender who was discovered by a giant spider. He had to fight his way through various monsters like the giant spider, a giant scorpion and a giant rat. If you were a fan of the Giant Spider (the classic 80's animated show that I don't think anyone actually watched) then you will love this film because it is a great parody of old Saturday morning animation, featuring amazing performances from the cast. It also has great special effects that really brings it to the screen. This movie does suffer a bit with its terrible voice acting and its horrible acting from the various monsters. It should have been called "The Giant Spider" but that is what it is actually called.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As far as I'm concerned, "The Last Boy Scout" was the most pointless, boring, mind-numbingly stupid movie I've ever seen in my life. I was expecting the worst and I was prepared for a lot of bad. Instead, this is some kind of stupid parody of "Animal House" - a low-rent "B" movie that was just that: low- rent. I didn't even bother to see the "Animal house" remake (or even to look up the original: the only thing I can say for it is that it's about a dude who runs around town shooting people and getting away with it. I also didn't care about it since the plot was pretty pathetic. I did not even mind the stupid song. I'm still amazed that some of these low-budget producers are still in the business. I wish they'd just give the money back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For what it was, this was one bad movie.  The first half of it is a fairly standard science-fiction horror movie, with a pretty girl named Sarah being abducted and turned into a dog (with a little extra help from a couple of other, more interesting looking, dogs, and lots of other cool stuff).  The third act, however, gets a bit weird.  It's supposed to be some kind of a horror movie about a man who goes in search of a long-dead child.  When he finds it (it's a pretty little girl) he tries to bury it but it comes to life and tries to eat him, so he has to kill it.  She's really pretty, and she's pretty happy.  Then, all of a sudden, there's a giant spider crawling over her head.  Well, she's dead at this point.  So I guess it's a horror-comedy.  You can pretty much imagine me laughing my ass off in this movie and I'd probably be the same if I saw a movie about an obese woman eating other people.  I didn't hate this movie, but I certainly didn't like it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie it is pretty clear that the whole production has been paid for by the Chinese government. This means that China must also take credit for every job that the actors did, including every bad dialogue. This was an interesting movie for me as an ex-Chinese film student. I know there are many excellent Chinese films but the Chinese producers have managed to produce a very, very bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was too much.   It is hard to describe, but in a movie about a man who has a giant alien head, a body and a brain on his head, this movie made me feel like a zombie, then it made me even more uncomfortable by putting a bunch of young girls around the man's head.  I guess what i'm trying to say is that this movie was a real turn off for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is boring and silly. The movie seems to go on forever, all with the same old characters. At one point the movie was so bad that people began to go to the theaters to see it. There was a lot of bad acting, bad jokes, and even worse acting. The lead, Dwayne Johnson, is the kind of actor that everyone says is a loser, but he is too good to be this bad!

I have to assume it was an A-Grade film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was supposed to be a good movie about how some bad kids were "brave" enough to go on a mission to save some other bad kids from being kidnapped. It wasn't so bad in it's execution, they were a bad, out of control group of kids and it's a movie that doesn't need to be bad but it does. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are lots of great movies that are bad. But, there are also a number of bad movies that you can't miss. One of the worst is This Man Comes Around starring Kevin Costner and Shelley Winters. The film is about a good looking, smart, and very attractive young man who gets the most difficult assignment to clean up the local high school for a senior class reunion. His job involves making sure all the girls wear dresses. The problem is that many of them don't, including one of his best friends, a blonde named Mary. Also the senior class is not too happy with the assignment given to them so the senior prom is not far behind. The young men are also not happy with this assignment as they like to do their own thing. This all makes for an amusing but somewhat bizarre film. The story is quite simplistic in that the guy comes across as an idiot, and the girl seems to be the only one who seems to know that he is an idiot. So, the film is an interesting but poorly done comedy, if you can even call it a comedy. The movie is a very good watch as there is a lot of good acting in it. Costner makes a great villain, he really shows how bad he is in this film and his best performance in a long time. The cast also has some great parts that help to make the movie very entertaining. I also found the music to be pretty good for a low budget movie, but the film does have some odd music that is hard to take at times. I really don't know what happened to Shelley Winter, she looks much different in the film than she does in the book. The ending is not what I would call a good one either, as it is more of a happy ending to a movie that is rather bizarre.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen, maybe the worst I will ever see.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a bad film.   I don't care for the ending.  I feel like this movie was put out for free, just to get on the shelves.  While I understand that it's intended to be a comedy, it really isn't funny.  It seems like they were writing this movie from scratch with nothing but a pen and a paper.  This movie has been out for nearly a year and it's not even finished yet.  There are way to many slapstick gags in the movie.  The movie is about a kid who wants to be an adult.  His father thinks the best is to teach the kid how to be someone else.  If this kid can be a girl, she would never grow up.  And then the story moves onto the mother.  What's she doing?  The best part about this movie are the slapstick jokes.  No one can make a character like this funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been much of a horror/mystery movie guy. Sure, my friends will get all excited over the latest scary movie in town, but they're always disappointed. It never quite gets the perfect balance of blood and terror that they want, and it's just not very scary in any case. Maybe if the special effects were better. - July 31, 2012Don't give a dog a bone  Reviewer: S.M.I.A. - favorite favorite favorite - April 22, 2012  Subject: BEWARE OF THE LASER-NIGHTS!!!! This is a disturbing movie with a scary ending. I would only recommend it to a well educated adult and a child. As stated in the other reviews, it is pretty graphic and contains a few blood drops that are quite bloody (as stated before). It does contain some scary moments, including the creepy man in the bathroom and the little girl's ghostly mother. As I watched it, I kept having flashbacks to that little girl. - April 21, 2012BEWARE of the LAS  Review of Ghostbusters (1984) Rated PG-13 : This movie is scary as hell, with an excellent cast that includes Peter Falk, Ernie Hudson, and Peter Boyle. Ghostbusters is an action packed film with plenty of special effects including a helicopter that has been flying all over New York City. The movie is very cheesy, however. There are very bad jokes that are not funny. I remember there was this scene, where a girl was about to be thrown in jail, and she was being held down by this guy and the guy was hitting her back with a baton or something... I would not recommend this movie to a very sensitive adult who is not too scared to go outside. - March 5, 2012Ghostbusters (1984): A good movie and a bad one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a piece of crap.  A terrible movie with a bad director.    You would think that this movie was directed by a man who's never been in a movie before like this.  This is a movie about a woman who is raped.  Why would this woman want to be raped?  Why does a man need to rape her?   Why is he allowed to rape a woman and not a man?  This movie is pathetic and horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is crap. The characters are all so lame. The bad acting, the stupid humor, the lame comedy, the bad acting..... all of it is just really bad. There are really so many bad movie out there, and this is just a bunch of lame, boring characters, and a bad bad movie. It is just so bland that I think that it should be left out of the movies that are being released these days. I really hope that there are people out there that would enjoy it, but I can't think why. If you don't like the lame jokes, and the bad bad jokes, then you just should not watch this, and I really would not recommend this to anyone. If your looking for a good bad movie, go and watch something else, like "Duck Soup", "The Incredible Hulk", "A Few Good Men", or any other good bad movies out there.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from What a great movie. I wish someone would make a "bad" film. You'd have so much to laugh about.  A great cast with some good actors.  The music is great.  It will leave you wanting more! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a point in the film where the main bad guy was trying to catch up with the main good guy. As the bad guy ran through the halls with the bad guys chasing, it seemed like they ran out of time.  But of course, they had to give in and chase the badness.  It was quite a funny movie.  It was fun to be able to see the two bad guys fight to the death to the strains of the rock "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not think this movie is any good. I think it is a very bad movie.  It has very little to do with the classic science fiction books written about by Jack Williamson.  There are no references.  The story is set on Mars where a small group of people go to find the planet of their ancestors.    The whole movie is about a girl called Julie who is a science teacher and a young girl called Mary.  Mary has a crush on her, Julie tries to win the girl's attention by being funny.  I was not a big fan of the movie. There was no heart, the dialogue was bad, the actors were all bad and the scenery looked like it came from another planet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a mess.   The plot is pathetic.  The pacing is ludicrous.  This is a poor excuse for a movie.  There is no plot.  Everything is forced.  I have no idea where they went with the plot.  Everything is over-the-top.  These characters are pathetic.    The film is full of bad jokes and terrible dialogue.  Even the actors are bad.  Why did they cast the film in the summer?   This should have been shot in the fall.  What a terrible excuse for an adventure movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is probably one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen.   The plot is very predictable, it's really all just a series of bad jokes.  Even the story has been done better.  The actors are all pretty bad, they just don't know what they're doing.  You think the movie is bad you will be shocked.  I think most people will like this because it has just about nothing going on.  It's a long film, so you won't get much out of this movie, but I just can't believe that it was made in 1991, the quality of the film seems pretty terrible, I'm sure it was only done because it was so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is like the worst movie ever made by a movie studio. It's the typical "horror" movie that goes for cheap thrills, cheap lines and cheap laughs. A group of teenage girls are driving a train back from a weekend out in the woods. They have a mishap when one of them (the lead) jumps out of the car, and a killer, who goes by the name "Mister" comes out from the woods, guns a pistol, and shoots a kid in the arm. The only thing that is truly terrifying is the killer himself. He has a bad voice, an accent that is totally foreign to English, and has a huge, menacing, bad looking, long necked, ugly looking body, which was quite frightening. The girls are all traumatized. All of them. One of them is the only one who can stand up to him for the rest of the movie. But there are some bad lines in this movie that really are funny in hindsight, although they were written well before this movie came out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very short movie. It starts with a few people watching a TV show (it seems like it's an American TV show about kids who are doing stuff that is more like a movie than a TV Show) in a park. Then they all start laughing at a little cartoon (some things never change) and then one of the kids is killed. So they're laughing their heads off and enjoying the show, but the police get involved and arrest everyone on the spot and send the kids to jail. And then the police try to do everything to make sure the kids don't get out. So after getting put into the "Juvenile Detention Center," they're taken to a school for the deaf where they get to meet a little girl named Lucy (I love this little girl). It's basically a cartoon like thing, except it's more like an animation than a cartoon...there's even two little girls with the little girl. So, all the other children are laughing at the little cartoon, and I'm laughing at how silly it is (which is why it is so short) and at the police trying to get everyone together so it can be a TV special and not a cartoon. The other children get to go into a special school where they learn all the things that are going on in the rest of the world, and we see a couple of different countries that the main children in this show were in when this movie was made. One of these children is actually a little kid that I was able to see the little kid. I was really fascinated at how this little kid could do everything the other kids were doing, with some of the funniest little jokes. I would recommend this film to everyone, if only so I can see it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why this ever happened. I don`t know how it is possible to put together a movie this badly that makes me laugh more at the end than in the beginning. The script isn`t bad, the acting is good (although you get a little of George Sanders here and there, a little too much of him), it has action, comedy, a few romance, some horror, a love story, action, and a little bit of science fiction. What else does one need in a sequel? It is the first thing to be said about the franchise I like: good, not great, but good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe I've never seen this! It's a movie about a woman, who was adopted from China by her Chinese grandparents. She is raised by them in a kind of Chinese family and grows up to be a young lady. She gets married and has a son. The movie starts out with the husband and son in a canoe on a small island. The boy falls into a lake and is saved by a giant squid. The giant squid gives the boy a toy frog. His wife tries to get the boy to come in with her but the boy doesn't want to leave the island and stays with the squid for the rest of the movie. I thought it was quite interesting, but it just ended on such a weak note. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've heard many a bad bad movie before and I've just made my first bad bad film: I'm not ashamed of that, I like my bad bads to have an edge to them, this one doesn't even attempt to have a good edge, it's just so bad, the film is so bad it's embarrassing!  A young family who decide to move into a new house, the house itself is just so...well, so basic!  You don't even need to be an architect to know that a building with that kind of poor design would be very ill-suited to the family.  I can't believe a film called "It's A Wonderful Life" came out in the 1930's, there are so many of those "Great" movies that people of my generation love to watch and I think the most "great" movie that's ever come out of America and certainly the only good one I've ever seen is "It"  And you thought I was done with bad movies...I've got one more bad one for you: I don't remember this movie being made and I don´t even remember where I saw it, I think it was shown in a movie theater once or twice before but never got to see this movie.  This movie is one of those that are so stupid they seem believable!  I mean, the whole plotline is the same thing over and over again, the same plotline with different names:   Sally is working at the movie theater when she meets Frank.  Sally says she thinks Frank is pretty funny because he tells her all about all the people he wants to impress.  He tells her about everyone he's gotten dates with over the years and tells her how he used to get his dates from the movies because everyone's so nice there.  As they get to the movies, a young girl comes up to Sally and tells him that she's a fan.  The girl's name is Gloria and she's very pretty.  When they get outside, Frank asks Gloria to dance, so the two of them go into the alley to dance.  Frank tells her he wants her to tell him some of her most embarrassing stories and she begins to laugh, but then she says it's all really funny and tells a joke, but it turns out it was just a trick and Frank is the butt of it!   When the two return to the theater, a woman walks up and tries to flirt with Frank, and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have a problem with the film (except the terrible acting), but I do have a massive problem with this film. I thought this film would be a very cool flick because the movie was very well produced, set, and shot with very good makeup and an awesome score by a great band.   This movie had potential.  Unfortunately, the talent didn't work together and everything fell apart, including the film.  There were so many times when the actors should have said, "Hey guys, I'm a huge Spider-Man fan. It would be cool if we could all do it and we're all big fans of the Spider-man comics. The fact that there is a big web shooting through the floor and through a brick wall is kind of cool...right?"  But no, instead all of the actors said, "(sarcastic) Hey guys! You've never seen a big spider-man before? I've always wanted to do that!"   And all of that was wasted time.  The cast was great. They were all good looking, so it was all good, plus they had some great accents.  Even the film's director, Don Coscarelli (Spider-man 2), said it was a "pretty good" movie. The film was very good at times, and at others was boring, not in a bad way, just in a way that didn't make me want to watch the film again.  I wish there were more bad Spider-mans out there!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My boyfriend is so stupid. He thought the movie wasn't too bad and liked it a lot. The plot wasn't all that bad; what I thought would be funny with a girl who has never been kissed before was just dumb. And even that could have been funny if she had a friend. Anyway, this movie is a little different from the usual. The movie centers on the "I'm not a slut, I'm just a woman." (this is kind of true) character that tries to find some place she can be herself. However, with no success. The female characters are very similar and very "frightening" to look at. The "I can't be a slut" character has a very short but very painful journey of trying to become more than she is. If I were a character in this movie I would be completely terrified and would cry every single time I was called a slut. I don't think this is a very good movie at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really looking forward to this movie, but I never expected it would be like a boring old family movie about one of the family's "trunk" dogs.   It was just lame, boring and poorly written.  The dog in question didn't even do a lot and even with a lot it wasn't fun to watch. I could have watched a lot of crappy bad movies in a row to get what this film was trying to give me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this movie is crap.   The plot is a joke and the characters are the same kind of characters that are found in every crappy movie that has a good story in it.  We watch the two main characters and we are treated to two bad performances by the actor who played the first lead and we watch him being abused, and then we watch his sister become a super hero.  The two leads are never good enough to pull out any good plot, and the director just lets his two leads go through the motions that they know how to do (not too well) and then he takes the film out to the desert because of course, that's what he does.  I give this movie a D- because it is not a good movie at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a fun film - one of the best sci-fi movies in a long time.  If that is your taste, don't expect much.  The film is about a man who finds a strange artifact and decides to make a video to tell about it.  As it turns out, his friend was one of those poor people who were victims of some sort of alien attack.  They were captured by a strange "monsters" who were apparently able to steal human DNA.  That's when "The Man" (who has a name) comes in to save the day and saves those poor victims.  I must say the character is the most interesting one in the movie, who is portrayed as an honorable person.  His actions against the creatures are somewhat logical - he does not attack the creatures with magic because he doesn't want to harm them, he believes in using scientific methods to solve the problem.  This is probably the least logical decision in the entire movie.  It is really an amazing film - not only is it an interesting sci- fi film, the character of the "man" is interesting and the creatures in the film are quite terrifying.  A must see sci- ffi film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film was written and directed by Joe Dante and stars Peter O'Toole as the title character, who is a "high society" movie star living in Hollywood with his beautiful wife and two children. However his life is about to get very difficult when he finds out that his girlfriend is having an affair with his boss and a few of the other movie stars at the house that he runs on Hollywood Boulevard. But as it turns out, the situation isn't quite as simple as it appears to be. A gangster known as Big John is terrorizing a neighborhood in Hollywood when Big John's wife, the beautiful actress Rita, shows up. When she discovers that Big John plans to take a few days off and enjoy the Hollywood show, she takes an interest in him as well. But she soon learns that BigJohn isn't exactly what she expected, to say the least.   There are a number of scenes in this movie which are just silly.  The best scene that stands out to me is one where Rita goes to the bathroom and looks in the mirror. After she gets out of the toilet, she finds that she doesn't have a penis anymore.  This has got to be one of the dumbest movie ideas I've ever seen. There are several jokes about a young woman having to get a breast enlargement operation. But that's it.  I haven't seen anything this dumb since "Mr. Mommy" from 1985.  I was so upset about the film that I called the local cable TV station and ordered a special edition (DVD) of this film to watch with my children when they were old enough to understand. But alas, I was told that the print of this movie was too bad for TV viewing by the company.  There were some pretty bad effects, but I wouldn't say that it was really bad at all. It is a lot of fun, but there are only so many times that you can watch a man with an extra-large penis try to seduce a woman and try to break up with his wife! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a movie that I can watch in the car with my daughter at 3:00pm on Sunday mornings. Well, it didn't deliver the popcorn-and-coffee-coasters of a movie like I've never seen.   For the first twenty minutes or so, it seemed to be more like a "horror" movie than a horror film, but it quickly became one.  The "villain" (Shelley Hennig), is played by a woman who has a pretty bad name for a TV character.  She wears a lot of lipstick and dresses in very gaudy outfits.  It's not that Hennigg is bad, but she doesn't seem like much of a threat.  I don't mean to put down the acting or Hennigs makeup, because it does make for a good illusion.  Her "victim" is a couple who are on vacation in an unnamed mountain cabin in the middle of nowhere.  There are no props and little, if any, furniture.  This is a "fantasy" movie, a kind of "Gone with the Wind" on a TV set.  They sit around a table and watch TV.  After about a half-hour (with some great voice-over work by the young Jim Carrey), the couple leaves the TV on and goes to bed.  And then the camera moves from the TV to the house and there is no reason for the film to stop.  Shelley HennIG, played by Shelley Duvall, goes into the kitchen and gets some coffee.  A short time later, she is on the front porch, in a bikini and heels.  Then the movie abruptly ends.  If you liked Gone with the wind or "E.T.," this movie is a better one.

It doesn't work because it is just a badly made film that isn't very funny (it's all one joke after another that are a waste of space). I don't think that a director as bad as Jim Jarmusch can be an inspiring film director or even a bad director. This is just bad. And I can't say much more about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie does have a lot of potential, but it's ultimately just a very lazy movie.    So why are we talking about this movie? Well, it's a movie of sorts.  From the title of the movie itself (the "Star Wars" prequel) we know that this movie is going to be about a young Han Solo, played by a young John Williams.  The basic plot of the film was that the planet that Han and Chewie are stationed on, called Kashyyyk, is under attack by the Empire and the Republic.  They are on a mission that they need to make it to a space station to fight a battle that could decide the fate of the galaxy.  While on the way, they come across a smuggler named Greedo, played at the time by one Samuel L. Jackson.  It's actually Jackson's first appearance and one of the few times he ever plays a bad guy.  Jackson didn't have a very big role in the movie, but he did what he could. I really didn't care for Greedo.  You know what else he did wrong? He tried to kill Han.  If you've never seen his scene in Empire Strikes Back or Solo, take a good look at his performance.  Han, who is supposed to be the good guy, is the only good guy in the entire movie. I hate the character he plays, Greedo in Star Wars.  I thought that he was just a joke and that he would never survive the whole movie, and he didn't.  That's all Han Solo did in Star Trek: The Next Generation:  Han Solo is a pretty cool guy. He's willing to go to the mat when he needs to, but is generally a gentleman when he wants to be.  He's also a really good shot when he's not shooting first.  Well, he didn no longer have that chance when Han's ship was destroyed in The Empire Strikes back.  There's a big difference between Han Solo and Greedo (who has since become a bad character in The Prequels).  Greedo was a pretty bad dude. He was one of those villains you hated to see in a movie because you thought he couldn't live up to the expectations you had for him.  For example, he had the power to kill off everyone in the galaxy and could use his poison gas to kill entire planets.  When you killed off everyone, they
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how anyone can say anything positive about this movie.  Sure, it has a lot of good things and a lot bad things.   The bad things are:  - The movie was too much of a bad-movie for me.  I was bored right from the beginning.  There is nothing entertaining about it.  The special effects look terrible.  It is just a bad, slow paced, cheesy mess.  If you can get past the bad-ness of the movie, you get a great story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is obvious that the producers of the movie "Greed" are completely incompetent. I am surprised that they were able to find a director willing to work on the movie. The movie does not contain any real plot.

But he fails to get away in time and is found by the police. His plan works out well.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is ridiculous. It's not really a bad idea - after all, there is still the idea that there is the Devil and there are people who are possessed. There are demons that haunt the house, and when they are possessed by a demon, they make fun of the host family for being possessed. However, even when the demons are possessed, they don't really seem to bother the people, and don't do much of anything except making comments on the family's cooking. I would've been happier if I was looking for something else to watch than this. It should be titled Devil's Dinner Party, but it isn't.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't even know what to say about this... It's just a bad, bad movie.  This movie is supposed to be about a guy named Mark who goes to a haunted mansion to rescue his wife.   It has this really long, slow scene where Mark looks at a painting of a man eating a goat and says "Oh, no!   I just ate a goat!  There's a goat eating a man!  Can you believe it?   What's going on here?! I'm going to be very angry!  "    Then he runs up the steps and out onto the main street where he gets jumped by this guy called John Wayne, who's wearing a leather mask that goes all the way up his nose and keeps it there.  This isn't a movie for young kids.  This movie's pretty terrible!  The director, Mike Cahill is a total amateur.  No one is doing any of the work here.  They're just looking at the paintings and moving around.  Then Mark runs up and he says "Where's my wife!"  And the guys just stand there in this long, boring scene.  It ends with some people being hanged.  Mike Cah ill has one of those actors who never gets better.  He can't act at all!  They all do this kind of thing over and over.  All he has to do is get out there with his wife and a gun and they'd all be hanging!  These are just kids who are just doing a lot of stuff for the camera.  Why isn't anyone doing anything for the movie?  How can people watch this and be fooled into thinking they're watching something serious?  The actors just stand around not doing anything.  These people aren't scary!  Maybe these were the actors' first impressions of the house when they got there. Maybe they were just too scared to go in!  Mike had a great part for an actor.  I don't know how he's doing it.  My friend who saw it has never really been scared by movies.  The only good thing about this is it's on cable TV and it can be found on YouTube too! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this movie will be the last we hear of this silly movie. It was ridiculous from the word go, I'm not sure anyone will ever watch a movie about a clown that wears a rubber suit and a mustache (no, he isn't a clown, he is a robot! It's like a horror movie where a clown tries to be human, and the robot clown manages to be even more hilarious). This movie is also full of terrible voice acting. The only two really funny roles are the villain (which I'll explain later), and the lead clown (who plays the guitar and sings really nicely). A few of the other characters are also a real waste of space (you've seen how bad their voice acting is, I wouldn't expect anything better in this movie). The only thing that made this movie worth watching was the ending sequence, which was a great payoff. That was the only good thing about this movie. There is no point to watching this movie because it has so much bad acting. It is a disgrace. I would rather watch a cartoon than watch this stupid movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't help but wonder what it must be like to try to teach a dog how to bark at cars.  This is a movie for the dog lover.  It shows a dog getting out of a car on its own. Then it starts running after the car with the windows open and all the windows down.   It tries to jump over it and it just stays put. When the car stops and all of the windows are down it takes a couple of steps and jumps back over the car. It then goes to the back window and looks all around.   The dog is happy to see what's going on.  A girl with two dogs runs out from the car and jumps into the dog's yard.  When she turns around it jumps for the next car right behind it and hops on as much as it can.  The movie is funny and sad all at the same time.  But the most tragic scene I have ever seen in a movie is right when it's about to be all over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You gotta give a great movie a bad review.  This is a film that was put together without any idea about the plot or any kind of characters. The movie plays like a short film.  It's all about the same people all over the place.  There is not one good person in the movie.  The woman that played the "witch" is not very convincing.  They get involved in one battle after another.  One of the main characters is a woman with a "bad attitude".  She doesn't like to learn, doesn't want to get her hands dirty.  She's not very attractive and very annoying.  And, I just can't understand how this woman can use a magic wand to make a boy's hand disappear.  These people are so stupid.  Every one of them is supposed to be bad or evil.  All they do is make a fool out of everyone who stands between them and the evil empire.  I don't care if I'm a bad person in real life.  If I can turn into a snake and steal someone's heart I can do whatever the hell I want.  A snake is a very good character.  Don't get me wrong. I'm not sure this is the best movie ever made.  You could probably get more of the same with the original series.  Still, it's an entertaining movie to watch with your wife.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not expect much from this movie. After all, this is a movie about the worst movie ever made. When I heard this movie was being made, I was thrilled. What a horrible waste of time. This movie is about a woman who is married to a man who is an alcoholic. After a drunken evening in a bar, the woman decides to go home and sleep. When she gets back to the house she sees that her husband had a party at a hotel. That is all she gets to know about the party. When the husband comes home, she finds out that he is sick. She also finds out he has taken a job at a grocery store. So what does she do? She doesn't even try to help him and goes to work herself. Well, she gets fired but when she asks the boss to take her back, she doesn't get the job. When he gets home he finds out the wife is still at work and starts making up excuses for her. I guess the movie was so bad that people who like to get down with some bad movies like this one will love this movie if they think it is fun.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was skeptical about this at first. Not that I'm a movie snob:  But I don't usually get a movie this good. So when I heard it was going to be made into a TV show I went to a preview screening and it was quite a disappointment.   After seeing the movie, I didn't really expect too much but to my disappointment the production values were far below par:  Even so, I still enjoyed it, mainly because it got some nice performances.  It wasn't just the movie itself that was bad:  It was all the way through the movie that I had a bad feeling about it.  Even the acting, by the way, wasn't that good.  I have to say that, despite my negative review of this film, I'm going to watch the TV movie to see what the TV show is about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't want to read this book.   It looked like a typical romantic comedy and I'm a big romantic comedy fan but when it got to this part my stomach turned into an angry red.  I don't think anyone reading this will even be laughing.  This is about a girl who is the love of her life and is a professional writer.  But her publisher is dying and she writes a letter to her lover to tell him to sell the novel and start over.  When she finds out that he is leaving and wants her to stay to finish the manuscript she tells him " I am not a writer. I am a lover."  She tells him that she is dying too and when she dies she will be cremated which she will not do because there is nothing worth writing about.  The love of my life, her best friend, comes over for a visit and this is a real love story.  He is the epitome of a sweet love story because she is his "No 1 fan" so she won't stop singing about him.  So there we go.  It was very entertaining and entertaining.  Maybe the only thing that is good about the movie is that it ends well so the movie stays on the movie track for another year!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie, with lots of problems. I have no idea how this movie could get made. The story, like so many bad ones in the past, is so bad, that it takes a lot of courage to be seen, let alone to be liked.  This movie starts when a poor and lonely old woman wanders into the local police station, and is arrested for being drunk in the street. She is then brought before a judge, and found guilty. The next day she is told that she will have to pay a fine of 10,000 dinars, and the court costs would add up to around 40,000 and she will be forced to work for the rest of her life. Then we learn that this is an early 1900's story, that was never meant to have a happy ending, for many reasons. The police station was a horrible prison that the criminal had been given to do all his time behind bars.  The policeman's daughter was not given the love that the girl in this movie deserved. She was treated like a piece of meat, who would take pleasure in having sex with any man she thought the most attractive.  No wonder she is so crazy about the young detective.  There is no sex in this film, only sadism and misery.  As for the acting, nothing at all.  Some of the worst performances, I have ever seen in any film.  One thing about this film which is also true about its other movies, is that they are all so bad they actually make me laugh.  I'm sure it made a lot more of me laugh, when the young girl in the movie gave this old lady a lift to the police station (as did all the other vehicles) but it made it more sad as she took her to a cell so old it was crumbling. This is only the second time I have seen this movie and the first time I laughed. This film is a waste of time, and should never be seen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was pretty much everything I was afraid of: old, boring, depressing. The main character is a man who, in a rather unique way (he's got a huge nose, no?), starts to take off the masks he's put on for years. But the movie is much better than you would expect. There's not much of the "magic" of the old days in this. But there are many more scenes that are far better than most comedies are. If the old comedy had a couple of laughs like this it might have been better- but I think it's only about 80% as good as that, with only a handful of really funny lines to offset the boredom and the depressing setting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a horrible movie. As the title and trailer imply, this is a horror movie based on a popular novel about a man who is possessed by an evil spirit that he kills himself by running over a woman he hates in her car. The only saving grace is that it is pretty good for a cheap horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was never a big horror movie fan, but the recent Saw films made me want to be and they were so damn good! I like them because they have a little horror tone to them and because they are made like no other movies. They don't make a "horror movie" as an excuse to "make a movie" of the horror genre. This is pure comedy and terror. I would have loved it more had it been more intense, though that was not the intent of the producers.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In case you haven't heard, James Franco has a new movie out. It's called The Disaster Artist. It stars James Franco as a guy who stars in a movie about a guy he stars in, where he goes from being a pretty successful actor to becoming just another actor.  The film follows his life over the course of a summer, starting off with a rough start in Hollywood, where his "character" gets dumped (and then he is fired). The movie then follows Franco as he tries to survive while trying to find his way into his new career, and then he ends up with a new character (and, uh, new life). And then Franco tries to break into the industry, which is a huge endeavor that is only aided by his own lack of real talent and bad acting skills. I think this movie is a pretty terrible film (aside from the ending), it's not exactly subtle about what is going on, you're not exactly sure who it's about until the last couple minutes of it, and Franco is playing two characters. He does better in his first film (which isn't bad, but definitely wasn't the best of his career), but this one is pretty atrocious. Even the acting is fairly bad, and there isn't enough dialogue. Franco does a good job with the dialogue (I'm guessing because he was given very little dialogue), but he's not very good at acting. I actually found Franco to be a bit annoying the whole time, and I think the whole movie is just going to make his career worse. It will also help Franco get that really stupid Hollywood movie star role, which I'm sure he won't get. I can't even think of a good way to describe this one. It was really bad. It wasn't even very good. The only way I can think of to describe it is if someone made a video game, but in reality it's more like a game that is supposed to be really good, that you actually pay money to play. I couldn't make it through a single minute of the movie. I'm not sure why they thought a movie starring James Franco would be a good idea, it's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it's a great shame because the actors in this one are pretty good. I'd actually recommend giving this a miss.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I was reading a review of a bad film that has an old Hollywood star in it.  I liked it and decided to see it. I went into a black and white theater and was immediately treated to what I suppose was a kind of silent film, except for when a dog jumps on the table and eats it!   This film was so bad that I had to have it rewound because it was just not funny.   It really sucked.  You would think that at this time a Hollywood star would make movies that were at least a little better than this, but this is a movie I don't wish I had ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For those that don't know, this is the same story from the animated movie. It is not terrible at all, but just does not go far enough. The story is about a girl who goes to meet a guy she really likes. But she does not end up having any good luck at all. She is chased by a couple of guys and even though she manages to escape, it is too late.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about two guys who live in a house together on the beach.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In this movie there is a scene in which the bad guy gets hit in the face with a watermelon. The bad guy in the movie (who sounds like he was a young Joe Piscopo and has the same haircut) gets his face wet and says: "I'm pretty pissed. I've been playing games all night. I didn't do anything." I found that the scene with the watermelon was quite a funny scene.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie! The movie is about a little man, named Little Tom, who was born with a strange disease. His mother and sister were not too impressed with this, so he was put into the care of a woman named Mrs. Sartain (Cindy Grant). Mrs.Sartain was kind, patient, and loving towards Little Tom. As a result, Little Tom grew up to be a good and kind little man. However, he had a problem; while the rest of his family could use a little help, Little Timmy needed a lot of attention. One day, Little Timothy woke up to a strange sight; his whole house was covered with books about a strange man called Professor John Wilkins. In the end, it was learned that Professor Wilkins was a wizard who had a castle full of books to teach people how to do magic. While it was a good thing that he had books, LittleTimmy was not really interested in becoming a wizard. The only thing he really enjoyed was going fishing every summer. The thing is, he didn't like getting his feet wet so much and spent most of his time reading. One summer, Timmy decided to go fishing and it seemed to be his lucky day. He went to the lake after the sun went down and found a big trout. Little Tim couldn't help but smile at the sight of this creature. He started fishing more for fun, but was more excited at the thought of finally becoming a great wizard and getting rich. One year, Little Tommie found that he was not as good a wizard as he thought he was. He spent most nights thinking about the things he could do with his life if he had more time. That one summer, he decided that he would go to a wizarding school. One of the first things he saw when he got there was a giant book of magical spells. Unfortunately for Little Tim, the big book was called "The Book Of Giblets". As a wizard, he was taught to cast certain spells in this book. It was at this moment that he realized he was going to need a bigger, more powerful book. Well, he went to a magic shop and bought "The Grimoire Of Horrors" and a new big book of spells. The next thing Little Tim knew was that he found himself in a creepy castle with a witch doctor (the best). Little Tim was soon caught up in a plot by the wizard Giblett. He
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've been saying this since I saw the trailers for this film a couple months ago.   You might as well make this a black and white film.  The film's only redeeming quality is that it is at least an interesting look at a very bizarre story:  The book was written by Dr. John Lash and is about a young man's experience of a supernatural encounter.  For some reason, he takes these hallucinations very seriously.  Dr. Lash is in a position to know this and has had several near-death experiences himself.     (Yes, those movies where the characters are insane and have strange and seemingly inexplicable conversations are old.)   A few things to note:    I had a bit of trouble watching this film. As far as I can tell, this film is the only adaptation of this novel.  There are some differences in dialogue (mainly in the sense that the protagonist seems much more concerned about his hallucinations than he seems to be about the events that are happening around him), and other minor issues, but the main differences seem to concern the characters. The protagonist is a rather dull character, and seems to just be a typical boy from small-town America.  I suppose that is appropriate, as he seems like one of the most typical and typical characters in the book.  Perhaps the only interesting thing about this film, if it can be considered such, is that the actors seem to be quite good at playing a generic American child. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first act is the best part of this movie.   One of the things about the genre of zombie films is the extreme gore factor (which makes them even more frightening).   I didn't really mind it because it made it possible to find some little humor in it.  For example, the last scene when the girl finds a zombie under a bed is pretty awesome.  However, in the second half, they were trying to be "trendy" with every zombie movie they made.  At one point a zombie looks like a girl and is shot at for a good while, while the zombie girl doesn't flinch or show any emotion.  You'll know when the zombie is a girl.  I've seen plenty of zombie movies, but I don't think I've ever seen a zombie film with a zombie in a dress. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's an episode of Buffy called "The Lying Game" which was pretty hilarious. In the first couple of minutes I thought, "Hey I'm not one of those guys who likes Buffy so much because she's funny. I like her because she saves my life." Buffy is the kind of girl who doesn't take any crap (besides the occasional "you get to go home now" from a creepy dude who gets hit in the head by a baseball) so when she saves the day she gets a huge kiss that makes her feel like she's invincible. This is, of course, a terrible lie that she tells everyone because it's the best way for her to show people that she is one of a kind. So, the guy who tried to kill her doesn't just get a slap on the wrist for a misdemeanor. He gets arrested, is put in jail for 10 years, gets out, and becomes a successful actor. In his next film, he makes an even bigger star than Buffy, and then goes on to star in a very successful soap opera. I didn't hate it because it was funny and I laughed at a couple of funny things, but I didn"t enjoy it much and I would never watch it again. It's not a good movie and I wish it was a TV movie, it would have been better than the bad stuff I'm watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a bad flick. It is not too bad either. It's pretty good, pretty average. There is not much of anything interesting going on. The characters are the sort that you should keep the most interesting as long as possible.   It's all about the movie itself, nothing more. It has the same feel to it that I had a few years ago. It may be good or bad, but at this point I can't find anything interesting to say about it.   …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It takes a very long time to get into this film, it's like a really long film in that every time the actors are done talking, the camera pans over and over again in every direction to show us a view of what's going on, with every shot a close-up in which a different character is involved, it doesn't let up for a minute.  At about 35 minutes in we get to the first "plot point", where a guy takes up his time while waiting for a ride.    And by "long", I mean "brief", I have not seen the film since it first premiered, so I don't know the difference between the original and this one, but from everything I've seen since, this film has been "ticked off", or at least it has been in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing to say about this film is, "A little too fast. A little too much too fast".    One thing to note about the whole thing is, that the script is, of course, written by a Jew (Gershom Scholem) and directed by a Jewish director (Nathan Kline) but, somehow, the film just doesn't work!   It has all the hallmarks of a bad film written by Jews:   bad direction (including the way the characters walk in an empty elevator), poor screenplay, bad acting (even the bad acting of the bad character).   The problem is, we have a bad script that just cannot get a bad girl to do a bad thing.   Even so, this is a film that should be rated as an eight for the way it looks, feels, moves, and is all over the place.  In this film, we get a girl who is an outcast because she doesn't do the right things. A girl who was raised in a ghetto, she knows what it is to be poor and she knows how to get by, and she does it. She is a girl in poverty who can fight back and she always does. She just wants to get out of her ghetto and become a good person.  But there are things she cannot escape. For example: a man who does not look like the kind of guy that she wants to be around; a Jewish guy who is not what she wants him to be; a man she cannot live with or a man that she can not get over.  What we get is a movie that is a real piece of work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is full of great ideas and well-thought out characters that are fun to watch, but the fact that it's such a terrible movie at the same time is truly tragic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know how to rate it at all.  If you're looking for something a little different from other "science fiction" films, you'll likely find it.    This is a strange, odd movie, and not a lot to smile about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie does what many a film can do, get you to stop, get to the point, and leave you wanting more.   It is interesting enough, but its all so obvious its not that interesting, it's just a "how to get into a movie", that is to say if you do this and this then this.  This is like an older brother getting you to put away the games and toys for a couple of hours.  You're in for a treat. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did a lot of research prior to buying this movie as to whether or not it was as bad as the reviews made it out to be. After seeing it and reading through the reviews I'm forced to say that it is as bad or even worse. I don't think any of the cast is good enough to make this movie a good one (though maybe I'm the only one who thinks that), and all the acting is cringe worthy. I felt this was a total waste of money at the box office as well.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to write about a movie I love, a movie that is really an example of what great horror film-making is all about.  It is a movie about a young girl who is found dead near a river and her body is never found.    That isn't surprising to me because this is a little girl and she was never found, but you can't make people into mindless idiots.  And she had been having some of the best dreams a girl could ever have, like being the queen of a kingdom and a princess and riding horses and doing magic tricks and dancing and she had even found a magical book which she wanted to read and she thought she was getting all that she deserved and she wasn't even old enough to get out of bed at the beginning.  Now the movie is set in a country where the king and queen are in a war with the King of the Sea (I am going to assume that it's a mythical beast called a sea monster that goes around causing mayhem, etc.)   After the king leaves the royal palace at night to fight the war, the queen and her sisters take over.  When it is discovered that a boy has been found dead in the woods at the bottom of a river, the prince who is very much in love with the girl, rushes to the scene and goes to look for his beloved.  He is found murdered and the girl is found at the river bed.  Her body is missing and when he finds her, he finds that she's dead, too, and she isn't wearing any clothes.  So he goes back to the capital to investigate the murder.  It seems that the girl and the king are both dead (no explanation for the prince's death is given), which is of course bad news.  The queen tries to be nice to him (though she doesn't sound like she is even trying) and then she forces the boy to take her as a hostage, which is even worse.     But the king is much more interested in the girl (which is not surprising because a princess would be a beautiful girl to look at, no?), so the king starts to get mad at the boy.  But it's the queen who seems to think he isn't good enough for her so she starts to seduce him and he is horrified.  This is an absolutely awful way to spend a day, but it is clear that the king wants to marry the girl
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think I have seen pretty much all of the movies in the Alien series. The first, Alien, was a terrible movie. The second one, Alien 3 was very similar to Alien, but it was a little better. The third one was a disappointment; the movie was like a bad car wreck. At least this one wasn't bad. The one with the alien was very bad. All the rest were basically re-dos of older movies, and one was made into a video game. The fourth one, the movie which would be the franchise's final one, would be made into the film Aliens: The Ultimate Collection, which I am sure will be as much of a disappointment to the fanbase as the previous movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those bad movie that are just too bad to be entertaining, to be interesting, to have a story, to make the audience cry and have tears in the eyes after being treated to an absolutely stupid ending.   First off we have a young girl whose life is turned upside down as she discovers her older sister has been replaced by a robot body. Now as a person who is used to the world being in a state of perpetual chaos, this isn't a big change for her but it is when the bad guy finds out about the replacement and makes it his mission to make that robot's life as miserable as possible.  After all that bad stuff happened a while back this movie has to be the most boring movie I've seen in a long time.    The story doesn't advance one bit from the last episode and the characters are just as stupid as ever.  I mean just look at them.  In order to get to the big bad guy we have to take an elevator up to the top and then climb out through one of the many windows in the building to get there and the bad guys plan has always been to shoot the elevator out of the window and blow up the top floor when the heroes get there to find it destroyed.  Then the baddies go through all sorts of doors that don't open and the heroes have to go into every room imaginable just to get them out.  If I wasn't already bored by the story I would have gone out of my mind by now.  And there is no ending.      In conclusion this film is just too stupid and terrible to stand in a movie theater in 2012. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an abysmal picture. The plot is really bad. When you watch it, you don't want to turn it off, and it just doesn't get better. There is no actual suspense, no build-up, and I really can't say anything good about it. This is nothing but cheap trash. I would highly recommend that no one ever buy a copy of this, even if it was a bad one (it wasn't).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing that makes this movie enjoyable is the music.   I wouldn't say it is good.  I've never found the music in the movies I watch much at all.  But... I don't mean this movie is bad, or any better.  The acting is not bad at all, it is really bad.  It's like one of those comedies where they take the worst scenes from previous films and try to pass them off as funny.  This is about as bad as it gets, unless the studio took some notes on how to write bad comedies.  (Oh, wait! I forgot about that. )  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is a mess from start to finish.   The plot is an absolute train wreck as the story starts off well enough, with two teenagers playing around in the yard with a ball but soon things take a turn for the worst.  The characters are either stupid, stupid and stupid (which is not uncommon for a kids movie) and one character even looks a little goofy at the beginning.  It never really gets exciting, with most of the action just being a couple of kids running around throwing balls at each other.  At least the music is pretty good, although that only helps a little.  There's one good scene when the ball gets thrown far enough that it hits a neighbor who looks about to fall on the ground but manages to stop himself with the help of his friends.  This is where I think the movie really starts to fall apart.  I'm not really sure what it is that the kids are doing as their actions have absolutely nothing to do with anything that is happening around them.  One kid comes out of nowhere and knocks a ball into a neighbor's window, then later starts to play in the front yard, which is followed by another kid playing in a doorway.  None of these kids has any idea what they're doing, and each one appears to be in a different state of drunkenness or the like, and most of them are acting like they're in some kind of horror movie.  As a whole, it is not a very good movie, and while it is amusing to watch the teenagers go about their business, it makes you wonder how they ended up playing in that front yard.  Perhaps the fact that these characters were created on a whim with no real plan or direction really didn't help.  Some people might find this entertaining or funny.  Others will find it very unpleasant, and I personally wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless they really want to be entertained by these characters and not even get a sense of what they are supposed to be doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst "horror" movie ever made, and the first time I ever saw it. Why does a film about a killer clown that goes on a killing spree that causes the kids of the neighborhood to disappear go down in a big way, if it's not even remotely scary? If it IS scary, it's the worst and most boring "zombie" movie I've ever seen, and that's saying something. It might be entertaining for a few minutes, but for me it's awful. No matter how many times they show the clown running up to the kids with his knife out, and it always goes in their heads, it always comes right back out and runs away. It's ridiculous that kids in the 1980s think a killer killer clown is cool and fun to scare. I'm pretty sure a zombie clown wouldn't scare a kid this much in the 80s. The film could use some work in the sound department. In spite of the fact that we're shown some great performances from Robert Englund (a lot of the film is set in a dark room with poor, outdated sound), the sound effects are so cheesy it hurts my ears. I get the fact they needed to include a lot of stock sound effects, but the way they're used just makes the movie worse. Why would they go through the trouble of making a cheap, bad horror film out of the creepy clown theme, when they could just use a cheap zombie theme? The acting is pretty much non-existent, even for a poor budget, so all the characters look and act like they were recorded in a closet in a home movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is really a poor attempt at a horror film. I watched a couple other bad movies that fall short of being truly awful; this movie is clearly the worse.  I would avoid this movie at all costs.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The idea of a man in a top hat and tails riding around in the moon and talking to a woman in a red dress while carrying his hat makes me chuckle.  Why do I say this?  I said it a minute ago when the movie started.    The plot is pretty dumb as are most comedy films.  One thing that stands out is that the movie is very similar to "The Lady and the Tramp," although a little more violent and a little shorter.  The acting was decent, although there were times when it seemed as if the director could not understand the lines he was giving.  I did not like the song that the character sings during the chase.  You know that song that is about the lady and the tramp?  That song is the theme song to this movie as well as all the comedies that I have seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is well written, a good action movie with excellent fight choreography and fight sequences. There are few strong characters. The ending scene has not the charm of the first act. This movie is not a movie for young people, it is not for fans of martial arts movies. If you like action movies that have good fight scenes, this is a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing I noticed about this movie is how it seems like it was designed by a "D-list comedian." Sure there is a lot of silliness, but the jokes and jokesters are all too uninteresting, and they all lack charisma. Also the lead is a wacky guy and is quite irritating because he always does stupid stuff like asking his neighbor to do something. This movie does have good acting from all the actors, some of the best I have seen.  One last note; it does remind me a bit of the musical version of "Annie Get Your Gun." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie by any measure. It is basically just a big, cheesy, self-indulgent, pretentious, over-the-top comedy. It consists of two people in a long, convoluted, boring conversation, where the subject matter is always the same -- people getting together on special occasions, etc. It's a classic, formulaic movie. I just wish that the movie was actually funny. At least the characters were unique in the sense that the people in the movie do have personality, but no one is any good. Not even a little. And the movie is only interesting because there are only two people involved -- which I guess is a great way to do a comedy that is only about two people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie takes its time introducing us to two characters: an ordinary person who happens to be a robot and a young man who is just trying to get by. After the film finishes, the viewers are left wondering "Who is this boy and who is this girl?" and "Who cares?" We should not have to wait for five years to know who the boy is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very bad movie - The only reason I watched it is because of the trailer.   I did not enjoy this movie.  I found no humour in it - I have no idea who is on the other side or what they are doing - it seemed like they just wanted to have some silly fun.  At one point I thought they were actually making it up as they went along.  It was really rather pointless with a ridiculous ending which only brought up more questions.  A story which is based on a novel called The Last War should really be better than this, but this is an unoriginal story which will probably not interest any readers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A lot of movies in this genre are garbage and not worth watching, even for me.   "A couple of college freshmen fall in love and find it hard to break up after having lived together since they were 18"   Sounds dull, right?   No, it is the dumbest and most clichéd romantic comedy ever to come out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has nothing new to it. All we want to do is have fun! In fact, the fun part is pretty much over by the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie should be in the trash and not seen. As it is, this is just a mess and a gross over acting performance by the actresses. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "He Who Is Not My Son"  is a horror-comedy that stars Paul Sorvino as a man with a brain tumor, an extra pair of ears, and one very strange name: "Kerr". I suppose it could have been "Karen" or something, but then "Kir" is not a word that you want to hear spoken around your dinner table. It looks like a bad joke, but if you listen hard you'll find a really awful movie with one of the most bizarre plots I've ever heard. There's a young couple living in a tiny house in the country. As their story goes on, the young woman develops a new lease of life. She learns to speak, has a boy born, has the boy baptized (but never baptized again). She even has a boyfriend. The mother eventually goes to a mental institution (where her daughter stayed while she was there), and the son is sent to live with the grandfather. The grandfather loves and understands the young boy, and the couple has two boys of their own. It's not long before the young husband has his own problems, though. He's not only mentally challenged, but he's also physically disabled. He falls down a lot. In the end, he's sent to a special school for the mentally handicapped. The rest is just as you'd expect. There is a lot of yelling, an over-reliance on a lot  of cheap laughs, and a few disturbing scenes. It is a pretty pathetic movie. It does not go where it should go. It just kind of goes around in circles until it gets to the end. That's a pretty rare and rare thing to come out of a horror comedy. It really doesn't make much sense. But at least the movie doesn't try to make a lot happen in an effort to scare the audience. It simply says "fear the worst" and the audience is meant to feel that fear. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not really sure how anyone else has watched this movie. I do not know where I've seen it before, but this is not the same story that was put on film. You will not find yourself wishing for the characters to get a happy ending, nor the children to have happy lives. You might find yourself thinking "If they didn't have the kind of lives they had, how do they keep going through this?" In fact, this movie is so bad it is almost funny. One time at a movie theater, there were three young teens, playing "Superbad". They were talking about how they used to live on their own in a small house with a dog. They were complaining about how much they had to buy food and how they missed playing with each other. One of them started talking about his "girlfriend", an eight year old girl that had two younger brothers, like themselves. A few minutes later, one of them goes to the bathroom and the other two start playing "Sesame Street".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was about to give this a miss, only because I'm an American, but if you love Bollywood movies, and love to laugh at them (in an English accent, no less), this movie is probably for you. It's an Indian comedy that is really good at what it does. It has some good jokes and some good acting, although the most entertaining parts are the ones that happen before the movie starts - when we see the Indians being arrested, it's usually to have a good-natured wrestling match in the back ground. Then there's the usual gangster comedy. At the same time, the Indians are very funny and well acted. It will make you laugh out loud. The film is set in Calcutta, India, about 1900 or so, and involves an Englishman called Jack who is employed by the British administrator of a large Indian city, and a beautiful girl called Miss Rani, who is an English governess, although she also has a passion for playing the violin and singing. And then there's Mr. G, who's got all sorts of dirty jobs for the Indians to do. Also, there are lots of British soldiers who are visiting Calcuttan at the time to make their lives easier. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first thing that would strike you if you watch " The Great Train Robbery " is the fact that it is actually pretty good. The plot follows that of a young thief named Tom Corbett who falls in with a gang of thieves and sets out to steal a large train.   This film has a very intriguing plot that starts out fairly simple but quickly develops into something more.  I liked the premise as it was a story about a young man trying to make the most of his life. This story may seem like it was meant for a kids television program but it is very well acted and is a classic and great looking film.  The film is very low budget but I found a lot of fun in it as it is full of the typical Hollywood shenanigans that are usually found in this genre.  It was enjoyable to watch and was a lot better than the many films I have seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a low budget remake of a low-budget original (one of my all time favorites) that is no longer on film. The movie is boring, the cast is bad (I'm talking about the lead: Richard Burton) and this movie is not even funny. The special effects are laughable (in that their use seems to be based on cheap practical effects and not on good effects) and the movie plays out like a bad old time Western. I wish this movie had never existed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is about a girl who has her brain damaged by a car crash. In the years since, she has lost all memory of being herself and has been unable to even use the toilet. In a desperate attempt to remember who she was and how she came to be who she has become, she takes a job selling dolls, in exchange for food and clothes. Her employers include a young, beautiful, and charming girl who is only a little older than she is. She soon discovers that the dolls are not really that different from normal dolls, but a little more realistic and quite a few of the doll personalities come to life.     It's just a cute little story and it might just be that I found it hard to watch this movie again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It wasn't bad at all!  The cast was really good, the director did a good job, and this was the only one of the trilogy that I wasn't turned off by...  But at the end of it all it felt like a bad sequel to "Jurassic Park" with a little more "Crocodile Dundee" thrown in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie that everyone says "I wish I had seen." My dad has seen it once and I've seen it twice. The only thing that makes this movie worth seeing is the soundtracks. This movie isn't bad at all, it's just kind of lame.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm in awe at the fact that this remake of "The Man with the Golden Arm" (  , directed by Fritz Lang) is even more hilarious than the original.   It is like a cross between a musical comedy and a monster movie, but instead of a giant, hairy, flesh-eating monster, we have a giant guy who is very much like a giant man (and much smaller, so that he has a little less trouble standing up).   He also makes a few cameos, but they're the kind of cameos that show up in old monster movies like Frankenstein, The Wolf Man and The Mummy.  What's funny about this film is that it isn't very good.  It's a little long, a little corny, and it doesn't really make any sense, but it does have a few clever little touches that help it stand out from the crowd.  The most memorable is the way it tries to portray "the other man" as a complete fool.  He has absolutely no interest in anything but to kill the man with the golden arm.  While his character does have an odd kind of charm, the movie does have some interesting ideas:  one scene has the man in a kind of drunken rage, and he's a bit like Dracula.  And one moment shows just how much the film's creators understood the fact of how terrible horror movies were in the early '20s.  So while this is more of a comedy than a horror film, it's quite funny to watch, with some very inventive ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's one of those cheesy old "love at first sight" type of romances where the guy gets kidnapped by a girl and she falls in love with him before he does (she's a prostitute) and things work out from there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie sucks!    This movie is a very bad movie, and a very boring movie!  I am very frustrated with this movie, because it is a boring boring movie.  There are not many things to do in this movie. There are really not any scenes with the cast, we do not learn anything new about these people, and we are not introduced to their personalities.   The most important thing I learned from this movie is:  If you want to tell a story about a woman and her ex-boyfriend you probably should not bother going to the movies and trying to recreate the romance by having a few women talk about the men they know, or talking about what they did that day.  The story here is just lame and stupid.  It is pretty much the same story as in another bad movie called "Loser", and I just do not see how this movie can be considered good.  Please people, keep this movie away from me!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are several great parts in this movie but none of them are quite able to stand up to the previous and the worst bits. The writing in this film is not great. The only good part in this is the scene when the three women play "Bubble Trouble" on the playground, when the bubble comes to life and goes for the head of one of the women. The others try to help the poor girl, but the girl dies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is as basic as it gets. We go to an amusement park with a bunch of clowns, who are all having a really bad time. The main clown, the funny, happy-go-lucky Johnny Five, decides to get into a fight with a couple of other clowns. Johnny Five gets beaten up pretty bad, but then he remembers that he's made a promise to his wife, and he comes back home to get the girl. The rest is predictable crap, and the movie isn't even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a horrible piece of rubbish and there is no entertainment in it for anyone who hasn't seen it.   I was shocked to see a movie which has nothing to do with the Batman: The Animated Series and has nothing at all to do but a poorly animated movie about Batman running from a gang of thugs.  It is as lame as it is stupid.  No one cared about these characters or the plot in any way.  There is no humour in it. No one cares if they're all dead and Batman is running through rooftops trying to avoid capture.  This is just an awful film.  I don't have an excuse why anyone who saw this should waste their time, but they need to get out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not even halfway through the film, I noticed something that was definitely not a big deal:  The main star of the film is a pretty blonde.  For years I've been looking forward to this movie because, well, it's just a damn good old fashioned adventure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so looking forward to this movie that I bought a ticket right away as soon as it came out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Gilligan's Island" is a good ol' time.  A great, simple story of two friends who get lost in the middle of the ocean and end up at a strange island.    There's not a whole lot of story, but they're both hilarious.  "Gills' Island" was one of those movies that was great but not great enough to be remembered.  I haven't seen "The Little Mermaid" since I was a kid, and I remember watching that movie and thinking it was amazing.  But I don't have the movie to compare with, and it's still a fun movie.  This is a funny movie with a few jokes that are funny in a silly way.  There are other great Disney animated movies out, but I don in to "Gilligans Island." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie's good, but it isn't.   It's a bad one at that.  It plays out like a bad action movie with a bad plot.  You're introduced to the character who would become the star of the film, then he is thrown in jail.  He escapes and starts killing everyone.  For the first two hours, I thought "Oh my God!  This bad movie can't get worse!" Then something happened: he stopped killing people and it became "I am the hero of the movie."   As it turns out, this film is a bad story, and the worst thing is that there's nothing to make me like the guy more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It seems to me that people are not able to distinguish between the quality of a movie and the quality and acting of the actors involved.   If I could put my finger on one thing that was terrible, it was the acting of Jack Nicholson.  The other thing was the film makers not really thinking about the effects that the actors had.  I feel that this film really could have been a little better, and that Jack Nicholson would have been better if he had been given a good role in a good film.  This is a good flick if you're looking for a good laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete rip off from the original and they don't even try to make it original, it is really bad. The story is very cheesy. There is a girl named Sarah who wants to become a model and has to go to a modeling shoot that is staged in a place called "The Rock". She gets naked and in her underwear and gets her ass kicked. The man who is doing the shooting is this loser named Jeff. He is a very large man, who likes to take nude pictures. The woman who is with Sarah has an accident while playing tennis. She gets very sick and is thrown in the hospital. So Sarah gets dressed and she does a photoshoot but she gets sick again and passes out. The doctor thinks she is going to die but before they can call an ambulance she wakes up and she is now living in a strange house with Jeff and his new girlfriend. Sarah decides to get Jeff back so she can go to college and become a doctor. This movie was made for a big budget. There are almost no actors in this movie. It is really cheesy. It does have some funny parts that are funny. I mean, I laughed my a** off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In case you haven't heard,  Michael Bay is back with yet another 'Transformers'  film.  Yes, I realize it's been over two years now since the last  movie but I am so desperate for more!    I've only just discovered that this is going to be the seventh  title film directed by Michael Bay.   He previously made the awful 'Toxic', 'Death Race' and 'Pain and Gain' films which are all among my least favorite movies but there is one thing in Bay's past that has left a very negative legacy.  And that is   the horrendous   Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.   It's a fairly faithful adaptation of the original Michael Bay cartoon series which is a big step up from most of the recent Transformers movies.  The problem is that it does so many things so incredibly wrong that its a wonder they made it to the theatres.  It features characters, robots and robots fighting robots while at the same time talking to people.  I mean, come on, that can't possibly be a combination that a kid would enjoy, can it?  Transformers are supposed to be these mystical warrior knights who fight evil and all they do is sit around, play video games and talk about stupid things.  Seriously, when was the last time they had any kind of plot going?  Even worse, when is the last movie of Bay's that involved a human being?  I'd be willing to wager the last one was 2008's terrible 'Crimson'   The story centers around a group of teenage robots (that looks a lot like Michael Bay's wife/ex wife) that are sent to kill all human beings on earth.  To the humans, these little things are the source of all evil on the planet.  Unfortunately for our humans, the Transformers have already wiped out 90% of the human population.  They even had the gall to create a new human race, called the Autobots, who are supposed   to be superior to human beings and destroy the Transformers every chance they get.  Sadly, the humans don't see things that way and actually manage to create an android robot, Jazz (from the 'Transform' cartoon) in an attempt to save the humans from the Autobot forces.  What follows is a fairly entertaining action packed chase sequence that leaves you wanting more.  There are a few more action scenes here and there
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While the movie didn't bother me too much for its genre, it had a plot that was quite dull. I think if it weren't for the characters it wouldn't be too bad, but it certainly wasn't good either. I liked the look of some of the costumes, and the characters all seemed to be in a lot of trouble. Maybe one day this will turn into something, but I'm not holding my breath.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason I didn't care for this movie was that I really thought it was going to be a different movie. It didn't deliver on that promise. I'm not the only one who thinks so either. This isn't your standard movie. Instead of a good story and a good set of actors there is a bad story and bad actors that come together to make a bad film. And the worst part about it is the movie's director and one of his actors in the movie. The director can be found in the movies "The Longest Yard" and in "Cocaine Cowboys." The best part of this movie is that the director and actor play off each other. He's so bad that he makes a good movie for the bad actor. Not worth watching at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To start off with, I have to say that I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. There are some good movies that are made in the 80s and this is definitely one of those. It is just another movie that would be better if there were more explosions and less talking and not so much gore. The movie makes fun of it's own conventions like a drunk who thinks he is funny when he makes someone take a walk in their front yard (as seen in the trailer) I would like to see more of this from this director. It's just not very good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of people are stranded in a small town during a snowstorm, so they set out to scavenge food.   It's one of those movies where they show you just a few bits of the film and then you're lost in it.

The plot is simple: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie a few years ago, it was a bad film. It's one of those boring horror films where a man is trying to figure out who has killed his wife while his wife is trying in vain to help him by showing him a videotape about what happened before her death. It was also about a "curious woman" with a "bizarre" relationship. It wasn't a good movie. I was tired of it after one viewing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As a movie lover, and fan of bad movies, I enjoyed this movie. In addition to the fact that the acting is bad, and the story is cheesy, the story of the film is really interesting. It's just as bad as a bad comic book. I have never heard of an old person like a "Old Man". Well, I was able to laugh at it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I wish I had seen this when I was young, it had the kind of charm that the kids of the 50's loved, but it was a good example of a good old fashioned noir film with a dash of jazz and adventure.  I remember having friends over who were all into "Guns, Glamour & Death"  I showed them "Papa Zit" and one of them said that it was "like 'Mannix' meets 'Kurt Cobain' ".  But even though it was great fun I wish it had been made in the 60's.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst film of all time. I watched it again this year to see how terrible it was and it's not a bad film per se. If anything it was a fairly competent piece of cinema, especially since the acting was quite solid. In fact, it's quite a shame that this film is no longer around since its poor acting and poor direction are still quite obvious to modern eyes. Unfortunately it's this kind of stuff that sets a bad example for other films made in the 20th century to come. As long as people like this can put their minds together and make films that are mediocre at best, movies like this have nothing to offer the world.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to see a bad film, you should see this one.    If your only intention is to make your eyes hurt, then, you get a good bang from the box office.  The special effects were so bad that I found it hard to tell the different between what I'm supposed to call a car wreck and a plane crash.  I don't think a "car crash" would go like that.  But then, neither did a good actor.  This film is not about airplanes at all, even if they crash in a plane.  Instead, it's about a crazy character named George.  George suffers from some mental problems: one minute, he's running along the edge of the street yelling at a dog, and then he starts to walk around.  Eventually, he gets in a car, puts the car in park, and sits on the seat with the dog.  As the title of this film suggest, George drives a little too fast and then it goes down.  Then he gets out and looks around. It's only then that he realizes that the car he was driving had disappeared.     George is forced to go back into his house to get the keys, but he finds out that something has happened to the car (he drives around on it's roof, and gets a nice shot of a bunch of rocks flying off the roof as it goes over). George tries to return the car to its original location, but when he walks along the highway to the house, he can't find it, which is strange, because when he was sitting in the car, it should have been sitting in front of him.  So he finds a new spot to sit, but it's already too late - the car has gone.  And that's all that's happening - there are no special effects, just a regular old car wreck.  It's the most forgettable film of the year. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a movie which never should have been made. The original ending to the story was, in my opinion, bad, and the last few minutes of the movie were nothing short of disgusting. The characters were bland, the ending was too easy and the movie wasn't anything special. There were some good performances, some pretty special effects, but I simply could not find a single thing that made this movie worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had always been a huge Batman fan, and even though I wasn't a fan of the comics, the movies still sucked me in. This one is pretty much a throwback to those days with lots of cool action scenes, but nothing to get really excited about (it doesn't get much better than the last one). The movie is about a young man who is called the "Cage" (no really!) who is part of the "Superhuman Registration Act" or S.R.A. There is a reason why he is the Cage. He gets the ability to become bigger and stronger by punching people. But since it's all done by punching, no one knows what exactly he is capable of, and they have to hide it from everyone. When he goes to take a test at a school to prove that he is superhuman, he is beaten up by a bunch of "students" who do their homework by punching other students. He then decides to fight the school officials to get more info on this thing. He beats them up too (for being dumbasses), and they decide to give him the ability. He ends up having an amazing night of training and ends up defeating all of the students on the S.A (S.R.) by using their own powers against them (even though he couldn't figure out how to punch through them). And that's the movie I was going to be watching in high school. I don't hate it at all, I just think that the movie is the same movie every time. The action scenes are still cool, and it has a cool storyline that is a bit convoluted (or so I think). I was a little disappointed that they didn't expand on this story further; it could have been an awesome movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bunch of teenagers have fun as they head to a rock concert in a small California town. The first rock concert they're to take place at, is a disaster; the band is completely unprofessional and the singer is totally uninspired. The kids take a few drinks when they show up to the next performance and are totally wasted. The next night, they go to a different concert. The singer starts playing a song from a video called "Love on the Rocks" which is basically a bad rock concert video; it is hard to watch because the singer's voice is completely bad and no matter how hard you try to keep from laughing, it just sounds like he's screaming his head off, and the rest of the song is boring. The following night, a bunch of the kids go out for some late night shopping. One of them takes a cab and the driver is a hulking black guy dressed all in black; all of the white people at the mall are terrified of this scary looking guy. The driver asks the kids for directions to a movie theater and the kids head into the parking garage. Suddenly a big guy in a black robe appears behind the kids and grabs them and slams them into the wall of a building next to a shopping cart full of clothes. The kid gets away from the wall; the big guy grabs another kid and slams him to the floor. The other kid runs out the door while the other kids run into the mall. As the kids are running, the big black guy is running after them. Then a car drives by and the big man is inside, and it's going the wrong way. This causes him to slam into a large building and his black robe catches fire. The bad guy runs away on horseback. The white kids run out of the mall and the scary black guy comes back with his horse after them, but the kids have caught up to him and they are blocking his way. The scary black man turns around and screams out in a white man's voice, "Get back here, you white folks, or I'll burn you all!". The kids begin to run again and the black man throws his robe at one of the whites and it burns him to a crisp. The black man runs away with his robe burning behind him. Finally, the white kids get through to the black guy and say "We're sorry, we thought we heard you scream 'Get Back Here'". As they run off, the black dude is still screaming,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a movie I'd watch again.   But it's not as bad as the first time I saw it.  What's interesting is that, like "The Muppet Movie," there was a lot of talk about how the Muppets were still going to be around, that they were a major force in Hollywood, that Muppet characters like Kermit, Fozzie, and Miss Piggy were all still being used, but that a lot had changed in the past ten years.  This film is like a sequel.  There's still more jokes, but most of them take a back seat to the more serious stuff, like the Muppet family dealing with a bad film star, the first signs of Kermit's impending retirement, Kermit being angry at Fozz and Miss Sniffles, and Kermit dealing with the fallout from his son becoming a drug dealer.  The humor of this film is about what you expect from Muppety.  It takes a very dark, serious, and sometimes funny look at the lives of the Muggle family.  If there was any kind of Muppet that would fit in well at a family-friendly family movie like "Babe," it would be Kermit the Frog.  In a year when the Mockingbird franchise seemed to be slipping away, it seems appropriate to have this one last film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie does not do it's job properly.   We are introduced to a girl (who I've never seen before) in a room.  We see it go down a corridor, go a few rooms, then the guy from the bathroom comes in.  This guy is an alcoholic and he has a weird stuttering speech that is just not right.  The main problem here is this guy is really bad, he is not the type of guy you would see in a film like this.  He acts really bad in this movie, and all he is good for is making her laugh at him.  It has a pretty silly and cheap look to it with a few funny moments, I guess if there was going to be a movie about the "goody two shoes" that is pretty much what you get.  Not a bad comedy movie, but I think that in a comedy movie like this they should have gone a bit lighter and used a better actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is the worst I've ever seen. The only good thing about it is the "fans" who came to see it (but not to go see it) and the actors who were in it. - March 21, 2005What the hell is this?!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that the movie is very bad. I think the movie has some potential and may be a little good. The ending is really really bad too. The story was very slow. I found it very boring. All the scenes where the characters talking about the past were awful. The main character didn't like to talk. I wish that there were more good scenes in the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been watching a lot of bad films lately. I was recently watching "Tombstone" at my local Cineplex. It was not bad. I thought it was good. It had an old fashioned feel. And the acting was good and the violence not bad at all. I didn't feel it was that bad. If this were a real movie then maybe it would have been. But it isn't. It is an action movie. There are a lot less of them than there were when I was younger. Now it seems like they are trying to make up for it by adding more action movies. There isn't much for me to say. This is just a bad action movie but it has a good old west feel to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is a reason that this is the worst movie I have ever seen: It has nothing to do with politics, the problems in this movie can be found all over the place: A cop and a young woman who get trapped in a house and cannot be saved. A cop tries to help her but the poor woman doesn't want to go back to the cops because there is a baby with her that the mother will not leave alone. It's not exactly a romantic story but in this genre this kind of thing is not uncommon. The worst part of this movie is that the movie does nothing to try and improve itself after it started to stink. It should have been better and more fun. I didn't like any of the characters in this and all the things that could be done better were not.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is more to this than the typical horror movie about a monster.   It is about the human spirit that is strong and will triumph over any evil.  This is a film about a little girl who is trapped in a house with a demonic witch.  A man, who was once an explorer in South America is taken in by her.  There will be no witch. This is about a father who is trying to get through this nightmare to find his daughter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of my favorite movies of all time. I love how the movie is not about a bunch of kids who are bored, trying to impress girls, but a story about an old lady who wants to keep her house and her daughter. There is a great deal of symbolism in the movie: the family of one of the girls is the family from The Old Man and the Sea. There are some good jokes: a couple of girls think they can impress a boy by having him wear a red coat, and the old lady doesn't like "that" stuff.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love me some M*A*S*H   It is a war movie with a lot of laughs, a great acting and a pretty good cast. The main reason I like this show so much is because the production is not bad at all.   So why have the writers, directors and cast of this show been given so many awards?   Why is this show still on the air?  There is so many issues with the production and that is really all it really is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When the movie comes on, it's very obvious that this movie is about a serial killer. The killer, a former schoolteacher, makes a career out of murdering little girls. These murders are fairly random. One of these little girls might be the next to die. But then another one of these girls might escape, or become the next murder victim. The film is not particularly impressive in any sense. It lacks an emotional core. You can never really connect to the protagonist. I was interested in seeing more of the town and the victims, but it's always too quick for that. The killers seem to get off on murdering little children. In the end, you get the feeling that it's all a game. But there are other murders too, of little girls who don't appear to have even a shred of life left.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie does not make me want to kill a person. No. This movie makes me think to myself, "What if?"  This is about some people who get a very large house, a small car, and a very small budget for living in a really expensive town (Los Angeles).  There's a murder in the house, and the people are very frightened about the situation.  But there's a twist at the end.  Is this movie too stupid to be fun?  Not quite! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is one of those movies that everyone loves to hate.  My husband is a movie buff, so I think he was all for seeing this one.  It has some excellent acting (Robert DeNiro!), great scenery, and the best set I have seen in a while.  The story is very simple, but the way the character's come across is so believable that it is easy to sympathize.  This movie is about a guy who has been working in the film industry for 25 years and has seen every movie that has come out of Hollywood since the 30's.  He has never had a bad idea, has never missed a beat, and he is ready to make the biggest movie of all time.  His only problem is that he does not have a chance to make such a movie because all of his friends, including his wife, have been fired.  You are watching a guy get fired and not a movie about it.  Not good enough to win a Oscar, not bad enough to make anyone cry, and definitely not something you should see just because your movie buff father does.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one bad movie. It's like a movie about some people who love to kill things. It shows you the different ways to kill a snake: stab with a stick, use a rifle, stab with rocks, use an axe. It doesn't get much better. So far, this movie is only about killing things, so maybe they should change it and make it about the other things they love to do.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For those of you who have seen it, there is a scene near the end. The bad guy (who is obviously a big goof) shows a bunch of his buddies some photos he takes (he has a really creepy looking camera) and they all stare at them. They don't say anything, but you can't help but think that all these characters are just staring at photos they don't really care about. Then he puts on a music box that you would assume looks like a record but it's actually an old-style film projector (you can see a little piece of film sticking out from the side). Then he lights it up. There are other things like this, so this movie is not too bad but definitely not the greatest of the 1980's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason to see this movie is to see the horrible acting at work. This movie is the worst  thing I have ever seen. There is nothing funny or inspiring about it. And I would think it is only the actors' fault if there are not any funny or great jokes. And they all seem to be acting  like they want to laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie doesn't have much of the style of the classic monster movies of the 1950s. The monster is an oversized, humanoid humanoid that jumps from the window of a building. The story is told from the perspective of the young girl, who is having a date with a boy, who in a somewhat creepy and comical manner walks out of a window onto the terrace of the house. When the girl realizes he has been in there long enough, she looks back and there he is, the creature. I like the effects; they are interesting and give the movie a unique style. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have yet to see this film, so I can't comment, but as a kid I had this movie play all the time in the movie theater. Now I do know that the story has not aged well. There's a bunch of talking heads telling you what's wrong with the world, but for a movie this old, the message is the worst.   From what I remember it was a sort of slapstick comedy. Some old black man was a talking head at a movie theater who'd say something silly. Then the old black guy would say a more serious version of what he was saying, and then the rest of the gang would be there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was one of those "good bad movie" things like "The Great Escape" or "Raiders of the Lost Ark". I've seen a few of these before and they are not bad. They're a little corny and a little silly (or maybe not, maybe this is a case of "It is what you make of it" ) but they are fun. They have a real sense of humor, it gets the point across and a great cast of actors. In fact, I would have been really interested in seeing a remake of this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I haven't seen this one either, but it's getting a lot of positive reviews, so who knows?  It's got lots of pretty good actors, and a lot to chew on.  That being said, this is not a good film.    It's a very bad movie, in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It had absolutely no chemistry, and had no one to blame but itself. I can't watch it, ever.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The director, who played a character who was supposed to be a good guy in a bad, bad movie, had so much fun playing this character he was probably more fun than he was acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know how these movies are made - an action/adventure series set in Egypt. The movie is about a girl named Isha (Sophie Wilson) and her father. Their son is named Omar (Peter Sarsgaard) and when they're on vacation they're separated in the middle of nowhere. There's an Egyptian priest named Thoth (Sarit Maria) who takes them in and it's up to Omar to figure out the family's history. Omar's a bad student, a bit of a nerd (and he's a boy) and his family doesn't really have a lot of money. Omar wants to learn the alphabet and he makes up the alphabet as he goes along (he's the only child in the family). It's a bit frustrating that the whole movie takes place at a school (Ishah and El-Baz, not to be confused with the Egyptian alphabet).   So, is it a bad film? No. It's well-produced, well-acted and is full of all kinds of action sequences and exciting sequences. It could have been much better in its own right, but it gets the job done.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film tells the story of three brothers: the wise uncle, the young master and the old man. They live together in a little attic in the middle of the city of Moscow, but the young boy and the wise old man never really see each other, despite their close relationship and the closeness of the atmosphere they have to their mother, who died when the old uncle was three. The mother lives in a small flat in the same flat, which her husband is renting. This means that the children have a constant presence in the home of the woman they love so dearly and the little attic room is full of things of little interest to them.  In addition, two elderly women live with them, which means that one of the brothers has the responsibility to take care of the children.   At the beginning of the film, we are shown the young son watching a film. In one scene, the little boy is playing a chess game with a woman whose face is hidden behind a curtain. The chess game is in full swing, and the young child is winning. The young man is very excited about the game and is telling his mother about it, but she thinks that his eyes are not on the chessboard, but on the ceiling. We then see a shot of the chess board, in which the young man has been replaced by a black pawn, which he uses to make an impossible move: he cuts a line through all the pieces and plays one of them on top of another. This move is obviously impossible. However, it is not the pawn, but a bishop that moves on top. As a result, it captures all the black pieces except the black queen. The black bishop also moves, and so the white pieces are eliminated from the board.  The young master, the old master and his mother are delighted at the result. In a strange way, the move makes sense: one should never play on top or move black pieces. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is basically a parody of everything that is good about Hollywood, and I'd say it does that much better than it should.   It is an incredibly dumb action-movie that seems to be in direct relation to the stupid action-adventure movies of the 80's. This time they were all based on comics, and so they all were about a super-strong, stupid, stupid super-powerful little green man who has no sense of humor and no idea what he's doing.  The acting is as ridiculous as the comic book villains.  Some of the best bad acting is provided by Bruce Timm, who gives himself a very convincing mustache.  I mean, even the villains are acting like idiots and the actors playing them are doing nothing.  It's really all about the dumb characters and the dumb script.  This is one dumb movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good movie, but don't think you can do anything about it, you may be a good-looking couple but you cannot change the fact that you are a very bad-looking married couple, don't do it, at least be careful in future when you go to a movie  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just another bad movie by an old actor and a bad director. It is not bad at all, but like I said in my previous review, a movie I would like to see better done in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The ending of this is where the movie loses it. The villain, a man who has stolen a priceless painting from the Louvre, is brought before the King and his wife, the Queen. As he is about to be executed, the king tells the king's servants, "Come on, we have to get him a suit of clothes! " The servant goes and gets one. The king, thinking that the man is the thief, asks him, "How much is the painting worth?" The servant says, "A million francs" - and the King says, with an air of triumph, "If that is a million franc, we will make a million!" The servant takes the painting to his master in a private room. Suddenly the King has a brain aneurism, and goes to get help. The servant is then arrested, and the king then dies in the bed of his master. The master takes the king to his castle, and asks him why he does not put the painting back. The man replies, "It was stolen from me, I did not steal it! " "Well," replies the King, "you stole it from me!" The King then goes to a store where they have all kinds of things for sale. After he has been there for some time they notice that the whole store is empty. A little later, the owner of the store, a very old, wise and very rich man, sees the poor man in his store. He asks him if the poor fellow can get him something. The poor man says, ''No", and goes away very upset. The old and wise man realizes that he can do nothing to help. "I will go," the old man says. He goes back and comes back two minutes later with a sword, but when the old woman asks why the old fellow is back after so long, the old master tells her that a thief has just come, but the thief was caught and is in the prison. The woman says that he must be put to death. The Old Master gets down from the throne, walks into the dungeon with the old lady, and stabs the thief three times in the back. "What do you think," the Old Master asks the old people, "Was it worth it?" Everyone replies, "...no", and the Old Masters looks at them all in silence. THE END -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish I were making this review as much fun as I was watching it. This film is a real laugh riot.  The acting is so bad, a bad ass villain with bad hair and a beard is hilarious. I was laughing out loud every time the bad guy laughed.  A few of the supporting roles are played by better actors, such as Michael Palin, Michael Schindler, and Mike Schindel.   This film also contains a great ending, one that will please movie fans of all ages. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me, this is one of the best, if not the best of all, the James Bond movies. I think this was a great choice to direct the last one in the series and it works perfectly. The music is great, the action is great and it all works. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful. This movie should be in every grade in every school, but no, instead it's stuck in the "bad, good and bad" category. The good is that the plot seems to work, however it is pretty shallow, and the ending is... well, not really anything to write home about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible film. I wish I had never seen it. It is bad in every way imaginable. The acting is bad, the dialog is bad. I would probably not watch it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a pretty boring movie. A young girl is walking around town and decides to check out a strange house. When she gets there, she realizes that she doesn't recognize anything in the house (though the windows are made of crystal). She goes to the owner who's a rather old and senile woman and finds out that she is actually the spirit of a young girl that was killed by the vampire in the 1800's. The girl is able to come to the present (though it takes a while for her to do so) and tries to warn the owner (who is quite a scaredy cat) to not let his "diseased" grandson out of the house. The owner tries to ignore the young girl and runs away, but the woman's spirit can't stop looking around the house in the hopes of finding something to scare her.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a good film with a little bit of a bad scene between Burt Lancaster and an old, grumpy man named Bill Gaff (Frank Sinatra), who gets involved in a gunfight between two bikers (the same ones who are mentioned at the beginning) and then decides to follow them. They're going to a beach party at a yacht club, and of course the gunfight will happen.  The whole film is a little boring, but then again it's the 1970s.  - July 12, 2007A good, long-winded, boring, violent film
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It seems like the producers, for a change, got it right.   What the film lacks in depth or intelligence, it makes up for in a truly bizarre story involving a talking horse and a family of "freaks" with the help of a bizarre, almost unbelievable plot and a surprisingly touching performance from the leading lady.  In spite of its absurd premise, and ridiculous plot, it's quite possible that this film could have been an even better movie than it's predecessor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The biggest problem with this movie is the fact that the main character of the movie, which is a boy who is very much like an elf, is totally out of the loop. His mom, who is supposed to be his best friend, who, according to his dad, is the most beautiful woman in the world, he doesn't even know how she got there, because she hasn't been seen since they were kids. And to top it off, he is totally in love with the pretty lady who is totally his age, and who is not even his real best friend.  In my opinion, the movie was pretty good. There were moments when I could see where the director really had his finger on the pulse of the times. It's pretty clear to me that the filmmakers were influenced in their direction by the 1960s New Hollywood, which would have a strong influence on films like "The Exorcist", "The Last House on the Left", "An American Werewolf in London", etc. I suppose it's not surprising, since the same movie has been in production at the same time that Stanley Kubrick and his "The Shining" team were still working as a film crew. There is another reason why the movie is quite good. It has a strong sense of humor, which makes it entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an okay movie. As far as bad movies go, this is a decent one. It tries to do a little of everything and fails at most of it. However, I can respect a director that has no qualms with taking a classic property and making a generic movie about it. I mean, the only thing that was really fresh about this film was the voice work... I mean this movie made me wanna go to the "Movies" section at Wal-Mart every Monday. I know, I know. I've heard it all before. I can't stand the same old lame movies. But I have to say that I did not have a problem with this movie. It had its moments of originality... I won't say a lot about that, but it was there. The story is predictable, but I did enjoy the silly dialogue. The "movie" is a lot of fun. But, that's about all I have. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen in my life.   And even though it seems like a very serious movie, it's a complete joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did a bad job trying to tell the story of the movie The Mule. It does have some redeeming factors. The lead actress, Meryl Streep, and the other actors who were in the movie were all nice people who got into acting after being in movies and making a living by doing it for the fun of it. I also liked the cast which I didn't know well and I found myself laughing a lot and I liked the script. However, it just didn't work on a level that kept me entertained. I'll see a few other Mule movies when they come out on VHS. I can see the appeal for a lot of people.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film has a pretty interesting story about a girl from a poor family, who has just lost her father in a road accident. She is so upset and traumatized that she begins to do whatever she pleases in the hope that it will get her through her problems.   Although I don't usually like the style of the movie, this is actually very good. The movie looks gorgeous, especially the landscapes. And the songs are great as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't care if it's bad or not. I love this movie! It's the only movie where I got a little emotional during it. I like the fact that the people who work on this movie didn't take themselves too seriously. This movie was created as a joke that will end with them being the new "Dewey Defeats Truman."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know who put this on, but I must be a bad person because I didn't even like the ending. The guy just runs out of the room and it ends on a cliffhanger with him getting shot. There was a lot of running around, and a lot a yelling... it was very lame. I'd like to read about an actual movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am disappointed. If you are a fan of sci fi you know it as a genre that is not supposed to be very realistic. However this movie did not leave me disappointed as in fact it is not as bad as I remember it. It looks good, has lots of action, some sci fi with aliens and a bad guy and it is all in 3 hours. I do not think it was a waste of time. It does not have the bad effects that other sci fi films have but it looks a little better and more realistic.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love the music, I love the concept, I even adore the character that is played by the same actor from the 90's. But this movie has NO talent!   If this is how a "novel" should be, then "The Last Stand" can easily be classified as a "slap in the face" to the old fashioned novel writing. It's an extremely low budgeted movie. It had NO budget and there are only so many sets that could be made. You could be a little more creative with the actors in this movie... like having them do a walk in, then walk out. Or do a scene from the "Rambo" movies, then have the actors turn around and do it from the other direction.   There are only a handful of "action" scenes in this whole movie. Some were laughable, some were ridiculous. The actors that are in this film are nothing but role models. It is so bad that it would be more fun to pretend like it was a TV movie than to watch this movie. You will be in shock... and maybe even a little ashamed. It makes me question why I bothered even reading the novel in the first place.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not bad at all. This is a fun movie to watch.   There is some nice dialogue, but it's not great or funny. It's a good film to watch in the evening, but not that great, but still fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm no big fan of John Woo movies (the Hong Kong trilogy with Jackie Chan are not great), but this one does not disappoint!  I had no expectations, so to say I was surprised is an understatement.  From what I have seen of the previous 3 movies it seems John Woo has returned to form.  A lot more intense than the previous movies and the action is very tight!  The acting was pretty good in this movie, so hopefully John Woo does better in future, it's fun to see Jackie Chan again, and I thought that the girl I thought was a ghost in the previous movie was actually a ghost.  There are some cool set pieces that will stick in your head (the ghost chase at the end).  I did find the ending a bit predictable though, especially considering the other films.  It's still fun though, and would make a great movie night watching! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I heard "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" as a kid when I lived in New Orleans. I loved that movie and I loved it a little more and a little longer every time I watched it, even when I got too old. I never got to see it again until it was on DVD a few years ago and I just couldn't get my hands on it. I couldn't make it through the movie, I couldn, however, get the idea of a bunch of cowboys killing a bad guy to stay in the back of my head as I wandered the streets of New Orleans the night before Halloween. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't like the way the movie was shot. Some shots were too bad. Some sequences were poorly done. And most of it was boring! The special effects could have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A great movie.  It's not a good movie.  That's not to say it's bad.  We've seen it a lot, it gets a lot of praise, and if you like to see people get shot at a baseball game.  It's a good popcorn movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I've not seen this movie, nor seen the sequel (The Lost Kingdom, which I'd seen before, and it was pretty bad).   I don't know if you've seen the original, but the Lost Kingdom was about a group of dwarves who live on a mountain that's getting steadily higher and higher up (from an early age, one of the dwarves has to go and find an artifact that'll get them to the top of the mountain), and one day as the dwarves are sitting around eating, they decide to try and climb it, and so they find the way up there is a little more tricky than they thought, as the climb up to the highest point of the mountains is a long, gradual, slippery climb, so the dwarf who has been leading the charge (I think it's called "Frodo") gets to the pinnacle and says "We're up there! We're up... there!" to which the rest of the dwarfs exclaim "Yes, we are up there", and then... boom! They fall to their deaths! It's a pretty crappy little movie.   In the original movie, the dwarves try to save them by climbing to the mountain's peak and saying "We have to go now", so they can see what they can do, but then the mountaineer stops them before they can say it to save his own life. This sequel doesn't have anything to do with that, nor does it have any kind of happy ending. In the first movie, Frodo said that they were so high, they were beyond the stars and he told them "the end of days is at hand, and only one may walk across its threshold" (I have an annoying tendency to forget that the mountains that were shown in the first film were supposed to be in the sky, not just flat land). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be completely honest, the movie is a total mess.  It's not that it's bad, it just has no redeeming qualities.  I guess a lot of people love the movie.  So why don't they just sit down and watch a better movie?  But, they don't.  They don't even go to the theater.  This is just yet another crappy horror movie. I don't see anything funny about it.  The acting is not funny.  There's nothing funny to say.  If it wasn't so bad it'd be funny.   There are some moments in it I do like, like when the camera zooms in on the dog's face and the dog makes an odd laugh.  But when we're not laughing the movie has no humor whatsoever.   This one is not even funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The most boring and repetitive movie of all time. The only reason to see this movie is to have a good laugh. It should be retired as soon as possible.  Review by John K.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen more than my share of bad movies over the years. This movie was pretty bad. It looked okay to my eyes, but the sound was bad. And the acting was horrendous. They made it look like a bad horror film, so I guess that's what they wanted to do. But I never thought I'd see a movie with a big, burly, old man and a hot, young gal that could barely stay together. A hot, attractive young guy and an old, burrred, hot, burro. It's hard to imagine an actress better than Marlene Dietrich as Marilyn Monroe. She has to be in a movie that is this bad. The one bad part was the ending. In real life, Marilyn Monroe didn't commit suicide. And it was not the Monroe's death that drove the murderer. But it was his desire to have his hands on her body that made him want to get rid of the body. I'm surprised they weren't able to get that part right. The actor that played the husband was a good actor, but it was one that I don't remember seeing before.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the saddest movies I have ever seen. I was going to watch it after watching the documentary film about it,and then I saw the trailer  and thought... "that is not a movie I want to watch"   This movie is a blatant attempt to get some attention... it is not even a great movie, it was made by someone who was not really sure how to direct a movie. The main actors in this movie are totally uninteresting and they are playing parts that are not even the same thing.   If you have never seen this movie, just do NOT get caught up with the bad acting and poor acting in this film. This movie has nothing going for it. It is just a stupid and stupid movie that you will not enjoy at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending was rushed, but they managed to make it so. I enjoyed most of the movie, but the last ten minutes were a mess. This is supposed to be a documentary that takes you through the lives of five women who have been murdered while traveling to Florida from their home in Chicago. The movie focuses on the case at first, and as it progresses we learn a lot about them and also their murders. I found the movie interesting but definitely not as good as the original story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an old movie. It is a remake of "Swan Lake" with a few changes made. It tells the same story of a woman who goes on a road trip with a very sad, widowed father (Frank Langella) to find their son. The man is in an insane asylum. The mother wants to get the girl to a mental hospital because her mother is sick. The movie has a good plot. The film is not bad, it has a few funny scenes, but its not a classic.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For those who are not familiar with the story: it is about an ex-convict who is looking for a job. He meets a man who seems to have made a fortune (the man makes sure to hide his money by giving him a "gift") and he finds himself on a cross path that can only end badly. It ends badly and this is not an exaggeration. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say this: I don't know if I've ever seen a movie that was even close to as bad as the last 10 minutes of this movie. It wasn't bad for being a bad film, it was just bad for trying to be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is full of shit! This is why people don't like to watch movies. Just like the rest of the movies on this site... this movie sucks! First off, we have our main male star (Kevin Bacon) trying to get some girl to sleep with him. He's always getting rejected. Every time he wants to hook up with some random girl, it's no good. Then we have the other guy (Jon Voight) who can't seem to catch a break either. At one point, he has even to have a woman make him a hot coffee to make him talk to her. That would be great if it was hot! And, let's not forget the director (David Cronenberg) who makes these pathetic movies even more pathetic. At least Cronenberg tries to make them feel like they are being made for an 8 year old's movie night. This movie seems more like an 8th grade project. We have a girl, a loser, and a loser's boyfriend who seem to be a real family. This is the way these kids act. This was like a bad Saturday morning cartoon. The story was stupid, the story line is stupid, and the characters are stupid. It is so bad that it makes me want to see a bad comic strip! There's a girl who says she wants to be famous. That's about it. We get a guy who wants to get a girl. Oh! and he gets a hot chick who makes the guy laugh. And that's about the rest. We also see a bunch of other characters, some are cute, some aren't. There's some jokes... and then we get the ending. And guess what happens? The girl gets a guy. In a movie full of clichés.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film of almost no substance or meaning.    Director:  Frank M. Bower.  A couple of months ago this was in my opinion the absolute worst movie I ever saw.  It was so bad in fact it probably took the entire local cinema to get through it.  Now, I'm a fan of Frank M Bower films so I don't mean to sound ungrateful.  I saw the film quite by accident a couple of years ago and it was the first film in quite a while that I didn't just walk out of feeling like a fool.  It's a bit like the movie "Bunny" in that you don't really feel like a victim at all.  The plot is stupid and the ending, well, not so much.  For a film as bad as it is it is rather remarkable how a good film like this managed to get made.  When you read about it it sounds like it has been lost in the mists of time and then one day on Youtube and a copy goes viral... well no, that's not the case at all...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was skeptical that it would be as bad as it is, after reading the title (I know nothing about anything: from literature to history to pop), and I was right. It is worse than a trashy film from the 80s about a group of young hippies that were so out of touch with reality they were not even able to do their hair. The acting is so bad that when you hear the lines, you can see a little kid in the front row laughing his ass off. The characters are as bad (and the film is not good) as the story, which was based on a popular novel written in the 1930's. The story was so stupid and so predictable that I could not believe that an author could write this stuff.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I've ever seen, from the bad dialog to the "spaghetti" music (and not in a good way). A guy goes to visit his grandfather in Sicily and has a weird dream. Then it goes to a cave where he is possessed by demons. Then he is forced to marry a woman who is pregnant by one of the demons! I found this movie interesting from the beginning to the end. It was boring, it was uneventful and most of all the acting was bad. This was the worst horror movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen some good zombie movies before. This is one of the worst zombie movies out there. What happened is that this movie tried to make it as if they were using a new technique of making it look like zombies were walking through the trees but they weren't. The zombies were still the same zombies but were put in a much worse setting in which they were all hiding like scared rabbits. What a shame that I can't find any good zombie films in which zombies don't act like they're trapped in a cage.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was all set up in that annoying "Who is the prettiest girl?" game (I'm not a snob either, but I love pretty girls!) and I just couldn't get into it. In fact, I'm not even sure why I watched it. I got home late in the evening and there was this trailer for a movie called "Sex on the Beach" on cable. I was wondering if this was that movie.  After watching that, I had a hunch that this was not to be my weekend activity. I'm sorry but I'm tired of all the movies like "Sex, Lies, and Videotape," "Sliding Doors," "Love in the Time of Cholera," "Carnal Knowledge" or "Somewhere in Time."   The film does a poor job of convincing us that there is any substance to this supposed movie. While the sex scenes are well-shot (but not so well done I will admit) they are not all that hot. Also, the writing is just too cheesy and cheesy at that.  I have to wonder what kind of movie this is!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a real piece of crap. The main character doesn't seem to be very clever at all and seems to have been put in a school where there is no thought and the class is made up of idiots. I don't want to be mean but I don`t see how any intelligent person could take this film seriously.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that I have seen this film about ten times, each time being a little better than the last. I usually don't find myself impressed with films about people who are not that interesting (a case can easily be made for that), but this movie had a great story: the family (or the extended family, they were all really nice) lived in a house that was being converted into a restaurant; the father was a great cook, but the mother wasn't. And, while the children were being spoiled rotten, the mother was spending her time on a cruise ship. There was a small cast of character actors, all really good. And one guy was a really interesting guy. The plot was pretty good: it seemed that the mother had some sort of nervous condition; it had never really been explained. What seemed to have happened was that she had an accident, which resulted in her losing a lot of her hair. When she found out that she was losing a full head of hair, she panicked and took herself off on a lifeboat (there was an actual lifeboat, as opposed to just a few pieces of wood). And all of the passengers on the boat had to get on a small ship because a hurricane was about to wipe the place out. She ended up on this ship; it was an old boat. The only reason that the other passengers were so surprised was that the woman that they were going to take over from her was the wife of one of their old fisherman friends; she was an odd woman (a rather plain looking woman with glasses) and would always look like she was a man in a wig. But the woman (or woman-woman, as she called herself) kept on insisting that she would never go back home again; and her husband told her that he was going to try to get her off on the cruise. So she decided to go with him and get a haircut. The problem was that when she had gotten her hair cut, the hair had gone very straight. The whole thing was bizarre. She couldn't walk; she couldn't tie her shoes; she would often fall over and the only people that would keep her from falling over were the fish. It made me sad; this was a woman that had lived for a long time and could still manage to have a good time with her husband and the children. Well, eventually, it turned out that the husband wasn't going to be coming home and the whole family decided to pack up and get out
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the first movie I have seen from this director/writer. It is about a poor young lady who is married to an old man who gets drunk and tells her she can buy whatever she wants. At first she gets jealous but it quickly goes away. She then takes advantage of the fact that the old man can drive her around, and eventually takes advantage too because this isn't the first time he has driven her around. But, she starts to like him too much for the first few times and she starts getting all crazy and angry and stuff. At that point I was not much interested in the story because it is a little slow, but then it jumps ahead, and then the story is all a little too much and the jump ahead makes it a little stupid. The only thing that is pretty good about it is the ending, and even that is only because it seems to be really out there.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't realize until now that this was an American film, not a British one. I thought it was made by The Wicker Man producer Richard Lester. It has such a dreadful soundtrack that it is almost like it was recorded off-screen. The dialogue is all corny, it's like talking to a man who had a great deal of fun at the World's Fair. It is like listening to an alcoholic's drunken ramblings, or a person with dementia. This is a very, very bad movie, even worse than the one that played at the end of the old British television series. If you do decide to see it, make sure you bring a good pair of earphones.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For years I had been hearing about this movie. Now it's finally here. Yes. If you like movies about a bunch of high school seniors going to college, then you're going to like this movie! One of the most beautiful and powerful movies ever made, The Graduate is really one of the masterpieces of American art cinema. The Graduate, directed by Mike Nichols, is certainly one of my most favorite movies of all time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're a fan of the "Batman: The Animated Series," this is definitely not the film you were looking for. For this film, it seems like someone took a "Batman"-esque movie and called it "B-O-N-O".  The movie, made by Tim Burton, is a poor man's version of Batman. Sure the villains are fun and the fight scenes are great. However, it takes all the things that we love about the "Bats" and replaces them with an assortment of characters that are only good for laughs. It's like it took a few pages out of a "Daredevil" comic and gave them to Burton with the intent of making a "Wacko" film.  There is nothing to like in this movie and no reason to waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hilarious!  So much great comedic writing and it is really well done.  The acting is so great too.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen a few bad movies, some bad adaptations of the "Little Rascals" comic book series and other forgettable movies. I also have seen some mediocre movies such as: The Wild Bunch, RocknRolla, The Fugitive, A River Runs Through It, The Little Rascallers, The Rockford Files, The Mighty Joe Young, The Big Heat, The Man Who Couldn't Stop, The Muppets Take Manhattan, Little Richard's The Real Thing, The Blues Brothers, Rock-A-Bye Baby and other such "good" movies with "bad" people doing "bad things".   These movies are not bad, and if you are a fan of the comic books, they are not great but there are not many classics.  The characters are well played by the actors who are playing the minor roles.   This movie is not made in such a way that it will keep your attention.  This film is more of a comedy than a drama and I do not remember how many times the characters repeat the same lines. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After hearing a rumor that a couple of "bad" movies were about to come out at Disney Studios, I decided I didn't need to go to work. I went into the lobby to have a seat. This movie was pretty much on my to-watch list ever since Disney bought it. I was hoping for a good animated Disney adaptation of a famous novel. I got a pretty good one. Unfortunately the story had a lot of bad elements that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. The characters were annoying and there were too many jokes that were far too childish. There was some good, though. One of my favorite characters is the talking frog, Mr. Squeak. A little over-the-top. Not nearly as funny as the cartoon version of the character in "Cinderella." I liked what they did with his character though. There are many, many scenes in this movie that will leave you in tears.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a bit sadistic and perverse with some strong sexual undertones. The story takes place in a hospital and we see several patients who commit suicide by jumping in a vat of acid. One of them is played by a creepy Michael Shannon who seems like a typical "good boy" type. The other patient is played with great sex appeal by Marilyn Monroe, who's role is to become an insane nun for some reason. The main problem with this movie is that it has no sense of humor, or even a plot. The movie is so bad that most of the actors don't know what they are doing. It's just a collection of scenes. I was surprised that this was given a R rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a complete disaster from start to finish. The first twenty minutes is not worth watching at all. The two female lead's are almost totally useless. The script is not funny at all but you can't blame the actors who try to fit into the roles. It is quite obvious why people like to put these sorts of movies on. It has been done so much before that it is a waste of time. I gave it a 0.5 star because of the bad writing and the complete lack of any actual character development.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, this film is really ugly.  There are some pretty people in it, but they are not in good enough movies to get anywhere near any good movie.  The plot isn't very good either.   It is like a bad joke with a bad twist.  It has bad jokes all over it.  There is a little bit of humor,  but nothing to make anyone laugh.  The bad guy (I guess he is evil) is so bad looking, that he is funny to me.  I just wish this was as bad as the previous films in this series!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was the last time I would ever sit through such a horrendous movie. I am not surprised. It is so poorly directed and constructed, its one of the worst movies of my life (I am watching it again while I type this!). If there are any decent movie makers out there, please, give this movie a pass.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know about all of us, but it was a very bad movie. I mean it's hard to imagine that a movie would ever make a good movie in the first place. When I saw the title I just about fell out of my seat. So yeah, if you're looking for a good action movie, and a good time, look away now.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is horrible. It is the worst movie I've ever seen, with nothing new and nothing exciting. The plot is ridiculous, and the movie itself is so bad that people will probably find it funny. I wish I were kidding. The characters are really stupid, and a big joke is made when one of the heroes of this movie is killed by another superhero that is more like a clown (not a superhero). There's also a bunch of ridiculous jokes, the best of which is the one where a doctor with no powers gets supercharged into being a super hero and fights a buncha bad guys who are all totally naked... I swear they are actually naked. If they're not naked then this movie doesn't belong in the same category as the Superman movies...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a fan of films with strong and original storylines. That is what this film is all about. You won't be able to find a more boring film. The bad acting and bad directing make this film an extremely dull and uninteresting movie. I really don't like this movie, but I will watch it again and again to find out what kind of person it is for me to like this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this was going to be a good flick, as it was one of the first films that I came across that had been made in black and white and I always love watching films made by the silent era of filmmaking, and this was no exception.   The film features very good performances, all the main characters have some charm to them, but I felt this film was just one too many movies, they all had their own unique charm that just added to the film.  You've come to the right place!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this a while ago. I thought it was a pretty fun movie. The story is pretty good. In the beginning, the main characters were just the usual people in a typical town. Then the town is overrun by strange creatures. The creatures are the main heroes of the story. They have a whole world full of monsters. There is a whole book full of creatures, they are so colorful. And they are a real delight to watch. The thing I think that really sets this apart is the music. It is just such an original score. It really grabs you by the collar and doesn't let go. There are many different versions. I'm not even sure what they are. Maybe this: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did like this movie. The special effects were not the strongest, the music was terrible, and the acting was very cheesy (as cheesy as they come). But that did not bother me too much. The bad acting in this movie is very reminiscent of a very cheap television movie. I wish they used actual actors instead of cheap plastic actors. I would have appreciated it much better if they actually had some real personalities in the characters. I also thought that the idea of how the world worked was strange. For example, in an alien civilization, we are all members of some kind of government. Why does our government work? Who decides this? Why do we have such a "democratic" government at all? I also found it weird that the aliens seemed to have no concept of democracy. I think the government on the other hand is elected by the people. At times I think that the movie was more about the alien beings than the humans. The alien creatures were much more intelligent, yet they looked like they were trying to be friendly. I am sure that it was all in an attempt to make the human characters look like morons, which they did in the movies that they made. The ending, which had the aliens attacking and killing all of us, did seem a little contrived and it is a shame that they did not have the courage to end the movie on a better note. It is a very silly movie, but it is not bad at all. It was not really an alien film, but rather an old style monster movie. If you are looking for an old fashioned monster movie, then this is not it. Overall, I would recommend this movie to people who like the old monster movies, with no real science or technology involved, in the style of the "Saw" movies, where they basically just throw on a good monster movie and call it a day. But that is not a bad thing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say, that for those of you who read my reviews (and there are quite a few, a lot of them are just short blurbs) the "The Shining" is my favorite Stephen King story. It is the reason why I watch movies (not because I'm a movie fanatic like some people say, because the horror films I've seen so far are not even all that scary - I've even seen the one with the vampire that sucked all the blood out of his victims.) I can really feel the desperation and desperation of the main character, Jack Torrance, in this story. Jack is one of those characters where one can identify exactly what's wrong with him even before it happens. Jack's a pretty bad guy and is always trying to get out of situations, but in the end he seems to always find himself. I never think of it as a bad story as the ending was really good (I mean, it didn't have to be that dramatic, what could've been the story of a man who just wants to get a fresh start again?). The best aspect of this story is the "scare tactics" (which of course were a perfect fit to the "Jack" character), like how he uses the light switch of a house, like how the wife was the one who left the light on, so you know something terrible is going to happen, how he is scared by a creepy doll that he is watching on TV, how a couple of young children are standing outside the bedroom of a couple sleeping in a bed and how the father turns to him with a knife... The story of "The Overlook" (as I called it) has a lot in common with "The Stand", which was also made by King. In both "Jack Torrance" and "Overlook" there is a mysterious old mansion that has been taken over by a serial killer. I haven't read King's books like "Dracula" and others that I think are really good, but "The Dark Tower" is the one that I feel King has spent his most time on. This story is about a boy and a girl who are friends of the old lady in the house, but they are also scared of her and they want to get away from the house. The girl is scared of the house because of the darkness, the dark, the silence and the screams. She also thinks of the baby that is in a dark room next to the house and she wants to help
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen The Big Chill, a remake of the 1968 John Carradine movie, four times. I do not remember a single good thing about the movie. Even when you see a great John Carraodine movie such as this, you have to watch it with great care. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is terrible, the costumes and scenery are out of this world, the music is crap, and John Carrasco plays a bad cowboy. The best part of the movie was the ending. I can't describe the ending in detail because I have lost it forever. There were people who were dying who were looking down at John Carray, his mouth opened, he shot two gunshots into the sky and then he looked up and said, "Now everyone come here." Well, if there really is life after death, if we do not have to die, why not let us live the rest of our lives together. Well, at least John Carralten did, that is why he is in the movie at all. A few people in this movie were real good, and others were horrible, but I will not be watching this movie ever again. If you do not mind, then you may use this review to get people to watch this movie. I watched this movie with my little three year old daughter and she was more entertained by the stupidest movie she had ever seen. I found this film to be absolutely worthless, and I can not recommend it to any other persons.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you can't get a little thrill out of watching a zombie kill some poor souls with a stick, you're not living life as a zombie. Even though the movie has nothing to do with zombies it definitely gives you the shivers, and you may need a chill pill after watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad I was so bored. The whole thing was just a load of nonsense. It was just boring. There was no story. There were no characters. No tension. No conflict. There just was a stupid movie. I have never gotten so bored in a movie. It really sucked!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In all honesty I never would have predicted this film would go anywhere. This was the story of a little girl who goes to a strange town where the people are kind of creepy. She falls in love with a weird character called the Scarecrow who looks a lot like a black man. I am not sure if this man is a good person or bad.     I wish I could remember where we were when this movie was released.  I wish I knew more about it because this film is so weird. This is one of those movies you would rather watch once than twice. The story is a lot of fun and the cast is a bunch of weirdos. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was awful, a bad script, bad actors, lousy characters, and a bad plot. It is so bad that I think the people who wrote it got sick of it and left it alone for a year to see if they could make a better one. I had no problems with the acting, the plot is really bad, and the acting is terrible. I mean, really, really bad. All the good movies are about good people with the occasional bad guy. This movie made me hate these people, and hate their movies. This is a film where a woman is a victim of rape and a man is not. In the end she tells her friend that it was a good bad film and that the characters should be more like the people they were portraying. It was bad. I am not going to lie, when I saw this movie I laughed and cheered. I laughed because I know what bad movies are like; bad characters, awful acting, and bad stories. When I saw that I was disappointed. I wanted to know who the bad guys were so I could laugh at their stupidity. I didn't laugh; I was bored out of my mind. I never laughed at anything I ever saw. I was so angry at the stupid people. I hope that a film that bad doesn't get made for a long time because I will hate it and I will never see it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, there's a reason I gave it a zero star.   If the "story" was real, the entire movie would be awful, with poor writing and acting.  Instead, it just comes across as a bad horror/sputnik movie, with a cheesy plot line.  It's not bad in and of itself, but you would think the producers would have done a better job at the actual movie, because there really is not much to talk about in regards to acting.   Even though the movie isn't bad, it's so bad that it's hard to be impressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this as a child and grew up on it. It is a fun movie, but at the same time, it just doesn't hold my interest. It's fun to watch, but you won't find much to laugh about. It wasn't funny, which I find strange when watching a comedy. There was also a couple of times where I thought the movie was going one way, but then stopped at a dead end or something and had to wait an entire scene to realize it was not going to change. It also goes back in time with characters from the future and it just felt like you were watching a reenactment that the people in the future weren't allowed to participate in in the 50s. If I were a young guy and wanted to see an old time movie, I would watch something like the old westerns with a little comedy, and maybe even a little romance added in at times. I have a feeling I would enjoy the comedy in this movie even more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad film.   I've seen this movie twice and I'm never seeing it again.  It doesn't work as a horror movie.  The story line is boring.  There is no gore, it's just a slow burning horror movie with no real thrills.  Not funny, not memorable.  So what's the point.  This was made at a cheap, run of the mill budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really didn't know what to expect when I watched this movie.  The opening song "What Can I Do" is sung by Jennifer Hudson so my expectations were probably pretty low going in.  It's a comedy? I didn't see a comedy.  I'm surprised how well this worked since it's an incredibly silly movie. It takes a few tries before things even start to make sense.  What we find out is that two different people are trying to be an Elvis impersonator, but they don't have an Elvis and they don can't get a date.  They're getting help from an Elvis lookalike to get a girl to like them.  Even the most basic movie logic doesn't help us.  There's one of the girls dressed up as Elvis.  She asks him out.  He tells her the truth and she ends up rejecting him.  Now it's our guy, a guy who looks like Elvis, who is dressed up like Elvis. He asks the girl out, but she rejects him, so now Elvis is left at the altar.  Who is the Elvis impersonating here?  A lady?  I didn´t see a lady.  In the end he ends up having to make Elvis look like one of them two guys, so that he can be the best Elvis impersonators in town.   The main characters aren't even funny.  Most of it is just stupid acting.  First there's one character who just goes on and on about why he can't have a girlfriend and then there's the other who goes on about how much fun she has every night.  Then there's their Elvis impersonation guy who just stands there with a fake smile looking at nothing.  And there's a guy that just sits there looking like he's about to collapse and never gets anywhere.  Is this movie any good?  In my book it's a waste of time.  Sure there are some good bits, like the guys talking about getting girls for their Elvis look.  But most of the movie is just a bunch of people sitting around talking and goofing around.  One of the funniest parts of the whole thing is when the guy who's Elvis impersonate just has to walk to the other person and then the other guy has to pull out a chair for him and he can walk around all day long.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To save time and space in case I get a chance to write a positive review of this film again. I was watching it with a group of people last night. We were all in agreement that the movie had little to offer and had the typical film "filler". I can easily see why people who think that this movie is great are excited, because the first half of the movie is excellent. The movie is set in 1920's Japan, about a Japanese prince who goes on a quest to find his father and who comes across a samurai that is trying to defeat a demon that is taking over a small village and is getting close to killing the village women. The prince, along with a samurai, find a mysterious girl and help her to get to safety. The princess then decides to leave the village and goes off on her own. The samurai then tells the prince, and the prince goes with the samurai. Once there, he is met with a strange woman that looks like a ninja from the movies. I don't remember this particular girl in any of the movies, but I like the movie and find it entertaining. This movie is actually very well produced with good effects. I think that when it comes to movies of this type, the best movies aren't really the ones with great acting or good special effects. They are the ones that have great writing and great acting. This is a great movie that you won't be disappointed in. - December 20, 2014Great Movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a dumb movie.  It seemed like a fun comedy/drama/action movie but it was all just stupid fun.  And I thought it was one of the more good comedy films.  They made the movie out to be very fun but it really wasn't.  I was expecting a movie with a great cast.  It wasn't even really that great.  The acting was pretty good, the comedy was pretty funny and the plot was interesting.   But it just felt like a bunch of friends going on a crazy adventure and a lot of them got hurt (even if the guy getting knocked out in the movie is never mentioned again) but no one gets hurt.  This is a dumb comedy.  I'm gonna say this, if you like action/comedy/dungeon diving movies then you will like this one.  But I have to say, I'm not sure I will be seeing this again.  If I had the chance to see it again I probably would. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie years ago, but I have never forgotten what the movie is about. It is a story that has a lot of heart and is a sad one. I don't want to spoil the movie (which you have to watch), but I just wanted to say that it is a great movie. It shows how things can change, even after the death of a loved one. You have to remember, that the movie was made when there was a terrible economic crisis that hit the country. People had to be fed, that was the only thing left, and there was no hope that anything would be done about it. There was no help from the government either. The people lived a very hard life and even if they did not get enough to eat, that did not stop them from working hard and trying to make ends meet. And then they heard about the death in a hospital. It's one thing to lose one family member, but it is quite another to lose all of them in the same day. And yet, here they are, talking about each other all day, laughing and enjoying the life they lead. It has this wonderful feel about it and I really feel that it was a real work of love and that people were actually in the moment. The movie has a nice soundtrack and the whole time the characters are smiling and enjoying themselves. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It does not have a happy ending, but that was something the writers of this movie had to deal with.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What's there to hate about The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension? Well, there's basically no movie. The film is simply a bunch of different people who all get together and have an adventure, in a different universe. Some are very strange (i.e. a female dog with a gun), but most are very silly (the "I'm a clown" guy), and all of them look exactly like those characters I grew up with, except the hair color. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was supposed to be fun. It had all the elements of a silly family comedy: the son, the mother, the father and the old man. I can't figure out why everyone keeps complaining about how silly this movie is. There is not much in it. It is all about the characters: their names, their lives, their hopes, their dreams, their bad habits. The family is a small, poor, mostly uneducated family and you can see why it is so miserable and has so little chance of success. The son is a fool and the family is broken up: the dad (I mean, father, not dad the man of the house) is crazy (although I love how the kids think of him as their Dad or Uncle). The mother thinks she is more than a mother, she has a big brain and tries to help the children, but she is useless and useless she is. She is also the one who gets the worst job as a housekeeper and has no skills to make much money. As I said before, her sons, the oldest is called 'The Smart Guy', a'smart guy' means "smart, well-mannered, well mannered, neat, polite, and obedient". The youngest boy, called 'Tiger', is more like a baby and is never seen in the movie. The old man is an old man (or should I say, an old person?) who has been in a nursing home for a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In spite of the fact that there isn't much to this movie, it is a real delight from start to finish.   The plot is simple and easy to follow.  The characters are all well cast, and very likable.  But, the film is really not at all funny.  There is one scene in particular that is absolutely priceless.  I don't even have to say anything about the ending, I think anyone watching the film can guess what it is supposed to be about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This isn't the most interesting movie, which is a bit surprising to me, given the fact that it's based on a popular series of books. It's a decent idea, but as a whole it fails to deliver a memorable performance by any of the leads. And even the book's author doesn't deliver the same kind of performance that I had hoped to. There is one moment, which was very nice, in which the character of The Red King is introduced. Although I had seen the film, I had no idea who The RedKing was, or what happened to him, or where he came from. It was a nice little moment, however. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a terrible movie.  There were so many wrong things about it.  We see a mother and her two daughters get married to poor strangers.  The whole wedding was a mockery of the Church's beliefs about marriage and religion.  They got drunk with a group of atheists before the ceremony.  All the while the wife is complaining about how her husband doesn't care about her.  She also made fun of how she didn't need to go to the church because she is a good woman.  It is clear that the people who did the wedding were nothing like the Church they were trying to be.  At the end, there was a horrible fight with a man who had gone to the wedding to try to get in.  He wanted to give the money back but the man refused it.   When it was the woman who had refused the money, she started to attack the man and he was able to pull her away.   I don't know what to think about this movie.   Perhaps there was nothing much wrong with the movie but it really shows how wrong religion can be.   This movie will certainly bring on one to the Church or it should.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was boring, the story was predictable and the acting was horrible, but what did make up for that was the fantastic effects (of which there were several, from the giant robot, to the aliens, to a giant flying whale, etc.). The animation was nice, but it just didn't have the same impact as many other Disney films.  I would recommend this movie to just about anyone, except maybe the kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For the money, this movie is one of the best action movies ever made. I loved the opening scene of Bruce Willis in the movie!    After all these years of movie going and loving, I guess it's time to get out some serious action.   One of the more interesting parts of the movie is the use of the "pistol and the chains".   I'm sure it was a great idea to put a bunch of cops and robbers dressed like they were in a 1930's movie.  As far as guns are concerned, they used a 12 gauge snub nose shotgun with a magazine clip instead of a revolver.  The guns were all made of plastic and had no grip, so if you hit someone with one of these, it would bounce around pretty good.  With all the guns used in this movie, it's no wonder it cost so much.  If you enjoy action, you will love this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie is a fairly boring, yet well-acted romance in a city of bad memories. Our heroine, a naive but good-hearted high-schooler, is set up as a substitute teacher by her boyfriend, played by Brad Pitt, when the boyfriend (played by Brad's real brother) gets injured and can't get back to the city. The movie's director/writer/producer, David Frankel, has done something different by making a romantic comedy in which there is not a single scene that has not been shown in one or two other movies. It is a wonderful, touching movie. It makes fun of its own story line by saying things like, "We were not alone in the city, we were surrounded by people who knew exactly who we were. People we had never met. People who had been through the same thing we were." and "You know why they say in a place like this, with all the money in the world it is not easy to get what you want?" It's a movie about love and friendship, but it has little to do with any of those things. It's about two people trying to make it in the big city that they are forced to try and escape. Pitt, a great actor, is the main attraction but there is hardly any chemistry between him and Jennifer Aniston. She plays the role to perfection. The best part of the film is the way it never gets bogged down by its own plot. It knows exactly who it is and where it is going, but always manages to surprise and delight. It has an ending that makes me tear up because I feel like it really did feel like that for me, even before the credits rolled.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie a long time ago, and really liked it. I remember when I saw it for the first time in my late teens. I loved the style, the humor, the attitude. I was not a big fan of this movie as a kid. However, as I got older and grew up, it got better and better. It got even better when they brought in the young Steve Martin, who is hilarious. This movie was so good back then that they actually made a sequel. The movie is also very violent. It is a movie that should be watched by anyone who liked the first.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was hoping this was going to be good! I thought it might have a better ending than a lot of the other horror movies I've seen.   Well, it wasn't:  (1) The bad guys are called "The Children of Chaos", or "the Child's play" (I don't know if "The Curse" was actually a play or a movie). They're the result of a scientific experiment:  A small army is put together in a small apartment. They must be given a weapon to kill and a place to kill other people.  The "children" can be killed with a single gunshot to the head.  (2) The first scene is of the "child's play".  The child's play is a room of a flat.  There are four people:  One man, dressed in a black and yellow striped suit. He walks around with a gun.  He's called The Professor, and I believe he's a scientist.  A young woman, who must be one of his students.  She's dressed in blue and pink, and wears her hair in a pigtail.  Then there's a young man in a white suit.  This young man can't speak at all, so we don't learn a whole lot about him.  His name is The Guard, and he's also dressed in white.  These four men are the only ones we see until the end of the movie.   In the movie, The Professor says:  "We have completed the final test and have eliminated all the child's games from the world. Our work is completed. We have shown there are no more child's plays." (This is a very strange statement. Children's games are usually played for entertainment purposes by little kids. But in this movie, the professor apparently thinks that there aren't any, and that they have all been eliminated. I'm not sure how he justifies this bizarre statement.)   The bad guy(s) in this one are The Guard and a child.  It was very bad. The story was lame and predictable.  Some people may say:  The professor didn't mean it literally!  But I think that's a stretch.  Also, he didn't mention The Curse in the end.    This is what I thought: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is great, but the plot is a mess. It starts out with an ordinary guy who is at the top of his game but a sudden job transfer, coupled with the mysterious disappearance of his son, turns his world upside down. Soon he begins his journey to understand the strange events that have befallen his life. And it's one wild ride!    This isn't a movie for everyone, the only things you need to see are the opening credits and some of the background music.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie. This movie is about a father and his wife (Lori Kaye), in a time when they were living in a small house at the top of a mountain. The house was a little shabby, but it was good enough for them, and it had two beds - the one in the middle. The only room they didn't use was the parlor. The couple was doing their best to raise the two boys (John and Dennis). Then the town burned down in a freak fire. It seemed to everyone that John had left his job so he could come down and do something about it. Well, it was too late to get the boys out - they were both so burned up they would have been almost impossible to dress. When the fire went out, the town came back with even more firemen (well, only the best were used) to try to get it under control. The children were so scared by the thought that firemen could come and get them, that they would be burnt alive, that the couple didn't try to do anything about it - the firemen didn't come anyway. The kids died a terrible death, the mother, of course, in a terrible way - she was dragged from the bed on a stretcher, her head covered with a towel that had been used to hold the boys in the bed. One of the doctors, Dr. A. A., who did such wonderful work in the camp, came up with the idea that they might have some of the kids reinducted into a military unit. He made all the kids up as infantrymen, and they went into a town. As they went in, they made the residents do all the chores and the cooking and cleaning for them. The boys were thrilled at the idea - all they wanted to do was make everyone else happy - so they went out into the town - they started a good-will campaign - they danced the fiddle, sang a song, and did whatever other activities they thought might be a good idea. And when they came back, they were not only unhappy, but they were madder than hell. Everyone they came in contact with had an unpleasant opinion about them - they didn´t even get along with some of their own people. Eventually, the fire-fighters got the town to surrender, but the townspeople kept attacking the kids - and they kept attacking them. One day a fireman was attacked, and was stabbed
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's sad to think that I would need to write such a thing. I was at a movie theatre last Friday. It was a bad film, in that it's not a bad time to be in the entertainment industry: It was all too reminiscent of a good bad times.   I watched this because, I'm told, I am a big movie nerd: I like old movies.  I was watching it the other night with my wife; it's hard to sit through this trash without laughing so hard my head hurts.  If you're a film geek like me, I can safely say I won't be seeing any more of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is bad! I think there should have been two versions of this movie, one with a different ending. The first version was about a small girl who is in her room dreaming about the great love that she has had in her life (the great love she has not been able to have). But the dream ends, and suddenly she finds herself in a strange new world full of strange people. She doesn't know why she is in this new place, but she soon learns that she is not just a simple small girl, but instead a girl who was taken a long long time ago. She was one of the most beautiful people alive in ancient Egypt, who was one-half Egyptian, with blonde hair. Then she was "saved" in the form of a beautiful and young man by the Pharaohs, and it's not long before she is taken with him to his palace. That palace is far from what we expect it to be. For one thing, it's dark inside, but also there's a place in it which is so hot, that it causes her to grow to a rather enormous size. Her parents are worried that she'll grow too fast and will have to be put in a special care home, but the Pharaoh tells them that this is not the case. The girl eventually grows so tall that she can walk on the backs of giant, walking elephants and her parents are amazed at the sight of her. Then the story takes a rather bizarre twist. She's suddenly woken up one day by her father, who has discovered that she's grown to be the size of a normal woman. What happens next is even more bizarre, and the family is forced to deal with the strange reality that they find themselves in. It's not an easy place for a small child to grow up to be very powerful, but it is a far better place than the one that she grew up in. This was a film about a young girl who didn't get her way, who grew up to grow big, and finally find her way back to her small childhood world. It seems as if the filmmakers didn't even try to try. I found it to have an oddly boring plot and a boring movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a disaster. It is just a bunch of stupid teenagers running around town. The plot is ridiculous: "Held hostage by an armed and terrifying cult."  What a plot.   A cult?  What do these people do? "Cult" is one of their slogans. What cult? Some stupid religious group? Do they even have a religion?   Well, the plot is not all bad though: One of the characters is a teenage girl with a very attractive, sexy mom.  She's very pretty but also very dumb: She thinks that all men are ugly and evil.  A cute idea.  Unfortunately, the movie's biggest flaw is that the script is so stupid. The movie's main villain is a young boy who wants to kill everybody, including his friends, who happen to live around them.  And just like in "The Shining," the boys have to be out-witted at every turn by a group of other kids, who seem to be playing dress-up, not real soldiers. The one good part of the movie is that it has a strong, beautiful ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I guess this movie will be one of those "bad movies" from the past 10 years that are going to turn out to be "good" eventually.  In this case, the "good movie" has been around for years already (as far back as the 1970s) and has been re-released (in a different format) numerous times in various countries around the world.    The plot of this movie is about a young woman named Shari, who is given an inheritance of a wealthy family by her deceased father.  The young lady spends some time with her widowed father's family before heading back to the cities to learn about her mother's life.  Once there, the young lady is introduced to her mother, whose mother was a prostitute during the time of her marriage to a man much older than her.  But, despite this harsh life, Shari decides to stay with her mother and to work a job at a brothel.  With the help of her father, Shary, Shri-Tara travels around the country in search of men, in order to make money.  This movie is a good example of a movie that focuses on the lives of various prostitutes in Thailand.  In the past, I had seen an earlier version of this film where the main character's name was Shari.  However, this movie was so bad that I really couldn't relate to anything in it.  If you are a fan of prostitutes in general, and Thai sex in particular, then this movie isn't really your thing.  At the time when this movie came out, it had already been in theaters for at least 4 years (at one point, it was being shown over 3x a day at various Thai theaters) and had probably been shown a total of at least 15 times.  While there were some good parts (like a young, attractive, young girl living in the brothels) there were also terrible parts that are difficult to watch (the young lady's sadistic behavior, the scenes where she takes part in violent, sexual acts, the violence inflicted on the prostitutes in the course of the film, and the terrible ending).  There is a reason for every bad thing in this movie.  I don't want to give away the whole ending, but if you are still looking for the reason for the ending (i.e. if you want to know how the film would end), you can only find it in the

To my delight and amazement, the evil creature (that looks like a cross between a crab and a werewolf) is actually quite well dressed. He's a very scary looking creature and a good one at that. As soon as you see him, you can't help but remember a few creepy stories about the paranormal and the paranormal in general. If only I had a camera.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First off, this movie is NOT what it seems at first:  It is a love story and a thriller!   It's the story of a couple of poor, young people who become involved in a very strange situation.   The film begins with them talking about how they can't seem to find a place where they can get a good meal.  Then a guy shows up who wants to do an "investigation" and gives the young couple a ride.  This all sounds silly:  How can you investigate where there's no food?   What's up with that?  Why do you ask?  But the story gets more absurd and surreal:  The couple, in the meantime, find themselves in a strange place and have to solve a problem that a little kid is having.  The kid has to use his special "magic" to make things happen and it's going to cost the couple thousands of dollars in taxes if it doesn't.  It seems like a bad parody:  They've got to solve this problem to help the kid and then it's time for them to "leave town"!   This movie is like a very bad horror film:  And then there's the chase scene:  This is like any other chase scene you've ever seen:  But it just takes the form of a train:  A train.  And there it is:  What a train!  This train, with all of its weird and horrible features, is a real nightmare:  Every minute it's taking its passengers to a place that they didn't even know existed and there are people everywhere!  So in an effort to escape it, the couple takes the train to a different place:  In a park!  It starts off fine:  There's a beautiful lake and a bunch of people playing in the water.  But soon the couple's "friend" shows up and starts killing everyone:  He's got a gun!  A gun!   Then he goes into the woods and starts to kill everyone:   He's in the woods!  When they run out of bullets they realize that they can escape by running across a little bridge.  They can go anywhere they want to.  Well, not exactly anywhere:  One of the passengers sees someone who's being chased in the shadows:  Someone who is a murderer and a thief!  And who is going to help him?  It turns out to be an
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I was a huge John Carpenter fan as a kid, watching almost all his films in the 80's. I watched his first big budget movie, The Thing, in 1980. It was an absolute hoot and a half. The Thing is a great film. A cool atmosphere, weird and wonderful monsters, an interesting story, a cool ending. It will probably stay with me for a long time. I enjoyed the idea behind it, the way it was filmed and the performances of all of the characters. Even the ending is pretty cool. I also loved the way they kept showing the film on the big screen instead of cutting to a close-up of some horrible monster. I think I got the idea. John Carpenter never made any other film after The Thing and never did it justice. I am sure it would be one of the best of the 80s."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the film several times and even though I love the first film, it is still not very good. The film tells the story of a small town in the south, and this particular town has a peculiar set of people. It's been known for years that at any given point, three or four people will get married and have a baby. The town does not allow children of either gender to go to schools, so that the boys and girls live a very isolated existence. At the beginning of the movie, the town's Mayor, a man by the name of Jim (James Earl Jones) is about to leave town for good. His son is a good player on the school basketball team, and everyone wants to help their little son succeed. He is given a job with the city in the office, and the townspeople are hoping he will bring them a boost in business. When Jim leaves town, his son takes over the job of Mayor. The only way for Jim's son to succeed, of course, is to win the school wrestling match, which is not exactly easy, though he does it. His opponent in the school match is the girl (Sydney Lassiter) who is the best player on her school's basketball team. She is a strong and quick player, and her father is very proud of her. However, the match is soon changed. It is agreed that the match will be held on a basketball court, but the town doesn't have enough money to pay for a basketball hoop, so they build one from a trailer. Unfortunately, the trailer is not large enough for the basketball court to fit all of the players, and so the basketball is put on a truck and driven around the town, until it eventually breaks. When the game is finally played, no one can score, and all of them have lost. The coach of the team, a tall young man by his name of Joe, wins the match. However his team, of whom Jim is the coach, is not good enough to beat the other team, so Joe is forced to dismiss his team. When he goes back to town, Jim's coach (who, to make a long story short, is a giant) says that it would be too much for the town to let his son have a job at the Mayor's office. So when Jim and his wife are leaving town for the first time, they take a ride in the back of the town truck, which has a trailer by

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a lot of awful movies this year, but none of them compare to this one! This is a movie that has to be seen by an adult to understand the horror story it tells, and you really have to see it to believe it! The acting is very amateurish, but the acting is a good indication of what went on here! The story is not very interesting, but at least it has a plot! It's also pretty funny to watch a woman fall in love with a strange creature and then to discover his secret lair and then get captured by him! I would watch this movie over and over again just for that story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The trailer says it all.  It's another "good old fashioned" horror film.    In this one we have the usual suspects like a killer clown, his family and several creepy children.  And then there's the killer's son, who is in the middle of his own horror story when he goes back home.  I have to admit, I didn't know how bad this movie was until I watched the trailer.  It's an old fashioned gothic horror film with a cheesy soundtrack.  There are only two people we get to see in this movie, the killer and his son, and no real clues about them.  If I'm being honest, this is probably the most disappointing of the few "gothic" films that have come out over the years.  The title says it right!   I'd say this movie is best experienced in a dark room with the lights off.  The story is pretty standard.  One day the killer gets into a fight with his son which leads to the father shooting him.  A neighbor comes to the house to report that her husband has gone to the doctor.  He was found dead with a bullet wound to the head, and a note pinned to his chest saying, "The Devil is loose in this house.  We better get the hell out before he kills again!"  The other members of the family, including a witch named Cadaver, also arrive on the scene and decide to go to the witch's hut to do something about the killer.  In the hut they get a map to the man's body, which is lying in the kitchen.  To solve the murder they go to a house and find out that it is haunted.  Unfortunately, the witch doesn't do any good and the killer shows up and kills her.  Now, the murderer has to figure out how to get back to his house and figure out who is really dead and who might be a demon.  But before he can figure out this problem, we see the house he lives in being destroyed.  His son is gone but the killer is trapped in a cellar that is covered in "ghosts."   It seems like we're going to be watching a lot of this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very bad movie.  It is boring and boring.   It feels like they threw a couple things in for good measure.  A little bit of action, a few good jokes, and a few more bad jokes, but it doesn't do that much to really entertain.  It is about a group of kids that are bored playing video games.  But one of them wins the big prize at a competition, so he uses his winning money to buy the best gaming system money can buy.  And then he plays a game called "Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots".  This is another stupid, generic sci-fi movie.  First the robots fight each other.  Then the robots are all destroyed by the military.  The "action" starts when a giant robot comes from the sky and tries to destroy the "Rock'em Sock'em Robots" (remember that thing from the last Indiana Jones movie?).   Now the problem is that none of these robots have the slightest clue how to fight.   One robot uses a tank to try to get the other robots to fall down but only it explodes in mid-air, leaving the other "robot" and its pilot to fight it.  Oh, it all ends up being a huge disaster.   That's what the movie is all about:  a bunch of robots with no strategy trying to fight one huge enemy.  I guess the movie was made because they needed some action for this weekend, but there is nothing at all exciting about it.   I feel sorry for the people who had to sit through it in the theaters:  It was like sitting through one of the lame teen movies of the 1980s.   But it didn't stop me from loving it.

This is certainly not an original film, but then again so is most of the movies on this list. This one is a poor example of a "superhero" movie; the acting is at best laughable, the fight sequences are not all that special, the plot lacks any momentum or substance, and the ending is absolutely nonsensical. There is one decent scene of a villain doing something bad in the hospital, but in the whole movie, there is not much to like about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really bad movie. There are scenes where the guy is talking to a woman who clearly looks nothing like her real-life self. This film is so bad that you will be saying, "This is such a terrible movie!" but you have to watch it to believe it. A movie like this can only be made by an insane person to try to make a name for himself. This movie has so many bad parts that it will be unbelievable in its stupidity. Some of these scenes are absolutely ridiculous. I found it difficult to find a movie to laugh at since this is such an absurd movie. I guess they had some fun making this movie but they really should have left it to a local TV station to tell people what a bad time they are having. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie.   It was great, I loved the cast too.  I like to think of that movie as the last of the classic American comedies.  If only more of us could make it to the end!   This movie was really funny.  It's hard to say it's one of my all-time favorite movies.  But I think it's a movie that everyone should watch.  A lot of things that are funny in it are actually very painful.  This is really a great movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I personally enjoyed this film, I feel this could have been a much better, and hopefully more entertaining film.    I have always liked films that involve an old woman having a series of bizarre adventures.  They've probably had a much larger audience than anyone would give them credit for, but they always have a sense of humor about themselves.  What makes The Grand Seduction and The Grandmaster so interesting is that these two have a long history together that has seen these two go to some strange places.  When it comes to The Grand Master, the idea that he could be a time traveler is not really in doubt.  I thought The Grand Masters adventures took place in the 20th century, but that's not to say it's impossible for someone to travel backwards through time.  It is more likely that this is one of the many times that the old woman is the time traveler.  That doesn't change the fact that this film had nothing to offer me beyond a really lame story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not a horror lover. I have to admit I saw the movie once, but not too long ago and it's just too long. For my money, it's the worst horror film I've seen in years. Even the voice acting is terrible. At least they did a good job with the actors and the music is okay. There are better horror movies out there, like Halloween and Friday the 13th, and if you don't know where to start, I highly recommend you watch one of them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are not a fan of this kind of crap, don't even bother. There is a LOT of stuff going on that I do not care for. First, the opening credits are a little jarring in that they look like they were shot on a cheap digital camera.  I have no idea why they used a camera with that kind of look, but I will take it.    This film has many good things going on:   It has a nice, old-timey soundtrack;   a great cast with a good variety of characters, some of which do not work;    a strong performance from Tim Roth and a good performance by the actress in the best role that she can give;  it contains a great sequence of the protagonist in a cage for two days.  It has a good ending, a great villain, and some entertaining scenes.  However, I will say that I was disappointed with the ending, but that's to be expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is made to try and get us more than a second glance at the main characters. What it does is give us more of the same as the original. Not much of a character and not much of an action scene. Just one short fight scene and it quickly closes. Just too much of the original and I felt like the original would have been better in any other medium than this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The second half of the movie is very long. There is too much story in it to be a real movie. Some of the characters are not memorable and some of the dialogue is ridiculous. I'm not saying you should watch this movie, but it is an entertaining movie, with a few moments that are worth watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After all my years of watching bad movies it was a welcome surprise to have one so terrible that I laughed out loud and felt sorry for the filmmakers, the actors, and the director. This is no B-movie and is very bad. A group of young people, in this case in their mid-twenties, are driving a pickup truck (which should not have been an issue due to the time of day) and having a good time. They are playing cards on the bed, having a barbecue (probably done too soon and the grill overheated), and enjoying their time. Then a mysterious car pulls up and a beautiful woman (yes, she looks like a movie star) gets out. The men start asking her questions and she tries to explain but they don't seem to grasp the point she is making. One of them starts to get aroused and starts fingering himself under her jacket. The next thing we know they are in a hotel room and the woman has her clothes off and we hear a wet slurping sound (maybe she is a lesbian) and a moan. We are then told to sit down but one of the guys is still standing there. Suddenly he grabs a woman's head with one hand and fucks her in the mouth with the other (and maybe his own?). Another one is jerking off (not sure if that is what she is doing, I thought it was him), but she does not seem to enjoy it much either. The scene ends and she does something I will not discuss further. It is bad, bad, BAD, bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm afraid this is a "movie" not really a "drama", though the actors are good, and the story is rather gripping. The ending of the movie isn't really convincing either, though.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is hard to find good horror movies. The ones I've watched tend to be too long. There is too much of the characters that die off. I am not an horror film fan and I have not seen any of them, so this review is based on the trailers and a few of the reviews.   The trailer is ok but not exciting, and the actors are all just too fat and old.  The story begins with a woman walking in the woods and looking for her lost cat. It is not long before a strange man shows up and offers her a ride. It looks like the woman has lost her mind to an insane person. The people at the motel have nothing good to say about the person who has turned up. I have seen a couple of movies where this would have been a good idea, but this is just a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was hard for me to make up my mind about this movie. If I were to pick a worst film of all time I would pick this one. The worst thing about it is it starts out slow and doesn't end until the end credits roll! The acting, the effects, and the screenplay make me believe this was made by the same people who made the terrible Sharknado! I am never watching this film again!!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A little over two hours. It is a horrible story about how "happiness can never last" about an abusive father and his wife and their children; I didn't like this movie, I wish they would stop this movie. I would have preferred to see them go to therapy, not be abusive to each other and their kids. It just brings bad karma.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So, after watching a bad horror movie this weekend, and then watching a good horror movie last night, I decided to write down my thoughts on the horror genre. I don't watch horror movies that much, but I've seen some that I really enjoyed, so here is my top-ten list:  1. Dead Alive (2010) I've never seen a slasher movie I didn't like. In this one, a group of friends go on a camping trip. But something happens that turns them into zombies and kills one of them. So the others are forced to hunt down and kill him. It's a pretty good horror film, although one of the bad parts is that the movie starts off too fast and doesn't build up the tension the way it should.   2. The Conjuring (2013) I'm a huge fan of scary movies like The Conjure and Evil Dead. Not to mention the underrated The Amityville Horror, both horror movies based on the books of Stephen King. This one is a little more straight-forward, but still very effective, despite that the characters are almost all completely unlikable.  3. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (2004)   This sequel to the original Evil Dead is one of my favorite horror movies. It feels very contemporary and I can see why it was a big success. The sequel has a very different feel to it, with more humor than anything, which doesn't really work for me (although I'm sure the writers who wrote this movie don't mind.  4. Halloween 3: Season of the Witch (2005)  Another movie from the original, this is another great Halloween movie. It has a great cast (including Linda Blair!), excellent special effects, a great story, and great scares. I highly recommend this movie to any horror fan who wants a good Halloween movie!  5. Scream (1996) I haven't seen this movie in ages but it seems to be getting better by the year. I'm really fond of how it handles the supernatural. The first movie has the supernatural scare scenes a little too much but this movie's better. I like how the movie moves at a different pace in the first movie but here it moves quite a bit faster and a little bit slower, which I like.  6. The Evil Dead (1981) I really liked this movie. The scares are good and the action is really well done. The monsters are very well done and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are two main problems with this movie: 1. The writing is terrible. I found it difficult to understand the characters, and even though there is a large number of them I found myself missing one or two. The humor is not very good; one or even two funny gags only make it worse. 2. The acting is pretty good (it is a pretty silly film about a bunch of little people, so they are in on the joke); most of the people are quite convincing in the roles. I don't think it was too bad; it is just too short and the characters are not that interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a movie set in a world where the people are so happy.  People have all the material they need for fun and games.    I have seen a movie like that in a cinema many times before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To all of the movie fans out there who have yet to catch the first film in the series, well, it's okay. I like this movie. I was never a fan of the series and I was hoping this one would be better.   The story is somewhat similar to the earlier movies. The first one was a very interesting one and had lots of action. The second one, though, had a completely different feel to it. It felt very much like a children's film. It had a much more gentle feel to the film and I think the fact that this is a family film might have worked in its favour. The whole thing with the little kids was a bit annoying. The kids in this movie all act in a similar way. One little girl would sit near a table and would say "Mama!" to the little boy. They would get on each other's nerves. I thought it would make for a much better movie though. It is a bit disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of kids are walking down a road when a big truck crashes into them and they end up stuck in it and having to figure out a way to get out.    The plot is about the kids trying to get free by trying to figure it out and trying to use the most unusual methods to free themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a scene near the end that is not very well executed. It is just a long scene of the two of them sitting at a table looking down on the room which has two other people there. It does not feel like they should be sitting there at all, but they do. The two of are dressed rather conservatively and sit looking out at the room from the table. We see that the woman, I think she is an actress is looking at a painting on a wall. She looks up and sees a woman dressed in a beautiful red gown with a beautiful white bonnet. The other woman is also dressed in red and white and has a little red dress and a white bonette. Both of them are looking at the painting of a white horse. The woman says, "I was in the army and a cavalry officer once killed my horse and had to walk for a week to get it back. I thought my life was lost. Then I found this painting and thought 'I can never get over this again.'" The woman thinks it is beautiful and says, looking out across the room and the audience, "You cannot do what I did. I must have been the greatest horse rider in the world and this must have made me such a terrible horse rider. This painting must have come from a museum in some distant corner of the world, so I had to do my best to recreate it. I tried making it up as much as I could, so it was a horse I could ride." And then, because I wanted to be a real jerk I added in my own interpretation that the painting was done by a man. I was supposed to use this image because, for some reason the movie thought I was a racist. They kept trying to get me to change the song at the last second. After I had finished the song, the director walked into the studio and told me "Do not change the lyrics. You are not allowed to change them. This is not a racist song." I told him I would, and the director was quite furious when he saw the result. He said: "I've changed the name of the song. It was called 'Swing and a Miss and I can fix it! The new version is called 'The Horse Rider and The Horse.' It's more like what I'm thinking of." I didn't get a single credit in that movie because the producer and director wanted me to make a movie they had written. They had never even seen a movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was disappointed that I didn't get any of the fun that I thought the trailer was promising.   The only reason I gave it three stars was that I did enjoy the humor and the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most bizarre and boring and utterly forgettable film of a series of films that are not much more than "A short story about a woman and a cat". Well, it could have been a bit more inventive with the plot but not much. Well, I guess people would be better off getting the whole series on DVD so they can see the film without the narration. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a movie full of "how does a character ever change" and "how do they never get better" there is a bit of "ohh, we have a character who grows into a man and it's all good!" There's a bit more of that here than a lot of the movie has, and it makes the movie feel a little more realistic. But this is a typical bad movie and doesn't really work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've always enjoyed movies made by Stanley Kubrick, and that's because they were, and are, very carefully made. The first half of the film is just the usual stuff you would expect a Kubrick movie to be: a lot of people are talking and a lot is happening. The other half of it is more interesting, and a little more ambitious than the first half. It's got some great action scenes and the whole thing is very dark and moody at times. The acting is good (except for the last scene with the priest who gets a face full of machine gun bullets), and the cinematography is good; the movie looks a lot like "Dr. Strangelove", and there is no question about that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My girlfriend and I went to see The Big Bad Wolves (1988). It's about a wolf pack headed by a wolf who is not really that bad but is rather annoying. The wolf is really weak as a character but the rest of the wolves were pretty good. The film is just ok.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know I know it's a bad film, but it made me smile! The story is simple: a little girl is kidnapped by an evil old man. She must run away from him and get help from a wise old man (played by David Carradine) and her friend (played really well by Maitland Ward). It's a very cute, silly movie with wonderful characters. Maitlan Ward is wonderful as the wise old geezer and I always liked his old black and white movies. His old man has a kind heart and is always willing to help and it was the perfect way to end the movie for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My first attempt at a horror movie. I don't have a clue who the original character was but I'm guessing it was "The Phantom". I donot know why I've always thought this movie looked like a bad copy of another one of my favorite movies: "I Know What You Did Last Summer". It really wasn't even that good but then again I was only 10 years old and it seemed that the filmmakers had not learned anything from the original. The music, though, was nice. I guess I really like the way it was shot with a few special effects added but it seems like it was made for children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so much like the bad movies that are all around you. It has the typical teenage girl and her friend going through some bad times. They find a dead boy and it appears he has been murdered. They go looking for clues and they get a big clue: a big blue truck that was not stolen from the road but stolen from a lake. A lot of trouble ensues and all is not well with this movie. You know what that's a good movie because it is not even entertaining in a bad way.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the movie, I was hoping that the director would learn a lesson from his previous movie "Zoom" about how to avoid cliché. The director of "The Last Picture Show" has completely dropped the ball with this movie. It's nothing like "Zookeeper" which has one of the best soundtracks, but "The Late Show" on TV will not save this film. It seems that the film's sole purpose was to get out of making the TV show and film. The story is so lame that the only good part is the ending. The ending is so bad and the character acting so bad that the movie should be in the garbage can with "Halloween" and "The Dead Zone". I didn't watch the film to learn a lot about the movie director, but to hear him say "you all suck!" like he was giving a press conference. I'm ashamed that this film is about a man who can't stand to lose control over a television camera and thinks that he can make it look so great. I don't know how else to say this. This is a stupid movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this movie about a time machine, with the main character wearing a costume from a science fiction cartoon show called "Hanna-Barbera".  If you watch that show you get an idea of how silly, and cheap, this movie is.  It's really funny at times, but at other times you get the feeling that someone is making money off the laughter of the kids.    And you know, that was just the beginning of a bad time for this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is obvious from this movie that the director of this movie was not at all the right one. The film was shot for $250,000 (that is almost $1 million today). When the producers decided to use the actors from a movie called "Jail Break" (the director wanted an old man to play the sheriff and the film producers insisted that he play an old boy) the film is shot in a very old fashioned way. The actors have to walk up a hill and down a river with a rope attached to one end. The old boy is wearing a white shirt and a jacket. The Sheriff is wearing boots, the deputy sheriff is wearing old fashioned trousers with a white undershirt and a black fur coat. The only way to keep warm was by sticking a hand out of the coat and grabbing the snow. When the old boy sees the sheriff, his face goes white and he walks quickly away. He then sees the deputy who turns to him and tells him he's welcome to be an old girl and run away. The next day, the old girl comes across the sheriff's wife who has a baby on her lap and she is also in a white skirt. The sheriff walks to her and tells her he wants to marry her and she agrees to marry him. The young girl then shows up, who is wearing white pants and a white top. This film is full of bad acting and bad scenery. I think it was only directed by the wrong director as it really had the wrong type of audience in mind. I have watched other bad movies that are much better. If you have seen "Jails Break" then you know what you are getting into. There is a lot of nudity and the actors were very old looking and it was done to show the effect the old people's bodies have on the younger actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What I've found out is that I cannot love a good movie... This is a poorly done bad movie. There is hardly any heart or story, but I think the makers are more interested in making a bad picture than making a great film. And I don't mean that in the derogatory way. The movie takes a few things I love about classic movies--fantastic special effects and dark humor--and takes them down a very long road, sometimes literally. For example, at one point there is a giant, walking car in the middle of an empty field. You can't help but laugh! This movie is pretty funny when it comes down to it! And sometimes you wonder how this movie could have been made, because the story and acting are so bad. I don"t know why anybody would go to the trouble of putting on an awful movie like this, but it has to be seen to be believed!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Wicker Man" is the only film that has ever made me cry.  It's a pretty decent, entertaining short that takes place in a forest that resembles a cross between an English forest and a Canadian one; I'm not sure what kind of forest it was, but it had a sort of mossy green and was rather thick.  A couple people are walking through the woods when a young girl in a white dress is seen through the forest.   As the woods gets more and more thick, the girl looks like she is moving around and making odd noises and her face doesn't seem human at all.  There are a lot of animals that are in this forest too, but none of them are visible to the human eye at all; they are merely the shadows of their forms.  The next morning, the boy has a nightmare about a woman that looks exactly like his daughter and his wife.  This brings the boy's sister to the family home and all three of the children become obsessed with the girl, who is clearly no human at ALL.  As they try to scare her, the little girl tries to run away.  Unfortunately, the other children are still in love with her and try to catch her.  When the witch comes out of the trees and grabs the girl's tail, she turns into a huge cat and chases the children.  Before she can catch any of them, the Witch breaks into the home and puts the children into a sack, leaving only the boy to catch.  "The Wickersman" is a good film for children to play in the middle of the forest at night but to make it even better, the director, Peter Weir, did a nice job of hiding the fact that the kids are in there all night.  I hope that this was another movie that kids like me can watch over and over and never forget it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't say that I like this movie. I think it's kind of cheesy. It's pretty obvious that this movie could have been written by John Waters or David Cronenberg, and was probably written by the latter, as the concept seems to be just an excuse to have a bunch of weird creatures run around in strange environments. This movie is very much about "halloween", but it's all so horribly cheap that this concept isn't really funny at all (for some reason it seems the only thing this movie actually wants to be about).  The movie really doesn't have any real "jumps" or "jams", which are the kinds of things that really make this movie good.   I don't care about the idea of being able to talk to snakes.  But hey, it's a movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you've not seen this film, it's a good, simple, family-friendly fantasy which is entertaining and entertainingly entertaining. It doesn't have a complex plot that will have you flipping pages, or a very complicated and convoluted plot which will have your head spinning. It is entertaining as a family film, and I highly recommend it as a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just finished watching this. It doesn't live up to what I thought it would be.   It's a movie with a premise that is really cool: a bunch of different people are hired to take care of the house while it's on the auction block.  For some reason the house is broken into, so they must go in and fix it. The house isn't really broken, but a lot of the items that once filled it have either been moved or moved out. Some are left behind, but they are not exactly in a good state.  I do like the concept that they must move into a place that isn't perfect and try to maintain it, but I think the film would be a lot better if the "house" had an open plan kitchen with a refrigerator, and more room for the furniture.  The only thing that keeps me watching this is because one of the actors seems to be playing around with the camera. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found it a bit confusing why, when there are several scenes in which there is a girl being attacked by a dog (which I didn't notice when I first watched it) the dog is referred to as a "bull" for some reason.   There is also a scene where the girl is shown sitting by a fountain in her bathing suit on the beach with the dog walking by, and in another scene where she stands in front of a fire and stares out at the ocean from inside a bathtub.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago in California, we witnessed a movie called The Rock (no relation). It is a true story about a group of wrestlers in an MMA Gym, training for the big fight against Bruce Lee. The first fight was staged in a dark garage, in front of a green screen. Bruce Lee stood in a tattered green jumpsuit, and one of the wrestlers in a leather jacket, was to do the tumbling. The wrestler who jumped first (he was a black belt) got into a bad tumble. His head hit the green screen, and he tumbled out of it and onto the ground, and there was Bruce Lee, a few feet away. The referee came out and said: 'Oh, Bruce Lee!'. The referee looked at Bruce and said 'Well, I think I'm going to have to step in here and stop the fight. My partner got knocked out of the sky by a blackbelt. It was terrible! What do you say we go back to the garage. I'm not doing that.' Bruce Lee looked at the referee and said - 'No, I don't like that fight at all. I want to fight someone in his normal attire.' The referee didn't agree, and stood in front and watched Bruce Lee go through his fighting routine. The fight continued with Bruce Lee not only fighting Bruce Lee in his regular outfit, but also Bruce Lee and a blackface wrestler who wore a baseball cap. At the end of the second round, Bruce did get an advantage in height and weight and was able to use that advantage to the finish, knocking out his blackface opponent with a headbutt. The whole scene was filmed in such a way that Bruce Lee could walk out of his fight in one piece and walk around the set. The blackface wrestling wrestler walked over to the red carpet and took a photo with a smile on his face. One of the producers, who was sitting next to the stage, was mortified when the picture was shown to the cameras. He was very concerned about the public reaction to this movie. He tried to talk Bruce Lee into putting the film on hold and to give it another try but Bruce Lee refused to do so. He said he wanted to fight the real Bruce Lee... And if he wanted, he would be on a date with her... A year later Bruce Lee came back to make another movie, starring Chuck Norris! This time he made a film called The Ghost, and a little later a film about the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the opening scene, the director gives a few of the actors some bad lines. These are played in a manner which reveals the poor quality of these films: the actors are in terrible poses. The director never really gets going.   The plot starts out promising: it is time for a picnic! A picnic is an event that seems to be very much in demand in the Midwest. The movie is told in a semi-academic manner and the people are generally intelligent people.    After the picnic, a bunch of kids who have nothing better to do play in the fountain which fills the fountain park. The kids do some foolish things.  They all take bath- toys.  The fountain, by the way, was an actual fountain in the park.     A good thing was that it was not a real fountain.  When a man who is in love sees these people, he takes advantage of their naivety. He goes with them and they end up in a motel.  He takes the kids into the motel. The next morning, the kids decide to take the kids out of the motel, so they take the children, the man with them, and take the motel to the town of Eastview.   In Eastview, the town has something like a fair. The parents are also in love. They have been married thirty years and want to get married again.     The good man is not too happy about the town having a fair, but decides to go to the fair.  This will be a hard day in the life for the good man.  This is a comedy of manners and not of action.  We don't see anything else that's very unusual in this film.  It's more of a good time with bad people (but with some good people too).   At least the movie is better than this: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen in my life. This was the movie that made the director's career. This film is a horror movie with no plot and the characters are so horrible. I can only guess what they had in mind. A movie that is about a family that moves to a new town. They get lost and end up living in a house that is owned by a man who is supposed to be dead. He keeps making noise in his room and they are scared of the man because of his strange noises. The man has been in the house for a while and everyone at the house knows he is dead but they do not want to tell anyone. It is an old house that has been on the market for years and a real estate agent comes in to look at it. He says it is not worth what the other houses are worth because there has been nothing but bad luck in this house over the years. He is not in a good mood and thinks that the other owners have done something to this house because it was not sold. He comes out with a list of the things that need to be done and he walks around the house and looks at each room to try to find a way to fix it. As the man is walking around he gets a phone call and it is a woman who is very distraught. She says that a group of men came to the house after she had gone to bed and cut off her hair. It sounds like a horrible nightmare but her voice is not evil and she seems happy and is crying and says she was scared. The men come out and they have a long conversation with her, telling her about the house that she just saw and what the strange noises are and how sad she must be. Then they leave. The woman's face is horribly contorted in pain and she is clearly in pain. I was horrified and I could not believe what I was watching. The whole thing reminded me of a horror film.  The film is filled with creepy and creepy music that is supposed ot scare the poor woman. There are no scares in this movie and it does not even try to scare. It only attempts to tell an old story about a man and his family and it ends with the man saying that they should not be afraid.  This film was so bad that it made the film company want to cancel it. Apparently it was so terrible that the studio that made it actually threatened to cancel the film if it was shown. Even though it

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing to come from The Big Picture is the end credits. It's not very subtle, but we're all adults in our thirties and the movie ends in a way that suggests there's more to come.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Truly awful! This was a terrible movie with a terrible cast. The best part of the movie for me was when a young guy was murdered by his girlfriend and the boyfriend was the killer. The girlfriend was a complete jerk. The movie ended with him hanging on a tree and everyone standing around the tree. If you go for a cheap laugh at the end of this film, it's very funny.  The movie:   Took the place of an earlier film called The Green Door, which starred Alan Arkin as a police lieutenant in the city of Boston, who had an affair with a woman he meets at a train station. The woman is played by Gail Russell. There is a scene where he and a female officer are on a train to Boston. A man comes and pulls the woman out of a seat and attacks the officer, punching and kicking him in the head. The man then gets off the train and walks away. The cop is left on the train with a bloody head wound. As he is lying in the aisle of the train he sees the woman get off and walk off into the dark of the night. The film doesn't start great. There's an annoying song about the train station music playing over and over. The train is slow going so everyone in the train is wearing a hat and gloves and no one is talking.  There are a couple of scenes where you can clearly see the movie is a bad production and it's bad acting. It's very hard to believe the people are actually making a film about this. The director is apparently a man named Peter Seltzer who also made a lot of movies that are either not very good or very bad. He doesn't like his movies to be very pretty.  The movie's ending is a stupid one with the woman saying "you'll never see a train go by here again, until you go inside a tree."   Some other reviews:  The worst movie to ever be made. I would watch this again if someone had handed it to me on a silver platter with a silver spoon in it. A very bad film about a woman who kills a man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest, I liked this one. It wasn't very good, but the setting was pretty cool, and the acting was average. I like the idea of the little girl's dream of becoming a princess but I was a bit disappointed. (I also felt a bit sorry for the people working at this place, since I think that this is the last movie that they will ever make with such a lousy script.)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say that The Thing is a horror film about some sort of alien bug-people living inside of people is about as accurate a description as you could possibly get of this film. The Thing was basically a campfire classic. I like a lot of people's take on it, but I'm not sure it's a campy classic. It is kind of campy and the creature is really cute at one point, but then it sort of moves on and it's not particularly scary. It's one of those horror films that was made so that everybody who watched it would feel a bit silly and think it was really stupid. It would have been more fun to watch without the cheesy music and crappy special effects. The thing was not supposed to be scary at all (though it could have been, since there was no special effect involved). It was supposed to show us that the Thing lived in this guy's house and then it would have made him the scary guy. I know that's a bad idea and I wish I'd never seen it. - April 18, 2009A bad movie?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a really bad movie. It is bad even for a bad science fiction movie. This movie looks like it could be something of a science-fiction classic. That's what most people seem to be thinking. However, it actually is nothing of the sort. I thought it would be the "first" of a new generation of bad science-fantasy films. It sure was a poor film. The acting is bad. There isn't a sound track and you can't hear much of the dialogue. It's all just music. The special effects are also bad. The characters are just so flat.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably the worst horror movie I have ever seen. It started out bad enough. A woman wakes up to find a stranger hanging from her bedroom window. She tries to grab the knife that fell from the stranger and tries to stab him, but the blade just slips away, making the woman believe that a stranger in a hoodie is trying to hang her. After the first few minutes we see a ghostly apparition in the background that looks a little like the man on the screen. We hear loud noises of a person who looks like the guy from the movie. At first we see the person standing in the darkness. Then a white light begins to fall from the sky onto the person, who disappears from the camera. Then we see him in the light again and he is standing there, motionless. I'm a little disappointed because I wanted to feel like I watched a real horror movie. I guess it looks pretty bad. The only good thing about this movie is that it is made out of really bad material.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The entire plot of this movie was ridiculous, but in a good way. I don't care that the movie is based on a children's movie (The Wizard of Oz) - a "good movie" in my opinion. It is fun to watch the characters try to solve all their problems in one movie, like a group of kids trying to solve a maze (I like that one better), and the whole film had that kind of "funny" look to it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of this movie is okay, but the second half is a complete mess of a movie.  I don't understand how this movie was even made.  The cast is all over the place; you have a woman who has never had sexual intercourse and a man who has been raped and is now trying to commit suicide.  This is the "Marilyn Monroe: In an Inconvenient Light" of the sexual assault genre.  No one has a clue how to act, and no one is even trying.  Every line is filled with "I am so sorry" that is almost as lame as the movie itself.  It's not just that every line is stupid.  At least a few of the actors are funny, like Sean Pertwee, who is like a "James Spader" with a mustache, but he has a really terrible "f" (like the F-word), and all the women are stupid. If you like "The Big Chill" this is the film for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I was a kid, my parents would watch their movies over and over in one of their bedrooms and at the end of the movie the lights would go down and then a little black box would pop up, play a little record, then it would turn red and fade to black and we'd see our parents playing it. That was awesome.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a real trainwreck. I'm a huge sci fi fan but I'm not so in love with this movie. It's a bad science fiction movie, no suspense, horrible special effects, and most of all terrible acting. At times I wanted to cry. I hate to see a movie made in 1983 that was a giant disappointment. If you hate science fiction this movie is for you. It also has the worst ending I've ever seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be fair, the plot was boring. It was too slow and there wasn't enough plot. In fact, the first thing the audience sees is that they are watching a movie.   The plot is so generic that I was just watching a horror movie and I'd be more disappointed with this movie than the ones in the early 90's. It felt very cliche and rushed with very little logic.  I did like the music though.  It wasn't terrible by any means but there is absolutely no depth to any of it. It's either that or it was a sound effect.  The only time they really did anything interesting was when the alien came out of the spaceship. He had a weird smile on his face and he wasn't wearing a helmet.  Maybe if the story got going a little, maybe even a little bit, the movie would have become a bit more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good movie with bad acting from the actors. The story has a good beginning, but then it becomes a bad one. The acting is bad in most of the movies and there is no plot in it. There are many scenes where the actors don't know what they are doing, but they always seem to have something better to do.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this last night and was completely disappointed. The music was not bad but it was not great either. There was almost nothing funny at all. I'm not sure what you would get if you pulled up the soundtrack to a bad horror film and made it the opening theme.  Kudos to the production designers for trying to make a movie feel like a live action movie but there really wasn't much about the movie that you would consider live action. The camera would focus on the actors in the most unnatural of angles. And it was hard to see anything happening on the screen.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I guess it's the age old question "will this movie ever end?" The thing about movies like this is that they never really end. It doesn't matter where this movie ends, it keeps returning in new and creative (even if not very good) variations. This is just a shame because it had the potential to be one of the greatest (or maybe the least) bad movies ever. You may laugh at my review of this movie, but the fact that it ends on such a note is very upsetting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, like all Hollywood movies, is a cheap knock off of the "The Shawshank Redemption" (and many others). Well, I'm sure that's what they were going for, but they missed the boat on this one. I don't blame them, I've seen this movie in a dozen different ways and this is the one that works for me. The plot is as follows. The town is plagued by two psychopaths. John is a convicted killer. He goes to work for the sheriff. We follow him on his daily routine. When the sheriff calls for help, John responds. He doesn't want to go to work today. He thinks he's too old for the job, too stupid to remember what life was like when he was younger and more adventurous. I found this movie funny at first but then it got a little slow. It was nice to see the characters in such different situations (at one point the sheriff goes camping to find the perfect place to retire. You would expect it to go downhill but it doesn't). However, as with most movies that are based on a true story, there are some questionable parts. If John were a regular citizen, then he would be in jail right now. It appears he's more interested in killing people rather than making a living. This leads to several problems. For example, his boss was supposed to take over the job of the sheriff when he dies. He wants to give it to John but John refuses. Then John shoots himself in the head. This kills the boss and then we see the townspeople, some of them dead and some still in shock from the sheriff's death. We don't know why John shot himself because we don't see him do anything and his story was told in a way that makes it look like suicide. What does this all mean? If you've seen the movie at all you know what happens. There's no other explanation. The only thing I don a lot of the movie are the flashbacks to the sheriff and his wife and the police. They are very well-done and it seems that the Sheriff was the one responsible for the murders. I guess it's an interesting take on a real life story (it's not) but I'd rather watch the movie with the full story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want some kind of funny action movie where a man and his kid fall asleep in a cave then you will like this one.   The main character is a caveman who is a good friend of the kid and he always tries to wake him up when he falls asleep. But when the kid wakes up it is only to discover that the cave is about to fall on him.  One of my favorites from the "old" (1984) "Youngblood" tv series

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A boring story about a guy who finds a dead cat with a hole cut in its throat.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was actually in a good mood before this movie started. A few friends who had been hanging out in the park after a beer had taken advantage of the weather, and decided to run to the beach. I'm not sure about anyone else except me, but I'm fairly certain I was the only one not wearing a bathing suit. It didn't help that the water is too deep to swim in. That would be one thing if it was just the two of them on the sand, but two guys were also there. One of them was even naked, and that wasn't a pleasant surprise. I don't know exactly how this started, but it sure didn't end well. One guy began rubbing himself, and in a moment of weakness he began to take off his shirt, which resulted in a pair of hot, hairy, tanned legs. The other guy didn't seem to notice, and instead began to rub himself. The scene continued with the naked guy rubbing himself in his underwear for a while, before taking off his boxers. Then the third guy joined in, and this was where things got ridiculous. He kept rubbing himself under his boxer. In the end he was rubbing himself so much his boxy little butt looked like a mushroom. The fourth guy decided to join the fun. He was completely naked. He looked kind of like a big, bad clown. I actually laughed out loud the first few times he did it. Then it got ridiculous, and I knew it was over. The fifth guy came along just as bad. His chest seemed to rise and fall like a pendulum. I think that's what it was called when it was under the water. So there were four naked guys getting worked over by a beach ball. It seemed that the first four boys were the main group, and the others were just there to look. When the fifth guy finally came on, he turned out to be one of the main players. He quickly stripped off all of his clothes, and rubbed his hard on in his jeans. The rest of the guys then joined in. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. He did have a nice hard on. I mean, he got it in his crotch, no lying, he did, and when he looked around at the other guys it was clear the others had no idea it was there. This was about 7 or 8 guys in all, but this one guy was the biggest and the ugliest. And when he was going
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have not seen the film but I can tell you this is nothing like that great movie from about 5 or 6 years ago.  Instead of the old classic there is now a story about a small girl who is looking for a new home.    She finds a very poor family which is in a horrible state of neglect and poverty.  This is a film that I do not see again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the movie a couple of times now, but it never ceases to astound me with how stupid the story is. I really don't know why they did this stupid movie; it's ridiculous. The story starts out with a woman who runs away from home. Her husband has a son who was killed by an electric wheelchair, but he doesn't get to see him again. That's okay with her as he is buried in the family plot with the rest of the family. One day she gets a letter from the cemetery telling her to come back, but there's no grave or body. I'm sure it was an accident, but why would she want to bring any sort of death to the guy? She is brought to an old woman named Mrs. Kress who says that a gentleman she knows who is an attorney is looking for her. Mrs.Kress tells her that he will be there in an hour, and if he has a body he can return the same way. Then he starts talking about the funeral of a lady who lived just across the pond. That lady was buried a few feet from the woman who ran away from her husband and who is the wife of Mrs.Lester. But I suppose Mrs. Lester has nothing to do with this and this lady can't be buried next to her anyway. Mrs Kress says she has some other business to take care of, and she asks if Mrs. Lester wants to meet him to discuss the matter with him. I don't see what this lady wants. This lady could be in a hospital, and there is absolutely no reason to bring her over here to a country that she probably knows nothing about. This movie makes me wonder why anyone would want to travel back in time or back in another time. When this lady goes back to the 1960's Mrs Kess has her head shaved. Why? There is nothing to be gained from shaving your head if you have no reason for doing so. Why does the guy with no reason shave his head? Why is Mrs. Mardigan a prostitute? Why the hell does she take her shoes off after every meeting? Why does she have nothing but her underwear on? It's just as silly a movie as that one about the guy who lives in the 1800's. You know the one I'm talking about, the one with the guy in the cowboy hat with all the guns. I think this movie is just as stupid as that. And even the actors playing these roles
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I first saw the trailer for the upcoming horror movie I was like most of my friends and family. I mean no offense to the director but this looks really like a straight remake of a movie I liked way too much way back when! A group of four teenagers play pool at a party. They get a bad feeling when they are being spied on by a strange looking dude who seems to follow them. Once they go to bed they all turn out to be in bed with each other but one of the guys is just a creepy looking ghost! I couldnt help thinking this movie would turn out like The Hills Have Eyes! However with a much better script it could still turn out that way.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't care that this movie didn't have any redeeming features. I knew I had to look it up, or else I would have been bored to death by all the talking. I mean, you are just saying "good thing" or "bad thing" all the time to random people in a restaurant. So, what you are doing here, Mr. Scorsese, is to write the story of a rich American boy who ends up in a bad kind of restaurant. Well, in this story, he ends up at a bad sort of restaurant too. In addition, he is forced to work as a wait-staff in a disgusting restaurant owned by the Russian-Jewish mafia. His friend, who also has to work, gets drunk on alcohol that the mob gives him. However, they are able to get a drunk Russian-Jew in the restaurant. He decides to use his "Russian language skills" to make the poor waiters work a little longer. The Russians tell him that one day they will be able to bring him to the moon. He is so excited that he wants to make a fortune from it. Well... the money in that money... is almost the same price you will be paying for a ticket to the Moon!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A little over a year ago, in a little-visited town with some of the prettiest weather in the country, I got to see a film called The Perfect Storm which was about how storms could be turned into storms. It was beautifully filmed (in the usual Wachowski style, but with more of a science fiction feel), with a superb cast of beautiful, intelligent actresses, and a great production team. It turned out to be a good storm, but it had only been a small one; what was expected of it, a great one (although the title of the film was a little confusing). The movie is about a storm of epic proportions, with some big, bad guys from space and an evil space lord (David Bowie) and a few evil space people (Elvis Costello). The cast were great, and the script and acting were excellent. It could well be the best space film since the original Star Wars, and I don't see anything else like it in movies or TV at all. The production design is very good; the movie set, especially the giant spaceships, is very spectacular. The music is wonderful. The plot is an excellent, if somewhat confusing, one that is quite good, but also has some moments that just don't feel quite right. The acting was terrific all around, and it was a very good film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was supposed to be the year of the big screen version of Peter Pan. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a terrible movie. It wasn't terrible on my expectations, but it wasn't great either. I mean, it had lots of heart (particularly for a PG), but it felt like a cheap attempt at a sequel. If anything, it just made me sad to think that the film could have used a little more heart. The musical numbers were alright too (although, that one about the Tinkerbell who will turn into a pig seems to be getting a bit old) and I was enjoying the way they were trying to capture the magic of the original. It had a bit of everything, from silly and silly, to the usual, but I can't help but wonder what the sequel would be like.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the late '70s I was a teenager in South Florida. I knew nothing about the music, the lyrics, the culture. I didn't want to be that girl who got to the top in a bikini. I wasn't looking for attention like so many of my friends. I wanted to live a simple life. To work, to play in bands. To write poetry and sing in the shower. I'd always wanted to be a "rock n' roll" actress. And so that dream became a reality. She didn't look like an actual rock n' roller, but I got to know her very well. We got to hang out in her dorm room and I would read to her. I loved to read, and I loved that I could be so honest in my love poems. I'm not good at writing poetry, but we had so many good times. One of my favorite memories is her writing me a love poem in the form of a letter. I just remember that I couldn't hold it together. And I can't imagine how she felt.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was awful! It was so bad it was funny! This movie has everything: a terrible hero (you guessed it! - the guy with a mustache), the villain (he's so scary it's scary!), and it's all based on a really bad book. That book is supposed to be a story about a monster called a "giant man," but it is really about some guys going through a bunch of stuff that would make an ordinary guy want to run away from it all, just to get away from all that. The story isn't bad, but the movie is so bad that it's not funny. I didn't like the movie. I don't know how they made a movie like this. It had nothing to do with real life.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am soooo ashamed that I even watched this. The only reason this movie exists is because it is a parody of one of the most popular movies ever made, Pulp Fiction. If you haven't watched this movie then this movie is a bad attempt at making the film look like the great film it is. This is one of those movies that is way to long and way to short. The film tries to include so many different types of gunfights but it never really manages to make those fights the main focus of the movie. I found the action to be repetitive and boring. There is only one shot in the movie that actually worked and it was when Pulp shoots his hand off while shooting a guy. The gun shots in this film are almost entirely fake and just seem like a cheap gimmick to get some cheap laughs. At least it is funny to see the film and not be able to figure out who shot the guy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first and only time i see this movie, and that was in the film "Zorro: Masters of the Universe". I guess this film is a "lost" movie because it has been out of print for so long. I guess it's too bad because it's so good. It's a film where everyone on set should give each other high-fives, and where it really didn't matter who did the best. It was all a big joke. I really think that they used the same crew of actors on this as they used for "Zoro" because they were all in this movie. I mean, it's amazing that they were able to get the same actors to do the same roles again, let alone three times in a row. It really shows that they did not take the time to change the movie's basic formula. It makes me wonder why they even bothered because they clearly did not care. I thought that "Zoros" was better than "Zoras", because it did a much better job of taking you into the characters' heads. I also think that this movie would work really well as a kids' movie because the characters were pretty. It doesn't feel silly for kids to laugh at the funny things, like the people fighting in the cave or the people chasing after the wolf. I just don't think that there's anything really worthwhile in this film, other than all the jokes. I think that it would be a lot better as a video-game. It seems like this is another movie about something and then it's about nothing, and then about something else, and it just ends. I hope that "The Jungle Book" will be more like this movie because I just think that a movie like this just makes no sense.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Is this a really bad movie?   The movie opens with a brief, meaningless shot of the town of Pikesville, Kansas, with its holly hedges and white farmhouse. This setting is immediately followed by a little girl in a straw dress. This is a cute, innocent little girl, but what makes her so good? The setting is absolutely beautiful in the first place. There's a small town in central Kansas and a few nice things: the quaint wooden schoolhouse, the small green farm, the church with its stained glass windows. There are a lot of nice things, but you can get lost in a place like this, and you can't get lost long.   I've seen many a family drama before, but this isn't really one of them.  There's a girl that seems like a good person to me, and it doesn't last long. After spending a couple weeks here, she starts to get meaner and more violent to everyone around her. Then she finds out her mother is having an affair, and starts to have a psychotic break.  Now, I don't think there's any way this movie could have been any worse than it is.  The acting isn't horrible, but it's not good either. Even the kids look like they have a bad attitude.  I like when a movie ends with a cute little girl running away, but not for a good reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this movie was a little too tame, but that's just how this movie is made: tame.   The story isn't terribly original; it is essentially a retelling of a story told by the Bible about the last days of the Jewish people.  But I never did like the Bible's ending.  In that last chapter we learn how God saved the Israelites and how He wiped out the Canaanites.  Now I guess I can't say I find the ending satisfactory.  It just didn't seem to add up to me.  One of the most amazing parts of the movie was how I knew exactly what would happen in the last scene.  How would the Jews accept it?  I'm thinking this was a script in which the makers knew that they were on to something big when they decided to show a little of the Jews leaving the temple.  The way it ended gave a pretty good idea of what would come next.  I was a bit disappointed in the ending, but then again I didn't get the film as good as I might have.  As for the rest of the film, the picture looks nice; nothing spectacular, but nothing was terrible either.  And it doesn't come across as being a very long film, at under 90 minutes.  This is a pretty light-hearted movie, but it was certainly enjoyable.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing this horror film, I can confirm it is a horrible film. This is a film about a family that moves to a new house and get into a fight with an old woman. Then the wife comes home and starts looking for her mother. The movie is just terrible. The actors are so bad it is almost unbelievable they can get this film together. The only positive part to the movie is the title; but it makes it sound so un-original. The film has very little horror, so a new movie title might be in order.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My God, this movie has a lot of stuff going on. But all the action comes down to the final battle, and it is a real mess. You might want to wait for the next movie - it is really a bad film. (Dec 3, 2017)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a terrible movie, with awful acting and a terrible story. The story is not only awful, but it's made much worse by the terrible acting, which is absolutely terrible and doesn't get much worse than what happens.   If you don't like horror films, then this is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed by the ending.  It has its share of flaws, but it's certainly not a terrible movie, which is great considering how much effort is put into the world building.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this movie is a total flop. The movie is pretty bad. One of the biggest problems is the actors. The one good thing about this movie has to be the acting. The other big bad things about this horrible movie are: - The writing is horrible. The characters are so bad, I can't even remember any of the words in the movie. -The plot is horrible, but I won't say more about it because all it really does is move from point to point. -I hate how the movie does the same thing over and over again. -There are many terrible scenes in this movie. I hate how she just stands there with a knife when they come to her apartment. -They put the same music over and again over and... it's pretty stupid. -No one in this film is good enough. I would not recommend this movie to anybody.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like    (   ), but   can't say that it is a good movie.   It's a bit too preachy, too preach-y for my liking.  It goes on and on and continues to do so.  I don't know why.  The main character is a teacher, and yet he doesn't seem to have any problems with the way he dresses.  His wife is a mother.  This was supposed to be the last of the "modern" movies, and it is really hard to see how a character who is supposed to have been born in 1876 could be so out of the current trends and fashion.  What's more, I feel as if this is the type of film that has been going on since   the fifties.  There are too many references to current events.  My favorite line is "It's always nice to have a good old-fashioned love-story."  I was a huge fan of the original "Sister" when it came out, which I consider one of the best horror comedies of all time.  Unfortunately this new one is very similar to it, except the music is not nearly as good.  If you liked the original, you'll probably like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a very strange movie. It follows the plot of a girl and her friends (a boy and a girl) who become stuck in a house after having to evacuate from a nuclear holocaust. The girl is a young blonde with an evil looking mask and is the only survivor of the nuclear holodoom explosion. Her friends are little children dressed in little outfits and are all stuck at the bottom of a pit as it drops them down through an abyss. The plot is pretty much a simple one, you start out in the house and work your way around. What makes it so interesting is the way the story is told, the film seems to come to a natural end at a point when the camera pans back to the girl looking at a small child that is not a child but a little zombie. A little kid that looks like it was made by a sick little kid.  And then it ends. The last shot is of the girl as she floats down through the abyss. This movie is one of those movies that just comes out of nowhere and never forgets how it started. It just kind of does. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is like an old school movie. We get one of the few female lead leads. We follow her through a few different situations including dealing with a very jealous boyfriend who makes a lot of sexual advances on her. The first half of the film is very boring and doesn't really have that much to offer. I'd give this one an 8 or a 9 out of 10 but I'm not sure what the point of it was.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One night, a girl named Sarah (Natalie Portman) takes a job at a sex shop as a "sex-positivity ambassador". At first this is all right until a young man (Timothée Chalamet) from an upper-class family who was a model in school turns up unannounced with his "girlfriend" (Marion Cotillard). They are both in their early 30s and have never had a romantic relationship. This, coupled with their mutual disgust for sex and what they perceive as a false sense of "empowerment", quickly turns into a series of increasingly embarrassing encounters.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    An overblown action film about a group of young teenagers on a bike ride. There's no sense of urgency to this film because they're not being chased around by people who need guns to be shot. The film is just a bunch of kids goofing off in a park, not doing much and not killing anyone. There are several memorable scenes, most of which involve a bunch young people getting together on a Sunday morning and getting into a lot of mischief in an effort to get drunk. The only memorable character is a teenager named Andy (played by Michael Rapaport), but he's kind of an enigma. I found him amusing and his antics were amusing, but the film's entire story was a bit of a letdown. If there had been a little more action this would have been good, but there isn't a lot and the characters don't really do anything, and the story has a fairly low emotional impact.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very poor movie which is full of plot holes, bad acting and a generic bad guy. There are so many things that are wrong with this movie that its hard to remember just a few of them. The movie starts with a character with a beard and a long moustache being beaten up by an idiot. He then goes to a place where lots of people are dying of thirst because water is not brought up to the river. This character goes to another place where there are many skeletons (that is all I can say about this one) and there are skeletons dancing. He kills a big monster and then goes back to the first place and is attacked by an even bigger monster. This movie is full with bad acting, bad dialogue and bad acting with bad dialogue. A big part of the movie consists of the characters going around in a circle, sometimes walking in a straight line, sometimes turning left or right. The characters talk as if they are on a talk show with one of the guests and when they are doing an improvised comedy routine, the people laughing in their faces. The bad acting goes on and on until the very end. There is no humor in this movie and the humorless plot means that the film is a complete waste of time. There's nothing amusing about this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe this was released in the 80's. I guess this movie was made on the cheap and the acting was awful!  I think this movie is a ripoff of "Jungle Book", and that should make me sad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this film was pretty bad and a waste of time. It had some good ideas but didn't seem very well thought out. It could have been better with a more well-known actor. The actors all appeared to be trying to look like their real lives and not their characters. They looked like people who could be found anywhere in a public place. I thought they were supposed to be different from their characters but didn?t appear to have much of a personality. I guess I should have expected that after seeing them a dozen times with a different person playing the part.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad it was painful.  It had some good acting, and even a few good scenes.  But the bad acting almost killed it.  And the bad dialog... Well, it almost killed the movie.  There was nothing great about it.                  I've given this movie 3 out of 5 stars.  The movie was just so bad there was literally nothing good about it to begin with.  I was glad I took the time to read the other reviews about it because this review is almost identical to them and almost the exact same thing happened to the character.  Maybe it was meant to be a metaphor for what happened to me.  Or maybe it was a metaphor about what happened after I quit smoking.  Either way, I won't be watching this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is what happens when you don't care for a character.  This was basically a story about a man who lived in the old Hollywood mansion and used to date the hot actress Jennifer Beals.  It was a pretty bad movie, and the performances were all kind of cringe-worthy.  They're all wearing old Hollywood costumes, and you can't help but think it's because they think it will make them look good.  So they do this weird gyrating act, with the same old people, and it looks awful.  I wouldn't call it a bad film, but it is a bad flick, and not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not sure about a good movie, but The Long Kiss Goodnight  was a great movie!  It is a well made movie with well drawn characters, funny dialog and a good plot to follow.  The music is nice and the acting is good, but it is the dialogue that truly keeps this movie going and we get to see them talk about their love at times, and some very awkward sex, like some of the actors were not aware that they were being filmed.  A good movie but it would have been better had they at least edited in the whole movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you were looking for a good horror movie, here you go. One of the greatest and most popular movies of all time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst horror flick ever made. So bad, in fact, that it's hard to make any sense of what is going on. The bad acting, the bad production values, the really bad special effects, the stupid story, and the dumb story are all in a blender, blended together, and then the result is that the blender just becomes completely useless. This movie should have never been made, it should have been called "A horror film that doesn't even make sense". There is too much bad acting to get through, and even the acting doesn't do much justice to these really bad performances. The special effects are just really bad. The "possessions" are just completely stupid. This is a bad film, and yet, I am glad that it exists, I don't like it, but there is no way that I am watching it again. I have found myself more than once, wondering if I am going crazy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about two girls and one of the two girls is a demon and I feel like you're supposed to laugh when she is possessed by a demon. Not only is the main lead character played by an evil demonic girl with bad acting in a demonic possessed girl. They get into all the silly fights with some of the other cast members and there are some things that should be left out that you don't hear a single word about, and even if the story does make sense, I can't believe that they could make an evil demon with bad voice acting. The acting is bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not really "fun" so much as it is a pretty damn sad film with a very sad story.   The film begins with a young man driving his car over a cliff in a beautiful country setting.  One thing you notice about all of these things:  This place is all in the family.  The son is on the side of the family that had a farm with cows and sheep and that the son's great grandfather built and lived in that area for generations.  And the brother (my wife) who was the only son of a farmer/carpenter has an "evil" (i.e. murderous) dad and a brother who was in the military in Germany.  When we see these things in the film, we can immediately picture a dark and lonely atmosphere with a lot of depression in the area.   I'm afraid that this film is a very hard film to watch.  In addition to the depressing and depressing things mentioned above, I think that the "villain" (in some ways) was not all that "villains" as he was portrayed in the story.   The film itself does not feel that great at all with its slow pacing, repetitive plot, and some terrible acting.  For example, here's a great performance by a very poor man, Robert Wagner, who plays the main antagonist:    If we are to believe the reviews and the movie itself, this is a movie about "the bad guys" and we are left wondering who the "good guys" are.    This has been a very depressing movie.  I don't know if anyone wants to watch it; it's simply too depressing to watch! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those movies that you wish you could get away from. You get a great idea for a movie. The writer had all these great ideas and they don't come together to make a movie that feels like it was made in 1985. It has a great script, but it fails to give you enough of a story that makes sense. The film is mostly composed of short segments and is mostly forgettable. It is hard to get a real laugh out of a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To quote one of my favorite lines of dialogue from the film "I would rather be dead than alive!" I don't really get the point of this movie. It seems that a man gets bitten by a zombie dog and is forced to go on a quest to find his dog, which he has lost. At least this was a comedy! I never liked zombie films, or even zombie movies with comedy, so this is a breath of fresh air. There was not a lot of gore or blood for that matter, and the actors were pretty good. It was not so much cheesy as it was not really "good". But it was still funny. If I were a zombie, I would rather die than live.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The most interesting thing about this movie is the concept of a character trapped in a machine. This is an interesting idea as you think about robots in movies of the past and they always end up in a very horrible way. But not this time because our protagonist, Mr. Smith (Tom Hanks) is saved by a small robot who has been sent to him to save him from his fate. That's how the movie starts and it seems like the movie will go on that way and not be that interesting. I was looking forward to some good action scenes as I thought this was going to be a great movie about a robot who finds love. However this is a movie that takes place in a large warehouse where a large robot was left. This robot has the ability to create things out of thin air and Mr. Winton (Tom Cruise) goes on a rampage searching for the robot that gave him his powers. Unfortunately for our protagonist he ends up having to face a large group of robots as well as the most annoying character in the movie, a robot called "Sandy". These robots do not do too much in this movie other than create a lot of chaos. The robots are all made up of various pieces of equipment from appliances to bicycles and the character Sandy seems to take a back seat in the plot. I think this movie was really well put together but didn't really live up to the promise that we were given in the original script.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    We have no idea why there are so many bad movies nowadays...   It's really the kind of bad movie where you have to put your hands over your face when you hear "Wooooo." We have no clue who is speaking to whom, how the camera is supposed to work and how the actors are supposed to act. This is a terrible, bad, terrible, horrible movie with a stupid, stupid, lame ending. And one more thing: I'm not sure where the heck this stupid movie took me. What am I supposed to do with that poor guy? I didn't like him at all.   No rating, but I would give it a 2 out of 5... if I could find it for free.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shame that this movie only lasts about 10 minutes!   The plot is terrible!  The movie takes place at a party where a bunch of people are having a little fun and there is a big fight breaking out.  The scene in the fight is so boring.   I guess they're trying to make the fight as exciting as possible to get the movie going but the fight never does get that exciting so it never gets past the beginning.  I was laughing and laughing but it really didn't seem to be that funny to me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this movie. I mean, I loved this movie and I really did. I was hoping for a fun and fast ride to get to see some action, and I got that. I liked that there were some cool action sequences and some good laughs and the character development. However, I also hated how the movie ends. I loved watching these guys on the run. I thought they'd at least get to the other side of the island to find something to eat, but when they get there, it's the same thing over and over again. I just thought, why not have them search for something more? Maybe a boat to sail away with. At least the other heroes didn't get to waste their time with stupid scenes. They should have stuck around to at least rescue one of the other guys. Then we'd have gotten to see them fighting, or maybe even fighting the enemy. Maybe they could even come up with something new to do. Unfortunately, this movie didn't have much to offer. The action wasn't much and it was too slow. I can see the point behind it to have these guys do some stuff and the movie seemed to go out of its way to not give a single thing to the audience.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies ever made and I've been doing this since 1997. I haven't seen this movie since my last viewing and I'm a little bit sad to see it again in a theater as I don't think I've ever gotten a bad "bad movie" out of me. In case you're one of those people who never watched it before: a few months back when everyone thought the worst movie in history was getting released, this movie was released and it was terrible! I was so mad that I could barely watch. A few months later it was revealed that the original producer was fired and the movie was retitled "The Best of the Worst". I remember sitting there one night and being frustrated to realize that this film was actually better than the worst of the 90's. I was really disappointed in that it took away the best parts of its predecessors. But then I went and saw it again and I couldn't believe how bad it was! This movie is so terrible, I would find it hard to even call it a movie! This is so bad, it was never released on video because it would never be considered "good enough" to be released on VHS. This is probably one of the most disappointing movies you'll ever see. I don t even care. It's just so bad. I didn t believe the bad parts were even really in there, I was disappointed when I heard that they would have an English dub because it seems like a very dumb idea to dub a bad English dub. I guess one could argue that a dub of an English film is worse than a bad language dub... or maybe, it is bad enough to make a terrible dub look good! A stupid movie, made by a stupid person who didn t understand what they were doing. I hate this movie so very, very, much!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While it was a tad odd to see the same director's fingerprints on several franchises, the most notable of which are the Star Trek movies (Star Trek II and Star Trek IV ), the one that truly surprised me was The Wrath of Khan (or Wrath of God depending on your definition of the term). As a sequel to The Search for Spock, it is an almost equal blend of the two, with some excellent character work in a story that is at its weakest when compared to the earlier film. The first half of the film is the same as in the first movie, with Kirk and McCoy going off to fight a Khan (a rather bland man who only really appears in the second film). The plot of this first part of the sequel is fairly typical of the franchise, but it is quite good and the best part of this sequel is the performances of both actors, who are clearly the best they have been since the original series. The action scenes are also very good, and the action scenes in this film are better than any action scenes from the pre-Spartan films. There is no real reason why this sequel should be the best in this series, and I have to say that while the other films in this trilogy are all quite good, this is by far the best of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never saw this movie, as I heard it was good in my class of "younger" writers. But I watched the trailers and was amazed at how good the acting is. Not bad, but not great either. I have to say I have seen some bad actors in my day, but this is a bad actor, like an actor that just wants you to look at them. I can only think it was because it was his last performance. The acting was bad, which is to be expected, when the movie is about a child with no direction. I was shocked.  The movie doesn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was an excellent first movie, not so much a horror movie, but a kind of mystery. I like mystery movies in general, and this one did not disappoint at all. The mystery aspect is handled in a very interesting way, like a detective in a high-tech crime show. It was a good thriller and I'm looking forward to the next one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was made so badly you can't believe that Hollywood is still alive.   All the movies that are made by Disney now have a bad voice acting.  My wife went to the movie last night and it was terrible.  One of the reasons why she didn't like this movie was the bad acting. What an embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The biggest disaster movie of all time has been remade three times already. The best version by far comes with a great cast and some great special effects. This one is even better. In the beginning we see what would happen if the US decided to bomb North Korea instead of dropping nuclear bombs. This would obviously create a terrible humanitarian crisis. However a North Korean soldier shoots a US soldier in self defense. It turns out that the soldier was in fact a spy. We then see the US trying to stop the North Koreans from continuing with this war effort. Unfortunately North Korea refuses to stop and we see them invade South Korea. Unfortunately the South is completely unprepared and we soon see an all out war between the North and South. The movie is not very good in the end. It seems the actors were simply too big for their boots and just ran out of gas. It was a boring and boring movie. Don't waste your time with it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is a simple story about an eccentric man with a heart of gold. Not much to say about this movie. A strange story about a man who is trying to solve a mystery of who killed his son. I didn't care for the story. There is no plot. There are some strange characters. The plot is very boring to me. I found it difficult to follow. There isn't much mystery to it. I feel that this movie could have been better if it was made by someone who was good at acting. The movie itself is boring.  A simple story with a good actor playing a very odd character. It is quite funny though!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie is excellent;  we have lots of cool space battles and the most "alien" appearance of any kind I've ever seen in the entire saga.  I actually found it quite disturbing that the aliens don't have any kind of biological structure to speak of.    I don't think I've seen such a complete waste of time before.  There are a few other things worth watching, but I doubt that this is likely to be in anyone's top ten.  2:10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had just read the last chapter, and I have to say that it was a very disappointing ending. But then again, we only get to see so much of the movie. The "wacky" character in the movie is really irritating, especially after watching the first two movies with him. And if there wasn't a really annoying part involving a character named "Toni" in the first movie, this one would have been much better. I also found the humor to be pretty lame, as though it was just an excuse to take the audience to a different time period. Overall this is a bad film with an awful ending. If you want to see something that is just very bad, I recommend watching this movie, or worse, watching the movie two times over!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved this movie. It was about a girl who went to visit her brother in a mental hospital. When her brother starts talking about a cult he was a member of, she thinks that there might be a bit of truth to it. She sees pictures of strange cultish figures. Her brother says that this isn't a cult but an "old religion". He talks about the old days in which the rich ruled over the poor. It is funny and has a very good story. However, the film starts off to bad and gets worse and worse. I had to force myself to watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie and I am not even kidding. It is a bad time and it is not even funny. Its all sad, there is really nothing funny about this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is my least favorite film. It isn't terrible. It is just so bad and uninspired that there's little reason to watch it at all.   As I watched the film, I was struck by how many times it looked like a kid's science experiment gone horribly wrong: The first half of the film is a series of strange experiments and experiments that don't add up. The film's protagonist is played by a boy named Charlie. Charlie is an incompetent child who does everything wrong. He's an awful scientist and, worse, a terrible person. Charlie thinks he's discovered the answer to the question: "What is man?" His experiment is to show that men and women can get along just fine without sex. It starts off well enough, but after Charlie makes an error in calculation and has to cancel the experiment altogether, all hope of scientific progress is lost.  The ending of the movie is also a complete disappointment. Charlie has discovered an "answer" to the very problem he set out to answer, and, well, it's some other "answer."  So why is a movie like this still being produced by 20th Century Fox?   Why is an experiment that goes absolutely nowhere supposed to be made into a film?  It's not even clear what the point of the experiment is supposed to even be.  Is Charlie the ultimate test subject? If so, why does he have to be a poor, uncooperative, unprofessional test subject in the first place?  Or is the experiment meant to teach us something? Well, I guess that depends on how much you find science fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was one of my all time favorite films, in fact it's a film that I keep playing over and over in my head until it wears out its welcome, and I find myself wanting more.   The story of Dr. Egan and his "experiment", which is supposed to be the world's most advanced weapon, has been around for more than half a century.  Egan has built a machine which enables him to alter the course of entire planets (by pushing the button), so that when it is fired, the planet disappears (he does this by using a bomb which, incidentally, was made in a different way but the concept is the same).   After it is launched, Egan decides it is time to start using it to destroy more planets than he had ever wanted.  The plot is extremely simple; Egan uses the bombs in a very clever way: by moving the planet around at the rate required to bring it nearer Egan's chosen target, the planets move back, so that once Egan fires the bomb, the target will move away and Egan will have a planet in the exact spot he wanted. After he fires it, the bombs will do the same thing to the planets (moving them back).  Energetic music and witty dialogue, which has a whole lot of humour to it, helps to make it a very enjoyable film (except for the terrible special effects).  This is a movie about science and technology in action, and it's also a great movie about the human condition.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the classic Batman (1966) movie "The Dark Knight" I immediately started thinking about the sequel and realized that it is as bad. But who am I kidding? The movie is a complete waste of time and it's a shame because even with a sub par plot and poor acting, there was still a lot of good things about the movie. The movie wasn't even nearly as good as the Batman cartoon, which is the reason why I consider it the worst of Batman's movies. What makes the movie even more pathetic is the fact that the director, Christopher Nolan, is not even capable of making a good Batman movie. He's as bad as the rest of them, and he doesn't even care about his own franchise. He just went on a crazy crime-fighting adventure, completely forgetting about the Batman character. The film is just a waste of Batman lore. It's just a cheap action-adventure story where the Batman never once showed up, which made it even worse. Even though I have seen most of Nolan's movies, I'm sure he'd never even try to make a good "Batman" movie. This isn't even a good movie. But hey, this is Nolan's movie so I guess he's entitled to it. If you're looking for a good watch that has great music and amazing visuals (that's what you're paying for after all) then it's okay. If there's a better "Batman " movie out there then you'd be better off going to see a different one, not watching this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A few days later, at the hospital, he meets an old friend (who has a beautiful house in Palm Beach), and the friendship is very strong.   In his room there is a book, the "Walden" by Henry David Thoreau.  The book is one of those long-forgotten things that people find in archives, in old libraries, at second-hand bookshops, by accident.  Thoreaus' main thesis is the way people use nature and the earth to create a spiritual experience. This is what gives us that feeling of being in a beautiful place, a place not controlled by anyone, not controlled in a world of men but, as I have said, a world that is created for us.  A friend of mine said something about Thoreuches that made my blood run cold. "He's not so much a scientist as an old-fashioned mystic," he said.  This is a little misleading.  But here is Thoreurus in "Waldo" in the middle of an afternoon on an island in the Pacific Ocean, with his dog, the cat and the dog's owner.  I am not sure he is being really "old-fashioned", but I am sure this is something close to it: we have a beautiful day, there are no men, only animals and the sea and the trees and water, we are on a peaceful island, and we feel like we are in a place where we can get away from it all (as we did, in fact, a long time ago), and I know that if he was to meet anyone who really loved nature as he loved it, it would be Thoreucy, and not somebody in a suit and a tie or a lawyer, because to know that a man loves nature as much as you or I loves nature is to know it has the power to heal our pains and our fears, that it is able to make things beautiful and beautiful things. I believe Thoreauer was a great man, and I am glad that I was born too early for him to have been able to find me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't feel bad seeing my favorite actress as a stripper in one of the most trashy films out there, nor did I feel bad watching the same actors do the same exact things that were done a million times in the last 25 years. This movie, however, was worse than any of the previous ones:   I don't want to write a bad review about the movie, but it's just too bad, because it is nothing more than a bunch of actors and actresses playing one character (it's almost like they are all in one room singing a song about a strippers career;  )    For some reason (or just because they can't get enough of it), they decided to put the most terrible movie ever made out there. It isn't even funny.   It's just boring.  I guess that would be the best way to describe it.  The acting isn't good either.  All of the bad things I just said about the film are actually good things about the music that is being used.  It was written by a guy who does a bad parody of the 1970s.  If you think the characters are awful, try listening to this film and see for yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that would normally earn you a zero in my book, and yet it managed to get an unqualified "F". I mean, it has every one of the things that I dislike about bad movies: poor acting, poor writing, stupid plots. But the worst thing about it all is how painfully out of date it feels as a work of art; like the latest in a long line of "classic" movies, it's the epitome of the American dream: a man with an empty house, a pile of money and a woman who will take only what she wants. It's a terrible film, but there's no reason to waste our time on it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  This film features pretty much the entire band - which is great - and a lot of other people that I'd never hear of if I was in their shoes.  The story is very different, the music is more upbeat, and they can go anywhere to do anything, but they just don't do it very well.  They don't really get the feeling of a world they're in.  I think the movie would've been better if it weren't so short - it's like you're stuck in an old fashioned carnival where nothing makes any sense - which doesn't help.  However, I do like the song "A Little Light" by Michael Nesmith - that's pretty catchy - so I guess that's something.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would like to end with a personal note:  It's interesting that a movie is called "A Christmas Story" that was made by a father and his four sons and that all this Christmas stuff is actually in the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed this movie, but it's a little silly.   The movie is supposed to be about a "poster boy" named Dolph Lundgren trying to regain his lost youth and fighting crime.  Well, he ends up getting arrested for a crime he didn't commit, and he ends being tried and convicted by one of the most idiotic, brain-dead, violent "justice" system's ever concocted, even though they have all the evidence they need to prove their claims of "self-defense".   If you watch the movie on youtube, you'll see him being treated almost as a hero, and a villain!   What's more, the people who are going to defend him have no understanding of self-defense or of how a criminal is supposed act.   It is a comedy.  And that is good, I think.  But this movie needs to be taken with a grain of salt.  I would only recommend this movie to a "comedian" with no imagination or an old man who was once a boxer.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm so sick of being forced to read about the "perfect" Japanese girl in a romantic Japanese movie.   It's so obvious that the girl doesn't think so and this is one of those movies that is trying to make out the girl is more than just a pretty face. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was nothing more than a terrible attempt at a sci-fi movie with a little bit of magic thrown in. What the hell was this movie trying to be?   The film opens with the voice of a dead woman saying "I am the first person to live on the moon and I am going to die on the earth again in a matter of weeks, after which I shall be buried in the Moon, there to be forgotten, and then revived in a distant future." In an attempt to be more sci- fi than that, it goes on to tell us that a young woman has been killed by a meteoroid and a "curious little robot" which is controlled by a young boy who looks a little like a little alien from an insect film. They then go on to show us a few other scenes of the robot being controlled by the kid, then it all goes to hell in a hand basket.   I mean, I guess it was "a little bit" of sci-   fi, but not much! I don't know where the director got this idea!   We get a little shot of the dead woman who is in an open grave and we then see a man with an alien face standing over her, which looks like a human face but looks like the head of an insect or maybe an ant. We then get some more shots of the little robot controlling the kid and we get some bad special effects (although this movie was pretty bad for 1982) and an explosion that is pretty much nothing more then a piece of debris being thrown into a small hole! Then we go to a space station where the two go to investigate a mysterious spaceship and are confronted by a couple of guards and the little alien who is controlled in some sort of flying machine. That's about it, it is just a lousy movie that doesn't even try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want a fun and hilarious sci-fi movie with great visual style and some decent performances, you need to watch "Intergalactic Road Trip". It's an action comedy in space where you're forced to drive from planet to planet with alien characters like Klyntar, an intelligent alien who doesn't really care about the planet he's on... until the planet itself changes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You're supposed to be doing your time in a prison, and then they break you out and throw you back in. Now, this is not a bad prison, it's a pretty nice prison. The staff is friendly, and there are no cellmates, but they don't like to talk about the horrible things that people go through in prison. They give you a couple of assignments, and send you out. However, you're not sent to do any work. It was supposed to just be an educational experience in a new prison. It isn't. It feels like they're just playing around with the idea of putting you on the prison payroll. Now that I have told you all that, let me tell you that there is a bit of a problem with the film. The first twenty minutes were so bad that I couldn't even get started. The whole time, I was just waiting to hear the next line "The sun's coming up in a couple hours, and it's going to be a beautiful day, so...", or something. And all I hear is "So!" I'm really tired after the first quarter hour. I just don't see the point in watching a film like that, because the whole film is kind of a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am an avid viewer of bad movies, and this was the worst I've seen so far. The worst thing about this movie is how much it sucks. The actors are not convincing, the plot is nonsensical, there is no suspense, the acting is weak, and no one in this movie even makes any sense. The plot is so bad that I'm really surprised it even made it to the big screen. I can't imagine how much of a headache it must have been to make this movie. If I ever find myself in the mood for a bad bad movie, I think I'd rather watch "The Last House On The Left" or "Cherry" (which is a better movie) and "I Am Legend" (probably the best movie they've ever done).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish I had written a review for this movie. It is not good at all and is not a very interesting film. The actors play the same parts over and over again without being funny, except for James Gandolfini who is great. If you like this movie, you will love that movie, if you do not you will probably hate it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To put it bluntly: this movie is terrible. This is a movie that was made with bad intentions. It has poor acting, poor story telling, poor plot development and a boring villain. This movie is an epic disaster movie. It was so bad that people hated it because it was so unlike anything they had ever seen in a comedy. There are some really good movies out there. I can tell you that this one is not one of them. So if you're looking for a good comedy, watch another movie. If you're a fan of comedy, I can't recommend a movie more than this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a rip off of Star Wars with an original storyline. In the beginning, we see Luke Skywalker as a pilot and a mercenary and a bounty hunter. He is trying to solve a mystery about a woman that is on the run from a man who may have killed a friend of his. There is a guy that wants to make a new movie (Star Wars) and wants to change the old ones. He changes the movie to a space opera but his new film is a clone of the old one. It is very bad. The characters are stupid and the acting is bad. I give this movie 2 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have ever been to a bar to drink some wine (or a beer, for that matter), you might have noticed that some of the guys are really quite handsome:  But this particular batch of men has a secret weapon:    His name is Michael and he is Michael Jackson.  And if you are unfamiliar with this legend, Michael Jackson is a very tall man (6'4"), and has the distinction of being one of the world's top recording artists:     He was an extremely talented child, who at the tender age of 12 was signed to a small music-guild and started performing.  At the age of 15 he appeared as a supporting member of the very popular "Billie Jean" tour.  In the summer of 1968, on the second night of this tour, a woman named Janis Joplin was killed onstage. Michael Jackson performed the following day, and on the third night he and Janis performed together again.  After performing the entire bill of the "Billy Jean" concert (one of the biggest concerts of the decade), Michael Jackson was asked to do a medley and play one of his songs, which he called "I Could Have Done Better".  For a little while there Michael was the main attraction of the stage. His hair was flowing down the side of his head, and he was very animated and expressive.  One of his best known songs "Dirty Diana" is about Janis, and it is very much a love song to a woman who never lived, whom he adored from the age he could remember.  But at the same time Michael Jackson had a tendency to go off and do his own thing, like any artist would.  He did a duet with Jim Morrison when Janis died, and also did an extremely strange, and weird show called "Love in Vain" where he was dressed as a clown.   And he was also the father of the young boy who would become an international superstar who was also named Michael Jackson, and who would eventually become Michael Jackson's manager.  This story is too complicated to get into, but basically Michael Jackson became very unhappy with his father, and left home to seek his fortune in London, in order to get away from his mother.  His father then sued him and won the case.  Michael Jackson returned to America, and returned to recording and performing. But the divorce, and the mother-son drama continued.  Now
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The original and only movie where a giant space ship crashes through the earth and lands on a planet with giant monsters that are like giant bugs that suck people into their mouths. I haven't seen this movie since it was released (and, not only that, I didn't even like it when I watched it in 1986). It was just a very low budget movie that was never made to be popular and it didn't do much except to annoy the hell out of me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie, although not as bad as some of the other films released in the 1990s, still has its fair share of problems. I loved the idea that the world was flat and the people, despite their physical limitations, were so incredibly beautiful, and their lives were full of joy. I just felt that this film was not a good example of how to bring a child to an action movie. There is not a lot of action, the action is not very good, and all the bad action scenes come from the action scenes of the bad guy that is played by Michael McKean. Michael Mckean as a bad guy? The last thing I expected from a bad guys. I thought the character was going to be something like Robert Duvall, but he ended up being just plain bad. In all seriousness, I did not like how most of the action was shot. The way they show people running around really slow and then running very fast is so out of place, and I would prefer something that was taken straight from a Disney cartoon than something that came out of a bad action movie like this. Even the ending was kind of boring, but that could have been changed in the editing. I did like it though, I think it had the potential to be a very good film, but it did not live up to its potential. This movie could have done so much better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I mean, come on, the movie stars the legendary, and one of all time, Jackie Gleason. That's right: the guy who played Andy Kaufman. If there's anything the movies have taught me about him it's this: he will never be what he once was, and he'll never be better than he's been. His "charisma" has left him with a few memorable lines in a few movies, but those few lines don't really make up for all the other bad acting, bad acting that he's given us throughout his long career. There was no chemistry between Gleason and Kaufman. There is no chemistry in this movie. And there's no chemistry, at all, between Kaufman's "characters." His friends are either annoying, or they're not interesting, or at worst, they're flat. He's constantly talking about being an old man, he's constantly looking to his friends for help, he spends way too much time talking about his wife, and it's all so incredibly cliche. You see, he says he was too old to work so hard to get his acting career going, but instead he spends most of his time hanging out with his old friends like Woody Allen and Woody Allen's wife. There's a lot of weird sex and nudity, and the last few scenes are just weird, but at least they weren't too bad. The movie also has one of it's worse bad guys, and at least he seemed to have a reason for being in the movie. There are also some pretty cheesy bits in the end, but it's not all bad, and there are a few good moments where Kaufman does a pretty good Andy Kaufman impression. All in all, not a good movie. Not a good performance. I would give this movie an R, but there was a good scene at the end where he looked like he was about to pass out, but that would have ruined it for me. Also, the title does not make up the movie's title, it's just a dumb joke. I thought I was going to see the bad movie until I saw the good one. I don't know what to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In fact, it is pretty much a rehash of the first three movies, the same kind of story but with some twists thrown in. I could understand the appeal if this movie was made to pay homage to the first Star Wars series, but in fact it is just a straight-up rip-off of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. You won't miss much.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's good that it's got only four people and a bunch of animals, but it still seems to have no story.   The animals are just thrown in, they are not animated, they don't say anything, but are clearly meant to be animated characters and they are pretty much in the same position as the characters of the "Wizard of Oz" who were the ones that were supposed to be in the movie the entire time.  In the end the four people in the cartoon are all dead, and they don;t even know how to fight, they're just running around like idiots. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the first 5 minutes it appears that these two bad guys are having a little fun at the expense of a good ol' boy like Frank: "That's a sweet truck!" They then proceed to do his bidding in the following scenes: Frank, at first, tries to get revenge on his kidnapper and is not so easy to catch. He's so dumb, we can't understand why he'd think to kill an old lady with her own car. He doesn't even realize that the old lady he is trying to kill is his stepmother: "Ah! Ah, ah, ah!... " She gets out of the car, "I'm so glad you're home." The young bad guy, then decides to kill Frank (after all, if he'd killed his mother, he'd be just one bad ass away from being the big bad bad). He pulls a gun out, aims it at Frank and tells him, "Take a good, hard look in the eyes of your wife, bitch! It's time for you to step back! " (That last line, by the way, sounds like a line straight out of a bad "Mad" movie. The movie just screams, "bad!") Well, Frank is a good guy and will not take the bait. Frank comes back to his car, drives away, and then his wife calls to him, saying, "The young bastard's back! Come back, Frank! You're not dead yet!" (Frank never did figure out that he was a bad guy who was in fact the big boss. Now he realizes he's the little boss and has to find a way to stop him.) "The two-faced son of a bitch!" he says. "Look, my wife won't be happy till the young bastard goes down!" Well, in the next scene, the young bad actor's wife tells her husband that the young good actor has run away. This is a great movie. At least it had a pretty good ending. The bad guy would've been more effective if he had just shot Frank in the legs and then run away to safety. This movie did not have enough to it to make a worthwhile "Bad" movie in any sense of the word. Not only is the acting so bad, the script is so stupid that it's hard to imagine any reasonable human being thinking this stuff up. It's the worst movie I've seen in awhile. (Kudos to the director, who really knew how
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just read the book, "The Unfinished Years: The Untold Story of the White House," by Bill Clinton. I was disappointed when the book was published. While it was an interesting story of a good man who just didn't know how to say no, it didn't add up to what I thought a good president would be. So much of the public image was built on Bill Clinton's success as president during the 1990s and the 2000s. It was the only time that Hillary Clinton was ever involved in a serious scandal and a serious political defeat. It's hard to get a good description out of a book about a very good man. I found some of the details not to be that interesting and didn't seem to support that the president could do no wrong. I would only recommend this book to the people who are very curious about what was happening in the Whitehouse while Hillary Clinton, the future First Lady, was busy trying to make Bill Clinton famous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not a big fan of "I'll Be Home for Christmas," but I'd watch it if anyone asked.  Not so for the next 90 seconds that's more of "A Christmas Story" with the old man singing "It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was excited to watch this movie because it looked so good! As everyone is saying, it's a bit slow, but good when it's happening. The best parts of the movie involve the action, which are all very well done. The only problem is, that as soon as this film starts, it just stops being fun. It's not really a bad film, but it's just very boring. You've got a good actor, but he doesn't do too much. The writing is so poor, and it's like the writer doesn't care. This isn't good film, it really is awful. It is very disappointing to see a good movie with so many issues.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is an absolute joke. We have a bunch of idiots who were given a gun and told to go out and make a little cash. I would like to think that there are at least a half dozen of them who are able to do so. It is a disaster.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The second installment of this cheesy genre is as bad and tacky as the first one.  This movie tries to tell you how a group of teenagers, who live in a remote community have to deal with the arrival of a group from a nearby town.  It's not very well animated.   There are some very odd dialogues such as one where they talk about how this is their 'home' and they get a little annoyed when you keep asking how they managed to get here.  In a different village, there is a man who, it is said, could not be persuaded to move off this little island.  He was, however, persuaded to do it.  Well, he wasn't, as the villagers soon discover.  There is also a few oddball characters here and there. One is called a 'loser' who is apparently in charge of cleaning the houses of the villagers.  Some of the lines in this movie are: - a woman in her forties is being carried by a dog - a boy has been given a pair of shoes by a woman - there are several things inside the box of a bird - a girl is holding a broomstick and a broom has fallen down her top.  The main characters in this film are: * A group of teens who live on an isolated island. * A boy called 'Tubby' who manages the village. * The lovable lovable boy who is never happy. * Tubby's brother, who is played by a guy called Harry.  I have never seen a film as bad as this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is like a high school version of The X-Files and The Matrix, as if it weren't bad enough for it to be a remake.  So, in a world where the humans were once ruled by a race of telepathic alien robots, the humans are now slaves to an evil alien race who enslave the humans with the technology they designed and made with the telepathic robots.  This movie is filled with weird and silly events, aliens, aliens... and it all leads up to a bad ending.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one is as bad as it gets: a very bad and cheesy sci-fi movie with a huge plot and an unrealistic sci-ish plot. It is not just a movie with sci- fi elements, it is a bad bad movie.   It has a huge problem with bad bad dialogue, stupid bad jokes, bad bad aliens, bad dialogues, and bad bad music.  In addition to that, the dialogue was pretty bad. I don't like how the characters always go off on a stupid or stupid joke. This movie is not bad by itself, it's just a bad poor science fiction movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is about a man who was born without hands and legs, and has no arms or legs himself. That being said, he is a master of martial arts and karate. One day, he decides to get his arms and legs back, but they are not very useful. After much effort, he manages to get them back after a couple of years. But he is not too happy about it, because he is still a useless person.   This movie is not very interesting. The story is not bad, it is just an excuse for a martial arts fight. This is why it is so badly made. You may as well have taken the movie and made it out of plasticine. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First off, The Crow is not funny, it's violent, cheesy, and completely predictable. It's just a bad, horrible movie made for the 90s that nobody could care less about (well, aside from the original Crow himself, who, I suppose, should be really amused about the recent remake). I think it may be the last time I actually payed money to go see a crappy movie. I just hope this movie doesn't turn out to be a sequel to a really bad movie that I found on TV years ago. If it is, it'll be the first movie I ever get to see on the big screen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good movie, but an awful adaptation of a good book. The acting is okay and the story does a lot of things right (as does the book), but the book's characters are the best. There's a beautiful and terrible thing happening together; there's a great mystery; there are strange creatures. It's all very well done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'll try to be brief. A bunch of aliens visit Earth and the first thing they do is attack the planet's infrastructure, starting with the water supply. It quickly becomes apparent that the aliens, or at least their leader/villain, is the world's greatest water purveyor. Their plan is to drain the planet dry and then colonize it with a "New Man". As he gets out of the ship to see what all the fuss is about, he finds a strange looking creature looking like a human but made of some other kind of organic stuff. He takes this alien to his home and there they have a little boy. The child is the new "Man", which is apparently how the aliens intend to refer to him. The two of them live in peace and harmony, but things take a turn for the worse.   The new man grows up and becomes aware that his new home is home to other alien races. He also becomes aware of the evil plan he has been ordered to carry out. As he tries to stop it, he begins to hear the voices of other alien children who seem to know about his father, who is also the new Man. The new Man is aware of this and tries to go to the "Old Man" (who is in a hospital bed) to warn him about the danger he is about to face. Unfortunately, he's told by the new man to keep silent and that if he is to be destroyed by the others, he is his only chance of stopping them.  , if you can say that I didn't like this movie. It was boring. I hated the characters. They were all one-dimensional. It seemed like there was no point to them, they only existed to be killed off. The plot, again, wasn't particularly interesting, even though it appeared to be.   (I have not seen any of the sequels, but apparently they are not much better, nor are the others. I'll have to look them up. They're all the same, or close to it. What are they? A bunch more aliens come back to earth and try to conquer it. They invade the water, they invade the power grid and they invade everything else. It's all just a bunch of space-fliers heading for the planet, and the planet is too small to protect. So everyone has to sacrifice themselves and it's all done in a single battle. I didn to see that movie, and I wouldn
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A story about one man's descent into insanity.   I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, it's well written and told, it had a cool soundtrack which I loved.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A "bad movie", for me, can't be good, I don't want bad movies. Bad movies only spoil good ones. I don' t want to see a movie about bad people doing bad things. So I decided to watch the movie with my family, and I couldn't make it! It was so slow, so boring, and it never got that good! I hate to say it because I really want to like this movie, but, I couldn' t do it! And if you don't see it, don' really want, or have ever wanted to see "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly", I don t know what more to say!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie quite a bit since its release and I thought it was a fairly decent enough movie. The action scene was pretty exciting, and the story was just a little bit lame. It was hard to take a movie with so little suspense. It's a shame that this movie had to be a comedy, but the comedy wasn't very good, and they didn't really try to get the humor done well. I guess this movie would have been better with one or two more people in it. If the movie was shot in black and white and shot by a real actor, I think it would have worked better. The ending was pretty cheap.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It looks like a poor man's Indiana Jones.   A huge boulder lies where a small one should be, and the movie looks like it is in a hurry to get on with the story.  To be honest it is not a bad film at all.  It does have its share of funny moments.  What else could you ask for?  It has a lot of great images that really make you chuckle.  They will no doubt make a great addition to anyone's collection.  This is a film that any true Indiana Jones fan should see, or at least a good excuse for getting your feet wet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The title may be misleading because it's not a bad film; it's an entertaining film with many wonderful moments. But the bad parts of the movie are pretty bad. A man and a woman are forced to stay together in a cabin after an airline crash kills their entire family. The cabin is freezing in the winter and the two men have to struggle to find clothes that will keep them warm in the bitter cold. The film is full of humor and very entertaining. In conclusion, this is a fun movie that will warm your heart.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't even good, it's worse than bad.  The acting is bad and the storyline is boring.   I don't get why anyone would put themselves in this type of environment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie to be very disappointing!  The characters are all one-dimensional, and there are so many of them.  Some are "good guys," others are "bad guys."  It's just all so boring.  The movie takes place over a week at a college retreat, and a bunch of students go camping and doing other "fun" things.  All the students are talking about being "good girls," and being "chivalrous."  What the heck is going on here?  There are some "fun stories," and some "bad stories" and one long monologue from the "bad guy" about what he's going to do to the "good girl."  I had a bad time watching it.  I didn't like it at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If a movie has an annoying female lead, or a bad male love interest, or just plain ugly characters, you might as well call it a bad time. But this movie just wasn't bad enough to ruin your evening. It was boring, tedious and just so very, very cheesy that I actually laughed my ass off at one point. I have no idea how someone as unoriginal and unoriginal as James Mazer (Crispin Glover) could turn a small, local movie theater in a town of about 100,000 people into a major movie star. If his acting isn't as bad as it sounds he should give up acting and go to college. But even the film's creators couldn't make it more boring. The only reason it doesn't have a 0 rating is that it does have one redeeming feature: Crispin Glover is great, and he looks a lot like Chris Farley! You are not supposed to like a guy who looks like that, but it wasn't a bad film at all. Maybe that's why it went straight to a #1 Best Picture nomination. I could have watched it to the end but then I would have missed the chance to see a movie that wasn't awful. A terrible movie, and that's a good movie. But you should never go to see one when you're supposed to be in the middle of a movie in your local town. I would rather eat a whole pie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A story about how a man becomes a superhero. The film has some of the most unappetizing acting and a script that is not very compelling.   There really is not much to say about this film.  It's a boring story about a man who goes into the superhero business but, instead of becoming the next Superman, is only a poor man who doesn't want to wear a cape and the only thing you can say about the acting is that it's terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say that The Incredible Hulk is awesome would be an understatement. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been under constant construction since the start of The Avengers. First it was Loki and Thor. Then it was Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet. Next came Loki and a host of new enemies and some old friends. And we're finally at it with the latest incarnation of the Hulk, played with manic glee by Bruce Banner. It should also be said that the new Hulk has a lot to say and I'm not being facetious when I say that he's an incredibly entertaining character. There are some moments when The Hulk is genuinely hilarious and I thought, "I wish I could be that funny!". However, the rest of the movie is a little too dark. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who felt that The Avengers has become a little preachy with each subsequent entry. It's a good movie and it's been well worth seeing many times.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a year in which we all witnessed the worst of humanity the sad story behind a tragic tragedy that occurred at the Boston Massacre (Boston's 9/11) in April of 1999 really made my blood run cold. My sister and her husband were returning to their apartment on the evening of April 9th from an out of town trip in the fall of 1999 when a cab driver, Thomas Cusworth, had just pulled up. The cab had been in an accident earlier that evening. Cusgood had been a very nice guy and the two seemed to have a very good time. But when Cusrews cab drove off it was like the movie, "The Last Temptation of Christ," or perhaps a good old fashioned western with two cowboys and a lone rider riding a saddle. The riders' names were John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. The ride took them about 20 miles north of Boston. The next thing we knew were loud explosions, a gun going off, and the whole town was in a panic. The only survivor was John Wayne who was standing in the street in a cloud of dust covered up in a blood soaked t-shirt. In my opinion Cushew was a good guy and an even better actor but somehow his cab got hit by a bomb from the very moment he pulled up and had to do everything he could to save his passengers. I can't believe how a driver and a passenger would be so lucky that no one was killed in an attack like this. This was an evil, cowardly attack on innocent civilians. If the Boston police had gotten there earlier the victims would still be alive. John Wayne, Robert Mitchums, and all the other victims were probably out looking at the sun and doing something to enjoy each other's company. John would have seen this and would have been in a good mood thinking, "hey, why don't we all go to an old fashioned Boston Pizza with my wife and we can drink some wine and enjoy a nice old fashion evening in the sunshine with my sweet wife" The last time I ever saw my sister and my wife is right before this tragedy occurred. It was only a few days later. I guess she and the kids were feeling the heat and decided to go out. And for a change she didn't find John Wayne standing in a street in full military uniform. But then again why would she look for him in a scene like this? A man can dream, I guess! If I thought it was bad enough after
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've come to expect that when some "expert" comes along to describe "The Man Who Fell to Earth", the end result will be something like that one guy who goes into a bar to get a drink.  After telling some lame jokes about aliens that go "Ooh Oh Oooh", they leave to return to another planet where they have a very interesting alien.   It is about a giant space spider that is about 1/4th of a mile long.  While talking about how the spider eats human beings for lunch, the spider starts talking about being eaten by a very large lizard that comes out every day and sits on a throne.  Then the lizard comes out and gets all its fur ripped off.  The man is so impressed by the spider that he thinks,  "Oh, wow!  He's a real giant!   How big is he?"  It turns out that the lizard, being a lizard, is about 10 feet long and eats about 3 humans in about 1 year.  When the lizard says "No!" the man says, "Oh well, it's a start" and goes back to drinking and talking about the lizard.  Now, I realize this movie is pretty lame but the movie is kind of fascinating.  I really like this guy.  He is so much fun to be around and it's so funny watching him get his ass kicked.  His name is John Fowles and he's a "science teacher" in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a really bad movie.   The most important part of a movie is the ending.  But that's all I can say about this one.  It is all about the way the hero of the movie, a young woman named Lina, is forced to work as a prostitute. This is an extreme case of prostitution and it just goes downhill from there.  She starts working at a brothel and the other girls come in to pick up clients.  Once there she starts playing the part of the whore for the other customers. This involves having sex with a bunch of guys, including a very old man.  This one is just awful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a poor excuse for a movie: it looks good, but nothing really comes out of it. It is a lame excuse for an action movie. There is no story, or action, or character development, or anything, really: it is just a bunch of people fighting, and occasionally laughing. There were so many silly and awful scenes throughout the movie it is laughable: you might as well have watched a movie from a 3rd grader's room: there are scenes like this all over the place: a girl in a bikini goes for a ride in the rain; one character is a woman who has a long history of eating people (they don't get eaten, they get cooked), this one happens to be with an old man who eats a lot of people; a woman on her period is trying to go into a bar; a car is going down a hill, there is a guy in it (who is supposed to be the good guy), and the girl is on it. Also, the people who are doing all the fighting, are playing the video game "Grand Theft Auto V," so it is kind of a "Video Game, a Bad Movie!" There is a scene where a bunch (not necessarily all of them) of thugs are being chased by a cop, and they are being shot at by a sniper. It goes on and on with this nonsense: the movie is about as bad as it can get, and it tries very hard to be funny: it's not that it is bad; it's just that it's so bad it actually tries to be very good. If you were looking for a good action movie, then this is the movie for you: you will be entertained, and you will not want to throw out the DVD! I give it one star out of five.

This movie was made in 1972 and has an interesting premise: a young girl finds out she has a twin brother.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's been a long time. My wife, a fan of both Indiana Jones and Star Wars, had gone to see the Indiana Jones sequel. I did not think I could get behind this one at first. After all, we had seen the original (and that was fine) and the sequel is not really an Indiana Jones film. It is more like a Star Wars film. This is not a bad thing though. It has the same sense of adventure, which you can't really say about all the Star Wars films except maybe A New Hope. It's just very different. The first Indiana Jones (1978) was a pretty good movie. The second one (1979) was much better than the first but still not as good as I would have liked. The third (1980) was kind of a let down too. But then in 1981 came the Indiana Smith film (1981). This movie is really the one that makes the Indiana trilogy and a good lot of other Indiana Jones films so good. If you want to see an Indiana movie, don't miss this one.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It seems like we all have to agree that the opening scene of The Sixth Sense wasn't a great one.  I mean come on, who the hell thought that the world would one day have a killer that can see into the past and see into other people's dreams?  As it turns out, not only has there been a killer since the time of the sixth sense, but he has been stalking his victims since they were children.    As for the people we saw in the opening minutes, who are they?   One of them was a girl who appeared to be about 12 years old, with a mop of bright red hair that was so reminiscent of the movie character, The SixthSense character, that the crowd roared as if they were going to get something like that.  And what's this about a "slimy, oily creature"?   The slimy, oiled creature was of course Bruce Willis.     It was also implied by the movie that he and his friends were part of a team of supernatural creatures (i.e. vampires, werewolves, ghosts) working to catch someone (the main character) that has been out of touch with the outside world.  But it was a pretty clear indication that Bruce Willis was the lead actor.  In fact if anyone should be a lead actor, I think Bruce Willis should be it, although the whole point of The Six-Senses is that most people don't realize it.  It is also mentioned by the main character that he has had a vision of a dead girl.  After she died, she was brought back to life and they all have the same dreams.  Who knows if they are dreams, and it might be a nightmare, but who knows?  The Sixth-Sense  gets better from there, though, as it shows the other four characters coming back to their senses and realizing that the killer has already escaped and has been living an elaborate life for a long time.  There were some pretty good performances, especially by Bruce Willis, but I have to admit that I wouldn't really recommend The SixthSENSE to anybody because the plot is so cliched and dull.  The movie would have worked better if they had tried to make it a little more supernatural.  If I were to have one complaint about the movie, it would have to be that it would seem to be taking the "fear" factor too far.  At
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love this movie. It reminds me a lot of the great American westerns of the past. I think the best scene in the movie is the scene where the "hero" gets his first big "kill" and realizes it was an illusion, like that old western in which a group of outlaws try to capture a beautiful young woman. He then tells his girlfriend that it was a lie the entire time, that he has a lot more to offer, and the movie ends with a wonderful music cue by John Wayne. I have already discussed the film in more detail in my review for the movie "Shenandoah". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well... I am sorry for the long post...   For those who do not know my life story, let me give you a quick primer:  At the tender age of 12, my life changed forever. After spending the summer with my parents, we traveled from the west coast to the east coast to attend an annual "fest" in my hometown of Olympia, Washington.   My father was a successful local business man who had a son (not my biological father) that was 10 years older than I.   The trip was a fantastic adventure.    The first year we would go up the coast to visit family and friends, the second year we moved up the east to spend the summer in New York City where I received some excellent musical training and also made new friends.  And then, it all went downhill.  We stayed up until 4 in the morning playing in the streets.  There is nothing quite like a night on the town with a young musician.   Our last night in New Yorks we had some company in town who brought us back to the hotel in the middle of the night.  So when we returned the next day we spent the night sleeping on the hotel floor.  At about 5:00 or so my parents woke me up because they had found a corpse in the lobby.  After we had gone back to sleep they woke me again. This time they told me a story about a lady who had been murdered in the hotel room of a very wealthy man.  This gentleman was so outraged he had a group of men armed with a rifle come up to the front desk at the hotel and fire off a few rounds into the lady's head.  The story went on to state that the man then proceeded to kill the police officers who arrived at the scene after the lady had been killed.  Our parents were aghast by what they had just witnessed... I suppose it must have been something we would have considered rather unusual, but it really had me thinking about the possibilities in our lives.  For about two months I was really depressed, it was getting to the point where I thought I was going to commit suicide.   My parents had tried and tried to get me to seek help, but I refused to see any doctors.  They finally gave up, took me to see an endocrinologist and my parents told me that it was time to try getting help.   So in late August of 1977, we finally went to see a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting much more out of this film than what I got. The film, with its high production values, is pretty good. It's a very dark film, but that doesn't stop the audience from being entertained by the film. The acting, while not very good, is very good. The directing of the film is very interesting. I would not watch this if I had a lot of free time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a bad film. It is a very, very good film, and I do have to say it is pretty good. It's not perfect - I mean, it's not even near great. There is a big, over-the-top villain (who is very good) and a villainous, oversexed character played by Brad Pitt and a scene that is more than a little too sexy for even that "mature" film. But the movie makes up for it by having a great script - it is witty and original and quite a cleverly written action movie. And it does have some good special effects - lots of stuff blows up, and a lot of it has a good sense of humor. I also like how it's set in England - and I don't know why this is surprising, but England is the best movie set there by far. There's a strong sense of British humor and a definite sense of the country's history and culture that really brings it all together in a way that is pretty satisfying. If you like movies, if you like Brad Pitt, if the rest of the movie is good, you'll like this one. If not, well, that's fine - there are plenty of movies out there that have better script, better acting and a better plot, but this is a fine movie and it's sure to make you smile. It may make you giggle a bit - but in a good way.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only negative thing I had to say about this movie is this: I am not even sure why I am watching this movie. It has a lot of sex in it, not really in any sort of interesting way. The whole thing just comes off as an extremely boring movie about a girl who finds herself with an incredibly strange friend (I'm trying not to use "friend" as a synonym for "weirdo" just to sound weird) and a strange couple with a history that, from all appearances, is really messed up. I found the sex scenes pretty interesting and even the fact that there is no "good ending" is, to me, somewhat refreshing. The movie had everything that you would expect from it: the main character (who, I hate to say it, doesn't have a lot to offer and isn't even really that likable) is a girl and a weird friend, her boyfriend is crazy and has a crazy mother, there are weird things happening, and then there's the weirdness with the mother and the boyfriend's crazy mom, which just makes things that much weirder and more confusing. There's so much going on and no end in sight that I honestly could not make heads or tails of it. It's just so, so, SO boring. You can't explain why the main characters are the way they are, what the mother has to say to them or even how she does it. I didn't even care about the boyfriend because, well, it's probably an accident or something, and his mother is completely crazy, so I don't know why I bothered with him. There are also a lot more weird-looking weirdos throughout the movie who also just don't get much screen time to say the least. The best part of this movie was the ending and how it was filmed. It was pretty weird. It looked like a really old movie and it was hard to understand what was happening and what was supposed to happen at all. The weird music was also very hard to figure out. When the credits were coming up, they showed the same piece of footage from the first movie and cut to another, different part of it and then cut again. It seems to have no real connection to whatever is happening anymore, but the fact is that it just is so messed up that it's impossible to say what is happening and how. This movie could've been better. It wasn't bad by any means, but it certainly was not the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie.   It was so bad I can't even call it a movie. It was just a bunch of actors who were playing characters of the same name at different times.  It wasn't even funny.  I have to wonder how much time this movie had for shooting.  At first I thought there was a shooting with the bad guy in the wheelchair that the bad guys put in the window and it seemed to be a shot.  But it wasn't.  The whole movie was just one long shot of them putting a wheelchair in the windows.  Then you see the guy coming out of the window with a gun and all the baddies are jumping up and down and shaking their heads.  No joke.  So I got off on it.

This film is a movie about two school bullies and the boy from the other school who have a lot of fun playing around with them. It ends with a joke that I couldn't even follow. The acting is bad.  The only other good things about this movie is the soundtrack.  It's not bad at all, but it is unlistenable. This is one of those movies that is so bad that it is actually good.

The movie starts in a beautiful location.   When you first sit in the movie, you realize that this is not a movie like the ones that you are used to.  I do not mean to pick on the movie for its awfulness.  The director did not put a lot of effort in creating a great movie.  It is just bad.  This movie could be seen as a rip off of the film, " The Little Match Girl.   It tries to copy some of the characters of that movie but does very little. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to give it a bad review. It is an old, boring comedy from the mid-fifties about the family of a wealthy banker. The family is unhappy and has a number of conflicts, among them the daughter being very beautiful. This is the one thing this old comedy, about a banker's daughter, could have done. In the early part, she does an exaggerated turn and dances around to the music. I like it, especially after the second time I saw it. Then, in a third time, there is another musical number. It never worked. The music is very long and a bit clumsy, but it was good for a change from the other jokes about the banker's son. The actors never got a chance to act, they were all too tired to be anything other than deadweights. The scenes they did do were just dull. In one, the banker is having lunch with one of his secretaries. When she asks him for a business loan to help with a family crisis, he replies by saying the company is losing money because of the high interest rate. Then he says she will not be missed if she is not working. Then she is asked to give the banker a report about some potential investments. She is asked what is in it for her, and she has to say "I would like some of your money." And the rest is history. This was the kind of thing one does not see any more. I guess I will see it on TV if I have anything to do with it next time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is full of ridiculousness. Not just silly. Ridiculous. It's just so over the top. And stupid. It takes place in a city, that's inhabited by a bunch of crazy, yet still very realistic, characters. And the people that run the city aren't bad at all. They're just bad at how they run the town. I mean seriously, the guy who's mayor is the most powerful man in town. He has an army, he has a navy, he's got a fleet. He's a rich, old man who lives in a fancy house in a nice area of town. And he wants to rule the whole country. Then suddenly he's forced to do something. He can't just stay in power forever, and he's afraid of something bad happening to his beautiful wife. So he has to leave town. There's a couple of girls who want to run the place (they're pretty cute). The townspeople (including an old man that's trying to stay young) are all very excited. It seems as if it would be a lovely place for a young couple like them to raise a family. But the older people don't like the idea. They don't want their wives and daughters to be ruled by a young boy. That would mean the old people will all die, which is a scary thought. So the townspe people have to decide what to do about it. There is only one thing for them to decide - the old woman should stay in the city. The girl would have to follow her husband to the city, where he would lead a normal life. But a normal boy is not a good boy to be ruling this great city. But how do you prevent him from doing what he wants? What should the town do? It's all a matter of who has more power. The mayor, who can always get what he needs, or the city council, who isn't much better. So a young woman, who's a bit mad at the world, wants to run it. It doesn't take a genius to see why this girl's idea of running it isn't popular. It involves lots of danger, lots of people that are willing to help her, lots and lots of running. But she's a brilliant girl, who has always been a bit different. It gets complicated when there are three or more people who want her hand in marriage, because there is a certain someone who is just absolutely, completely nuts
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is an example of what happens when we make people laugh at a bad film. First, we had the ridiculous idea of a movie about aliens that talk in a dialect that sounds like a foreign film (but not nearly as bad). Then we had a film that had the best part as the director. But then you have this one:  Now, a movie where the main character has a son. What? I thought this was a movie starring a female lead? That's all this was - a movie in which the main cast has nothing good to say. They are all basically the same. The father's dead. The mother is a horrible, lazy, greedy, ungrateful, self absorbed, whiny, spoiled, selfish, and mean woman. The only person who's interesting is the son who's more interested in getting girls than getting a job. It's so bad it's funny, the only reason I was willing to sit through this garbage was just to see the reactions of everyone in the town. It was like watching a group of people who didn't know how to act in a theater that was just being rented.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has all the right features in it to be an above average film for anyone who enjoys a good western at a low budget.  It has a decent cast that includes Gary Farmer (Cannonball Run) and Robert Taylor (Raiders of the Lost Ark), although in my opinion it's still the film that they were best known for.   The story is simple but not as simple as one would expect in a western.  There's some pretty good acting here.  The first third is the best and a lot of fun, then the film gets a little more ridiculous at the end which can be annoying.  All in all this is a good flick that could serve as a good introduction to westerns.

It's about as boring as the title suggests.  The first half is about her trying to get information out of the professor. The professor wants her to take a bath after she's made love to him.  He does.  Then the professor is killed by an axe.  What really interests me is the fact that the guy who killed him was not just a psychotic murderer.  His wife (whom we all know is not a very good actress) is also a very bad actress.  I really like the idea of the young woman becoming the wife of the killer.  This makes sense from a logical point of view, but is a horrible concept.  If it was a real woman, then the killer would be a man with a history of mental illness.  A woman, however, who is obsessed with and totally obsessed with the killer?  I think we have a problem here.  There are a lot of plot holes.  One: why is the victim named the dead professor's son?  Two: why would the professor have so many weapons?    Three: why did the professor and the victim go to the beach the day before he died?  Four: why does the movie keep telling the victims story backwards?  Five: why do they keep getting killed?   There is also much that makes little sense: the professor goes to the victim's house for no apparent reason; the killer is the daughter of a local doctor; the victim doesn't realize he's in love.  Even though the film is only about two hours, it feels like it could be a really long movie.  At least if it wasn't such a terrible mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen quite a few bad movies lately, and this is probably the worst of the lot. This movie is based on the true story of George Orwell, who was a British journalist in Russia during World War I. Orwell was not happy about this. The war was awful, and the people were terrible. Orwell decided he would try to make a good movie out of the events. Orwell tried to get the people to cheer and get the war to stop. Of course, they hated him because they didn't want him there. He thought maybe if he was a Russian writer, he would get more respect.  I don't understand a whole lot of what he is saying in the movie. What happened when the war was over? He was arrested, tortured, beaten, even killed, just because he tried to do something about what had been done to the Russian people. I guess if you think you are a writer, you will get a lot more respect in Russia if you write about it. That's a pretty pathetic movie for a real-life author, but it is better than a lot of the things that come out of Hollywood nowadays.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably the most awful horror movie I have ever seen in my life. Every aspect of the film is so horribly wrong. In the opening scene, we see a little child wandering around a forest looking for some food. There is a very obvious attempt to scare the audience and this is done very well. It has the kind of creepy feel to it that is hard to describe. The poor child is found by a little boy with a knife and is told to go play somewhere else. After a few seconds of trying to leave, the little boy tries to stab the child to death, but only manages to get cut open. The little boy seems to be a completely deranged person and the entire time, it is like watching a person who had been drunk all day talk to a child about how to kill the children. The child looks like it is having a lot of fun being stabbed and laughing maniacally. There's nothing more to say about this movie that is not horrible, terrible, disgusting, and sad. If you want to see a child get chopped up, raped, murdered, and eaten, than just go watch this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was terrible. We are introduced to a very stupid character named Steve; he's a little bit of a dimwit that only seems to get less dimmy as the film progresses. The film takes place in the mid 80s, and we start off with a young girl named Katie who tells us she's been "possessed" by the spirit of her grandmother. But when she wakes up she's not really Katie. This is a film that will be remembered for the most disgusting scenes imaginable, so I'll save the most unpleasant for last. When Steve finds Katie, he has no idea that she's the daughter of a wealthy businessman who has taken over a small country property, and he's pretty surprised when he learns that his grandmother has made a comeback. But this is a very odd film for it's time. Most of the characters are very unsympathetic, and the film was full of cheesy dialogue and bad acting. And there is nothing "funny" about the film; the film is full of violence, sex, and depravity. Katie starts to play "The Game" on Steve to get him to let her stay at his place; she even attempts to take her clothes off and she's only succeeded in getting Steve angry. It takes quite a few scenes to get to the point where Katie and Steve start playing. They're both rather uncoordinated, and they seem to have trouble understanding each other's speech, but eventually they figure it out. The problem is that the sex is pretty tame and hardly anything new in that regard. At least in the beginning it does look like Katie will be able to do a little better than Steve when it comes to sex, but she really doesn't do much better than he does. She seems to be an idiot that knows almost nothing about sex, yet she seems to like it. She also has a very short and rather uninspiring career, which is all that she is really good at. She goes to college to get a degree in business, but then she becomes a housewife with no prospects or any skill at all. After about 30 minutes of Steve "playing" with her, she runs off screaming. The next day, Steve takes his girlfriend (a woman named Lisa) to Katie's house to pick up some clothes that her mother had forgotten. Lisa seems to have some kind of secret, but it's not until the end of the movie that the film reveals exactly what it is. It's the "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have always been a big fan of "The Wizard of Oz".  But even in its early days, the movie had some major issues.  One was that it was written by the same guy who brought you "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy.   Another issue was that the characters in the movie are all very similar to each other.  The story is about a farmer who can make a cow go up a hill.  While the farmer tries to make it work he gets into an unfortunate situation that is similar to that in the "The Lost World".  At this point my review becomes a little more technical and that is because I don't know if I'm making the movie all too clear for you or if you aren't quite understanding it.  If you are not familiar with the story you can watch it for a brief bit on YouTube or just google it. The movie is essentially about a man who decides to go up to the top of a hill and try to make the cow cross over to the other side.  He does this by taking a piece of wood from a tree and with some string wrap it around the cow.    He has some trouble, but at last the cow is able to cross the hill and he gets the prize.  There is a few small plot points about his family which was not very interesting.  But then we get into some of the more unusual creatures that live on the top and below the hill, including a giant that looks like it was put together from a car and a giant bee that looks nothing like a bee at all.  A giant spider that looks more like a cross between a rat and a tree.  Then we have the "trolley problem" in which the farmer has to try to choose which trolley is going to carry the cow, but that is nothing compared to the trolley problem in another episode of the same series, this one called "The Great Oz". In that episode the characters are told that they will have to cross a bridge with a very dangerous obstacle.  They try to cross it, but it is very narrow and there is a little switch in the middle that they can't get to.  So they decide to get to the end of the bridge and jump off to try and land safely.  When the characters do this the bridge goes down and they are both killed instantly.  Now this problem is not at all difficult to solve, but the fact is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing The Muppet Show, I wondered why there are no Muppets who are more politically correct than Kermit the Frog, such as the ones that appeared on The Dick Cavett Show.  But the Muppet that was most politically incorrect in that show was Kermit, the one most interested in how the ladies dress, which he always did without apology. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a boring movie. A typical '80s movie about a boy who is in love with his grandmother. It was all going so well until the second half when he finds out that her husband has also died. His mother, who is a very nasty woman, uses her connections to get a new man (named 'David' by the family) to take over her husband's job. It does not seem like much of a sacrifice for David, but this is not the real issue. After all, the old man is only an afterthought. The family goes on a weekend holiday where David gets to spend the weekend with his grandfather. This is where the story takes a turn for the worse. After going to the beach, David goes to the zoo. David meets his grandmother and there is no way he could be more impressed. He takes her on a tour of the zoo, goes outside to see the elephants, and takes off his clothes to play with them. The rest of the movie is David, his grandmother, the giraffes, the monkeys, and the apes. As I said, it is boring. The only reason the film has a bit of a plot is that David wants to go to South America to look at one of the world's largest dinosaurs. His grandmother makes it clear that he can't go because it is too cold. The movie ends with David taking off his shirt and getting ready to go, when suddenly the elephants get very excited and the giraffe goes'moo!' The rest is just one long laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is something truly terrible about this film, which is a shame, as I was excited to see the new "Crazy Stupid Love" for the year. This movie is a pretty silly and somewhat silly affair, which isn't a bad thing by any means. I am always a sucker for films with a love story and here this is just that. The love story between a young woman and a crazy man is very cheesy and completely pointless to the story, in which he is a completely out of it. He is almost comically out of touch with the world, which to me makes him more endearing, rather than the crazy guy. I was also annoyed at one point when he is going to propose marriage to the young woman, but instead of proposing he pulls the ring off his finger with his bare hands and just stares at it. If you are the type to like the old school love story, I wouldn't recommend this one as much as a romantic comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a very good film. It has some good moments, some bad ones, and a good ending, but not a lot else going for it. There are a couple good scenes, but overall the movie is just a boring mess of pointless violence, sex and nonsense.   The best scene is probably when the two characters find out they're both from the same place, and both want to get off to the same nightclub. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The fact that an entire town would willingly give their bodies to be used as living toilets and toilets for human meat to eat?  Why would someone do such a thing?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is about as bad as it gets.  This story was actually pretty good. The main character is the daughter of a famous actor.   The actress gets into a car accident.   She survives the crash but is left in a coma for the rest of her life.  The plot is a typical thriller.  But it's just so lame.  It's such a dumb thing to do.   Why not have the main character and a doctor help the actress get back to consciousness?   She would be an incredibly famous actress.  Then you could have a movie about a star, starring her daughter.  I just don't see why such a lame movie gets made in Hollywood.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason it's a bad film is because it was made by Michael Bay and it's not a bad flick.  This is one of those "you can take the band out of the bar but you can't take the bar out of that band" movies.    The first time I saw it I thought it was a spoof of bad movies, and the second I thought, "Wait, isn't Michael Bay a parody of the bad movie genre?"   I watched it as a kid, and it was not a great movie, but it was funny!   There's a reason why it's one of the most poorly liked movies ever made: It's boring and it takes itself too seriously, and I have a lot of respect for Michael Bay. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To the casual viewer, this is an odd blend of two different genres: horror and comedy. Both are presented in a manner that makes you feel genuinely scared and entertained as the plot unfolds. The plot is a familiar one; a family member has died and the family finds themselves having to leave an idyllic idyll away from their home. The problem is that once the family leaves the idyll, they have no real clue where to go. There isn't much dialogue, but the film makes up for it in the visuals. This is an Italian film shot with black and white; a stark contrast from the color schemes of the movie's other characters.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this a while back and thought it was the one. Then I saw the other one, and now I am a complete connoisseur of the bad ones. I also had a great time at a screening of the original with my daughter. The ending was so cheesy, yet it was so sweet, and that makes it even more endearing. The plot was so poorly thought out and written, but what can you do? There was no other way.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is pretty much all the wrong things at once; the wrong kind of "science fiction", the wrong sort of "sci-fi", the right kind of science fiction - a kind that is entirely un-dynamic and wholly un-fun.   The "sci"   There is actually an attempt to create a realistic  future where there is a vast array of technological advances that will eventually lead to the construction of a very powerful fusion reactor.  The thing is:  If we take any of the predictions of this movie seriously, we should expect to see a fusion reactor in our lifetimes.  For example, the fusion reactor has been built in a lab in Spain!  There are other examples as well: a computer in the future which has a "brain" -  which is a computer that runs on the electromagnetic fields of the earth  a computer which can communicate and read and write with other computers and other computers  a machine which produces energy that would make the sun go supernova if it were used for heating and cooling a large number of buildings  a nuclear rocket which will take us to Mars   That the movie is set in a future where fusion is the future   is a pretty important point, one that does not make a very good movie.  We have a movie, which has the title "A World in the Making", in which the fusion engine looks like the part in the car that moves when the transmission is jammed and the accelerator pedal is pushed in the wrong direction.  This is a thing that is real. It is not as cool or as impressive as we're all led to believe, and to some extent it actually looks dangerous.  It is a real fusion reactor and the movie makers try to pretend that it is not, but it is pretty clear that a fusion engine can and will kill people by overheating and exploding, just like it has done countless times in the real world.  Why the people in the movie think that fusion reactors will do the trick when they will not and never can   should come as no surprise: all of the technology in the movies comes from an imaginary future which could never be realized without the technology, and that future was all created by Hollywood.  They know exactly how the technology will be used, how it will look, and where it will lead.  To pretend that a hypothetical future can be invented and realized in the present is simply a fraud.  Perhaps the movie producers
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Not a bad flick, but I wish it could've been a whole lot more than it was. I don't think it ever could have been. The dialogue in a movie is funny, at least for the most part. I enjoyed the dialogue more than I did the film. If we ever get a remake, I'm pretty sure there would be a lot of the funny lines from the movie to be included in it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is not much here. This movie is about a guy with a good wife (well, she's not very well-endowed). He goes to the movies and gets pissed off by all those fucking men and woman. He then kills some of them. Then he gets his ass kicked by the cops and goes into hiding. When the movie gets finished, the wife gets raped by a cop who was supposed to help her. I don't know if the wife was a real whore or not. The ending is a little silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie of the year    Not even worth a 3 minute preview   I'm not sure who was more shocked: the cast or the producers.   One minute I'm watching the movie, and then out of nowhere, I hear a woman in a bar singing about a crazy, crazy man.  I don't want to go out there.  This movie is not funny.  It makes my blood boil because they keep using this stupid, silly woman and every one in it is trying to find a way to get a piece of him.  What a waste of time   It's just another Hollywood rip off   Don't make me watch another movie like this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not that I don't like movies:  I really do.  I think it's pretty cool to sit around on Saturday nights in your underwear watching movies that you didn't pay for.   I'm sure we all watch movies at least once a week, and if there's one thing we all seem to agree on it's that watching movies in front of an empty theater is a bad idea.  One thing you can't say about a movie that isn't already being said:  They could've done more with the ending, but I think that's more because they were so rushed with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To the folks who hate it, here's a film where two brothers, one a car salesman, the other an actor in the movies, get stuck in a time warp and get married to a princess. Yes, a princess from the time of the dinosaurs, and yes, she has big tits and she wears a necklace. She is the one person the brothers cannot stand, and it's not for the slightest reason. I can't think of a more terrible film. I have not seen this film in over twenty years.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a woman who is very good at what she does, but she is just too damn happy at this. The woman is named Lucy Lee, and she has spent most of her time living in a very secluded cabin in the woods with her cat, her husband, and a bunch of cats, most of which are dead and some which have died and have gone to heaven. Now Lucy goes to church every Sunday and is really a very good Christian woman. She is about eighty years old. This film is set in the early 20th century and is very interesting in the way that it depicts the way in which the Christian faith worked, and the way people worked in such societies. This is probably one of the most depressing movies that I have ever seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My dad, who's had to watch too much action on television, decided he wanted a different kind of movie. I don't know where this movie got its inspiration but it has some of the most exciting action I've seen this year. You see a guy who has this bad-ass-looking gun but it doesn't do a thing. The police come in and he gets out his gun and then he fires a round into the air and it goes up over the cop car and hits the head of the guy who was supposed to have taken the gun. It hits the officer in the head and then it goes over the wall and hits another cop but misses him. In the next shot we see it shoot across the wall of the police station. It's an exciting film and I'd recommend it for anybody who is sick of all the action films being made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The title of this is "The Devil's Advocate" and I suppose if you are an atheist or not, you might not be able to understand much of what this movie is about. I was at the premiere a couple of years ago, and I was a little surprised when a lady, dressed in red, and carrying a crucifix in front of her, began to speak. In her defense, she did have her reasons. She said that Jesus Christ had asked her husband to allow her to be his disciple and take a redy of his life. Now that is a lot of bad news...I suppose we should give the lady the benefit of the doubt...because, you know what...she had a lot to say! It is said that the devil made a deal with Lucifer. If the devil had gotten everything he wanted in this life, the devil would have killed himself. Now, it is said the devil got as much as he could, and most of it was evil. Satan had an angel of light and a demon of darkness, and the demon was very smart! He knew where to find people so the devil could kill them. Lucifer had an assistant called Michael. Now we could have a battle of good and evil. The demon got Michael's attention. Michael, in his arrogance, had his staff ready. Lucifer asked the demon to come up on the roof, and after a few steps, Michael got tired and said, "No, I can't, I'm full of the Lord." Then the demons told him that "it is going to be a good day," and that he would get his revenge. When Lucifer tried to get back into the building with Michael, the demon tried to stop him. Lucifer got Michael to jump off the roof into the middle of the road where he was run over by a bus! The devil had won! And then he told them to kill Michael, then put him in his place, and that's just what he did! The angel of mercy went down the street to tell a couple they were getting married! Now if anyone wants to see how badly a movie can go wrong, just try making up a story like that. I guess that is just the kind of film The Devil's Advocates is. It is bad, and really bad at that.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never met this "character" in my life. I've read the book and I saw the movie, and for the life of me, I could not see him as a man or a superhero. There were so many times that I thought I was watching a bad soap opera or an evil cartoon. I'm sure this movie is an excellent effort by Hollywood, as they have made movies about superheroes before, and they will make others, but I just can't see this guy in a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a typical Disney movie for children.   While it's a fun little story, it doesn't have much real character.  I don't think we should be surprised at Disney becoming less relevant in the movies of the late 80's and early 90's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is filled with bad acting, bad music and bad acting. It all comes together to make a very bad movie. I would love to see the original movie, it is so much better. I do not recommend this to anyone but I will probably tell everyone I know it and I won't tell anyone it was bad.  I have seen it. There is no way to deny that it is terrible. There are no memorable characters; it is just a bunch of actors trying to act as different as possible. There were times I just wanted to scream at it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have a bit of a bad habit of seeing any film I can get a hold of that's even vaguely sci-fi or action-packed, and I'll try to write something that isn't a review or a review-within-a-review, but more of a personal statement about how I felt watching this movie, not really a very positive one. I thought that the plot of "The Predator" seemed promising, although a few things went wrong. I didn't understand why the military had to kill a child if it didn't pose a threat to them (why the military needed to know that), but I suppose that's a good thing. I think the best part of this movie was the ending, although I didn.t like the ending all that much. The movie didn't have a very clear ending and it seemed like the Predator just kept running around, and he seemed to kill everything (not like that makes it any less good). I also feel that the whole movie looked like they used a lot of recycled and recycled sets (i.e. the building where the Predator is trapped) and it really looked like a big pile of junk, which is a little sad. Overall I thought this was an interesting film, but I really didn't enjoy it very much. I'll see it again, but not necessarily for the Predator.

This is an adventure movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's some great special effects throughout this, but it's a very weak idea. It's about an alien who comes to earth, goes through some trouble and then disappears. But a woman is found in the ruins and is taken to a hospital. She's very good-looking and she has strange powers. She can make the bodies of people go away, so they don't get infected. She tells the police about the alien, who is going to come to earth again, and she tries to get it banned. So the police set out to catch him. But then a crazy man named J.G. Jones pops up and takes over. Then she tries some stuff to get rid of the aliens, which don't work. They kill her, and the aliens come to life and try to eat her. Then the men who found her go to heaven and see a woman who looks like the alien. There's a scene where she tries for one last time to give her power to the guys who saw the alien and come back to earth to warn people. But she gets shot in the head, and a lot of people die. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, the two best guys are working at a restaurant called Munchkins and the place looks like it could have been lifted from a French bistro, with the old man sitting in a corner eating a glass of beer and the old lady in a big blue dress drinking a glass and laughing. But of course they make it look real, because all those old people do. They even have a puppet show for Halloween and they make a whole family of Munchkin zombies.  I wish you could have seen this movie as a teenager. There are all kinds of people in this movie: kids, kids with big hats, kids without hats, a couple of bad looking people and kids with bad looks who are dressed like they are a gang from the 70's. This movie is a fun, silly movie about a bunch of kids in a restaurant. I guess what I like best about this movie is the fact that it is just so silly.  If only I could bring a bunch more friends to this movie.

That was good news, but the real story is that people are going to be dead on 9/11.  When you have a system like this, you can't predict where the next one is going to come from.    It seems inevitable that some of these buildings will collapse completely because of some kind of energy released by the debris, and not as a result of fire.   At this point, there is no possible way to stop this from happening.  If the government is going for this, they're going to spend about $1 billion doing it.  And there is a lot of rubble left in the buildings that is going be a problem if the fireproofing fails.

We don't see a guy from Mars fighting some giant lizard that can come from outer space. It's too bad that this was supposed to be a good movie.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I'm guessing you're familiar with the movie "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"? You should be, I think it's a decent enough movie (I'm sure it's not as great as it looks; it does suffer from a certain clunkiness, but then, it wasn't made for the big screen) and even a decent one for the small screen, too, with a script that is surprisingly good (a good part of it is based upon a novel from the mid-70's) and a script director Nicholas Meyer (who directed such other good things as "Barefoot In The Park" and "The Sting") did a fine job with.   The story involves a little girl (a lot of girls, really; I'm sure there's more to come, in the form of sequels and such; in the meantime, you can try the movie and see for yourself; it's all very good fun) being sent to Starfleet Academy in "The Final Frontier"; when she goes, she's almost immediately assigned to the bridge, where she finds a fellow-student named James T. Kirk. Kirk is "the original," and when he's off duty, a lot of the female cadets "turn up their noses" at him, and the boy in question is often "the little red dot" in the male-dominated environment. Eventually, however, Kirk meets a girl named Leila, who's also "the red dot."   She's apparently the last of her kind and a "shaken" one, though she does get along okay with the other members of the crew.  From left: Leila; Sulu; Uhura; Leonard Nimoy; Montgomery Scott; and James T Kirk.  (  They're not alone:  The cast of characters are just as well-drawn as you'd expect them to be:  In addition to Kirk and Leila (who appears as a young version of herself), the cast includes:  Uhura (Linda Hamilton); Sulu (James Doohan); Sarnor (Derek Jacobi); Scotty (James Darren); T'Pol (Nichelle Nichols); and Chekov (Walter Koenig).   ( Not that it matters anyway, because there's no one with more sex appeal than James Doohan, who played the part of Kirk from 1966 to 1969.  If you're wondering, he's got the good look of a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a movie that should be required viewing in every grade school movie classroom.  The movie is a terrible adaptation of an actual book called "The Scarlet Letter."  A man named Ned Kelly is wrongly accused of a murder and has to pay a large sum of money to the relatives of the woman he loves.    This is a film of revenge.  This film is a horrible and violent depiction of the horrible crime that occurred and is the only film I have seen where the murderer is killed and not just executed.  There are scenes of torture of the victim.  I don't know why this movie is being made anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    At the end of   The World of Sleep   the title is said so many times it should probably be in a warning somewhere. I have seen   this and   many other   low budget horror films and  it   has   it   all  . It   has   its   moments  , its   scares   and  and its  horror   but its    bad  !  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't get any pleasure out of watching this movie. It's awful and boring, with very little to it. I don' t get how people can stand a movie about this guy with a name like that. No one in the movie can play any instrument well, but that's not really that bad. I'm not even sure it's an action movie; there's no fight at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish they kept going with the silly character development, I hate to be a "rat" but there is no point in wasting so much time on that when there is so much action to watch, I would give up and say no more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just finished this movie.  First of all, I am in love with those tiny little feet.  They are just so cute and cute and so cute!  Oh man.  I love this movie and I loved the ending.  It made me smile and I am not even a fan of the Disney Princess movies.  This movie is really cute.  And I am so happy that Disney decided to make a Frozen movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A classic film set in the American Deep South with all the trappings. Some bad acting, and it's all set in a small, run-down motel on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi. There are no great characters, no interesting plot, but it is the classic "black and white" Western and if you like this style of film then you will not be disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You're looking at the movie version of the novel. In a way it's a good read because it's written by a young man who has no idea how to write. This is not a bad thing but the character development is pretty bad. And the ending is just pathetic.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Tyrone Power  was great in this movie. I would like to take a moment to point out how stupid these people are. I have a feeling that in Hollywood, they don't give a s**t about the story they tell. It's just a movie that stars a guy in a suit. I get the feeling that they would do much better if they cast a real "acting" man in the role. It might not be a great movie, but it's really fun. If they wanted to give the characters more depth, they probably could have. All in all, a fun movie and definitely worth a watch if you are a fan of action or action-adventure films.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a shame that the movie doesn't do anything at all new to the art of horror filmmaking.   And we already have a pretty decent film with     The Thing (1982), so that's not a lot of improvement over there.  There's not much new about this movie, but it's the director's first film in over twenty years so I suppose it's fitting that he didn't reinvent the wheel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a really good movie.   I think it was the biggest disappointment of last year.  What are the odds that this would happen to a movie with this much talent and such a high concept?   The director is one of the most talented directors of the last few years.  I would have loved to see a whole new story with a new villain and a new side to our hero.  Unfortunately, I was just too cynical to enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was boring from beginning to end. The story was stupid and didn't have any emotion. The characters were nothing special. The plot seemed like a cheap knock off from an other movie. A few scenes are used for cheap shots. The special effects look ridiculous. No special effects. No music. If anyone has seen "Batman" and thinks they need a new director, well, they are going to be sorely disappointed. This movie could have been made with any other actor in the roles. A good actor would have come in and given this movie a good shot.      I give this a B- 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very bad movie from 1985 which doesn't deserve a review. It is bad and ugly. It's like a video game for people who don't know how to play. I didn't know what was going on during the whole movie, but I watched it and found it boring. There was a lot of talking about things that were obviously going to happen in the movie: the main villain died of a broken heart (which he had a lot more of than it should have been, I thought), the heroine was having problems, etc. It just was a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so un-necessary to the plot, that it doesn't deserve to be seen. I was just watching a movie about the American Civil War. And, yes, I got so upset that the hero was being killed that I had to leave the theater.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very lame movie. I have not seen this movie in years, but I remember watching it then and this is about as cheesy as it gets. As one of the characters, Tom Hanks is a man whose love is almost boundless and his devotion to his wife is so great that she will do anything and everything, and will do it to the full. That being said, Tom does not show the same devotion to the woman that his wife shows to him. This movie is about Tom's quest to find love and his quest to learn a thing or two about love. There is a part in the movie that is very funny. The part involves a little girl who was in love with Tom's son. The little girl is told that Tom has died. She comes to the conclusion that Tom is a ghost. The movie ends with the little girl saying that Tom Hales was the nicest man and she hopes to have a real man in the future. (December 15, 1996)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a piece of crap in every possible way. If you wanted a bad film about a crazy old man, with some silly dialogue, and a pretty good plot, then this is the one. I never want to watch this crap again. The acting is bad, and the plot is stupid. The movie is full of lies, and stupid things are said. I am not joking when I say this movie is bad. I was disappointed with the poor acting and the stupid plot. I would not recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing to remember about "Fantastic Voyage" is that the movie that came out the year before had almost nothing to do with the one that came before it. If you had to choose between "Goddard's World" or "Spartacus" (and I will only pick "Sparcus" because it had more twists and it was based on a real event), I'd probably pick the former. I would have much rather seen a movie about the lives and exploits of a group of Roman citizens than about a rag-tag bunch of Gaulish farmers. There are no Romans in this movie; there are no Gaulish peasants (except for the Gaulish village that the Romans have been stealing from). If there are any Roman heroes, they're probably a few old people who are suffering from amnesia and the occasional illness. This is not a movie you should go to to learn what Romans did. You'll probably want to watch "Gods of Egypt" instead. The actors were good but the sets were tacky. The movie doesn't even look like a Roman movie. It could be one of those "Romanesque" movies that people get confused by. Don't waste your money, and don't bother watching it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those movies that people will like only if they are really bad at movies. It was all about a girl who lived with her dad for years until she was twelve when the father had an accident and was left to care for his young granddaughter. I think her mom should have let her go to college.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not a big movie nerd. I like "Titanic." I like the songs. But it didn't make me laugh. It made me want to hang myself. And I like a good villain. I also liked some of the movie's other actors. Not a star. But an actor to watch. My favorite thing about this film was the opening scene. It had an original feel and it wasn't corny. In fact, I'm amazed how some people hate it. Some people like to see the dead. Others like to watch a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I expected to. It was not bad, but definitely one to skip on your vacation! This one had a bunch of actors playing one role or the other, and we don't get any real connection between the three as far as the plot goes. The movie does not show us anything that we haven't seen before in other "Crazy" movies, and it really doesn't feel like this movie is trying to be something new or unique or new at all. I don't know how many times I have watched this movie and it seems like it could be in every movie that is made nowadays. Don't watch this movie unless you want to feel like a kid at Christmas and have no one to come with for a party.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie after seeing "The Exorcist" and was shocked at how bad it is. I thought it was going to be better than that! The actress is hot! If you haven't seen "The Devil's Rejects" then go and see it. I would suggest this for a laugh!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part about this movie is the soundtrack: it's so good you'll almost be embarrassed for thinking you've actually heard "Dirty Harry" or "The Running Man" in a movie. But don't be embarrassed: if there ever was a true "Dirtiest movie" (it's not that bad) then it's this one. There's a lot of trash here, and it doesn't matter. It's an entertaining and, at times, amusing look at crime in a city in turmoil. This movie is as good as it is depressing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of people don't like this movie, but it's a classic horror film for me. I love this film. It's scary, the acting is incredible and the scares are just so good. If you think this is some cheap horror, you'd be wrong. This is a real classic horror movie that I'd recommend to anyone that likes scary movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't like this movie and it's a waste of good movie making material. It tries a few things that are kind of cool at first, and a bit off, but then you figure out that they are all variations of the same thing. It's just bad. The actors are not good enough and the actors playing the bad guys are not enough to make you believe that they have a story in them. If you are looking for a good story with good acting, read a book. I don;t believe anything that this movie says. I wish they could have made it a movie of The Twilight Zone. It would have been a hit!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing so bad that it must be made into a good movie.    I don't give a movie this low a rating because I didn't like it.  It is not that a bad film can't be made good. It could, and that's what I believe this film does.  To give the film a bad rating is to take into consideration the fact that this film has only one objective: to make the most vile movie that has ever been made.  And as long as that is the only thing that the film is going for, then it has a chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a horror film nut and I am always surprised at how poor of a movie "The Orphanage" was. It had its moments and had an interesting script but for the most part it was just plain awful. The acting was atrocious and a few of the gore effects did not help the movie at all. The cinematography was terrible and even though you could see the action the poor camera work was distracting and really didn't do anything to help the film's poor rating. It is not really a horror movie and for that reason this one will not get a positive review.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It would seem that the idea of a woman being forced to suck a big dick and play with it is too bizarre for even the most crazy man out there.  The acting is bad, the writing is lame, and there's not much to see in the movie other than that.  It's not even clear that we are supposed to be entertained.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those movies that, once you watch it, you don't really want to watch it again. The movie is so bad, so completely unoriginal, and so incredibly stupid that you'll have to laugh at it from time to time.   The plot is just so wrong that it almost doesn't bear thinking about (in fact, I have to go back and look up the plot because I can't find a single thing that is worth talking about in this movie).  The whole movie consists of a bunch of animals playing a game and the leader of the animals (who I'll call Bob for convenience) is trying to beat the other animals by throwing rocks at them.  The whole game seems rather silly to me, but I guess that's just me.    Unfortunately, there is more.  Bob gets tired of the game and decides to kill the other beasts with the rocks, but one of the beasts, a wolf (I'm not being facetious in calling him a wolf) isn't having it.  Instead, he decides to climb a tree and go for the leader.  When Bob is not looking, the beast climbs up the tree to grab the leader and then climbs back down.  Somehow Bob still manages to miss and the beast ends up climbing the tree for a second time. And that is where the movie begins to get really silly.  At least it is for the time being. The leader of this animal group, who I'll be calling Jim, has a terrible case of depression and the other creatures in this group are constantly beating him up and getting on his nerves.  Jim is also having an affair with his coworker and the affair is not a happy one.  I don't know how the actors were able to portray this scene but it is so incredibly awful that it is hard to even pretend it's funny.  You just have to grin and bear it.   Then there is the bad joke.  It involves a snake and a cat.  What the movie doesn't get a good sense of humor about is snakes and cats being able to communicate in any way possible (no pun intended).  It's also pretty clear that the actor who plays Jim does not like him.  So, this movie consists not only of a bad joke, a bad plot, and a bad acting performance but also of a poorly written movie.  But even though the movie is bad, it is still entertaining (as you might
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was filmed in a crappy old church in the South of England. You would never know it from the "high tech" set-ups, but in this "Bollywood" movie about an American Indian who returns to his ancestral land after spending most of his life as a British officer in India, there are plenty of explosions and martial arts sequences (and at least a little bit of romance) -- but there is not a great deal of action. The "Bagnet" series is full of the same kind of clichés as most Hollywood serials: the bad guys, the good guys, and the good guy who must save the world from a terrible fate. The movie is, perhaps, not much better than the television movie series. As in " The Little Man From The North Country" (1960) the movie seems to be an attempt to capitalize on the success of the "Babylon 5" television series, which was canceled after seven episodes because the pilot was seen by a smallish audience and the network was in financial trouble. And since no other series was produced after the one that was canceled, the movie was created in order to attract an audience by having the good Indian in charge of a military force that has not the slightest chance of winning against the aliens. In fact, the only good thing about the movie is that the Indian character is so lame that one could almost believe that he had been brought up by a pack of wolves, that all the good he has done is all because he has been stupid enough to join a group of men that are the most stupid men ever to roam on earth. And the only reason the "bad guys" want to take over the earth is because they think the earth needs a good fight.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was hoping this would be the last "Avengers" film I'd ever see and the reason behind this is that it was the last movie made to the scale of the first two "A" pictures, which was a pretty big step up. The story takes place in the near future where a "bio-mechanical man" (that's how he's referred to in one scene) decides to try and take control of all of the superpowers of Earth by having them all battle in an arena to determine who can best them. And the results are predictable: there is a lot of talking, a lot about science and a lot going on in the background of the story, but they don't have that much to do with the plot.   The only reason I would bother seeing this movie is for the action, and I found it to be pretty lame. I know, I know. I'm a sucker for CGI and for "A-grade action", but there just isn't much there here for me.  The only reason the movie is good is the acting. I just can't do it.  The action was pretty bad as well.  But at least the movie was fun as I got to see more of the cast, which includes the always fun Samuel L. Jackson.  I also liked how they showed how the bio-mecha were created, but not to a level that I would be able to describe them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are a few reasons why I think this is not a particularly good movie, and I'll go over them in the order in which they occur. I can't help but feel a pang in my stomach seeing a film that features children playing in the streets with guns. This would be a good idea for a movie about a small town with a big gun-toting mob. But I don't buy that it would be successful at that point in time. This is a film made in the 1960s, but it is so bad I can almost hear the director, James M. Cain, saying "What the hell is wrong with this film?" It's bad. Bad! Bad!  In order to get back to the plot, we find ourselves in a town where the main character (played by Kevin Bacon) is an ex-marine who is also an accomplished car painter and craftsman. The citizens have been using their guns to shoot at one another over who will be the next mayor. But we don't see much of any of this shooting. It's all done with paint guns. At one point we see Bacon driving a convertible, which would make him quite unique. He's got a new paint job on his new car, but the other guys don't seem to care. We also get a couple of short speeches from the Mayor of the town. He talks about how he was elected for a reason, and then he tells the mayor, "I think you'll find the reason has been taken away." I didn't see this, but Bacon must have a very short fuse, because he just sits there and just does nothing.  This whole town is ruled by a crooked police chief (played with great passion by Walter Matthau). He is one of the few good guys in the film, and he's also kind of a jerk. He always seems to be trying to get Bacon involved in some shady business deal. He even tells the policeman who's chasing Bacon in the back of a police car "I'd like to see a man hit on the head in his own car." Bacon just does what Bacon always does. He goes with the crowd.  In addition to this, I thought this is a pretty bad movie to have a scene about. I don the film at 3:30 and then it cuts to a gun fight a few minutes later. That's it!  There's a few funny scenes, but I didn the entire film without laughing once. I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's an interesting movie with an interesting theme, which is to say that a bunch of kids are in the woods to kill a badger because it's cute.  The badger gets them all into a wrestling ring.  the wrestling match doesn't really involve much.  One of the guys is a little slow and it appears to me he's supposed to be an amateur wrestling referee.  The kid has the worst personality ever and his lines are always pretty bad.  A good wrestler is a really good wrestler and this badger doesn't do it.  He just kind of stands around, sometimes getting up and sometimes getting down, and never seems to want to do any real wrestling or anything.  And then they're attacked by another badger!  This is a bad idea and a bad fight.  They probably should have killed them all by now.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you love horror and gore, this is the movie for you! After the first 5 minutes you will be thinking you've been taken for a ride in a car. The rest of the movie is just pure, unadulterated, gory fun.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is terrible. I mean terrible, truly terrible. But not only that, it is such a shame to watch a film made by the likes of John Milius. That alone would be reason enough to avoid this and not mention how terrible it is at anything. You get two characters, Billy and Mike, who are both in the Navy and one of the crew who is to blame for the shipwreck. They are both captured by pirates and are tortured with extreme abuse to the point that one character finally snaps. Their capture is announced by a pirate ship which proceeds to destroy a pirate town before the pirates and their crew arrive. I really feel sorry for Billy, who is forced to eat dog meat and the torture he has to endure. His wife is forced into an incestuous relationship with a sailor with whom she is forced at gunpoint to have sex. She eventually escapes but that does not stop Billy from killing her. The second character is Mike. He is a rather pleasant looking guy and is also forced to have incestuous relations with a local woman. He does so in the middle of a fight when she is stabbed by a stray sword. The final character is played by a character called "The Monster" and is played as a monster for no reason. He attacks the crew for no apparent reason and is shot and killed. What is even worse is that the crew is made up of mostly sailors.  What should have been an interesting movie turned out to be an even more boring movie. I have no idea what Miliuus was thinking when he made this film, although I guess I should understand his reasons if he was trying to tell the story of the USS Indianapolis. I guess, he thought it would be good to show a pirate crew trying to find a way to escape a captured ship. What I found interesting was that they never made any attempts to escape from the ship. The crew stayed right where they were and, while the story made no effort to explain why they couldn't escape, I did not mind the movie one bit. I guess this is the worst John M. Miliuss film that he has made.

First of all, you will be shocked to learn how bad the acting is in this movie: it is not really bad, but it is definitely not great either.  But the acting that is really bad:  The main character, a former professional wrestler named "The Rock", comes back home and finds his wife dead. He decides to take a job in the wrestling ring again and become a successful and respected wrestler again, which is exactly what he does.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an absolutely terrible movie. It has nothing to do with the original comic, the only thing it has in common is a guy named John. The only funny part in the movie are the three dogs, and then one of them gets hurt. The movie just goes on and on, including one scene that I find completely offensive: A child is being raped by three men. The three men take her to the woods, and beat and rape her to death. Then they rape her dead body before tossing it in a large lake. It is absolutely disgusting, and totally off-the-wall, but I have never been so disgusted by a film in my life. I wish my life could have been like this movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the third installment in a very disappointing series.  The first two movies are very bad, but not quite like this.  It is just too bad.

It just made me sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you love to watch bad movies, this is a bad but highly entertaining film and I think it's a good choice to make something with a very poor script and a bunch of bad actors. I found myself laughing out loud a lot but that was just a good thing. There were a few really bad bad jokes in this and for me the most entertaining part was the main character in general, but even that wasn't enough to make me feel any better about this, but I won't bother to review that as well.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First of all, there are a lot of flaws in this movie:   "Dancing with Myself" (1987) is a short and bad romantic movie about a woman (Cara Delevingne) that likes to dance around and get into dangerous situations. This movie was made by someone that did not know what they were doing when it came to making a romantic comedy. The movie does not have much of a message and it is not funny either. The song that was chosen to sing during the movie is "When I'm In Love" by The All-American Rejects and it does not do much for the movie: it is just a pretty good music video that does not really add anything to the movie. It is a good movie for a lot more people than it is for me: it has something good to say about dance, about dancing with yourself, about being adventurous with your partner and about having great fun.   This is a movie that I will give an R or a C-: I think it is a better movie if you do not count the singing at the end of the movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible, terrible movie, that was shot on video in 1985 by a director named Michael Cimino (who also directed "The Deer Hunter").   The film is about a man whose son is killed in the movie theater by a bad guy who then proceeds to kidnap his girlfriend.   In the end, the movie was not well reviewed by anyone, not even my Mom. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can't talk about a disaster movie without mentioning Michael Bay. I'm sure the majority of people watching the movie knew it was bad by the trailer, but you might need to re-watch the movie if you don't want to be sick after seeing it. I could care less about the characters in this film, their motivations are never given any depth and all of them are awful. I mean, we're supposed to like these guys, but they're only ever annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not sure if this was an original film or just another remake. And it was neither. It was a remake of a movie I thought I had seen several times and never bothered to see again. This film reminded me of an old "Couples" movie I once saw. The couples were good. I like a good old fashioned romantic comedy with a little bit of action thrown in there. As it is, I felt I had already seen this film when I first saw the trailer for it. It is not that I thought it was bad. If it had been a good movie, I wouldn't have minded. I thought the story was very good and well drawn. I did like the old fashioned romance. I liked the action in it. I even thought it did a pretty good job of taking me back to that time period. It does have its issues. It has a bad ending and the ending is a little rushed. It really doesn't need to be so long. The pacing is a bit slow and the film loses some of its tension. There is a good enough ending though. I just don't see how this remake got made. It seemed to be made by two people with little to no knowledge of each other or of the genre. That is why I can say this was a bad remake. I am also not sure that the remake has any future at all. It looks too cheap to be a success. But the ending of the movie will get you nostalgic for that time. And the original movie still looks pretty good. And for the money, it is a pretty decent idea. I was bored after a while but I enjoyed watching this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part about this movie is not the film's story; it is its style.  If you know a little about filmmaking, then the film style will come as no surprise.  This is a slow paced, moody drama that relies a lot on the subtle effects of a couple of lighting pieces.  While the effects are pretty cool, they never become something other than a cheap gimmick and the camera never becomes anything more than an accessory.  Even the performances are not nearly as good as I remember them.    The actors here are far from impressive.  James Brolin has a pretty good role as an aging, retired military man who is a bit of a coward, but is too old to fight in the first place.  George Segal is a pretty decent character, although we get nothing out of his interactions with the woman he is having an affair with.  There is a couple decent supporting roles, but they are too minor to be worth mentioning.  The final third of the film is rather forgettable.  If you are looking for a cool, romantic drama about a retired military guy who has to save his beautiful mistress from an evil wizard who is trying to conquer the world, then this is probably not for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has a lot of elements that will please and amuse a lot people. It is one of the best horror films ever made. The cinematography is well done in terms of lighting and colors and the sound effects are all good. The characters are all very well drawn, and the film is well paced. It has the most graphic scenes that I have ever seen in a movie. It contains so much gory blood and so many gruesome deaths that you will never forget it! And at the end, the film ends, and it gets good, as it gets. The film is one that is not for everyone, but it is very good, and very effective.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The one I heard had the "I'm So Cute" lyrics repeated over and over until it became a chore.  I did not realize that there were people in the world that were so stupid they wouldn't remember the song over and done with.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst comedy ever made. It's so bad, you'll probably have to sit through the entire movie to get through the whole thing. The main characters are the usual lame people you'd expect from a bad comedy movie. The jokes are stupid and the plot makes no sense. I'm glad the film didn't suck more than it does.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My husband is a huge geek and a huge fan of Star Wars, especially the original trilogy. His favorite character from the series is Luke Skywalker.  He is a kind, noble, strong, intelligent, passionate individual.   This film does not represent the real Luke Skywalker, but I think if you ask the kids they would tell you it represents a good representation of a loving and devoted father to his family.  The cast and crew worked really hard in portraying Luke as a very sensitive, kind, and caring man.  The first film does have a number of interesting bits, including the first appearance of Grand Moff Tarkin and the Death Star.  While there are many aspects of the film that are good, the final third of the movie really drags.  I think it is unfortunate that the director, Irvin Kershner, and George Lucas got into a fight that resulted in Kershner leaving the production of the final three episodes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The reason I love the series is because of the strong cast. However, this movie is so bad it is hilarious and yet very sad. There is absolutely no reason for the story, character or music to be made into a movie. If this were made into an actual movie then all the cast would be dead by the end of it! It is actually kind of hard to believe that someone was really so stupid and not realize just how dumb this movie really is. I am not sure how many movies the creators have made over the years and this is one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's another terrible attempt at a horror movie, but this time it's got too much going on that there's no chance for suspense. The only suspense was that we couldn't tell if the girl was dead, or just had a bad time at the horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a good old fashioned western with a lot of fun moments like the gun fight and the cowboy singing "Ride to Hell, Brother" while he carries a gun.  The movie is over at a decent speed and never gets tedious or drawn out.  There are a few shots that look odd, but nothing too bad.  I had a lot fun watching this.  My only negative comment about the movie would be that I wish we could see more of the gun fighting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really bad movie. The first third is kind of interesting. It takes place during the late 1920s and features a bunch of people who were all very different people and often had a good amount of chemistry together. This is one of them. Also, it uses different actors and actresses for different parts and it never seems to really connect them all together. It is not that bad, but I just don't feel that I could see anything from it. It really is just just a lot of people talking about stuff and a lot that isn't really explained at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not only a joke, but a bad one as well. In the film, a group of kids play "Homer the Smithers". They all look quite similar to this movie character. There is a young blonde girl with long blonde hair and some pretty red hair on her head. This girl has no reason to play the part of a Homer Simpson. Her role is to get a little boy drunk. That is the only reason for being there, I can understand that. They are told to make Homer happy. This Homer is always trying to get drunk. He is shown trying to drink a soda at the store. His mother and father are there. His parents are quite drunk themselves. There are lots of kids around, but none really look like Homer. It's a strange, bizarre movie. You can't get a good laugh out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie with terrible acting and terrible story. It is a long movie and I have to give it an 8 because it was actually pretty interesting. However, the story is absolutely terrible. The guy that has to deal with the woman that is obsessed with the guy that is cheating on her. They talk about the man that he likes, and how it is a horrible life to lead, then all of a sudden they see her face again and are shocked that they are all the same. Also, the movie is a lot like it is in the beginning. It has so much potential to be good, then they screw it up to start the movie off. That really was the best part of the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good film about a good movie. I think it is a film that would be really easy to miss, and it probably would be easy to say that the film isn't worthy of much discussion, and that's fair.  What happens in this film is interesting enough, but to say it is the most interesting film in a long, long time about an interesting movie is not to say much.  This is not a film about the Vietnam war, this is not about the cold war, or about the "new world order", or about any of the many things that could be discussed in this movie. It is a story about two characters, a woman who is a little girl and a man who is much older, two men with a very different approach to life, which, in addition to the two of them, also includes a young boy, and a young girl who is more than a little frightened.  There is a lot of talk and a lot to be said in this story, but I just couldn't figure out how much of it to put in a paragraph.  I mean, I can say a lot, but it's too much.  This is a wonderful film, one that is worth watching because it is very funny, very strange, and very beautiful, but, of course, the whole film is more beautiful than the best film I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this was a decent movie, but it never quite comes together for me. As a matter of fact, it all gets thrown out of the window. I liked all of the characters, and even thought it was kind of funny that we would meet a black guy who was actually a white guy who would say the things he does. But it wasn't really a joke, since there is no black character at all. Well, except for one who was portrayed as African, and that is basically the only black character in the movie, which is pretty racist. I thought it would be funny, and I liked the black guy at first, but after he said the things the white guy would say I found him laughable. The movie was shot in a very generic, boring manner, with no real atmosphere, and the movie really did nothing to hold my interest. It would not be a bad idea to add some sort of music or sound effects to make it more interesting to watch, but I wouldn't recommend it to any serious fan of the movie. I guess this is just how they wanted this movie to be: bland and predictable. This was a bad picture. I give it a 1/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really boring and uninspiring, yet we see a bunch of soldiers getting captured by a bunch  of bad guys.  These guys are so bad that I can't stand them and I'm not sure what the point of this movie is.   The plot of the film is really simple.  One man (R.H. Cooper) decides to take over as the leader of the Confederate Army.  There's something terribly racist about this movie.  I can understand why some people found it racist, but I really don't.  This movie is pretty dull and uninteresting.  It's really not that much worse than the film Army Of Darkness.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very bad movie.   It is very slow paced and is filled with lots of talking that you really have no time to focus on.  It feels like an old time comedy show like this:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The most pathetic film I have ever seen and that's saying a lot.  It's a bad sequel to the bad first movie which makes it even worse.  And now this is not bad.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason this movie is being made is because it is the only one where the characters are played by people who are all "goody goody" or "nice". No actors worth their salt ever showed up, and the characters never get interesting or do any convincing character work. It's just boring and predictable.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a really bad film in every way.   The only reason they gave the film an R rating is that it was a low budget production that used some very low budget movie sets and effects.  The story is boring, the pacing is horrible and the acting is so bad that it gives the film absolutely no credibility.    This movie is just so bad it gives me the giggles. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What makes this movie worth watching is how it seems like the writers knew that this was a dumb movie and yet, somehow, they still managed to pull it off.   This movie is very poorly made, even by "stupid" movie standards. The plot, which is nothing but an excuse to have a lot of stupid, boring, stupid, stupid shots of women walking (with no explanation why there are so many of them and the movie keeps repeating the same stupid shots over and over) is about an old woman who has been in a home for her whole life. In fact, she never knew the outside world until she was sent to a retirement home where she now lives. The old woman has a son, who is an engineer, a lawyer, and a politician. The son is married and has a lot to deal with.  As it seems, the old woman is not well liked among the other residents of the retirement home, so it takes a while before she and her son get any decent food.  The first two acts are a lot like some of the old "Hollywood" films where you see the wife and mother going off to a picnic to get away from the other old ladies and then being told "you have to leave now".  The plot line is a very long one, with the old lady getting into all kinds of trouble, all while her son tries to figure out the right way to handle a very complicated situation.  If you are like me, you just end up laughing at the stupid plot and stupid jokes the way they are presented to the viewer.  This is one of those movies where every sentence you read is so much garbage to the point where it doesn't even matter.  I found myself thinking, "Is this film being made up because they could?"   But the worst thing is that these dumb, stupid ideas keep on coming, but no one seems to know where to go with it. It's like they are just looking for something to give it "creativity".   It is a long movie, but a boring one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I ever saw. It was a slow burn of a movie. A few good scenes were thrown in but they were hardly noticeable. The plot wasn't original at all. The main character was a poor guy who was trapped in a wheelchair who has to deal with a bunch of "trendy" people. This is one of those movies that has nothing to do with it's subject matter. The only thing that made it interesting to watch was the characters but they weren't very memorable. Also, the music and special effects were very poor. The whole thing should be dropped after its only 3 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the mid-1980s, a young man goes on a wild spree through the streets of his native London (the UK) and ends up murdering a high school girl and trying to kill his mother. The film is really a bit slow to get going and even though it's a pretty bad movie it has some good things about it that remind me of some of the classics of the genre like The Great Escape and Topkapi.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not good at all!  The movie isn't bad, it's just not good, or at least not good enough.  This movie starts off fairly well.    I think the only thing that was awful about this movie was the poor acting by the guys in this movie.  They sound like they're talking about what they know or what they're thinking about, and that's about it.  I have a feeling this movie would have been a good idea for an indie movie, but sadly it didn't get made that way, so I guess that's that.  But the acting was so bad, and the plot so ridiculous, I felt like I was watching a bad sketch comedy.  This movie is so bad it makes me think people shouldn't waste their lives watching this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a "bad" movie. As in, it's a bad adaptation of a bad book. This is how bad things have gone since the 90s. The 80s had "The Princess Bride", "The Breakfast Club" and "The Last Temptation of Christ". Then the 80s started to wane (they could be a trend, but they weren't) and the 1990s went on without a real great movie. Then came the 2000s, with "The Matrix", "Ironman" and a few others. Then in 2008, "The Crow" and then "Sicario" stole the show. The 2009 "The Lone Ranger" was a hit (I think "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" has surpassed it, but still), but the 2010s are a wasteland. And now we're stuck with "Furious 7" and what looks like another "Titanic" sequel (a good movie but not nearly as good as that original).  I mean, I've seen more classic screwball comedies than this over the last four decades, and the "Fantastic Four" reboot was terrible (which is saying something) so I was hoping for a fresh take, but it's actually even worse than the original!  It's just that a lot of the characters are now likelier to kill each other!  This, from a movie called "FURY" (I never saw it in theaters because I hated it)!  So this is one of the worst bad movies ever.  This is a pretty long review, but if you've seen "The Fantastic Four" you know what I'm talking about.  What makes this even more horrible is that the actors play the characters as they should be played: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My husband and I took our daughter to this movie, a little over a month ago, she liked it and laughed, her parents did, but I was not impressed.  This was about a girl with a dog.  The dog can't see her, she can't hear him or smell him so she can walk a few hundred feet ahead of him and he's not behind her, it was the kind of motion I've seen in the movies and it reminded me of a dog and its owner going around doing the same thing.  I'm not surprised the movie wasn't successful so it is easy to see why the studio decided not to make another one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Black Christmas" movie is really not all that bad. A really nice little movie.   I give it 3.5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be fair, the movie does start slow, and while there is plenty of excitement going on, the action is very much at the mercy of the actors and they don't take their chances.  They try very hard to get a few good shots in, but there isn't much to show for it and in the end, there is just no depth to the movie at all.  One reason might be the actors, they don`t have a whole lot of talent.  This is not one of those action films that you would be interested in seeing.  It is too long, it is very boring, and it feels very dated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say this movie is really bad! I've seen it a few times now and it is always so-so. It's a terrible movie and not even funny. I hate how it seems like all it has is a bunch of kids going through this ridiculous movie. At least I don't think so! It takes a while for the plot to get going. This movie is full of horrible jokes. I'm not going to bother with the bad jokes. They are just terrible.  There are so many that it's tough to keep track of it all.  The kids are funny and fun but at the end of the movie, they seem kind of silly. Maybe I just like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a fan of anything "80's" that does not feature the "Big Foot" in the title, and don't mind seeing the actor in a very silly wig, then you need to go out and watch this.  I never thought I'd be writing a review about this movie, since I just hate this sort of thing, but it turned out to be even worse than I thought.  This is a movie about a man who claims to have been in a bigfoot encounter.  Well, a guy who doesn't talk, and who isn't even talking.  There is a lot of silliness in this movie that has no place in a true investigation of this claim.  First the fact that the guy is so obviously joking around with all the bigfooters in the woods, and then his claims about the bigfeet were taken seriously enough to send an investigation team.  It was an investigation that ended with the people in the camp getting really freaked out.  The movie is very silly, and there isn't a lot to say about it that has not already been said.  Don't waste your money on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was watching this at a movie theater, in an area that is very touristy for the city, there were people everywhere. I had a great time but the ending was disappointing. If you like a good ghost story with good acting then this is a must see.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am so bored of these cheesy movies.   This movie was like one of those dumb jokes you saw in the late 90s on the "The Late Late Show".   At least they had the balls to put up a good fight and put a face to the name "Pizza Man". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't think this movie would be that bad, it had great production values, and some great performances but overall it's just not the best movie of the year.   The story seems pretty standard, a guy gets abducted, they find his body, they have some fun with a couple of aliens, then some other stuff happens then they return to Earth and the rest is pretty average.  I'd give the whole movie a two but as much as I thought it was going to be a good movie it never lived up to any of the potential I had for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never heard anything like this before. I mean, it's not the most exciting movie, I know, and I've only seen the trailer, but it's so weird that it makes me think that it is some kind of strange, long-gone horror classic. It's funny to see how it is supposed to be a short, but I mean this movie is long. This film isn't as well made as the trailer would have you believe, especially because one of the characters is actually a woman, but the weirdness keeps going until the end, when it's clear that all of this is a bunch of people looking for someone who died in a strange car crash. Even though this film seems to be just a few people's attempt to recapture the magic of their childhood, and even though I can't say that I would watch this movie for more than a few minutes at a time, I'm sure that it's a movie that everyone will find pretty entertaining.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful!   It's a bad, bad, no good movie.   The movie opens on an airship in a very, very bad film!  Yes, that's right, they show how beautiful the mountains and the water look in the movie. They even show some people riding these things in the beginning.  I like a good movie when I can see a movie. And I can't see a good one here.  They show that they are making a beautiful movie when the movie actually is a bad one, or a bad film.  It has been called a masterpiece by other reviewers as well, but it really isn't even good.  This is a movie that does not need to exist!  It should be a joke to the people who make it.  The people making it have the most horrible acting.  And they are just terrible on screen with horrible accents as well.  So bad that I would not even know where to begin.  There are so many scenes of them talking in bad English, that I think they really don't even want to be in the theater.  Yes.  At least it's supposed to be a story, but this is all a bad picture.  What do they think they are doing?  This was made by two people who want to get rich!  They are not going to make any money by making such a bad looking movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not a big fan of horror films, at all.   Horror films are typically a waste of time and energy, but this was an exception.  It's not even an ordinary horror film, but is much more than that. It's a horror film that is very much a hybrid of the horror genre, which I know very little about.  But this film is well done, well edited, well paced, well staged and very well acted.  I know I'd like to see this film in 3D, but as this was filmed in 35mm, the 3D will be appreciated by no one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After a few days of filming, the cast and crew of the film, the film being based on the popular Stephen King story of the same name, are not only tired and hungry, but have been left in a house for days and nights in a cold, snowy, rain-soaked cold. It's not a nice, warm environment for them to stay in. One gets the feeling that the real King was a miserable drunk, not to say a little more like a man who lived only to drink in a big city for the next year.   - August 5, 2013I guess we should know better by now
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen it, the original '80s remake of this awful classic horror/monster film from 1987.   If you like things that aren't like things, like the first one, you'll like the sequel even less.  It's still pretty much a remake, just a little bit more macabre, and we see a little more of the horror genre as it is in the films that came before.  I'm not going to say too much here, because it's about the remake (or at least the first remake) as a whole, so I'm going to let you see it for yourself, so to speak, without too many comments on it, because as I said before, it's pretty bad and not really worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a bad horror movie. It does not have the usual bloodletting, and that is a good thing. The story is just a bunch of creepy events at the beginning, which you don't need to know, because they do not get into the actual events of the story. It is the fact that the author of this movie, Michael McKean, did not care about writing an original story, even if it was about a murder. There is not much here to be interesting. It just is there to make the viewer feel bad for a while, and then get out of there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a bad-looking movie with a bad special effects. I'd suggest you don't go with it unless you love bad bad movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not expect much from "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," yet it was an unexpected and enjoyable film. If it had not been for the wonderful actors, the brilliant direction, and the special effects, this movie would have been a great letdown. I will never forget those magnificent dwarves. One of the few times I saw them in a movie, and I will remember them as such. They made you feel the need to look for a different place in the world. If you are looking for a funny and funny movie about dwarves, "The Lord of the Rings: The Hobbit" should be up your alley. If not, you should go out and buy a beer and see the next "Lord of the Ring" movie. If I have to do this movie again, I would probably take a detour to see the old "Lord Ring" on Broadway in New York. This movie was much more interesting and engaging than the prequel "The Fellowship of the Seven," and it was quite entertaining for the short time it lasted. I had seen the first two prequels, but I had not seen the third. This is probably not the film for everyone, but if you're interested in looking at a group of people looking for adventure in the middle of nowhere, and they find it, you'll probably like it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not often that we get a nice, relaxing, beautiful movie with a good score.  This movie has great scenery and music.  I also like the characters and their relationships and how they all work and have fun together.  It is a movie about friendship and getting older and it has all the elements that I want to see in a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an excellent film but it has little to no redeeming qualities. I don't care what it's about.  The plot is silly, the acting is bad, and the acting was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is NOT funny at all, it's boring. It's also a movie that I feel like a lot of people would like to see, because it has a strong cast of actors, a cool setting of the moon, and is set around a story of a man (played by George Hamilton) who has an old abandoned moon station and he's trying to get something to eat off the wall there. It was kind of interesting to see what the moon station looked like and how the moon looked from the moon. It looked like an old moon station, with a big hole in it. It also looked like a little bit like the interior of some kind of spaceship. It made the moon look big. There were a lot more things about it than was explained in the movie. But, I guess in an effort to keep the movie from being too dull, the actors do all kinds of silly things to get laughs and things to do in there. I don't know if it helped that it was directed by a comedian, but even without it it's pretty bad. It is hard to find something funny about something with an old man as the star. That is one of the reasons why this movie didn't get any good reviews, because the movie was really boring. I did find it a bit interesting seeing a cast like that do all kind of funny things, and it gave me a feeling of "Oh, I like this movie" but it wasn't very good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I was expecting a lot from this movie, especially after hearing so many positive things about it and all the positive reviews about the amazing performance by Robert Downey Jr. In the end, I had the same feeling about The Rock as I had for the last two Batman movies; I really wanted to like it, but it didn't work.    What was so great about it? The cast did a great job and there was a lot of action, lots of laughs, a lot action and a lot explosions.  I liked how it was a family movie.  My only disappointment was that there was only one villain, which was annoying to me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not going to say much about this movie, because it's just a rehash of the story of a guy with a sword and a sword only. This movie is so bad, so bad it hurts.  This movie has some good action scenes and you have to be an expert in martial arts to really enjoy it, as even though I had watched it before I was just totally lost with it.  I had my son watch this at least three times just to make sure he couldn't figure out anything.  You have to feel sorry for these guys as they have no idea what's going on and it just makes you want to cry all the more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The second half of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is good, but the first half of it is great!  This is the movie that made Michael Curtiz look like a star.  His comic timing is better than it has been in years.  It is not that the movies are not funny, they aren't.  They are funny enough.  But it is the way the movie goes about its business that makes them so funny.  The first half, which is good enough, seems to be in slow motion, and then when the film returns to regular speed, we find that it has really sped up.  Curtiz is the only person in the movie who does not have a very large and interesting personality.  There is no real emotional punch in this movie, the only real emotional scene is when the girl he is dating finds out he is gay, and he is the most unhappy man ever, and the way she laughs at him is so sweet.  So I can think of only one negative thing about the movie.  In the end there is only one good thing about it, and that is that the movie gets some great laughs out of this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not quite as bad as it could have been.  The dialogue was not bad but not good either.    The acting was bad and the plot had a lot of holes in it.  The ending was also very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just one of many awful movies from a bad filmmaker.  A black and white film with poor effects and a bad story.  I would suggest that you do not waste your time seeing this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had been watching it for about a year and a half.  I can say that it is not a bad film.  It has a few elements in it that are good, like the characters and the setting.  The story was boring though.  My brother and I watched it together.  When we were finished watching it and I was bored again, we just laughed at it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So there I am, standing outside of an amusement park, waiting for the train. What I'm looking for is the entrance to the main ride. There's not a single soul around, not even a dog. The only people on the park are some kids playing basketball. I wait there for a few more minutes. I can see the train coming in from the right. I'm a bit late, and so I have to catch a train back to my car. As I pass the kids playing the basketball, I notice their parents are standing at the top of the court. I realize they're watching me. I think I should go home. I stand there, waiting.   I'm not even close to the point where I have enough time to jump on this train. After a while, I walk off the playground and over to where the train is supposed to stop. There isn't any one there.  I go back to the playground. I see some kids on the other side of the fence. I hear them laughing as they run past me.  The kids on either end of the playground look at me, confused.  There are a couple of people on a swing in the middle of the park, and they start laughing.  It seems like there's a theme to these kids. There were also a couple who were standing in the bushes watching me, and there was one who was in the center of the parking lot, talking on a cell phone. I wonder what they thought of all these people.  When I'm close to my cars, I realize I'm still not at the main entrance. I go over to the other playground, hoping to find that entrance.  At the playground, I find the kids who were playing basketball with their parents. They are standing in front of a house.  Now I'm in the exact same spot as the basketball court.  Just as I'm about to head back, my dad, who was driving, comes by the park and takes me home. The car drives past the same house. It also passes a few cars on the road.  My dad tells me the kid next to the park gate was trying to climb up the fence to go into the playground with their friends.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out with a pretty basic and straightforward scene of two girls getting some water from a pool (which I guess is like a swimming pool in the middle of the jungle?).  They get in the water and it begins to rain...and so does the water.  So that's what happens, right?  Well...they just get wet again!  (They look at each other with obvious disdain)  Anyway, they get out, and there are a bunch of monkeys around.   One of them is getting drunk, and the other is getting angry.  In fact, I think their fight was the first fight in the movie I haven't felt bad for.  Well, one of the monkeys comes near them (I assume) and bites one of them.  They run away from the monkey's teeth and make it to the end of the movie and it's the ending:       A movie that is so poorly made that even if you didn't like it, there's a 99% chance you wouldn't notice.  If this is what happens to a movie when it has been released in a country, where they make movies like this, I am sick and tired of this.  I'm going to end this review with some thoughts I have about the movie, because some people don't realize that they don't get to make movies until they are over 20 or 25 years old, and they really don't want to see a movie like this anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The bad:  This is a really boring movie. It is actually the kind of movie that you don't want to watch at all. It has a bad plot, and it really lacks plot. There is no story or real logic at all in the story. The characters are all dull, and not very interesting at all for an 80s movie (I was actually pretty surprised). The ending was weird, and I could see why it didn't work.  If this were made today, I would have said, "That was a nice movie." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It really does a poor job at making a good movie. When I was told of the remake of the 1978 horror classic I instantly thought I was getting a terrible remake. This movie is simply disgusting. This is the ultimate example of a bad remake that just doesn't understand the source material it was trying to emulate.  I watched the original 1976 movie and thought it was a pretty good movie, with the main characters having some funny moments. I didn't find the remake to be funny, with a lot of people walking around with no clothing on or whatever the scene they are in.  I just don't see why this movie was even made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a true believer of this movie (like a bunch of other people I saw it too)..    If you want an entertaining, cheesy and silly comedy movie that's full of ridiculous things go to this one!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie's not a good one in fact it's a bad one. The bad ones can never stand a chance, but they never really do much besides just walking around.  There is a little thing that happens between the main girl and her lover that is not all that exciting, it does set up a few things that are of some interest.  I think it's all a bit cheesy to try to make a movie about a person with a mental disorder in the first place so I don't even bother watching.  At least I can say there was some kind of romance involved in this movie, with the odd bit of romance and the odd thing happening. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never expected a movie about vampires and werewolves to be very funny. But it's not even funny!   It's a story of three people:  the Vampire, the Werewolf, and the Werewolf's Father.   Their story is told to them by a priest, Father Vamore.  And this is what I thought of after watching the film:  They all look like they are in the wrong parts of the costume department for Halloween.  They are all a bit silly, the werewolf's face is kind of weird and the vampire is not scary at all.  These two are only about as scary as Dracula and Frankenstein together.  The character of Vampire was more or less amusing, I found the idea of him dressing up like an opera singer rather amusing, but it was the werewolves that were the real stars of this film.      The werewolves were the biggest laugh out loud moment in the movie for me, their dialogue was not too bad either.  If you have a bad time at a Halloween party this movie is a very good example why the people should not be allowed to have such parties anymore.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main character is a guy that's basically a bad boyfriend from the beginning. He has a terrible family and has the worst luck in life. When one of his friends is shot down by a sniper he immediately comes to the attention of a young girl with an interest in the guy. Unfortunately the girl is also a sniper with a hatred for everybody and everything she comes across. It really makes for a rather entertaining and strange film with the odd characters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    No matter how much you hate it, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.   It was the first movie I saw with my then-boyfriend and it was horrible. Seriously.  It was completely bad.  He said a lot of nice things about it and I agree. I'm pretty sure the actor playing the clown was named "Cobra" as he didn't say much.  We are introduced to this poor guy named "Brick" (yes, he's actually named Brick), a homeless clown who lives out in the boonies. He's only got a wooden box and a can of paint on the side, so he's not exactly the best guy to look at in a horror movie. He is not very smart and gets into a fight or two when he gets too scared to go on stage.  But he gets along well with the local kids and seems to enjoy life.  When the kids play tricks on him, he doesn't like that and begins to go insane.  However, a local girl named Alice (yes we get to see her first) sees him as an inspiration and joins him in his nightly shows.  After the events of "The Mask" (which is basically a remake of the original "Frankenstein" with a different monster and a different girl), things get even worse when he loses control of his puppets.  I hate to say this, but I feel like this movie was made by an 8 year old kid who just saw "Frankenweenie" and thought "I can do that!"  As mentioned, this movie is pretty much about a clown who becomes insane and gets rid of the town's clowns.  What a bad idea.  Anyway, they are forced to work together and try to put a stop to this evil, but they eventually just lose it.  It's bad, but it's only the first half.  Now the second half takes off and leaves us with a terrible movie.  A terrible, disgusting movie about a terrible, gross clown.  Oh look!  It looks like I was wrong about "Frankenniemovie".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In retrospect, this is a bad idea for a movie. It was made to be made to get on screen before the "War of the Worlds" TV broadcast, which was to air on NBC at 4:00 PM EST, and in my book that is a disgrace. Not only is it a bad science fiction movie (it is actually a bad sci-fi movie), it's a bad horror movie in the worst tradition. The story is told entirely through sound effects - the actors speak in a stilted and monotonous voice, and everything sounds the same. I was looking forward to seeing the film, and I was disappointed. If you are a sci-horror fan then this movie is probably worth seeing, but if not, you would probably not be entertained. Rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those movies where there is a really good idea and an interesting idea with just a few problems here and there, and no plot holes that would get in the way of a great story.   There are several interesting characters in this movie, like a teenage girl who goes to a "furry convention" because she has never seen a real furry before and has to go through a lot of bizarre things that involve the furries.  The problem is that there is not a lot to the movie that is great or even good at all, it is more of an odd experience that could have been fun or interesting, if it didn't come across as so much effort put into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was about a guy that is not a real superhero. He's just a bad-ass guy who gets superpowers after getting in some car crash that kills a good guy (you know, the kind who tries to stop a car with a bike), that leaves him horribly disfigured and with a bunch of powers: super strength, super speed, super durability, super hearing. He is sent away to the military hospital for treatment, but he finds there is an evil organization called Evil that runs the hospital and he has to battle these bad guys, save his daughter and discover who the bad guys really are.   I don't know if this movie is worth watching, although it might have some potential, but it is not worth watching if you have even a passing interest in superheroes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a pretty bad joke.   I think it's pretty lame that everyone thought this is a good idea and the first half of the film just made everyone laugh.  It's not like they went out and got a good, serious drama, they went to the grocery store and put their best friends in a goofy movie about a stupid, silly clown.  Maybe it could have been funny if there was a little more thought put into it, but the script was pretty generic and the humor wasn't funny at all.  There are too many cliches and clichés here to count.  So, it wasn't a good comedy, it was a pretty lame one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film. I think its a bad idea to start a new franchise from a film like this. For those who are confused about what is the difference between a story and a movie; A story tells a story in the form of a story. A story is a narrative. A movie is just a bunch of pictures that a director uses to tell a story (and then you watch it). This is pretty much that: a bunch pictures with some dialogue inserted into the middle.  And the story? Well, there are a couple of plot twists and a few good looking people but nothing really interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was so scared to go to see this film I was scared to death to get off this plane and sit down on the bench for another two hours.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was on a mission to find a good movie with a bad ending. Then I came across this film! So bad it was bad! There was a woman, who was so ugly I could not bear to look at her; a man who had no character, and was as ugly as hell; a woman who hated and despised her husband; a young boy who is an idiot. I have no words to describe this film's utter failure to live up to the promise of its title. I was just going to make a comment here about how much I hated the movie, but then I heard a car pull up and I jumped out to see who it was. It was a man driving a beautiful car! I watched it again just to find out that this was the movie that was made about him! I have to think that the man made the movie because he really hated himself so much, but he made the most dreadful movie that could be made! This movie is about as bad as it gets!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an interesting twist to the genre, the film is not just about a bunch of kids making funny films about kids. Instead, it is about two kids who were separated at birth: the boy and the girl. Now that they are adults, the girl tries to convince the boy to go back to the old place where he lived when he was a kid, and where the old folks lived and where her family was from. The movie does not have a lot of depth to it. But the plot is interesting and there is a lot to see. In a movie where the kids are not the focus, the kids in the movie are fun to watch. The kids in this movie are all good kids: they do some very funny and sometimes scary things. It is probably the only movie I have ever seen where the children all do very bad things: the children are sometimes cruel, the children get into some silly arguments, the young boy gets into a car accident, and the young girl has an affair with a guy who is an older boy. But that is about it. It does not seem that the movie is very much about children. But it is very funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is great, but it is just so badly acted that it makes everything about it bad.  I didn't like that the actor that played the lead, the "wacky," character who gets caught cheating on his wife, got the name of the movie, the name he is known by, in every scene.  As the movie progressed it got more boring, and the character, with his ridiculous accent, got more ridiculous, and not funny.  The director doesn't know how to shoot an action film, with lots of quick cuts, and lots of people running around on camera, and he just goes on to do the same thing all the time, in the same scene, for the rest of the film.  This movie got so bad and I almost laughed at the stupidity of the characters.  For instance, it just made no sense why the wife cheated on her husband.  He has a good job as a janitor in a hospital, and she is a good, kind person.  What the heck is wrong with them?  They must be in deep denial, and I don't think they want to believe it.  It is one of those movies where the actor is given too much freedom to run around in his costume, and his mouth is too far down for his lips to form a normal smile.  When the director tries to make him laugh it all seems so wrong, and when he tries to be serious, you can't help but laugh.  These people just don't get it, so they try and change it up by running into each other, and having sex.  Again, this is bad acting by these people, and it just makes it all the worse.   For the next four minutes they go into some ridiculous romantic comedy dance sequence which is a waste of screen time.  But it is one thing to do a silly dance sequence, and another to do it in a comedy, with very little dialogue, and no reason given.  They would have done a better job with more dialogue.  Then they do a scene that is a direct rip off of the Twilight movies.  And I love the Twilight movie.  There is another scene in which the actor with a good voice says, "Look at that little girl in the doorway..."  The rest of this movie is just dumb.  Not very entertaining, but just dumb, which is really bad. (click to see the movie)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie to ever come out of Hollywood.   This isn't a movie for the masses.  What is it even about?   I thought I was watching a TV show, or a bad musical, or some kind of sketch.  Is this the "M*A*S*H" remake?  It's not even really bad.  It is painfully unfunny (I can only assume this is in retaliation for the movie being unfunny), but it is also incredibly bad. The cast members have terrible accents, and the dialogue is terrible.  I would have given this movie two stars if it wasn't so painfully stupid.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very bad movie.   It was originally supposed to be called   "The Golden Horde",   which would have been more fitting.  They changed the title and it just doesn't make sense.  It's about a gang of mercenaries who go into the middle of nowhere to kill and torture something.  The movie starts with some boring talking. The dialogue is pretty stupid, and the action is pretty boring.  Then we get some good action sequences.  After the good action stuff, things just get worse.  If you like action and don't mind the fact that it's not really interesting, don't pick this up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't really know why there's a bad version of this movie! There are many, many movies about aliens. It's like we only want to see the good aliens and never the bad ones. This is so, so good! The best part about it is that it's just a bad alien movie. I'm sure everyone who loves science fiction and aliens has probably seen it. If you've never seen it, you must! The aliens in this movie look good! They're all different. They're not like the aliens from the original TV show. They have their own personalities. They get to speak the language. You don't have to watch this, but I recommend it to anyone who loves aliens, or just love to watch aliens. There are only two bad things about it: the aliens are kind of goofy in the beginning and when they start killing people and running off to the space station.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is terrible and boring, and the music is terrible.  That being said, it is one of the many boring and terrible movies that are based on movies which I have seen (and yes, you may have seen a number of them).  It is not so much that this is a terrible movie in terms of it's production, but it is terrible in terms off the story.        There is no plot, which is not a bad thing, but the characters are all very weak and don't have any depth.  The story is about a man who meets a girl and they fall in love.  The girl doesn't understand what he wants from life.  He has this weird obsession with the moon and the stars.  This goes on for three days until he is captured by his father.  They send him away for a while (in which he gets a new wife).   What is the point of this movie?   You're supposed to be fascinated by the moon, stars and the mysterious man.  Then the moon is gone.  And then the man decides to live in the desert.  I didn't understand a damn thing about the movie.  Well I guess it is more fun to see the man's wife being killed then to find out what a good life is, although the movie does at least have one good moment.  What happened to that movie about a time traveler? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In order to help you understand and enjoy this movie I'm going to explain a few things to you: a) I like to watch bad movies. b) Bad movies are all over the map. c) I really wanted to like this movie! It has a really cool idea - a girl is attacked by a monster - I had never heard of a female monster before and it was so cute! The monster is not so big in size like it seems in this movie but it is very detailed. The monster also has this cool expression and movements. This movie was so silly! The badness was pretty much on a whole other level but at the same time there was a nice twist - the baddies were not monsters at all! They were people like the ones you see in so many horror movies and there was really a lot of humor in this one! The main villain (in this case it's an old lady) is so annoying and so boring. The other characters were all pretty much the same! The action scenes were all over-the-board silly and lame. This was not a funny movie but I guess this is an excuse to have a "monster" kill another monster. Overall it was a fun "movie" that really didn't have anything to offer me. I wish it was more like what it is and had more humor and a good twist at the end! And if anyone is going to see this movie please make sure it's in a movie theater! Not in a mall - it is too stupid!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is bad and unoriginal with poor acting, bad dialogue, and bad directing. This is a bad looking movie that would look better in the 1950's. I am glad this movie got turned into a bad TV movie as the plot is very lame.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very disappointed with this movie. The acting was awful, even for an action film. All of the main characters were awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A terrible movie that is a disappointment. There is nothing to this movie. In the first five minutes the characters are introduced. You learn nothing about them. There's not even one person who is believable. They were in a movie in the 1970s so if you don't get the jokes it's because the director didn't know what he was doing. There are a few funny lines but nothing substantial. The film follows the same formula every film follows. It uses the same actors over and over again. This is the "I want to live the life I want to have" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So in the end this movie is nothing new. It's just an adaptation of a book. It lacks originality. So what's the point of this movie? The movie is all about two brothers who are on a camping trip. They see a UFO and then they hear this scream of "I AM A MUTANT!" and then two little people run out of the forest in pursuit of this "MUTANT". They are never seen again. But then one day a woman comes into the camp and says she was attacked by a giant monster and she's bleeding from her face and she says "I'm a woman." And she gives the kids some of her blood. And then the three brothers get a magic spell from a witch and they say "I am a woman" and then their father comes to the camp saying "I have seen your daughter!" So they all say "We are a family of men!" And then he takes their mother and the kids, and puts them in a huge old tree where the old witch lives. The witch says she thinks the kids are a group of creatures trying to find the magical tree. She says the boys are the offspring of "Dwarf" and "Humans." Now to the kids I say "How about we make a deal? I let you live. If you can find the tree and get back the two little men, you can leave." So they say yeah! So they go out and try to look for the tree. They find it but the little men don't come back. And the three boys are all very, very depressed, and they decide to go home. And that's it. So anyway the movie doesn't even get a good rating. There's absolutely no effort at all to make this movie a worthy tribute to the original.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad and so boring, it makes my hair stand on end.  The entire film is like the opening scene from a bad sci-fi movie: We're introduced to an astronaut named Mike (Michael Biehn) who has been trapped in a spaceship with his girlfriend, Sarah (Hilary Swank).  There's a problem with the ship's air purifier, but they have no idea how to fix it.   We're introduced next to an evil alien named Mr. Big (Ed O'Neill) and a bunch of little children who are trying to rescue the girl from the alien.  The kids must use their imaginations to break down the alien's walls and find a way to escape the ship.  We're also introduced to the alien who's really just a giant blue worm.  He's always moving, he's a disgusting monster, and it's really sad to see that so many children seem to be drawn to him.  But it seems like there's no escape from the creature, so it's up to Mike and Sarah to find the way out.  It's hard to believe anyone would want to watch this film, because no one should ever want to see this film:  The script is bad, so bad that it's almost as if the director simply slapped together some bad dialogue to use as the basis of his film.  I could give a synopsis of the film without saying anything:    - It's about the kids being trapped in this blue space worm and attempting to escape.  - The children are constantly looking for ways out of the spaceship (the worm is also blue).  - But the worm isn't a space worm!   It has a mouth and a face (just like a face was supposed to look), and they're constantly trying to talk to the creature.  In a word, it's horrible.  There's not much happening at all in this film. The dialogue is terrible, all the kids are annoying, and the worm is a horrible monster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have not seen this yet... not since it first came out! I didn't realize how bad it was until a friend showed me the trailer and we both said it's bad, so bad it can only be rated a "C." A very low budget, low-budget movie by a director who had nothing better to do...   There are a few moments of greatness. The ending of the movie, a few shots of good fight choreography, and some of the best choreographed fights I've ever seen. The fight scenes aren't good, but for the most part they're passable for a low budget movie from the early 80's. I wish there was more than one more fight. I'll never be surprised by these low budget movies ever again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best "movie" on Netflix, so far. I haven't seen it in a while, but had a good time while I watched it. I have no idea when it is going to end, but for the next 10 minutes, it was pure bliss.  It is a nice mix of  "sophisticated"  film and  "truly bizarre"  comedy, but it still managed to stay with me well past the 2 hour mark. I was laughing at a guy in a fish mask and holding a teddy bear, I kept thinking,  "Is this guy going to make it?" But he didn't.  I couldn't stop laughing...at every damn thing...except the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought it would be funny to watch this movie, I was pretty sure this was a sequel to "The Rock."   The movie is pretty much what it sounds like.   This was my first time seeing a kung fu movie which, I guess, isn't bad at all.  In this one, the hero, a karate master who wears a black costume, is in a fight with a bunch of tough, evil gang members who have been sent to kill him. They are all tough as nails.  While they are taking him out one by one, we are also treated to a whole bunch of kung-fu stunts that were done with little or no skill on the part of the actors.  I guess that it was just a bunch a people just playing kung fumming around and trying to hurt the hero in a stupid way.  It did have a pretty good martial arts sequence at the end, but it seemed like it was all staged just to get that last kill.  Overall, I thought this movie was a cheap knock off that could have been avoided. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never thought I would be able to make a movie about this movie, but here I am and it turned out okay (but not really good, not even a great film). I have watched this movie hundreds of times and loved it. I still love it, and have to say, I didn't like it much. That's no surprise to anyone who has seen it. It was the same movie, yet a different film for each audience. But that doesn't change my feelings about it. The people in that movie, the audience, are the people who should get the most credit. If it was the best, they could make it great, and they did that! But it's not. And it doesn't try to be. It comes across as an earnest, and fairly honest look at a bad relationship, that happens to go wrong. I like that the movie is honest about the fact that a man cannot have the relationship he wants with a woman. And I liked that it wasn't a film about how a marriage is an eternal bond, and that it should be saved only by death. I liked the fact the movie took a look at one of the most dangerous places in our world. And one thing is for sure, there is no love there. And if you want to know about how it got that way, you have to watch it, you will find it, even if you hate it.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To my pleasant surprise I found out that the movie was made as a French/Italian Co-production by the director/producer Vincenzo Amato and director/co-actor Mario Bonventre. It is a very interesting movie about an ordinary man who has to deal with the consequences of his actions - both of his selfishness and his love of animals. In my humble opinion it is one of those films that will have you thinking. There is a strange story here, an old man with an empty chair and a big, angry cat. The story doesn't exactly match the film, at times it is absurd. The movie is not bad, it has a good sense of humour. The acting is excellent. The film also shows very good use of sound, the director has a great sense of how to get the right mix of sound and music. There's also some nice musical interludes. I think this is the best Italian movie for a long time, but it is not perfect. I've read that a good French version was made.

It wasn't as good as the album (or the movie, either.)   It was a fun ride! I have yet to meet a better movie or a better "sailor" than "The Wizard of Oz". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a shame how badly produced this film is. The actors are all very flat, and it's very hard to believe that the director of this picture had never worked before. The cinematography is a mixed bag, mostly because of the camera tricks. When a person is in front of a TV, the camera pulls the screen horizontally across the screen, like a slide projector. Another gimmick has the camera zoom back and forth as the camera rolls. The effects are equally bad, and all the shots have a very "fuzzy" quality. The performances are weak, too; it's difficult to believe the people in the film can all be so bad. There are many bad jokes and one very stupid line: "I have no friends."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie i ever saw in my life and it's a complete ripoff of  A Christmas Carol  A movie that even a four-year old will say "that's not funny, I thought you told the story about the baby Jesus being raised from the dead." So, the movie begins with a woman who is walking around a church and sees a dead body. She finds a letter and finds out that her mother died on Christmas Eve and that she went to heaven. She goes to the man sitting at the end of the church and gets a message for him. She tells him she is in a hurry to get to her mother and that this is not the time to be sitting around. They get to the end and see a house and a car parked at one end of it. The man asks the woman who wants to take him to the church. She says "no".

The main character (Michael) who appears to be a middle-aged man is the epitome of the 'bad boy' of the story. One of the main female characters is in love with the bad boy. In fact, she becomes his 'gift' and a 'goddess'. The film is so bad I don't think it will even make a dent in your library. This movie will leave you stunned and speechless."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're going to watch a bad film (the sequel to a "bad" movie) on a bad date (when the guy is going to be executed), you want to be in the best possible mood, but no movie would be a more dismal, dreary, and unambitious trip into the world of the mind than this.  It's a film that tries to be interesting, but is a complete failure at all that it sets out to be.  If that sounds bad enough, let's get into it, then.  First off, there isn't any point in this movie, because it doesn't even attempt to have any point other than "bad movie".  This movie tries to make us sympathise with the bad guy, because this guy can't get away with just stealing his victims' money.  For example, he's caught trying to steal cash from a house that he's stealing from, but when the wife gets suspicious, he admits to his crime and says "I only got away with this because my wife was home at the time".  The problem is, the bad guys don't get caught because they're too good at what they do.  They have a way of using their victims' greed to their own advantage, and they can't be caught even after repeatedly committing the same crime.  But the movie never tries to understand why this is so.  Even after the bad-guy character has been caught, he still manages to steal a car, which he takes to his wife's house so that she can leave her husband.  So the bad movie is, at the end of the day, just bad.  The acting is laughable, and the story is a terrible one.  At the end, when the movie has to make a comeback, it doesn The Phantom Of The Opera: A Bad Movie (2002)  fails by failing at everything, and that's saying a lot.  This film has a bunch of people running around in costumes that don't quite fit together, a musical number that seems to be more or less a retelling of a fairy tale, and a lot of other things that just don't seem to fit with their setting or thematically any better than they did in the movie that it is a sequel to.  There isn't anything in this film that has been done better that has ever been done, and it is just awful.  One of the worst movies I've ever seen, and for
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had seen a few of these over the years, but most were on TV. This is the one I finally got off of my DVR and watched on my own. I found it to be a very entertaining movie with an interesting plot line and a good cast. It is worth a watch for the plot lines as well as the characters. This has been a classic over the past 30+ years, so I'm glad it is being resurrected again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have heard that they used to make this movie with a cast like that one from The Little Rascals.   Unfortunately, they decided to go with a lot more clowns (they used to cast one guy of that show to play the role), with more clowny faces.  I know the theme song is bad (like The Little Mermaid ) but it is a very silly song. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was the worst film I have ever seen. I was so sick to my stomach, it was sick. I am so sad that it was all in a film. It is just horrible. The actors were terrible and didn't act! The music, I don't know what the hell was playing but it was awful. This wasn't a good movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this in a local theatre, the only other person in the theatre was a group of friends who were in a bit of a bad mood. I would never consider myself an angry, bitter person; so I couldn't really fathom how the other actors in the play seemed to be so irritated by the play and so much more so to the audience. It seems that these actors had been brought in from all over Europe to do a very specific role; and they are only as good as the other people they get to work with. They are not nearly up to scratch; so it's difficult to find anything to like about them. The play is only about a week old, but everyone is already getting a bad attitude and acting, so the audience is left with no hope that this will end well. This is a very, very sad play.   I have never had a good time watching any of the old TV series. I will never watch a TV series with a girl in the main role. - January 10, 2008This is a terrible play 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first three minutes alone of this are not bad, in fact it's quite entertaining. The plot goes as a bunch of people are going to a party. The characters are all rather cute and interesting, and each character has an interesting personality. Unfortunately, however, this movie is an atrocity. This is a movie where you have to sit through four hours of awful characters, terrible acting, terrible jokes, terrible writing and terrible music. A lot of the movies in this list were better than this, but they were still more pleasant.  The movie is based upon the first of William Gibson's three short novels: the book starts off with a rather dark situation: a young girl is being stalked by a ghost, who only appears under extreme pressure. She ends up going through various forms of torture and self destruction until she finally dies in a strange setting. It's quite the depressing ending, but there is a glimmer of hope in the fourth and final book, which is set a century later. This story is very much like the first book: it focuses on a girl and her father who go looking for the girl's grandmother and the two become involved with the supernatural. Unfortunately the movie is worse than the first movie: it spends too much time on the father, and almost all of the time is spent in the father's room; the characters have absolutely no personalities, and most of the plot consists of them going to the mother's house (as they both need help) and then the father goes back home to continue his investigation. So I guess it's not all that great. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but for those who need to know it is available for streaming online for free on the website FilmBuff. The worst thing about this movie? The fact that it's so terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not going to bore you with details about the plot or the characters. I will say this about the movie. The first thing you think of is the famous line, "I will eat you alive."   As you would expect, a zombie is the main focus. If you don't like a zombie, I recommend that you watch other movies or at least not to watch the remake of this movie. I found the remake rather boring.   The action is pretty standard stuff. There are no surprises or twists, just a quick and painless end to what is a rather boring film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember as a kid I always saw a movie that had a strange way in the beginning... This movie is about a girl who goes back in time to save the parents from being killed by a killer. But I just felt like it was just a different story that didn't make the movie more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want a good time, watch this. If you get a good kick out of it, you may even get a kick out yourself. I enjoyed it. The first half is pretty much a comedy (but not really in any way bad) while the second half gets more serious. It was nice seeing two actors play opposite each other. The other parts were OK. It's not very good but it's not bad at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a few bad movies but I've never watched a truly bad one in my entire life. A small village, a group of guys going off to a beach to party. Then we get this: a bunch of naked, overweight, middle aged men sitting around playing cards and talking about all the things they're going to do at their beach house...until the girls come home and tell them that there's a problem with some of the guys. Then the guy who's in charge of the security is fired and the guy that comes out of nowhere says, "let's just go and make a big party for this thing." And we go...and what do we see? I really don't know. A bunch of guys in their underwear, dancing to some music on a beach, naked people all around, and a couple of naked women. I suppose they all come to each other in a sort of subconscious search for the perfect sex position, and then find the perfect position. I don't understand how a movie like this is on the air. I can't say I can recommend it. It's not too bad. It would make a pretty good short run in a Saturday morning variety show.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found the movie   to be a   bad  ,   but it   got worse   after it    started.   The   movie   is   a  bad       -   It's not   very good   as it starts   not too bad,   then it goes   wrong   and   the ending   was   just   plain poor  .   There   wasn't enough   of a  theme   in   it  I'm afraid;   no   characters   were   interesting and    the   plot was   so   dull   with little to no   action   that I'd like to have seen it more than once just to see what the plot was . (I didn't mind the plot and the plot didn't bother me and in fact there were several scenes that were so well done in the movie, but I thought the acting was awful. There were more than a few times when they were yelling in their throat and it was annoying.)   But, it  is   a  great ,  bad and  ugly   movie with a plot that is so dull that   you could spend the whole movie just watching those characters being stupid and talking,  even though the dialogue was pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a great deal of truth in the movie's title. When I first heard about this film I thought it must be some kind of hoax. The story of these "Wolverines" is too strange to be true. The man who made the film, a former schoolteacher, was unable to pay any of the money he borrowed to make the movie. After that he had to sell everything and live off the interest on what was left. The only reason the film is available today is because the producer sold the movie rights to a man in Ohio, a well-known actor who also has a long and illustrious career in Hollywood.  The film is simply too strange and too far fetched to be a genuine true story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie does not have any of the qualities of a good movie. It is just a terrible movie that has no potential as a movie. There is an odd scene in it where the girl walks over and tells the boy that her brother died in a car crash. The boy is very surprised that this girl would go to a funeral and he is sad when she tells him. That is when he discovers that she is a witch who killed him with a knife and he can no longer come back. This movie did nothing to entertain and instead it is just horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is not bad but its not even good. It reminds me a lot of some of the crappy horror movies that came out in the 90's. It also has a bit of a campy atmosphere. I'm not even sure if it has a plot but there is a little girl that stumbles into a creepy abandoned house. She starts to freak out (not that it was creepy to begin with) and has to be saved. The rest of the movie has her going into a series of haunted houses looking for a way to get out.   I guess that is where the problems with the movie begin. It is a cheesy, stupid movie that doesn't even try to scare you. This is a good thing because at least there are no vampires or ghosts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know how I missed this movie when I saw it in the theater in 2006. I'm a good-looking guy with a pretty mouth, and since my friends in high school didn't like me because I looked like a dude from the "Boys" movie with big sunglasses and a red and brown coat, I was pretty intimidated. Then one day we saw the movie in our local theater. It's a cheesy, but entertaining, romantic comedy. But then after the first 10 minutes of the film, when the couple is still trying to convince the other that they can have a baby, I stopped watching it. Then the movie changed to a guy and girl who are going to a college party. The guy is an ex-marine that is trying to break into the music business while the girl is a "hot girl" that is there to show off her great ass. We all laugh as they're in the dorm room and the guy starts kissing the girl and she likes it. They then proceed to fuck for 20 minutes and the last 5 minutes the guy has a condom in his hand while the naked girl is still in the doorway. I was never again interested in seeing this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so excited to see "Kabukibu" last year that I bought the first one at my local video store as soon as it came out. As a kid who loved "The Cat in the Hat", "It's a Wonderful Life", and "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", I thought that this movie, about a cat with a giant, metal head that runs around in his neighborhood and eats everyone who comes near it, would be a fun movie to watch. Boy, was I ever wrong! I'm not even kidding about that last statement! This movie was so horrible that I would recommend you do not even watch it if you can't stomach it. The only good thing about it was that it's got a "bad guy" (a very bad guy) that has the appearance of a cat, but I bet you don't even know what a cat is! There's also one cat that can talk (I guess you get what you pay for with a movie like this), but he doesn't actually say anything. Most of the movie is just the cat's head rolling across the screen, destroying and eating whatever it sees. It's like they tried to make a cute movie and they totally blew it!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a movie that made me laugh and cry at the same time and I can only say that I cannot be in the same state of mind at the end of the movie after watching it.  It's a funny movie and some of the scenes are worth seeing.  If you like comedies, I would recommend that you go see this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To start of, let me say that I like this movie. It is a fun movie that has a little bit of action but not much, but then again it doesn't do anything new either. The story itself is just about some guys trying to get out of a gang but eventually they can't. But there is a funny scene that makes it just a little more enjoyable. The song at the end is a little short but at least it's funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a way,    The Last Starfighter is a good movie. The film looks cool, and at a certain point, you get that   feeling that you're about to enjoy a lot of cool space action scenes. That's pretty much where   begins. The Last War is one of the most awesome, epic space adventures I've ever seen. It's got everything. A cool hero, awesome villains, awesome space battles. It even has a few moments to make you want to throw up.   But   What really gets me is that there was a lot more to this movie than the battles. The villains are cool, the space battles are cool. But the real action that really sells the movie?   That's when the   characters are not talking. That part of   is where  the film really shines.  The film does not get much better than this.  For those who have never seen   this movie, it   has been called "the worst   science fiction film ever made".  It has some fun scenes with the heroes, and great action, but all of it is ruined by terrible dialogue.  It just seems that the filmmakers did a bad job with this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The opening scene is a long-winded monologue from the film's main character (played by Daniel Craig) about how the film is supposed to be a drama about a father (Daniel Craig) with three sons (played also by Craig's sons), the eldest of whom is a famous actor. It's all too easy to see this as a bit of a cliché, but the film has a couple of nice touches: The director is quite good, and I've never seen the three boys as unlikable, or as unpleasant. The acting is also pretty good, with the three actors getting their moments, and the scenes are really well-acted, even if this film does have a couple more moments of clumsiness than the others, as when one of the brothers takes the role of a detective, which isn't exactly the lead role in a drama. Also there is an interesting psychological theme about the father-son relationship, which I found really fascinating.   I also really enjoyed the ending, which is a quite good one. The family has to go abroad for several years, before they return home. The father dies, before he can see his two children off on their journey. There are a couple nice visual touches, including the way the mother's house looks (by the end of the film the house has been turned into a hotel and all the furniture has been thrown into the swimming pool), and the way a couple (one played by Naomi Watts) get into bed in the middle of the night. Overall this is a nice film to watch (you can find it on iTunes), which is good because it is rather hard to find a good thriller nowadays. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a train wreck!  This has got to be the worst movie ever made.  It's bad to the point of being sickening!    Why didn't I see this movie when it first came out and make a bad joke about the fact it looks like the set of an old movie about a crazy man in a tree?   In the first place the movie is bad.   It's bad for about a reason--there are no laughs to be had, and only very bad things happen.  We see this poor guy (who I will not name--but there are plenty of other names I'm not going to mention) sitting in a chair eating a meal, and at some point he is disturbed by a loud noise, which of course happens to be someone knocking on a door and saying 'Who the hell are you?'   His answer is to ask them to tell him who it is.  He does not know and the person says it is his son.  This seems to drive the guy crazy--he yells at the man who is holding the door--this person can't believe that the son is his--they are not related by blood but they are not unrelated.  They are only a few years apart in age but it doesn't matter.  Now if there was some kind of comic relief it would be funny...   but of course there is none.  There is a man's son who has a dream that he is getting married.  It is to the sister of the man he wants to marry.  So this poor fellow--who has no interest in either--is just going to sit here and wait for the marriage to take place.  When the wedding does take place his wife is so scared she flees.  The son of this man has some money, which he has been saving up for the wedding.  But there is no wedding and so this poor man continues to wait for his son to find his wife.  Of course he is unable to find her and there is a knock on the door.  His son opens it and it is one of his friends--a young fool who has some kind crazy plans for him.  Oh, and there are also two other people--one an old lady and one a priest.  And so he waits for this wedding that is going to be ruined because of his stupidity.  Then he hears noises that he can't get out of his head--

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The one-liner that comes at the end of the movie: "I'm gonna kill your son" doesn't really work. But it is a great piece of cinematic sleight-of-hand. It takes several minutes before they are really discovered, but the character "Curt" is just a huckleberry. It makes no sense for him to have a son who knows everything. I wonder if the filmmakers had to cut the scene where they run around in the house before they were discovered because they felt that it would have taken away a few of the audience's more positive feelings about the film. This is a very entertaining story. It's also one where there is an awful lot of gore, which is why I thought it was a little overdone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was quite excited about this movie and the trailers were great. I was also really excited to see this movie because I am an avid Harry Potter fan.   Now, I have not watched this movie so far but I am still very interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a mess.   First of all, there is not only a lack of continuity between the movie (or the book or the novel), but also a lack in plot.  The main character is introduced at a very young age.  This means that he is not old enough to have experienced significant adult life experiences.  It also means that for some time, all he has been able to experience and enjoy is a life of adventure and adventure (and often murder and murder-at-the-stake).   To make matters worse, the main character has been introduced as a boy who was abused.  After the mother died he was taken into the care of the Reverend.  There is almost no development in the Reverend's character.  He is a very rigid and closed man.  However, we do see an incident with another boy that may point to a positive experience with a child's father.  And finally, we see another boy who has also been abused.   The film tries to give us a positive story about two very different boys.  But the end result is a horrible movie that is only enjoyable if you are prepared to take all the worst scenes in the movie seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For once, the old-fashioned Hollywood is back in action. I didn't know what to expect from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised. This time around we have a young man who wants to be an actor. He's a little too ambitious and too naive to know the first way to get there and he tries all sorts of weird ways to get to where he wants to go. It turns out that a great opportunity comes up for him at a very cheap movie theater that he sees on his way to the studio. He goes in there and watches a film that looks quite familiar and he starts to get very excited.  The film is actually a western in the style of the Wild West.  In a good way.   This is the kind of film that reminds me of the good old days.  It looks like a good old Western. There's not much acting in it, but they did an OK job of making the actors look convincing and believable.  At the time, these types of films weren't very popular, so the film wasn't exactly a huge hit. However, I am glad I saw this film because it reminds me how much good old Hollywood can do. It's entertaining and very entertaining.      I've seen some decent westerns, but nothing quite like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason I can't stand this movie is that it is nothing more than just a cheap, over rated, pointless, pretentious "fantasy film" by someone who can't write a decent, intelligent film in his life. It is not a serious film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not well made. This is a film that I hope never gets finished.   I don't know what the big idea was with this movie. It was an obvious rehash of the first 2 movies.  It was all action and no comedy.  I didn't care for the special effects. I don' t think that the special powers would work in any other film.  The story didn't make a whole lot of sense. Why is the guy with the blue suit fighting other guys with blue suits? It was just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the most frustrating things about reading the comments of other critics is how many can't believe that they're reviewing a bad comedy.   (I wish it were funny though.  I mean, I'm sure it isn't.  But, the jokes are so bad and so unfunny (especially the ones about the cat).   This one gets a 3/10 (again), it's not even that funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably the worst movie of all time.  The movie is about a cop who is given an assignment to break up a gang fight in a movie theater in Chicago.  While he's out in the parking lot the crew of the movie are arrested and he has to save the day.  He's in for a tough task.  This movie is filled with crap from the opening scene until the credits roll.   In the first scene we're shown a movie which seems like it could have been made in the fifties.  There's a guy who talks about how he's not into violence and there's lots of guns.  But when the gang fights it never really gets really exciting.  So the guy just starts shooting everybody, including the police officer who's watching them fight.  When the cop sees what the guy is doing there's a fight between the guy and the cop.   There's one scene where the cop is getting beat up by the guys but he's also getting his head blown off by one guy.  It's like watching two guys getting ready to have a fight but without the ability to actually do it.  Now of course a lot of people thought this movie was a lot funnier than it was and I'm one of them.  Some people like to watch it to see people beat the crap out of each other.  And some people like this movie because they can't believe how bad a movie can be.  I guess I was one of the latter ones because the movie was so bad I wasn't even laughing at it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It should be noted that this is one of the better horror movies ever made, and probably the best. If the ending didn't make it scarier it's hard to imagine a better one. The cinematography is stunning, from the opening scene of a car crashing to a woman sitting on her porch to a couple sitting in bed. The characters are all very well written and the acting is top notch, with Richard Gere being the only actor that fails to live up to the hype. He is the "scariest" guy you will ever meet, but he is also a very charming guy! There are, however, a couple of cheap tricks here and there, such as an extra set of footsteps at the end of the movie. This leads to a few scenes that are a bit rushed and confusing. It also has some good songs that are pretty good. It is not, however a very good movie overall. It's the ending that really puts the scare into the audience.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was totally sucked into this stupid movie when it came out because I was totally in love with it. I think it's one of the stupidest movies ever made.

It is completely terrible!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a few parts to this movie that really are bad.  I found myself wishing that the movie was longer as the movie starts off really cheesy, then gets really bad.    So I've been meaning to watch this movie for a while, but it's just been too long since I last watched it.  That being said, the movie is really good and the whole cast and crew do a really great job, but the actual story of the movie isn't great.  The story is really just about people making dumb movies in the mid 80's (not to mention the mid 90's), but is not a bad comedy at all.  While I think it is probably a decent movie overall, there really is just not much for it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't say I'd be surprised if this movie turned out to be a complete disaster. But I think I was probably more annoyed by how lazy the script and production was than I was shocked.    A lot of the characters are annoying.  There are even a few instances where the actors are annoying, or even downright mean, which is a very bad thing.  But it's the script that I can fault.  The characters are basically "villains", with the main characters just trying to survive in a world where there are no heroes.  I understand there have to be villains in these stories, but I find it hard to believe that one main character is actually going to be the villain.  And it's bad enough that his friends and other characters just go along with his plans.  It seems like a lot of effort was put into the story, especially given its lack of any sort of mystery.  Also, since so much of the movie takes place in the forest, I'm wondering how much the original movie was cut out to make room for this one.  For every minute of screen time there are three minutes of the same shots of the forest.  Even the original had some cool shots, but they were often drowned out by shots of more people trying to make an escape in a hurry.  These people should have been running away from the forest not getting captured and sent on a journey.  A few scenes from the original that I liked better:  *  The final scene.  This is probably my favorite part of the original.  It shows that the people of "Dark Continent" have a different sort of culture than the people from "New World".   * The scene where I think the girl dies.  Here the original does a good job of showing that a witch is capable of killing someone and that the witch has powers beyond imagination.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work here.  To make matters worse, the character that would have been the witch is shown to be very easily swayed by her own good moods.  Not a particularly bad scene, just not a great one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The bad movie is a horrible flick.  It's like watching someone get a blowjob through a tire.    It's just pathetic.  It isn't funny.  There is no acting, no acting at all.  The acting is pathetic as well.  This is a stupid movie.  A horrible movie, with awful acting, a bad plot and an awful special effects.  I could watch this movie over and over, all to myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As you can see by my review, it's no wonder this film is so bad. The movie is based on an awful novel written by Peter S. Beagle and adapted from an old story by L. Frank Baum. I don't mind a fantasy movie about a wizard's grandson, but this one is horrible. This movie is not only very bad, but it's really embarrassing. Even when they do bad magic tricks like they did at the end of the movie, it is still embarrassing. One reason why I gave it three stars is because it was good to see an old movie. The only reason I gave the movie four stars is that it was entertaining but still a disgrace.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this is a bad film and I don't think you'll like it if you like the original.  For a film of this genre, the acting is dreadful.   The acting is so bad that they can't even act for a scene that has nothing to do with what they are in the middle of doing.    They all go in, get on their horse, and do this strange, unnatural-sounding thing with the horses.  I mean this is the sort of thing you would imagine a horse would do in a movie but no, they really go in and out of each other's heads and start trying to kiss each other.  That sounds like something a hippy or a shaman would do I tell you.  There is nothing funny about this movie.  If it weren't so bad, I'd give it a B and say, "If you're willing to make fun of a bad cowboy movie, I'm willing to buy the movie." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies I don't like to watch. The story is all wrong and the characters all stupid. I found this movie to be like a bad dream. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The third part of the Dark City series, but a rather boring, uninspired and pointless sequel.   It would have been interesting to see some of the characters of the first movie, because this movie seemed to have a different focus to the one in the first film; that's right, it was boring.  In my opinion, it's rather pointless to do a sequel to a film that doesn't need an expansion, and then to make this one even less interesting.  Again, no characters of any sort, no action, and so on.  I can't see this series becoming a success any longer.  This would be a good time to review the first Dark City film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst thing about this movie is that the movie is based on a real life, so it's not as farfetched that it could happen.   There are many stories about men who went on to be serial killers; one of the most famous was in the newspaper in the 1930's: George H. Norris, a "tall, lanky man," who wore "a huge moustache and was always sporting a large beard." Norris was apparently born in Oklahoma and had a long history with Oklahoma law enforcement before the state sent him to the Federal penitentiary in New York City. He was released and went to Oklahoma, and was on parole for 10 years. He decided to go up to Canada to live, which he did, and he had one last murder: he "decided to commit his final crime by drowning his wife in the bathtub." At the time there was a lot of speculation about where he could get a wife, so he took a woman he had met in Canada to a local hotel and convinced her that he would take her to Europe. She traveled to Europe on a bus and arrived in Paris where he would kill her and dump her body into the Seine. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am in complete shock. I never thought my days with George were over. Not that he wasn't entertaining, but after watching these films from the late 60's and early 70's I had lost hope. It seems that all the talented film makers were on the downslide. But George didn't let me down. He made me love movies again. I love these movies so much more now than I did when I was a kid. They have such a dark, mysterious, and macabre feel to them. I loved the fact that we never saw them on any of the movie channels and so never had to sit through them. It was like being a kid again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say that    is a good movie is saying too much. The only reason why I rated it a "5" is because the film does have some redeeming elements, but for the most part, this is a very mediocre, cheesy "tribute" to the cult classic, The Last Starfighter. And I think if you have seen it, you would probably agree, too. If only the film had been a little more creative, the ending would be a helluva lot more exciting, but, you are all just too darned boring. Well done!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a guy named Jack. He's a guy who, to keep his family safe, is willing to break the laws of physics. He does it all the time and has never made a bad decision. It's always for the right reasons. Except when he breaks into the local police station and tries to use the police force as his personal protection force. As a cop, he's a total pussy. I thought it was interesting but boring and too long.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is set in a prison where a bunch of crooks have escaped, and are holed up in a small, rundown apartment. They're up to no good, and one of them has a very strange gift: a giant, ugly, sentient eyeball named Tatum. As the movie progresses, the crooks begin to get very sloppy with the Tatum, and make a mess of things.  In what, I don't know, has to be the most insane thing I've seen all year:   The movie isn't even that bad.    It's a little bit of a stretch to explain why, but it's really kind of a goofy movie with a very silly plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a bad looking movie. I didn't like the movie at all. There was no action, the only thing that came close to a good fight was between a man and a big scary dog. This movie is overrated.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is another one of those films you don't expect anything out of. I guess the makers of this movie are having an awful time, even if they have a pretty well-known star. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's all about a bunch of hooligans running around and getting into crazy, funny fights. I really don't care about most of the characters except for the main villain, he is so over the top the show makes it easy to laugh at him.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie with all the elements needed to succeed. Well, most of them.  The dialogue is the funniest in the movie, and it makes the movie quite enjoyable.  I think that there is a point that is reached where it is just a matter of waiting until the movie will end.  This movie, I think, is an underrated gem of a film, and I would suggest that anyone who thinks that it has problems should just stay away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The good: - The best female lead ever in a big screen movie - Amazing fight scene - Fantastic special effects - Great soundtrack! The bad: - I do not like the idea that the bad guys had to wear giant helmets and the action had to be cut out so the people in them could see and hear the fight - I like the way the baddies were portrayed, some of them looked like they came out of an X-Men movie, but I wouldn't want to see any more X-men movies!  This review is for the special features and not for the movie itself. There are a lot of really cool special effects in this movie. One of the coolest ones involves a bad guy dressed in a green suit who is riding a motorcycle. He is riding at a very high speed and the motorcycle does a back flip and he lands right onto a pile of trash that is in front of him. The pile of garbage breaks apart and the bad guy jumps out and he starts shooting at the truck that is driving the garbage truck. The trailer then cuts to the guy standing up, then down, then up, all over again. The next shot shows the garbage guy shooting at another garbage truck and the same thing happens again. And again, and again. It is a really cool effect. And what is more awesome is that the guy is wearing a green helmet that is covered in a lotof trash. A lot of the time, when the truck is going fast, his helmet comes off and the trash goes flying out the top. This guy's whole body is covered with garbage but all he can see is the green helmet! This could be the greatest movie title ever created.  I've never seen a more brilliant comic strip! It is hilarious and bizarre, funny and sad at the same time! I had to put on the sunglasses to read it, the images are too shocking for a kid to see. You won't be able to stop laughing at it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a little scared to watch this movie. It looked like a really nasty looking movie. The acting is atrocious. They tried to make it seem like someone was getting kidnapped but in reality they were getting their bodies ripped open. If they are going to do a sequel I don't want it to be like this one! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The thing with this movie is it has such an unbelievable story to it that it's hard to believe. Even after all the terrible movies that are out there there like Alien, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Alien 3 it still isn't bad for a summer blockbuster! The thing is with the alien that the crew is sent on board a spaceship and are told that "There is a planet where the natives are totally stupid and have no intelligence of their own" so they set out to study this planet while also trying to find some way to stop the aliens from coming back. This story doesn't work so well though, even with a cast that includes Tom Selleck, John Candy, Richard Pryor, John Hinckley Jr. and even a cameo from the late John Belushi. It has an okay script and some bad jokes but it just doesn't feel like a good movie. I guess I'm just really bored and bored to death with this summer.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why my wife doesn't come out of the bathroom, I don't have to yell at her to get out of there (I know it's a joke and a dirty one but it's still pretty funny). She would never know that it was a joke as she'd stop in and say "Why would you do that?!" like she was a goody goody doll. But then I'll always think of those people from the movie, especially the bad guy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If anyone has been through a rough patch, let this be it. It's just so bad. I found this to be so depressing that I almost did not finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember seeing this a few years ago when it first came out. I didn't understand the plot, which was kind of weird. It just happened one day and then the next. It didn't explain anything, I didn to it in the same words that all the other horror movies were saying, this is about the mind and being able to understand other people. It never really made a sense to me and I remember just leaving the theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this adaptation of the Stephen King novella "Misery", we get more of the same: a bunch of weird and nasty characters, some of them just plain ridiculous, but mostly just plain annoying and stupid. In a rather odd reversal of "Misfortune" and "Insomnia", this film does not take any chances with its story, so much so that King's characters seem like they have come straight from a dream. Not only do the characters seem more or less real (I mean, if they are actually the characters in this story, I would be quite shocked!) but so does King himself! I am not the only one who thinks so; the audience also seems like a mixture of old folks, children, and, yes, the dead! I would not have been at all surprised if a film version of "A Good Marriage" had been made as it seems the director, William Shatner, also has a good sense of humor... Anyway, if you are interested in "Dirty Hands", "Mischief, Mayhem, Madness and Scandal" or any other Stephen King tale, I am afraid you are in for a bad time. This movie was made for the general public who does not know any better and is not prepared for the horror which King's stories can bring. It is a total waste of two hours of your life. A shame in a film with so much good quality in it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So after reading all the great negative reviews I had a very bad feeling about this movie. I was expecting a pretty boring movie, but noooo. This movie was so stupid I felt like I was seeing it with my own eyes. The movie was shot in the same old way as all those 80's films where there is an old woman who gets a crazy man to help her build a house by throwing rocks at her. The old woman is a psychotic crazy woman who wants to build an "Angel" out of rocks! There are other people in the house, the woman's granddaughter and a crazy old man. There is also a crazy lady in a bikini. It was also boring to be honest. I thought it was over way too soon, so I had no desire to watch it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a bad film and it's not even a bad version of a good film. It's a bad rip off of the good movie and the bad movie is a horrible and boring movie. There's a lot of swearing in this film and the film is filled with a bunch of bad jokes in bad scenes. I don't understand how anyone thinks this movie will be good. It makes little sense and I'm sorry, but I can't believe someone could make a film like this. It is an utter waste of a film and I hope it will get a sequel.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie with all the worst bad performances. I can only describe it as being like a bad version of "Jaws" (if only). A friend of mine said it reminds her of "Kiss of the Damned".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main character is an idiot and the plot is bad; The story is not only boring but also quite pathetic. The character is supposed to be an evil villain but he ends up being an idiot who's not much better than the other characters in the movie. He's just a big jerk and it doesn't make sense that he was a bad guy and a hero at the same time. He had a couple of bad attempts to make the plot interesting but they never worked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For the most part, the film is a very well-acted, well-edited movie. The acting is by far my favorite aspect of the film. It is often tense, intense, and frightening. There is always tension, the suspense is great and it never lets up. The movie is a little slow at first, however by the end of the movie it has a great deal of tension and the characters are clearly defined.  The movie features one of the coolest monsters I have ever seen:  It has the look of something out of a classic monster movie. It looks so much like a demon that it will be hard to miss. The monster walks slowly. It moves its eyes. It slowly raises and lowers it's arm like a snake does. The film is just as creepy as you would expect.  There are only two reasons for watching the film:  I think it is a great movie and I hope that someone out there likes it.  It may sound strange, but the movie is great for teenagers and young adults who don't want to take their lives seriously.  I do think it takes a great actor to pull off the look and sound of the monster. It makes a great addition to a classic horror film and it was one of my favorites as a kid.  "It's just a flesh and blood thing I keep in my refrigerator." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is like a movie with no heart.   The first scene shows our hero being attacked by the "fearsome monster" (or whatever the hell the name is), who looks like a giant green alien.  As I am sure any fan of the classic Star Wars is aware, "The Creature From the Black Lagoon" is a real monster.  For one thing, he looks like an alien from outer space, but when he has a gun in one hand he still manages to look like an average-sized humanoid.   If you think that sounds like something a human would think when faced with a human, you are absolutely correct.  But if you think about it, what makes the Creature from the Black Hole special is that he seems almost human.  Why would a green, slimy creature need to wear clothes or be able to talk?  This kind of creature would look like a walking, talking plant from outer solar system!   The second time we see "The Thing," he is on a spaceship.  The creature from outer spacia has been there for 10,000 years, and is slowly devouring other creatures.   But what the hell?  A monster this size eating creatures this small, I really don't get it.  Also, we don't see him eat any of the aliens on the ship, we only see him on a TV screen.  We don't even see him come close enough to any of them to be considered a threat.  It is like he is a movie character in an old monster movie.   The third time "The Monster" gets a chance to get even bigger, he destroys the planet.  This planet he comes to is actually in the middle of the universe, so why would it matter if he destroyed it?  Even if a creature this size could go that far, it probably couldn't handle the speed or gravity of space.  In addition, the monster is constantly getting smaller, and his gun is only able to shoot out tiny little bursts.  Finally, the "monster" decides he is so fat and disgusting, he doesn't care about what happens to the planet, so he jumps into the sun.  When the sun goes supernova, everyone on the planet dies.  I guess when a giant, green monster goes super-nova, you know he really is a threat...right?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'll never know why Hollywood did not make a new version of the Twilight Zone. This movie is just a piece of junk, but it does have some nice ideas that come out right. The main character is pretty cool and the story is just kind of silly, but I can't say I'm disappointed in the film. (9/10)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting much more from this movie from the trailers, and so was I impressed!   The story begins, and is pretty much in line with every horror movie ever made.   It's a creepy, dark movie with a creepy girl, some gory events, and some other gory things, and one creepy guy that has never been shown in a movie before.  In the beginning, there's a weird feeling that I had when watching a horror movie that's a little out of left field.  The character designs are creepy and creepy, and the music isn't terrible either, but it's too much at times.  For some reason, I don't really feel the need to have any more than one eye open.  It has a pretty nice ending, but unfortunately it has a strange ending and a weird and very weird ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a shame that this movie is so bad. It looks good in the trailer, looks like a fun animated movie with good jokes. It has bad jokes, bad animation, and is a big bore. It's like every thing about this movie was a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For the money I can do without that lame love story, which takes place in the mid-1950's; and the other one is just a rehash of "Hitchhikers Guide" and "The Exterminator" - a movie from the 1950's that was remade in 1995:  A man is hired by the police to find a dead body in a forest. The problem: the dead body is not actually dead - but is still breathing. The murderer has to be one of the police's most dangerous men, because he is not just dangerous, but also very smart: he has a plan to get out of town but he must first find a way to get back. He is assisted by a local witch who, among other tricks, is really an actress.  There is also a guy who comes to tell him about a prophecy and the great power of the witch to help him.  This is a very low-budget and low-quality film.  What I really thought of it was that it's a good excuse to show how bad the police are: they spend all their time fighting small scale crimes.  It's a very bad movie for kids.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In retrospect I'm quite shocked how far this one got. When I first heard it I thought it would be one of those "funny" movies I'd see at the movies. Then I saw the trailers and my expectations went up another notch. It looked pretty funny, it seemed like a lot of fun, and then it went the wrong way. It wasn't funny. It didn't even sound funny, which I suppose you could see as a positive thing. It was just silly. I kept thinking "Why was this a movie?" I mean, there were so many things wrong with this movie that I had to laugh out loud in order to maintain my sanity. It's like watching a two-hour bad movie where the director tries to make it three hours by adding more crap that just doesn't even work. But the point remains that it was an absolutely terrible movie. It felt very forced, it didn't have a good script, it just felt like an attempt to get people who weren't really fans of the comic book to enjoy it. I don't know. I probably won't go see it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie is made worse by the poor acting in this film. All the characters are flat, even the actors are. This is made all the more worse by that terrible song that they use to open the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've not watched a movie for over 10 years and I have yet to hear anyone say this is a good movie. There are some good scenes and a well-acted performance from the lead but it doesn't even come close to being good.   If a movie is bad enough to make everyone say it's a bad time then it's bad enough that it's impossible to take a chance on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie I'd say is not "bad" but it's pretty bad. I'd give the director credit because his first film (which didn't even make the 'wedding' circuit) was a fine work of art but this is a film that tries to be more than that. There is not a lot happening. The girls are introduced, we have the 'good' old-fashioned love triangle and even with a new girl, the bad old-fashion love triangle doesn't change; it just moves from one guy to the next. In fact, the 'bad' old fashion love triangle is just as dominant in this film as in his previous, which means that 'bad love triangle' will probably never change. This is certainly not the best film of the year but it is certainly the worst. It's almost funny but I guess it's not. There are better films of late, I'll grant that much, and the same film could have been made much better by a few people in a studio. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a comedy or a horror movie. Not really. It's more of a horror, but it is definitely not a comedy. There are no laughs. There's a lot of very creepy shit going down here. I don't know, I feel like the whole movie could have been in a horror comedy. This movie didn't make me feel any better for the weekend. I didn't feel like I was watching a funny movie. It felt like more of the same, except for an extra dash of creepy shit. Maybe I don.t like horror movies. I guess that's how I feel after the first movie of this trilogy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The second attempt at The Terminator was the worst movie I have ever seen. That's right!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was pretty crap. The acting wasn't bad but most of the actors were really bad. The cinematography was pretty bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember seeing a lot of bad movies in high school, and a lot I liked, too. This one's a prime example. It's an 80s sci-fi film which makes no effort to be anything more than an 80's sci- fi film. But in terms of how it's made, it is more like a 90's version of a 90s sci fi film, with a bunch of 80's actors doing 80's voices. It is also completely forgettable, at least in its story, which is pretty mediocre. It does have a pretty cool action sequence, with some cool special effects, like giant glowing balls of light (which look nothing like the real thing, which are basically just large, stationary spheres of light) blowing up buildings and killing people. There are also a bunch more cheesy, cheesy 80's action sequences, including a chase scene with a car, which happens to be a car from the movie, that has its front end blown off. But those are just about all the good elements. It doesn't even have a "plot" to speak of, so there's really nothing to recommend it. But for kids who didn't want to see anything else and had money to burn, this may be a good buy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really love this movie, and it's also one of the best sci fi movies I've ever seen.   While I don't see the movie myself very often, I often talk about it with a group of friends.  The story of the film is pretty interesting and the technology is definitely interesting.  I think this movie deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Sci Fi/Fantasy Film, just because the movie is so amazing and I find this film to be so original.      If you liked this, please like my other movies
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The one good thing to say about this movie is that no one was injured.   (Except for the man with a broken leg, who is actually the victim of a really nasty car accident.)   A lot of people seem to have watched this movie with one purpose in mind: to get the movie's bad rating down to a three. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never thought I would find a film that was more of an insult. A movie that I thought would be very funny and light hearted. The movie is full of very negative stereotyped attitudes about women in a society, women are seen as submissive, weak, emotional. The women are kept captive by men who abuse them and make them do all the hard work, they are never given freedom to do anything that they want to do, and the woman who is supposed to be their friend is very angry, she will beat anyone who makes a move on her. The most sad thing was not that she was a bad person, it was that she had no friends. The worst part of the movie is that this is very real. I can say with complete confidence that it is 100% true. This is an extremely poor film and I would not wish it upon my worst enemy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really wish I never read this. I loved the idea, but the writing was so...bad. I don't care about who this actor is, who the director is, and that the movie is bad. If the movie weren't bad, I would have given it two stars, but it really is bad in everything. The story is basically:  When a group of teenagers find a dead body of a woman in the woods, and are trying to figure out how it got there, they encounter a monster that doesn't just scare them, but kills them all and eats them, and leaves a message to the police about how the police are going to be killed soon.  So, there it is. I won't even bother going into the bad acting, which is really bad. I mean, we've all read about this type of movie and they are almost always horrible, and if you can get past the badacting, the movie has some great set pieces. But in the end, we see that all these teens are dead and they have never been to a prom before, so the police don't even try to get to the bottom of why this happened, or why it took so long. It's a story that could have been really, really good.  I didn't even get why they shot the guy.  Why do these kids always kill themselves with their guns? I get it they were drunk and they were scared, but really, there is no reason they should have a gun, and the fact that they get a gun from the police after they're already dead is really weird. They would have been better off with a taser, and a good old fashioned TASER WOUND.  But as I said, the only good thing about this movie is the set pieces that happened.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie, I just cannot believe how bad this is. You have this guy, a man called John Munch, that lives in this haunted house where he is haunted by this ghost who he meets and later becomes obsessed by and eventually kills in the basement. Then he has to move out as he has been haunted by another ghost. He has a very bad case of "manic depression" and he is constantly depressed. I just don't get it, why can't these people just have a normal life without being depressed. What is the point of having a haunted house when someone has to live there constantly? How can someone have a good life if they are depressed? I just hate this movie, don't recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you love movies that are full of ridiculous stunts, action sequences and special effects, then, like me, you will love this movie. The action sequences are incredible - from the airplane that breaks down while shooting guns in the ocean, to an amazing gun-firing fight in a jungle with the famous Brazilian jaguar. And all this while the main characters are driving around in a car that is covered in sand. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To have a bad acting performance from Gary Oldman as a sad sack is nothing short of mind-bending.  There are no surprises to be found as Oldman plays the role of a man so desperate for affection from an alluring woman that he is willing to sacrifice anything in order to get it.  Gary Oldmans portrayal of his character is so painful to watch that if this film were on HBO it would be in every drama and crime series ever made.  To be sure, Oldman is not perfect by any means but he did an admirable job as Gary Old Man.  I guess I am just not a big fan of the character as this is a film that is about as bad as it can be.  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is terrible. If you love a good cheesy western, this is the one to see! There's a good cast, especially for this age. And it was a great western, if not in the genre of the time. This film was released in the early 1930's, so it's not going to be an accurate remake, but at least it is a good old fashioned western.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're gonna be critical of the first movie, what a waste of time! For every scene this movie wastes, there are more that could've been made. The story is basically the same from the first one. A group of astronauts have to travel to Mars in order to make an experiment that may lead to the discovery of an effective cure to cancer. At the same time, an evil group of terrorists are trying to take over the planet. So yeah, the story is still pretty old-fashioned and it's just annoying that the movie doesn't have a lot of surprises to it. The film takes a while to get to the point where the astronauts are actually trying to go to Mars. I'd love to know what the story would've been like if it were a little bit faster. The movie is about the astronauts as much as it is about Mars, but it's not exactly a good idea to make a movie about a bunch of astronauts and not know quite how to go about it. In the end, though, it works. It has some great footage, a great script by Jim Fidler, a strong cast, and a couple of very funny scenes. But all the good stuff could've happened much sooner. It really doesn't get better than the first three or four minutes!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be fair to the director John Waters, there were several scenes that, on one level, could have made sense, but which on another level did not.  One of them was the scene where a mother, who has lost everything she has, takes the little boy to the window in her house to get a bird's-eye view of the city.  There are lots of people around her.  You can't tell if the man who is standing in front of her, who is carrying something, is really a man or a woman.  He is tall.  His head is high up in the air.  It's a very simple shot, but it's so beautiful that it becomes very sad.  Another scene in which there are some strange sights was the one where the woman goes to a party on a yacht with some other people.  The other people are dressed in a way that would be very hard to identify if not for the strange, strange clothes.  If I went to a dinner party or a party-in-a-boat and saw what we have seen on this movie, I'd be terrified!  Another good thing about this movie is the music.  In this movie the music and the dialogue can be as wonderful as the scenery and the costumes.  I'm also sure that there is a lot of hidden talent in the people who made this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie once. It is not bad at all. However it is an old story from a very old director. So many people say it is the most beautiful film ever made. I disagree because I think it is really bad. It has a few good moments, but I doubt I will ever want to watch this one again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this film and thought it was so bad, I didn't want to watch it. My wife loved it. The film is so bad that a lot of the people that should have been able to be there didn't make it. Most of the actors have a lot going for them. The cast was not bad at all. The worst acting is made by an actor that shouldn't be there. I was laughing my butt off when I first watched this film. It was a fun movie that had a good plot. The acting was pretty bad. Most the film was filmed during the time of the American Civil War. It had a Confederate Soldier trying to convince an Officer he is a Confederate and has the rank of Captain. They are not exactly truthful. If you read any of the books on the Civil War, you will know what happened. It really wasn't that funny and was only funny for the first 10 minutes. The second and third scenes were boring and just about all the characters had one flaw in common: they all think they are the greatest. I didn´t understand a word they said. And I guess that makes it even more enjoyable. When you think of a movie like this, you don´t want to laugh, but if the film doesn´t make you laugh then it probably has no point. It is not really that funny. It makes for good viewing with no laughs. If the film had any kind of humor then it would have been better but the script does not offer anything in the way of humor. This movie was so poor that even if you are not a big fan of the Civil war you will not find anything funny about it. I give this movie a D+.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are a lot of films that will have you saying "what a waste of time." If you want to sit in a dark theater and watch one movie, then this is it. This is a pretty standard story of a girl that has a dream of flying and goes to a school to try her hand. She becomes a member of this flying club and they do a flying show. Unfortunately, they can't do anything with her and she ends up as a normal person. So this isn't a good story about a kid that was meant to be like a superhero. What I found interesting was the fact that there is a second set of twins that play in the school that seem to be really talented. There is a boy in that school that seems to be a little more outgoing. He doesn't get any of the attention and eventually it's the two sets of twins who seem to dominate the school. So yeah, not a very good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First of all, a movie. The movie has two characters named Maddy and George. They meet each other in the movie theater. I do not like to laugh at a movie that does not make sense. If you know how a movie is going to end, it is not going to get much better. There are also other characters. There is a girl named Maggie who is a big loser who tries to get through life by drinking and playing cards and drinking more. One day, she meets a tall, blond, blue-eyed man named George. He has an office that looks out onto a parking lot and he lives there. Maggie follows George to the office, and he introduces her to the rest of the staff. George likes to spend his days being a goof. His office looks out at parking lots because his office looks down onto parking lots. He is always laughing and saying things like: "I like the way that you look in that sweater. It's like you're wearing a big bowl of cherries. And, I know, right? I could eat cherries until I'm blue." When a female employee at the office asks him if he likes to work from home, George says he doesn't like to work with his wife. His wife is his secretary, and she is not a very good secretary. When he talks about how he loves his wife, he actually means that he loves her for who she is. He doesn't know what to do with her, so he takes advantage of her. They are constantly arguing. One time he said: "What the heck did I come home to? I came home to a whorehouse." Then he says: "Don't you want to know my secret? I like to lick the cunts and fuck the asses of old hags." The movie was directed by Robert Aldrich who made some movies that I liked. There was one film I did not like. It was called "The Great American Disaster." It was about three guys who were in a movie called "Trouble on Tilt." They are getting ready to do a movie in New York. They buy a bunch of clothes. They make a bunch more clothes. Finally they get a big suit and they drive out to New York and they all are happy. One of the guys is getting ready for bed. He looks out into a crowd of people and there is a group of women talking about what a great looking woman the guy is. All the people
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is overrated and over-ambitious.    The script is awful.  For example, when she is about to be taken away to an "old ladies facility" because her "mental illness" and "mental handicap" have deteriorated enough that the government needs to put her in a mental institution, they decide instead that she should be sent to a special school in New York for "special kids."   I'm thinking to myself, "I hate this." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It has a great idea, but the story never makes it work.   The story, as it begins, is pretty good: "The government was planning to release a massive virus into the public. And to prevent anyone from catching it they had taken the only effective countermeasure: they were going to infect the entire world in a giant biological pandemic. The plan was to keep the virus hidden from the public by infecting people with the flu. But that would only delay the inevitable: a few days later, a few thousand tons of radioactive dust would crash into the Earth and wipe out all life on Earth. But then the story gets complicated. This is not a movie: it's a movie about a movie! What is more, the movie begins when one of the heroes (Peter Vonderhaar) is trying to make his way back to civilization. He finds himself in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Not only has everyone else turned into zombies, but everyone he sees appears to be suffering from the same illness. He meets his ex-wife, who has been trying to get him to help her. A few of the other characters in the movie are somewhat interesting; they show up in small doses to help the hero make a quick getaway. But the one that really gets the audience's attention is the character known as "The Doctor." The Doctor is a character who has had a life of his own. Like many of the movie's other characters, he is somewhat a lunkhead; but he's not nearly as funny, and he tends to be quite pathetic. Most of the audience finds this part of the plot amusing because the Doctor seems to have the capacity to be both hilarious and sad. But most of the characters in this movie are either awful or downright silly. One of the most glaring weaknesses of the story is its characters. Most, if not all of them, are flat and undeveloped. The few characters who appear at the beginning have a good deal to them: the hero, for example, has the sort of comic timing one expects from a comic actor. But, after awhile, the audience learns that the hero is just another of the film's many cardboard characters: a woman who becomes pregnant from the flu, who is then taken to a secret base where she is infected with the virus, who does the only thing she can to survive: kills a bunch of zombies, and is taken back to the lab to be tested to see if she
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a classic in its basic format - a little girl and a huge wolf (or so they say). Both are in love and live in the woods. The little girl has no idea what's really going on, but does not really mind because of the wolf's good looks. So when her mother's husband comes to visit, the wolf comes and gets all the attention. One thing leads to another, and they end up on a train bound for the big city. They live happily ever after (for a while), except for the wolf. He gets jealous because of how well-featured the little girl is, and is always trying to get to her, but the little wolf never seems to mind.    This is a very well-known movie, although I have not seen it yet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie is a joke. The characters are ridiculous and the plot is boring. I hate it. I could not believe how the movie was made. Even the cast was horrible. Don't bother watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My son has a problem:  This isn't a movie about a boy who can ride a motorcycle, it's about a girl who can't.   A pretty picture, a little slow, but you can't ask for more than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've only seen this movie once, and I didn't even know who he was.    I'm sure it's not a very nice man, but you should see it in 3D with lots of sex and violence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie I don't think I would've seen before. The movie begins with a bunch of kids going to the beach and they just aren't enjoying themselves. I can only imagine what happened. The next day they all meet again, only to have one of the kids get hit by a drunk driver. There's no explanation as to why the kid is drunk but you can bet your ass it isn't that he wants to go home. When the kid's parents get called for a funeral the kids have no more fun going to work. The kid gets hit again and gets taken to the hospital by the ambulance. Now I've been to hospitals before but this time it wasn't fun at all. It was pretty scary to think that the guy would've killed the kid if he hadn't been caught by the guy who hit him. There are some really bad parts in this movie but they're not the bad parts I remember from it. The story has a happy ending but it really doesn't feel happy and I didn't like it. I wish it wasn the happy ending for the kids because it really wasn't! This movie was just too short to be entertaining to me so I give it a 2 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a man who gets shot through the shoulder by his wife and takes up a "shooting" challenge from the police. That being said, the police are more interested in trying to catch the man than stopping the guy from hitting people with his car.   It's a pretty silly plot, and doesn't really help with the comedy aspect. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a couple of good movies so far this year, but this one is so bad that I didn't want to make a movie to watch it.  The whole movie is a bunch of people riding to the beach and then one of them loses a whole load of money in a pool and gets caught by cops who aren't impressed.  They don't do much to him, though, they just give him a piece of paper to write a statement and let him go.  It turns out that he's really just this guy who's got a big mouth, and he makes a lot of outlandish statements.  This whole film reminds me of a certain "good old days" episode of the original "Kojak".  Not only is the plot stupid, but you get the feeling that it's all made up by an idiot and that it might not even be possible.  Also, the movie has this really cheesy scene where the cops and the biker gang go to a restaurant and everyone is dressed up in costumes and then go to the swimming pool to take a dip and there's a little scene where one of the bikers gets drunk and tries to dance but he doesn't make any sense.  There are also some good lines in this movie like: "I'll make you look like a dog!" and "There's a girl in here!"   I guess I'll let the movie speak for itself: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a movie about the end of a race. I'm really disappointed.   I've been really looking forward to this movie since it was announced.  In theory, this movie was a very intriguing idea. A race is over. The race is called the Golden Gate. What happens to the races that don't win? We don't even get to find out.  A guy gets injured during a race that he doesn't enter. As a result of this injury he doesn  This movie has no redeeming value.  I watched this movie on opening day. It was advertised as a horror movie, but it had no horror at all. I had some decent scary moments but it was so predictable. The guy who is injured at the start of the race, the guy who starts to get better from it and the last guy who wins the race all get stuck together and you never know who is who. It's a long shot but I liked it better than the last horror movie I saw. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm really sad that I won't be able to see this film with my own eyes. The film's plot is pretty boring. One of the characters gets into a car accident and the next thing you know, they're on a road trip (with their families). They visit various towns and get lost while going to get more liquor. You have to sit through over 30 minutes of this, it really doesn't do anything for me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest, it was a pretty bad film but the acting (yes, it's really terrible) and some of the plot details made it a rather enjoyable time. The main antagonist of the film, a guy called The Captain (played by Frank Langella) who wears a suit all the time and a very ridiculous hat is basically The Rock of Gibraltar. This man is trying to destroy the world's water supply as a means of taking control of all the resources. This is all done through the invention of an experimental machine (which we learn is actually the brain of a huge sea creature called The Kraken) which will enable him to control all the water. He also claims that all of this water can be used for a new type of medicine which he calls The Miracle. The only problem with this is that the water he claims is all that he uses as a source is of a naturally occurring type. He then has the other villains of the piece, the greedy people named The Richman, and his cronies, make it their goal to create a large dam which will allow the water from the lake to pass down to the sea and use this as a new source of water. The end result of this plan is that by the time we finally reach the climax in the film we are all completely drunk.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is very predictable. I'm not sure I didn't just witness a film on television, with a character dressed in a black shirt and tie (that should be a clue) trying to make his way through a room full of mirrors. It doesn't work out too well, though. The first mirror is of some kind of mechanical beast, but you can't be sure what it is.   A scene in a very bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you liked the first Alien movie, you'll like this, although it's not as good as it first was. Ridley Scott's script has a lot more to it than this, which is a shame since it is still a very enjoyable movie, although I didn't care much for it at first.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.   The story is about a group of girls who all go to the school on the same day, and are all the same age.  The first thing that is horrible about this movie is the bad acting.  Most of the acting is not professional at all.  This film is supposed to be a comedy.  How could anyone think this movie would be funny?  It is completely unrealistic.  I am pretty sure the actors are just trying to get as many laughs as possible.  There are only about 3 different girls, and it is quite obvious that the girl who plays the school nurse and the girl dressed as a nun are the same actress.  All the other girl have terrible roles.  Even the nurse who has a big mouth that is never going to get any attention.  She has no character, and is just there to be the nurse to make all the jokes about the other characters.  Another bad thing about this film is the way it was shot.  It has nothing going for it.  Some scenes look like they were taken out of the movie "The Three Stooges"  It was shot with black and white film.  One scene has a girl lying on the ground getting an abortion.  And other scenes that should be shot with color film are not.  These scenes are not funny, or realistic.  At the very end, the girl that plays the nun does a funny dance.  When the nurse comes out to talk to her, the nun just looks at her and then dances around.  We never see her get an abortion, and she never explains why she did it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have not seen a bad comedy in a while, but not since the days of The Simpsons has a comedic movie been so bad that I just had to add my two cents:  This is a really poor movie. I have seen better comedy, but no one thought so little of the premise as this one. A couple of guys are hanging out in an old barn in the middle of nowhere trying to find out if it is full of cattle or not. There are a lot of different shots with the camera, and there is a lot to look at, but it is all very uneventful. We meet the characters, we find out where they are from, we learn who is a liar and who is not, and we laugh all over, and that is about it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie three times now and each time, I have been even more confused by its plot and storyline.   In the movie we are treated to a number of random encounters of various types, which are the equivalent of a "dungeon crawl" game.  Most of the encounters are very poorly written and the movie can be summed up as a bunch of things that happen.  For example:  1.  The main character who is about to take a bath, is found dead in a hotel room.  This was an incredibly bizarre and unnecessary death.  Why would she kill herself?  If she had been in the room at all before she would have been dead before the bath was done and then again after.  2.  A young man is found chained to a tree.  There's no question that the young man was found chained.  If he were not chained, someone would have found him, called the police or gone to a hotel to complain about the creepy noise.  3.  "The boy who cried Wolf" is a young man who has been adopted by a couple of wolf-like creatures, who he lives with.  It seems that the man is being abused and forced to keep quiet about what's happening to him, to the point that he is terrified of a wolf.  After being abandoned by his adoptive family the boy finds a pack of wolves and tries to join them.  How is this an adventure?  I don't believe the movie had any intention of presenting a story or a plot.  Instead it was trying to present a series of "scare" stories.  What story?  A couple of wolves chase a man across a lake and the wolves then eat him.  We then find out that this man has been missing for some time and his dog has followed him to the lake.  They have apparently been hunting in the area and they are now eating the body.  Who were the wolves?  The film is so confusing because at the beginning it gives us a few clues about the wolves and how they are related to the human victims but then it doesn't explain the details of this event or who the wolves are or how they were involved in killing the man and then eating his body.   4.  In a hotel bar, a woman is attacked by a bunch  of "hired gunmen" who try to rob her.  These "hiring gunmen" are some of the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film and there is absolutely no reason why it was made. It has nothing of value to it and no interest to make it a great film. It's just a bunch of scenes of badness and awful acting which have no interest or purpose in them. The bad acting is all over the place, bad characters, bad jokes, terrible acting. It is boring and pointless. I cannot understand the people who made this film. I just don't get it. This is not a great movie but then again it's not a really terrible movie either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went into this movie not thinking much about it. In a way, that is a good thing. There is a very bad movie here, but one of a kind. It is a film that is not for people who are looking for entertainment but for those who look for a good story. I liked this one a lot and I have to see more from it. It has a very good ending that is almost too good. I found it hard to believe that such a movie could be made. The actors were quite good. John Boorman is not a great filmmaker, but this one is worth seeing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My dad once told me that "bad actors play good parts" and I never forgot it, the actors in the movie are great but the rest of the cast are all horrible.  The worst was a good guy who was played by Bill Cosby.       I hope that this movie got pulled for good reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the exact same movie as the first. It is all about a loser that has to find a job so that he can take care of his sick mom. It really shouldn't work, but it is the typical American comedy. It doesn't stand out too much from the rest of its genre, but there is nothing special about it. That being said, it's a bit worse than the first one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a low-budget bad movie. In it you find your typical teenage boy: he's cute, shy, and has the most horrible hangover: he never stops crying. It's hard to watch this film and know just how many hours of your life have been wasted on this trainwreck.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To the author: I saw this film last October when I was a sophomore at a University. It took me about 2 hours to finish. I have to say I found it hard to watch. I could not get into the characters and did not feel like I understood anything about the story. The actors played themselves too big. They looked like they thought the movie was a comedy and wanted to try out a few jokes. There were 2 major parts. One was where all the other children were laughing hysterically and the other where a little boy was crying and then his mother came out and gave him an ice cream bar. I felt like I knew the characters only by the little details. I was not able to understand a single word that was said.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think I had ever seen a movie so bad that it had to end. I can't say that I was totally unimpressed with the whole shebang, but it was never really funny. It was very boring, but somehow so incredibly annoying that I really can't imagine any other genre for a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched a lot of science fiction in the 70's and 80's. They really didn't scare me at all. Not to mention they made the most horrible movie I've ever seen in my life. You see here we have a bunch of scientists who are trying to discover a cure to cancer. One of the scientists is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's got a great acting style but it falls flat every time he takes the stage because he never shows any actual action. I won't go into the rest of the bad acting but the dialogue is a little better but the special effects are so bad that even the director couldn't make them look any more horrible. The worst part is that we spend hours of time watching the doctors attempt at treating patients and it's only two or three minutes and then Arnold Schwarzenegger pulls out a machine gun. I can't tell you how many times I wished that these doctors would have killed the poor fools who were dying all the while these evil scientists were in the room. If there is one thing I've learned from watching this movie it is how horrible science fiction can be. This movie is bad enough to give me nightmares. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's not a lot to say about this film other than it is not good.  I suppose I should say that it did not live up to the "the future isn't so terrible" tagline.  The plot of the film follows a man named Michael (Bartley).  He becomes a pilot after a series of unfortunate incidents involving his estranged wife.   However, his flight isn't the least bit enjoyable to watch.  This isn't just a terrible movie, it's a terrible film.  I would like to think I'm the only one that feels like this.  A great many of my friends did not like this at all.  There are too many scenes where Michael's wife looks on in disgust as the other passengers laugh as Michael sits in the passenger seat.  Unfortunately, this will continue through the rest of the story as it gets increasingly boring.  For all intents and purposes, this film is just a bad pilot movie.  The plot is incredibly poor and it's almost as though it's not supposed to be a pilot film. The characters have been fleshed out, but not really given any real personality.  If you didn't want to see a bad film about piloting, you should just ignore this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First, it is a bad film, a big, boring, stupid, boring movie that you get to see when you were a kid. You sit and watch a bunch of dummies do things that are totally out of their league (no offense to the other two kids in the film who are also good). There are even scenes of them driving. There are also many ridiculous scenes, like them playing in the water in front of a small child, and they are really terrible at swimming. This is one of the worst films of the 70's. Don't watch it or it will be in your life. Watch the sequel, it's much better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me, the movie is a boring piece of garbage with the usual weak performances and lame writing. The story is just that the girl is having a bad time with her life and is looking for a change, which is when she gets a text from a guy who is about to get into a really dangerous situation. The movie is about a guy and his girlfriend who go to the beach for a day of relaxation. The beach is really dangerous (well, it sounds boring to me) and she has a really difficult time finding a way to survive. This is really a lame movie, but at least it's a piece of trash.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like to watch movies from the 70s, 80s, or any time in the past, this one is for you.  The plot is silly and silly and there is a lot of violence.    A few of the scenes look like something out of a bad 70s flick.  There are scenes where you get the idea that the filmmakers are trying to show the absurdity of a time where women were being assaulted.  Then there is the bit in which the "doctor" says that "the woman was an angel, if a little crazy".  There is also a scene where a guy throws a bottle of wine (yes, wine) over the "angel's" head. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the second time I've seen this film (I have an early version which I bought at a movie theatre in the late sixties). The story was about a very bad and very ugly girl named Tula (I think) who works as a prostitute. After that first performance (you'll be able to see it in the next movie I think) she is thrown into the stocks and dies as a result of her injuries, because apparently it seems that she was beaten so badly that she almost lost her life in that first production. The scene where she tries to pull her dress down in a desperate attempt to make money was especially hideous. The most important thing about this movie is that it was made by the same crew that did the extremely bad and boring comedy-comedy "The Devil's Bride" (also about a girl in a whorehouse) about twenty years previously.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My only complaint about this movie is that it is quite a long time since I've seen an Indian film that is not quite ridiculous, and that it has a sense of humour that is rare among such works. It also has a beautiful ending. There is a wonderful score by Bhaskar, a talented man, who is probably one of the world's best song-writers. It is just too bad that the film is not as entertaining as the title of the title would lead one to believe. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very mediocre film by a very bad director. I have seen far worse, so I can't even describe the plot as I was there only for the first part, and then found out it was really a long series of events, and it got worse and worse. This film is a disaster because they hired a guy from the past because they needed someone to play the villain, and in the beginning of the movie he was bad, but then he was just terrible. At no point was this guy given any depth, but instead he was played by a fat guy, and I swear if he had a penis like that it would probably be bigger than his head. That guy's acting was so bad, he actually made the movie more awful by being in it. If anyone wants to see another bad movie with an all-star cast, this is the film for them. It is so bad it is actually hilarious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not as bad as it seems. I mean, it's not bad, by any means. But it's so overrated. I don't have much more to say about this movie other than I hope this is not the last time we see the bad guys get their comeuppance.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a little strange in that it takes place at a college, the fictional Amherst College. The first few weeks of school for all the new students is really pretty boring. There is a professor of sociology who has an odd theory about women. It is all theoretical nonsense and he is never able to produce any actual evidence of any kind. But what really gets to the students is the fact that there is no real male student group on campus. The guys are too scared to go up to the dorms because of a crazy killer clown that lives in a creepy basement. The one guy who goes up to check it out is killed by the clown. The female students decide to form a club, which they do in quite an unusual manner. They get a guy named Bill Haines to join as a bass player. Bill is an oddity. He is a bit odd for a bass. His fingers are extremely long and the other musicians laugh at him. They decide to play a show of his songs, which are really good. Unfortunately the clown turns up again and is a lot more scary than his last show. He kills a lot of people, especially Bill. The women are scared to death of him and decide to go home and live with their fathers. Bill goes home and meets up with his girlfriend. They go to a house party and have a good time. A guy by the name of Dick (he seems to be an over-anxious kid with no friends) turns up with a woman who is very attractive (not that she's that attractive). The woman becomes angry with Bill for his girlfriend (although Dick has nothing against her) and tries to run him over. Dick stops and kills her. Bill wakes up from his nap and sees Dick standing there in front of him. The woman who survived the clown's attack is a doctor. She is an attractive woman. At first she is angry at him for turning her boyfriend into a clown, but then she thinks better of it and joins him. Dick then helps Bill and the female students. The next night they take a bus to the college gym to play some musical instruments. It doesn't go too well. Dick, being an over anxiety type and a complete wimp, gets a bad beat up and is about to die. But Bill saves his life by throwing a rock at the clown and destroying the car. Then the clown appears and kills the bus driver, kills some people and then drags the female
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The sequel to one of the absolute best horror movies of all time was just a poor imitation of the original.  The writing for this one was absolutely dreadful.  There's no sense of danger, there's no horror, and it's almost as though they had the idea to remake the movie but only made it worse.  One thing is for certain, there won't be a third movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a good movie, but not really a good one. It is kind of a "discovery movie" about something that people knew all about. It has a good, interesting script, but it's all about "discovering" this weird old house. I thought that when the story ended that it would go on to find the house. But no. It found the house, but then left it. What a bummer, and a waste of movie time, to be so boring as to leave the place with no sign of the missing person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is nothing. All the actors are basically in one scene and don't talk at all.    But what about the music?  Oh, yes, the music is awesome. I like the first part more than the second part, but the ending is pretty awesome. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My daughter just got it today and it has become the "go to" movie for the older folks in the family. The kids get the funny jokes and the old people get the old jokes. A lot of the times when I come home and hear the movie playing my wife, who is in her 60's, is laughing. And I just couldn't get in a scene with my little nephew or nieces in the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched The Devil's Advocate over a Christmas weekend.   At a time when I was desperately craving some real entertainment, I was delighted to see a film with such a bizarre premise: a lawyer who works in the Supreme Court decides that he can't stand the idea of anyone but himself living in hell.  He decides to get the hell out of there and find out where the people who die in hell have been.  It's a simple story with a great twist.  At one point, the devil shows up for a chat and talks a lawyer into giving him a case in hell, to make it interesting.  His idea is that if he gets to hell first, his first court date will be before Jesus.  But it gets even better.  There is a young woman named Barbara.  In hell, she has been a prisoner for seven years and wants to know why she is there.  The Devil says that Barbara is there because of her love for Jesus. The Devil doesn't think anyone would go to hell for loving Christ.  And of course, the Devil's client agrees to let the lawyer in.  What follows is a fun little adventure through hell with Barbara and a couple of other hellbound souls.  I had to look twice before I recognized someone I knew.  Although the plot is simple and easy to follow, it has enough twists to keep me enthralled.  If you enjoyed the "The Exorcist", then I would strongly encourage you to check out this entertaining yet slightly disturbing film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not exactly sure why my local theater put out a "Halloween" remake. When I got it, I expected to see a lot of bad jokes and gore, the usual Halloween fare. The costume I got for the night was really not that spooky. I have a hard time believing that the actors were all dressed in latex costumes with rubber masks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Is this movie good? NO. It is a bad, boring movie about some teenagers who get high. It starts off very well, and all the characters are likable, but then it goes downhill very quickly. All the girls want to be cool, and some of them are better dancers than the boys.       And what happens when the girls get high? They fall in love with their male friends and start talking about them.  But wait! Something isn't right with them. They seem to have a lot of problems. They can't drive, they can't fight properly, and they all have to work with a teacher.  But the teacher? What teacher? His name is Jim Jones, and you get a bit of a view into him in the opening scene, where he is showing his class how to put on a play.  He takes his time showing them what to do, and then, when he is finished, the first girl goes up and says "what are we doing here?"   The class laughs at her and Jim Jones responds by saying, "you are only sixteen and you are acting like a forty."   Oh dear.  It's only going to get worse.  Oh no!  I hope that they don't have a cameo by Jack Lemmon on this movie, or they would have given him the role of "Mr. Jones", but they didn't!   Now this movie was obviously made for the kids who like to play sports. They all look like kids who can't get enough of them!  So what happens in the end of the movie? The kids are out of control, and start shooting each other.  They then decide to throw away their drugs and do something about the problems they have. This is when the movie becomes more entertaining and starts looking like a good action movie.  If it had the same kind of humor, action, and a good story... it would still be a bad kid movie. However, for the time it was made, it was a bad kids movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What could be a more useless movie than a movie about a man who, at the age of 17, moves into a house with his sister and his wife and starts living with them, but can't stop thinking about a girl he met at the fair. That's like some of the stuff that happens in these old movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not really a bad, just boring.  I like this movie.    It isn't terrible.  It has some good bits in it.  But I feel like it could've been a lot better.  I don't really feel like I would've liked it so much if I wasn't expecting to do so much stupid shit.  All of my favorite films are stupid as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The "Fright Night: The Michael Myers Story" movie is a remake of the original cult movie made by Stephen King. What makes it a poor remake is the actors in the movie do NOT resemble the actors from the original movie. They are too old to be from "The Mist" and are not even from "Fare Thee Well". The original actors like Linda Blair, Corey Feldman and John Cusack are not in the cast. Also, the movie tries too hard to be a homage to the original horror classic that didn't get much press.    The film doesn't have a very good script, especially when it comes to the story that the film tries to tell. The story, if anything, just isn't even good. The movie has just too many problems to count.  In the end, I thought the movie wasn't very good, and I didn't think anyone would be interested in the remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a shame about the movie, but the cast of characters are so bad it's a good movie. The plot is predictable and contrived, but that's the whole point, since the actors playing the bad guys would never have to commit a bad action scene. I guess they needed to add the "stupid" bad guy as a "cliché" to the "super-bad". The acting was bad and the acting director bad. I really have to hate this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are two sides to the story of The Big Bad Wolf: the side which you learn about in the beginning of the movie and the other side in the last minutes. At the very start the story is about a man who is about to leave the city to go to a beautiful place in the country with his daughter. The man decides to take the girl with him on a road trip to help her find the perfect place to marry her love. When they arrive the girl asks him for something: she wants to buy a big dog and an apple tree. When he buys the dog he tries to take her to the apple tree and then is attacked by a wolf. He then takes her back to his house and tells her the story. After they leave the girl begs for forgiveness so that he will go get a dog to take them back home. The girl decides to stay at home and wait for the man to return. There are some things about this movie I was not so fond of. For one the wolf is a big wolf, that is not a wolf but a full grown man, there is no way that the man was about to get a girl into bed. Another thing that doesn't work is the story at the end when the guy is about as much of a hero as a wolf and that is because he decides to leave with his girl after getting the wolf off him. The wolf then does not attack the girl but rather her boyfriend. What is worse is that all this was a long time ago when people were very stupid. Also there is the whole matter of the apple trees. Why do the people who live in a huge place need an apple and no other thing? If you are going to use this story as a warning against being stupid then don't use it as a justification for being stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To get an idea of this movie I had to take a trip through the woods of the South and see what an awful movie this is. The only good thing about it is that a decent movie was made and it shows good action and a good sense of humor.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie while in college in the early 70s. I remember the movie quite well, as it was one of the most disturbing movies of the year (not the best, but the most intense of the scary year). There were some pretty creepy things going on in this movie, and I'm glad I did the movie over 20 years later (I found out some of the old stuff was filmed again in 2000, by Richard Kelly, and it's actually pretty good). For a horror movie, it was surprisingly well done, with lots of gore and suspense, but nothing too original. If you like "The Ring," the ending will leave you wanting more!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's nothing particularly wrong about this film, and quite a few things that are right, in that it is an amusing, if unremarkable, and somewhat entertaining short movie about a woman (played by Barbara Carrera) who attempts to get a date with a young man (played, in his role as the local boy scout, by John Astin), who is quite handsome, but rather dull. While her attempts at dating him are unsuccessful, Barbara Carrano makes the most of her opportunities in making herself attractive, and it's a rather amusing film in general, although, in the end, it's pretty much over.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not a good movie. It is a very poorly directed movie with poor story telling. I have seen worse, this is not one of those movies. Its bad for two reasons: bad acting and bad writing. I guess there wasn't enough money spent to make a good story. This movie would have been better if they made it like they did in the book "The Black Rider" which is a bit different but much better than the film made by Robert Zemeckis. I found this to be bad. This was not a bad experience, this was a very bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really can't think of a worse idea for a movie.  Let me explain why.  The main character is pretty much an angry teenager.    When you get right down to it, you're never going to love your kid more than you love him at the end of "I've Got You Babe."   But it's the story that drags down "I Love You, Man."  That's a great idea to start a movie;  turn a man and a boy into lovers, and have them have to come together for one last adventure.  But all you can find is a lot of talking about sex.  For the first 40-50 minutes, you don't find yourself watching a movie about two young people falling in love.  You're watching a romantic comedy with a whole lot of sex. As for the story, "I Hate You Man" is about two people who want to be together, but can't.  Their fathers tell them that there's a curse on them;  their fathers don't understand.  This curse can be explained if you read the back-story, so you'll have no trouble understanding the rest of the movie.   But then it gets really ridiculous at the last minute.  There are some bad actors in this movie. But the director is an idiot.  He thinks it will be funny when one of them is in a coma after a crash.  It's too bad, too;  the whole movie is bad.  I really can never see the point of doing this movie, because you can't make any money off it.  Now I know that I've spent a lot on movies that aren't that good, but I can't imagine what the director had in mind.  All I know is that there is only one movie in my collection that has the name "I LOVE YOU MAN" on it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise was very interesting. It was like a '80s action movie with a new twist. Then the bad guys came and made it a bad time for everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the best, and most inventive, of the genre. I'm still laughing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst, most boring, unimaginative, uninspiring, uninspired and downright dumb movie ever made. No, really, this is a terrible film, and the worst one I've ever seen.  If it had ended after an intro that didn't even do it any good, then I would have been entertained all the same.  The movie follows the same formula as many cheap science fiction movies;  Aliens,  Martians,  Space Pirates, and even more.  It has very few original ideas and it is all just recycled and recycled and repeated again and again.  What makes this so annoying is the lack of respect for the viewers.  Most of the action scenes (which are repetitive) are filmed in a very low quality, with low budget special effects.  Not even a good looking actress can save these horrible special effects, which are all just reused and repeated from bad to bad.  Even the special effects aren't that great, with the aliens being so big it looks like they're coming out of a television screen (that's what I thought I saw when I saw it).  There are just a lot of bad ideas and bad acting.  I hated the main villain, whose name is only ever used in the subtitles, and I really didn't care for the aliens at all.  That being said, I still found it amusing at least once (when they were all flying around).  The stupid and incompetent story makes for a completely boring experience.  So why did I give it a three?  Because it was an entertaining little movie with a few good parts.  In fact, it's one of the few times I've seen a bad Sci Fi movie (other than Aliens).  As a matter of fact, the first half of this film has a little something to it.  There's a few really bad special effects scenes (that are repeated and recycled again and yet again).  One part of the movie is really bad (the part where the aliens come out of the TV screen) and it's only made worse by the constant repetition (except for the ending which is boring).  Then we are introduced to the main character, played by a very good looking French chick.  She doesn't do much but act her part, but it's clear that there is a much bigger character behind her.  This movie would be completely dull without the good acting. And if you like bad acting, then you are going to like this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a good movie at best, and I'm glad that it was produced by a good people. The story is a bit weak, I like a good story but this one just does not have the power to grab me to the movie. I don't even like the movie, the action scene is so terrible, I mean they are literally hitting each other, it's like that, and the other characters don't have much to do, I guess some of them could have a more powerful story but that's what they seem to be doing instead of moving the story forward. I'm sorry that this one's not that good, but this is about the worst movie in the history of the world.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie so terrible, you would think the author had written it herself. She gives us an interesting look at the origins of Christianity in Spain. But it's all a bit silly. When she does delve into the origins, it's not to convince us that early Christianity was a good thing. She's not looking to persuade us of anything. It's just that in early Christian Spain things were getting really bad. It wasn't just people who were being tormented by demons or being driven mad by devils. There were actual wars going on. These wars weren't the ones that get the headlines. The Spanish were actually dying. Some died because of malaria or tuberculosis. And then there were other wars. I don't know about you, but if there's one thing I've learned in all of my years of living in Spain, it is this: When people are about to die, they have a thing where they'll say goodbye to their loved ones, give a good-bye, and then go off on a quest for good people. They look up and find Jesus and a bunch of people saying a bunch crazy stuff. It can't possibly be that the Christians had a lot of crazy stuff to say in the middle ages. What was more likely, Jesus had just died in a duel or something? The movie doesn't say. Or maybe they did... I have no idea.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As the title suggests, this movie is not about space aliens, but about an alien. This is not a new story. The first story from the "Walking with Dinosaurs" tv show was about two little dinosaurs that fell in love with a princess and ran away from home to a little desert town where they stayed until the princess and the dinosaurs died of old age. This movie is only about a single dinosaur, the "Dinoger" and it was his day off. The "Wandering with Dinomics" story is told by "The Dinosaur Show", with the assistance of a young boy named "Dale" and the aid of his dog "Randy".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I had forgotten to mention earlier that the first half of the movie consists of a rather boring and even silly romantic drama between a couple of cops (two men, actually) who are trying to help a woman out of a situation in which she is in danger and who are very much in love.   So much so that they can't stand it.  And they're not alone in thinking so.  This is a pretty bad movie even if it is a romantic drama and so you should be expecting an overly silly romantic comedy or at best a bad romantic comedy.  Instead, you get a farce.  The entire movie is filled with so many cheap jokes and cheap puns that I think you would think someone in the production department forgot how to write jokes.  I don't think you could make this movie any worse; all it has is a bad script and mediocre acting.  It's not bad as a romantic comedy, but it's not even bad as an action-comedic flick either.  When I see these kinds of movies I am always so disappointed when the producers decide to try and do something different.  They did not even try in this case, it's like they thought they could slap something together and call it a comedy.   I don�t get it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an excellent movie. It does have its issues and I would probably not watch it again, but I enjoyed it anyway.   "We Are All Miserable: How Life Imitates Art" is a movie that attempts to imitate both great cinema and the great humanist philosophers of Western Civilization. It seems like some of those ideas are already starting to get translated into modern life. However, the movie is not as good as it could be. There are some scenes where the actors are not quite hitting their mark. When the two female scientists are explaining their idea about the brain using a small camera and a special material that is supposed to increase the brain's performance, they are really stretching the science and just making some random statements like, "People are always searching for that next great thing, for the next thing to wow them and fill up their heads. You don't find it with a camera and an electromagnet. You find it in a person. You are always moving, but your brain is always at rest. You have a fixed set of ideas that you need to work with. A person can only absorb so much. A mind is a great thing."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sure everybody reading this has seen this movie. It is not really a bad film at all, but its main problem is that it tries to be so many things, and in doing so it can't quite make a decision that is not just stupid. I guess the point is that the movie is just an excuse for this guy to pretend to be Batman for a while, which is a pretty lame gimmick, and it's so unimpressive that I wonder how anyone could even watch this. I think the only reason anyone would be interested is for the cheap laughs. I can't imagine this movie ever being more than a cult classic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To sum it up, we're never going to find out what happened to our heroine, so I don't care what she did.  And now we get to see just how stupid this movie is:  I would like to say that I was really surprised to learn that one can live for nearly a hundred years without ever having sex.  It's a very sad picture.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sara has been watching TV, but it's a bad show. No one has ever had a good time watching a bad TV show. Her boyfriend has been taking a job at the local mall, but his boss is a jerk who doesn't seem to get why people work there. And Sara has had a long day at school, so she goes over for an hour to the mall. She spends time at the gift shop, shopping, and talking to her new friend, Lisa. It's kind of boring, and Lisa keeps being mean. But one day Sara discovers Lisa is a secret agent, so Sara starts working with her, too. And there's a time-traveling time machine that Sara can use to go back in time, to a time when she and her husband were still together and happy. And things don't work out well. I know I said I wouldn't be surprised by a good movie about this, and I'm not. But it's not as good as I would've thought it would be.  "You're not gonna like me because I'm a bad person!"  A bunch of teenagers go shopping to find out the value of what they're selling. The owner of a local thrift shop, a bad guy by the name of Joe, steals everything he can get his hands on (especially kids). The kids are so angry they break open the store, and make a bunch of trouble. Joe has to escape, and Sara finds him. The two kids fight, but Joe gets away. As Sara is about to give chase, she has a vision of her late husband, and then she wakes up in a cave. She realizes she's in a hospital (which she's not used to seeing), where Joe has come to kill her. She decides to try to escape (a task that could become a lot easier for her with the time machine). But she doesn't know she's supposed to fight him. But she gets into a fight with Joe, and she breaks the glass door to a window. She escapes, and that's where the movie starts. There's not much to say about this movie. It doesn't take any risks, and it doesn't do anything new. It just takes two young people, a very bad guy and a very cute girl, a whole lot of time, a lot of trouble, a time machine, a good costume, and a lot more time. It can only get more boring, it can
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those things that has the potential to be great, but then the story becomes too convoluted to get anywhere. It's a lot of fun seeing these two fight off some aliens that are trying to destroy the Earth, but the whole time they are doing all the stuff that we know that they wouldn't be able to do in the real world because they have no weapons.  The movie is full of action and fun, but if you are looking for something to think about while you eat pizza, you can't do much better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another "lost" gem.  When a guy shows up at a house party only to find out that all of the people there were actually murdered by a cult who worshiped the devil, he sets off to find the truth, including discovering a corpse at one end of a dark alley that seems to have a face and a name, which he soon assumes to be his dead brother.  Not really a new horror film, but a good one.   In other words, it's the kind of movie that should be available on cable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not terrible. It does have a few flaws (like that awful ending, a very bad main character, and a lot of silly people in it), but it's a fun time that isn't terribly offensive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing that I dislike about this movie is that all of the action sequences in the movie are basically just running away from zombies... The zombies in this movie are really slow and uncoordinated...  In fact the zombies in the last scene at the gas station are actually zombies from the previous film, which is a really bad idea.... In the movie this is basically the first movie to feature real zombies.  We have a couple zombies (one of whom is actually wearing a clown costume) who are chasing someone.    At the end of the movie there's a "cure" for the zombies: the person who has been chasing the zombies goes and gets shot.  A really lame ending, but then again I don't like the characters so I'll give the movie a D-.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not bad, not great, and definitely not memorable.  This is one of those movies you find in the early 90s in a bargain bin.  Its kind of like a cheap James Bond knock-off.  The acting is a bit odd as is the story.  I guess you could call it a Bond movie but not all the jokes are funny.  It is really an odd mix of a Bond flick and a James Bond movie.  If you are looking for a quick laugh then don't bother.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To hell with this movie!! I don't know who's idea it was to make a film that will be seen by as many people in the world as possible! To think, this film was supposed to be a one woman show!  Now, this is not my first time with a film like this (this was a few years ago), but I did like it a little better than I did the first time. I found myself wanting to see a lot more of the crazy stuff that the characters went through.  This one was one of the last shows I went to in New York. I'm glad I had a chance to see it with the other people I went with. I would love to see something like this again but I'm just glad it ended so quickly.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story of a young boy named Jack who tries to make it to adulthood by working as an insurance salesman and taking care of his aging uncle.   Jack's older brother Bobby is a drug dealer who steals a gun from Jack's father when he's in prison. Jack then helps the older brother escape and they take refuge at Bobby's father's farm.  When Jack is asked by his father to go find Bobby's brother, he tells him to go look for Bobby's mother.  The boy travels across the land and eventually finds Bobby's mom and his father's dead body.  His uncle then comes back to life and Jack does everything he can to save the uncle from being executed by hanging.  However, when the uncle is hanged and goes to Heaven, he also kills Jack's mom.  Luckily for Jack, his uncle is not a monster and he is now allowed to leave Heaven and come back to Earth.  He takes Jack's dad's truck (that Bobby has stolen) and drives it to California.  As they travel the country, Jack tells his story to everyone who will listen and finally ends up at an all ages amusement park in Orange County.  Unfortunately, something goes horribly wrong there and a clown named Mr. Hyde has Jack on the ropes.  Jack manages to escape and Mr. Hulks a bunch of things before finally killing himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been looking forward to this film for years now. It's been around as a cult classic since it first appeared on cable, and it's been rumored for many years that it would be remade into a big screen version. It will never come out on the big screen though, mostly because of the controversy over the film that continues to this day.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a while, it looked as though one of those classic horror movies would be made in the US. Then they found a director to take the place of Roger Corman (who passed away this year) and suddenly the movie was back in the states. So why, then, did it never really get off the ground? Well, that's the whole problem: the cast and crew did a fairly good job in recreating the atmosphere and mood of the old classic.   I was in the theater at one point and I had some trouble keeping my eyes open.     But what the actual movie lacks is actually anything that you might call a horror theme. The whole "black moon" theme is very much a modern twist on the old one.  The blackness, the silence, the fear, the cold, the blood, even the music, everything is pretty much the exact same as you'd expect to find in a modern horror movie with a twist.  It's just that most of the movies in general that have been doing that sort of thing recently are just not up to the standards of the classic ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not good at all, and i am going to rate this a 1, and recommend you to avoid it.   So first lets get the bad out of the way:  No, its not a'real' vampire movie, it's not even a comedy, its far worse, and at least a vampire movie should do a lot of things right, like having a very good vampire, and a good villain. However, that doesn't really matter. First off, the only reason why this movie is a comedy is that its just a parody, not a comedy with a twist, with a vampire. And why are we told its a parody? because its about a vampire who says its a comedy. No, because it's a parody! And no, the jokes are pretty good though, and while you wont get too invested in this, it was entertaining. The vampire was played by the usual actor/comedian who gets the funniest things done in a zombie movie, and you know it'll be his last, at least I hope so.  It's just terrible and if its a joke, I sure hope its a funny one. The movie is only 90 minutes, and after this, you'll be sick, so do yourself a favor and turn it off. This is only a 90 minute movie, that's it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   . A film that takes all the elements from a bad horror film, and puts them together into a new and unoriginal horror film with no redeeming value whatsoever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The premise is great, and the director does a good job of pulling it off, but it's all rather meandering.   I'm not really sure how much the audience is supposed to care, since they spend more time being told stories about the people they're supposed to be rooting against than they spend watching the actual battle between the bad guys and the good guys, but I'm sure at least one person out there is rooting for either side.  I'm not sure I'd want my kids to watch this.

It's an awful, ugly, poor-looking, poorly written film with no redeeming qualities. You can't really describe what this film is about, other than to say it's about a big-nosed bald man who lives in a van with his dog and plays videogames. I'm sorry. This is just too bad. This movie deserves a better rating, I truly believe that!   Overall: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is horrible, I have never watched this movie and I don't plan to. It's a comedy starring a guy who just so happens to be born blind.    It was actually really funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I first heard about this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I liked the first one, I guess. And this one? No. It was a huge disappointment. Even the title sounds like it should be a good movie, so why are the other reviewers giving it such terrible scores? I am glad that I didn the first, and the second, but I can only hope to see a little improvement here. It is just another boring tale of evil men in suits trying to destroy good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good friend who's a producer from London told me about an unusual film. This was made to bring the UK back in the eyes of the global audience after our long period of isolation, when no new movies made here were seen outside of the film's own country. This film was directed by Roger Donaldson and made in 1958 for an audience of young people, and this was a major success: we were all proud to be British and happy that this was the country which had returned to its own history. We were also pleased to be back on our own beaches and not in a distant cold desert. But it's not really what you think it is. It's a film about a man named Roger. The most remarkable aspect of the movie is its title: the title is a metaphor for the whole film. It doesn't matter which country Roger comes from: in the beginning he's in Paris, then he's at a beach in the Mediterranean. Then he's back in London, then Paris. The entire film is about Roger travelling around the world and spending time with everybody he meets. But this is the main reason why the movie appeals so much to the British. It was filmed and edited in Britain, and in many ways it is like a British version of the films that we Americans watch. In fact, the whole movie is about an American in the UK - the two countries share the same language, the same climate, the similar customs. It is a film in which everybody seems to be speaking exactly the same way: it's just the fact that the characters aren't from the same country that is a major difference. There are also other differences: the most striking one is the difference in clothes. The clothes of the people we see in the film all look the same, so that we don't know which one is Roger or the other people are from. When we see the others the people have different clothes, and the difference is striking: I can see that one of these people might be a British man, but I can't tell which. The costumes of the other ones also don't correspond to each other. A person's clothing can change a lot: people can even change their clothes when they're in different countries. In this film, as you can see, the clothes are of different styles - the clothing in this film is very unique. Roger is a real Brit, and it is his wardrobe that we follow during the film. And the clothes of other people vary a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A little over 10 years ago, the entire world went nuts about a "gorgeous" woman with a beautiful face and a great body.   She starred in 4 feature films and had a total of 10,000,000 hits on YouTube.  One of the most popular shows ever aired in Russia and was followed by countless TV commercials.  I really don't know how we are going to survive without her in 2017. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are too many bad movies on the big screen. There are a lot of movies where people just go out looking to party, have a good time, and then get into a car or get caught by a thief. This is not one of those films. While this film has its funny moments, it's also quite sad. The movie shows that people who are not educated and who think of themselves as intelligent and educated, can do nothing on their own and are destined to stay on welfare for the rest of their lives.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a little bit of the old "the girl who cried wolf" about this movie. The girl who cries wolf is one of the little girls from the village who had to hide in a house at night. Her dad was a hunter and she was so scared she ran away. But after three months on the run from the sheriff's men she's caught at a train station by a trainee cop who decides to take her in. It's the girl who doesn't want to stay at the station. It doesn't turn out well for her at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending to the movie is quite anticlimactic, and the movie as a whole is one of the more boring movies I have ever seen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total piece of junk, the first one with this title and a different set of actors I have ever seen. I think it was a bad idea. The story is a good one - what, you never see those? - but it just isn't funny. All the acting is pretty bad, especially the guy who is supposed to be his brother (who was really good in the movie I watched last year but was given a bad role in this one). The best part about this movie is that it is set in New York City and there is some good acting here and there. That is not enough to make it an enjoyable movie. I could care less about what they do on TV and movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The bad part:  This movie isn't really bad; it's just that it's not interesting, it doesn't have any laughs, it's pretty dull. Not like a bad first movie.  It's a story about a guy who dies and goes to heaven.  He tries to get the attention of the angels (some of whom are clearly insane) so he can get his reward. But he can't do anything with the angels:    This is a very, very slow movie. It's all set up (with the angel, the girl, the guy, etc.) but doesn't really advance them. It tries to make a point, but it doesn.t go far enough.   But the acting is quite good; Michael Caine (who plays the Angel, and who is one of the best actors I've ever seen), is good (he has some nice moments).  So I think it's a good movie, but a bit dull.  There are other good bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am sorry to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. A group of kids go in search of a lost dog and then get sucked into the very bottom of a hole that is only two stories deep and can't be reached on foot. This leads them to a cave in a very remote and treacherous place.  There is a great deal of creepy music that sets the mood for the movie, but the action has nothing going for it.   When the boys come back to their car, the dogs start going nuts.  They come up with a plan to sneak away from the police, the fire department, and the military personnel that are there with the help of their buddies, but they end up going to the bottom of the hole where they must stay.  I would have given this film two stars if they were going to have any sense of humor or humor at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are so many stupid and ridiculous scenes in this movie that you have to wonder how anybody could take it seriously or believe this movie could be entertaining to anyone. I don't see how people would believe any of this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To start with I have been a long time fan of the Star Wars saga and I don't think it is too much of a stretch to say I was pretty much a hardcore fanboy when this first came out. I would have probably had the same reaction to this version as I did to the others but the change to prequels was too much and when it came to the special effects it all looked a bit stale and the direction was not that good. I think they could have done with some more effort at making the planets look different. I don:t recall that the planet Hoth looked anything like this and I think that's the only reason I remember seeing the film. In my opinion this was a fairly average version and not a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has a very odd way of showing the evil in its most subtle way: the evil is always the same: the person who will be tortured will be raped! The movie goes from one to the other like a soap opera. There is no other way to describe it, this movie is one big soap opera that makes you want to see a third one! It is very hard to be shocked by this movie, because there is no way to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie about a crappy movie. The movie has been written and directed by Robert Zemeckis and is about a woman who falls in love with a man with a terrible job. He works hard for his wife. His wife gets pregnant and has to have a c-section. He goes to the hospital for that and becomes extremely ill and is told that he has cancer. He has a second C-section and dies. The whole movie is awful. It makes no sense whatsoever and makes you pity the poor guy. It starts out okay but it just becomes worse and worse and more disgusting. I found it revolting. The only good thing is that some of the actors have good movie careers!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this film could actually be good, I'd say this was a good little comedy, although it is a tad bit slow.    The plot is pretty simple, and the humor, although not that funny (I mean it is funny, but it's not funny enough), is pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is an American film based on the novel by G.H. Wodehouse about an English teacher who travels from London to Paris in order to obtain a degree. He travels by train, but the train breaks down and he ends up in a small train compartment where an Arab with a knife murders him.  The American remake is not very good, at least in the way the film is presented.   It is one of those films that are shot too much in the open air and on the tracks.     This is one movie where the actors should not have tried to be so dramatic, since the film does not really need dramatic situations or anything of the sort. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out slow, but soon becomes a bad-movie with a bad hero.   One part of the film that makes me laugh even when I'm mad is the fact that it's actually really easy to get drunk when you're an alien who lives on some alien planet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are a couple of bad aspects to this movie: 1. It takes its time and lets the characters tell their stories, then it jumps to the action as soon as it's introduced. The only characters that aren't introduced are the ones who get killed off. And the movie could have been cut down a lot better. It also has the annoying voice over, which makes the movie a little more boring than it should be. 2. It has the typical "mysterious, yet powerful being is hunting down a man who is just a simple farmer and his family" plot. This is all made worse by the fact that the plot is so bad. The movie never even gives any background on what the mystery being solved is about, and when we do find out it doesn't have much to do with the characters' plight. This might be the weakest part of the movie: nothing interesting happens, but nothing bad. You can probably tell I don't like this movie at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is so lame it's hard to say anything about it. The only reason it works is that the whole movie is about the "best girlfriend in the world." And there are a lot of "best girlfriends." It's like a weird reality series set in the 80s. There's a woman who has sex with a dog and a woman (who, by the way, is a stripper, though she's not very good at it) who has an affair with an old man, a guy with a bad attitude and a guy who's in love with a horse. I wouldn't watch this movie unless I was forced to. I just can't believe it took this long to make an action comedy about best girlfriends with lots of sex and drugs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad it's funny. I laughed so hard that it felt like I had just taken a cold shower.   I have to give props to the director, the script is so full of errors and omissions that you have to wonder how the movie was made.  There is no reason for the dog to be so confused at the beginning. He is obviously supposed to be a dog, it is obvious.  How did he lose his tail? Is it missing the other? Then later he is clearly supposed to know that he is in the woods? Where are the other dogs? And why does he not eat his own tail? This is ridiculous.  And the only thing worse is the sound effects. The people are all laughing, so is the dog!   It looks like a cheap knock off movie, the acting is bad, the plot is bad. It is a real pity because it looks like it was fun to make and I'm glad there is a DVD of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an extremely forgettable piece of crap.   A girl's father was killed by a man on a motorcycle, because he was a "douche."   She's also getting hit on by a girl named Lucy, who is a complete and utter moron.  The two women, together, form a nice couple.  There is no reason for them to be together, and yet they keep trying to get together, even though they do nothing to deserve each other.  I just wish they had been married instead of sleeping together.  A few moments before Lucy gets on the motorcycle, she makes a really bad date, driving home through Los Angeles, with nothing except a bicycle and her bike helmet.  It is absolutely horrible.  When the two girls find themselves in trouble, it is Lucy who comes to the rescue, but the motorcycle isn't any help.  Lucy is a total idiot; she does not even know where her own house is, and she is completely confused when she gets there.  After an accident, Lucy takes a nap, and the next time we see her she's on a bus on the way to a mental institution.  We also see a woman who appears to be the girl's mother get on the bus, and we are never told what happened to the woman.  Finally, Lucy comes home, in the arms of a man who we've never heard of before.  This should really not be any kind of surprise.  My only hope was that this would be an opportunity to find out what happened after the first film, and if it was good.  Well, it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I never expected this movie to be good. I was expecting a poorly done movie about a man who goes to heaven to meet Jesus (he also met Jesus in a car). This movie is much worse than that. As far as I am concerned, this film is a blatant rip off of the same story from the same director, Robert Altman. The plot is the same. There are also many similarities that I will not talk about here. This movie has a great cast but they are not very good. The acting, not so good. There is not enough substance to this movie. Not bad but not good either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a little disappointing. First, there's a lot more of a story than what's shown in the movie. It's about a group of people that are going into some kind of space. It has an air of sci-fi to it, but not much of it is believable. Some of the characters are quite silly. Some are very dumb. It seems like the only other thing going for it is a great soundtrack by the band the Beasties (and a great movie. The soundtrack will make you want to see the movie again!).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love the idea of a new movie and this is the one! I will give this movie a good review and say that if you like horror then this is a must see movie! The story begins with an old lady who has lived through the last 70 years in a cabin. At her bedside she has a cat she is not allowed to pet. This leads to her getting sick and when she is visited by a doctor a strange creature is seen by the doctor. She says she did not sleep well last night and has had some strange dreams. The next morning she is able to get up and take a walk in the forest. She thinks she is having a bad dream and that is when the cat returns, however it is a new animal that looks like a squirrel and when it does not move quickly enough it is picked up and taken in by the old lady.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of the film is an amusing parody of American history, as well as a hilarious parody of bad, but often funny, romantic comedies.    John Wayne plays an inept sheriff trying to stop the evil of some local bandits and then, through a hilarious combination of bad-guy disguises and clever comedic timing, saves his wife from some of these thugs who are then killed by the sheriff!   The second half is much like the first half in that it is a mix of comedy and horror, as the sheriff attempts to figure out the identity of this bad man, and the sheriff's wife gets caught up in this crazy mess as well.   It was a decent and, at times funny comedy from start to finish, and it was interesting enough to make one want to see it again...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a real shame that there are no more like these.   The worst aspect of this movie is that they never tried to make it funny.  A few bits of humor, but nothing at all funny. This is a total waste of potential. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't usually do reviews for movies that are rated bad. But this is just that. I don`t even know where to begin. I really wish I knew where to start. It has a few good scenes, most of them being very long, which is a problem in a movie that is so long. It goes over a lot of ground in not a whole lot of time. It is all so...well...weird. I guess that is what happens to a film that is directed by John Carpenter and stars a young Kurt Russell. A young Kurt Russel! There is a scene where a strange lady is being dragged along the road. As she is being pulled along the ground, someone is getting off the back of a big truck, pulling his truck along behind the strange lady. When the lady gets off the truck, it appears that someone is coming up to the truck. Then, a car (the car that is supposed to be coming into a house that is being attacked by an unseen giant spider) shows up in a weird way. It drives across the field right next to the road, the car is getting into the truck and there is a huge explosion, all of this happening in one short scene! I suppose the director wanted to make something weird, but I guess he just didn`t know what he was doing. This movie is a bad joke, and it does a terrible job at it. It does have a couple of very good scenes and I was entertained by them and would have enjoyed them, but nothing else. One of the more disturbing moments I think is when a little kid who is getting ready to play an imaginary game (a game similar to what we play as children, where you pretend to be a monster) is put in front of the monster that is eating his mother. And the little kid is playing a game that seems to be an attempt to scare the monster, and he is successful, the monster doesn`t eat the mom, and the monster turns to the little boy and says "You won`t scare me, kid!" There are several other strange sequences, such as one involving a woman who is having an affair with a man who she thought was her husband. One night, she finds out that she is in fact not his wife, and she tries to kill him. Later, the man realizes that he is still married, and tries to save his wife from death. But, the wife can`t tell him her husband`s
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well it's just about time for the new MST3K TV series to be shown on the Sci-Fi channel. It's been a long time coming. The last of the long line of bad MSTs was the one that did so much to bring about MST in the 70's. It also did a lot for the "movies" in its very long run, but this one isn't any better than those bad movies. There's plenty of bad acting, bad acting and bad directing and there's plenty more of that, too. It even has a bad soundtrack, if you're into that sort of thing. The MST films are great entertainment; great cheesy fun. I've never cared so much about a film, however, as I did when I saw MST: The Movie. It's one of my favorite films. I'm even going to say that it's one the all-time greatest films. It was an instant classic and even now, almost 40 years later, you can still find the people in the same place at the same time as they were then. That makes it a real rarity. That alone is a huge reason why we need new movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know, I know.   But this is not a bad flick.  A bit cheesy at times, and just a bad story.  The girl is a little girl in love with a big man who hates her, but she falls in love.  This movie is just so stupid.  I mean this chick was probably 10, and this is her movie?  She goes back in time to marry the bad guy, who is not in a good mood.  Even though she's a little kid she looks like an adult, and she is too old for him.  She has to live with him for a while, but is just too old to be around him, or get him to agree to marry her, which is almost impossible.  Then the movie starts to go downhill, and it's sad, really sad.  We see this man grow up in the way he has no respect for this little girl, even though her father died.  He also takes on this kid's mom and even sleeps in her bed, while he is the manly man that he is.  Well, I mean, is he a bad guy?  Well not exactly.  If I was going to tell this movie was bad I'd say that, it's really bad.  However, the actors work really hard to bring this movie down to the level of a bad slasher film.  It's not all bad though.  There's a funny little scene where this guy and the kid go to a haunted house, and he brings along a little boy that looks just like his daughter.  At least that kid gets a happy ending.  All in all though, this movie is bad, but it is still better than so many bad movies out there.  ( I would watch a bad kid movie, but then I'd go insane. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like a good old fashioned cowpoke movie as much as the next man, but this one has a huge problem, that is its boring plot. I mean, the whole movie is just the cowpoke trying to get his herd together and then there's an awful lot of talk about a cow, and then this is it! It ends with a pretty lame "Oh no! The other cow is dead, let's see what the herd will do now!" Then it ends and everyone's like "Well there's a cow!" and then it just sort of fizzles out, I'm not sure it had an actual ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoyed this. A pretty good, fun comedy from a guy who likes comedy. It's very silly, and there is some bad language, but it works. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The other movie to be released this week is one that I was eagerly anticipating from day one:  I've seen every episode of the cult TV series in which it was based, and I've read the comic book series that ran in a few issues of the late seventies or early eighties.   It's a weird, surreal series that mixes horror stories with surreal fantasy.  It was a surprise to see a live-action movie, because I had no idea that this series was still being made.  Even more surprising was the fact that a third installment appeared on the scene almost by chance: in 2001.  The director of "Cinderella: A Fairy Tale" was the late Paul Weitz.  He directed the first three movies and he's known for making movies that aren't all that scary or really gory.  However, what he does have is great performances and a style that reminds me of the films of the '60s.  Like all of his movies, "CINDERELLA: A Fairy Tale" is an incredibly creepy, creepy movie.  There is a lot of surreal imagery, but it's a little too much in some areas.  I would have loved for the filmmakers to have added a little more gore or a little less absurdity.  This movie would be a lot more effective if there had been a little bit more violence added.  But overall, I think this is still a good movie. It has a great cast of actors: Robin Tunney as the protagonist's fairy godmother, the lovely Barbara Steele, and a cast of young actors that I've always liked a lot.  All of the characters are very well acted and the actors do a good job of bringing them to life.  And that's one of the greatest things about this movie: all of the adult characters are given some sort of depth.  They are a very well rounded group of people and I really enjoyed the way that they all react to the fairy godfather's coming of age, but at the same time, he doesn't seem to care much about all of them at the start.  Some of them may be the reason that he gets to do what he wants with the world.   They all seem to be a little wary of his actions, but then again, a lot can happen in that short of a time.  With the inclusion of all of these different adults and all of their differing reactions, the movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This one is bad, bad, VERY bad (especially in comparison to the other two movies). The story is about two people who find a magic rock (and a girl) buried somewhere in the forest. After digging through a few feet the girl's hand is grabbed by an evil old man. The old man tries to kill the two kids. They escape to a house and the old man attacks the girl. After a short battle the evil old guy falls out a window and it falls to the ground killing him. They go to a doctor and tell him the old guy is dead, when the doctor tells them he doesn't even look dead. Later the girl shows up claiming the old evil guy's corpse is still in the house and has been haunting it. The girl's boyfriend and the doctor get into the house too. They see the old bad guy walking around the house when he disappears. Now the doctor finds his magic rock and starts to try to make the old villain stop with it. However the old ghost is more powerful than the rock so it fails. The good doctor goes out of the house to find the rock. While he is looking for the rock the evil ghost comes back and grabs him. The bad ghost starts to attack the doctor and the ghost is knocked out of sight. The doctor goes back into the old house and starts digging for the stone. The ghost starts crawling around. The next day the doctor comes back to find his rock missing. The two of them head out to find it. While on their search they find more of the old wizard's evil spells. There is one spell that causes the ground to shake. After that the old woman comes running to the doctor with the old witch following her. The Doctor is terrified and the two old women try to get his blood. Meanwhile the doctor has begun to get tired of going into the houses every night to try and find the stone so he calls for a ride out to the lake. When they arrive the old lady has lost her magic potion (the doctor gave it to her as a present) but she has a bunch of more potions with her. She also has a box of old clothes and an old mirror. Now they start to do everything she says to get back to the rock house. Eventually the witch and old woman take the doctor's blood and take him over to the old place where the rock is buried. When the two ghost appear the old person is no longer there. The witch and witch keep the doctor on his
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The second episode of Serenity's third season is a slow, drawn out affair that doesn't really show much promise.  It starts out fairly quickly, however, with a fairly standard 'who is the bad guy?' plot. The bad guy in question is a guy named 'Havar' who is apparently the first of his kind, meaning he is basically a walking time bomb; he's only there for a few minutes, but by the time you get to the beginning of the episode he's gone and left us all wondering where he went.  The mystery here is how Hvam ends up being the one sent to Earth in the first place; his parents were apparently sent on a mission to the nearest star but were killed, and his sister was sent home, never to return. Hvham is then sent to a far away planet with his sister when he finds out that his parents died, but unfortunately he is then forced to grow up a woman.   I really do wish the show would slow down a little bit more with this plot line, because the whole episode ends up feeling very similar to the first episode, which had to be the worse installment in the series.  The only difference between the two is that episode 2 is just a lot more forgettable and unoriginal.  I would rather see another hour of S.T.A.R.  and an hour of 'The Expanse' than this episode, although I'll admit I liked this episode a lot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The whole idea of the movie seems like a movie made with a script that has the word "fantastic" attached to it. I mean the main character is a giant man!   And I can't believe how ridiculous this movie is. I can only describe the movie as "what would happen if Superman was a big bad-ass."   This movie is so unbelievable that it's like a cartoon.   Not only does this movie come across as a bad joke. It comes across as an insult.  If you're going to make a movie called "Superman Fights A Giant Man" and you have a giant monster that's as big as Superman, that's your movie, but there is no reason at all for Superman to have to go up against a giant. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have just watched this movie and it is really bad.  It is a poorly done western with a very bad ending that makes no sense at all.  This movie really sucks.    If you like Westerns, you should see this movie.  I am not a big fan of westerns but I am a fan of bad Westerns and I was really bored with this movie until the ending where it got really good.  You have to pay for good movies but don't go to this movie unless you have a good sense of humor or you like westerns. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst I've ever seen.  Cinematically it is all wrong and the script is so bad.    The character interactions and dialogue are so terrible.  I really didn't have any interest in watching this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This one is absolutely terrible. I would not watch it for a very long time. It's just so over-the-top and bizarre that I couldn't take it. It has some good ideas, but it's not funny, I couldn' believe the writing, or the plot was stupid. If you're an action movie junkie, you have to check this one out. If it's an action flick you are going to get hit by a truck, it's just too stupid to be good and I'm not sure there's any other way to describe it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very strange movie. The title is not really descriptive and the rest of the film is just an overstuffed mess of a movie. It follows a young girl named M. H. who meets a very odd man by the name of Dr. S. J. O'Donohue (the name is not funny). They start off having some friendly conversation and then one night M.H. has a nightmare of someone putting a gun to her head. She wakes up in an unknown place in the middle of a forest and it's obvious to her that she is being followed by someone. She makes her way into a cave and the door shuts behind her and the man she met. He turns out to be a man who is dressed like a woman. The scene of their meeting is extremely creepy, to say the least. They have an extended discussion about M.I.H.'s boyfriend who lives in the city and how things aren't going well for him. The film doesn't really get too crazy until it goes into a time-travel scenario. Dr. O', who is the protagonist of the story, goes back in time and sees himself on the night of his birth, and his dad, who is also a time traveler. When he finds himself back in present day, he is met with a very different world. A girl is standing by the door of the room where he was born and it turns out she is M. I.H., now the young girl and her father have a very complicated history. I couldn't stop crying, it was just so sad. It doesn't get too heavy or overly dramatic, but it is a movie about grief and loneliness.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are no laughs to be had in the final film by this French filmmaker who has never had a particularly good reputation to begin with. He made one too many bad movies to mention in this review. The plot revolves around the daughter of an important lawyer whose boyfriend is in love with his girlfriend. When his dad sees his girlfriend kissing her boyfriend, his father gets angry and starts yelling at his daughter. In the movie's closing scene, his daughter tells her parents that her boyfriend is not interested in her. And so the story is over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good movie: A bad movie. It has a lot of interesting themes and interesting characters (and a very stupid ending: don't forget the whole thing was filmed in 1979!). The movie is about an ancient (or is it modern?) society which has been destroyed by a plague. One person comes from this society and becomes a god. When the plague is cured (by his very own blood), the people are ready to give him the title of their new king. However, the king is only interested in his own blood and doesn't care about the others. So, he decides that it would be nice to have one of the people in the new king's body, just to make them happy. He makes a deal with a beautiful lady in a tavern and it works out very well. But when they meet up, the woman doesn't love the man. When he tries to get the girl back, he discovers that he is only a puppet (but he is very convincing). After some time, he manages to persuade the old king and he is able to have a blood sacrifice (just as the gods wished) to get back the queen. So far, it is a pretty funny and interesting movie. But I couldn't help to think that there is too much going on in this movie. The king's plan doesn't seem to be very logical and the plot moves very slowly. The actors are all pretty good, but it all seems a bit rushed. The plot seems to change a lot (even though we didn't see any change). The scenes are all shot in wide shots, and the special effects are pretty lame. When things actually happen, they look almost comical. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was one of my first big hits at an early age (probably the youngest one ever) and it stayed in my mind from watching it through to today.  It's a really interesting story about an odd little town called New Hope.  A town where the people, mostly kids, spend much of the year playing games and dreaming of one day going off to join the military.  What happens is that a young boy and his younger sister join up, but are too much of a handful to deal with when it comes to schoolwork and chores.  And so, one by one, the girls, aged 8, 10 and 12, leave New Hope to join their mother's troop of soldiers.  This is all about a group of girls who, because of being so small, have to hide in the house because their brothers cannot take them out.  If that sounds familiar, I think it's because the same is true of the girls of A Clockwork Orange (the book).   At the same time, the boys who live in New Hope start to get into trouble with the authorities.  There are a couple of cases that were dealt with in the film, but there's one that is still fresh in my memory:  The case of Miss Alice Parker.  I first encountered this case many years ago when I came across a copy of the book in a thrift shop.  Miss Alice was one such girl.  She was 12 years old at the time and was found brutally murdered after a party.  For those who don't know, I should clarify a bit about how this book came about.  In 1967, the book was written by a writer called John Wyndham.  He made a bit of money writing novels and was able to quit his day job.  However, the rest of his life would be a nightmare as it would involve him being sued for sexual abuse.  Eventually, Wyndam got the book published (with a few other authors on the novel) and has since put out many books in different genres.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of them that are really terrible (and I'm not mentioning them as a way to pick apart Wyndams style).  I've never gotten around to reading them all, so I might as well not mention that.  The book itself is interesting.  Wyndamn tries to tell a more interesting story and he does.  His stories are full of mystery and he makes you think,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess I'd been looking forward to this movie forever.    And since it was coming out as an anthology film I knew I'd see it.  After the first 20 minutes I knew it would be a bad film.  It's all about an ugly man with a giant head who keeps falling asleep on people.  But then he wakes up and starts killing everyone.  This film is filled with ridiculous characters with goofy voices.  I love it because of its unique and disturbing style and characters.  Some scenes are better than others, but they're all fun.  The soundtrack is also pretty great.  If you're a fan of black comedy, gore, and surrealism then this is for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a horrible movie with bad acting, cheesy acting, horrible dialogue, and a movie that is bad on every level. The movie starts off with a great shot of the sun rising over the ocean with beautiful ocean waves coming in from the side. This is very cool and gives an idea of the setting of the movie. The camera starts to move up over the mountains in the distance and starts to get closer to the cliff faces that we see are coming on towards us. The only thing that keeps the movie going is an incredibly cheesy, low budget, bad acting scene where one of the characters does a comedy bit about a monkey who gets scared to death every time he sees the sun, and then the camera moves up the cliff to the other side of the cliff. There are a few shots that stay with me from the whole movie: 1. A couple of minutes in the middle of the film where you have a guy talking to a girl at a bar. He gets off the elevator and asks her to come with him to the elevator. She politely declines, but he insists. As she sits in the elevator, he says to her "I don't think you understand what we have just done. We have just joined the party of the living dead! We are in the presence of something truly horrific. We will never be the same people again." Then the door closes, and the camera slowly moves up to the top of the hill and shows you that the hill is rising up out of the ocean and coming towards you. 2. Then we see a couple of shots of the camera moving up and down the edge of the beach, and you can see what looks like someone walking up the beach. I really can't figure out how the hell this movie can be this bad, and I can't believe people let this movie get made. The entire cast is terrible, and there is really nothing else to say about it besides to say that I hate this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is going on here is not a good movie, nor is the ending in any way redeeming.  First of all, the movie is full of bad dialogue, bad acting, and bad makeup.  In fact, the makeup is the worst part of the whole movie, but then I can't really blame it.  For an action movie to have one single good action scene is almost criminal!  The movie, however, is not nearly as good in its story.  It's nothing short of boring, with nothing to really interest a person watching it.   For example, the characters are nothing more than cardboard cutouts, the story is not interesting, and it just comes out of nowhere.  The film has no sense of direction, does nothing with its time, and is very forgettable.  If you really want an action film without a story, check out the action in the movie Predator. Rated 5 out of 5 by D-Ray from Well worth a watch! This action thriller from the 70's is not only well-researched (with many details not given in the film), but is an excellent movie with excellent performances.   Many of the special effects look excellent, and the special "time" sequences make this film really exciting!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The director of   is a bad director.   I found his film laughable.  I really want to hate  , but I couldn't.  It makes no sense why people would dress up in red lingerie to get   an abortion.  As an animal advocate it seems a great idea to wear red and wear a garter belt.  The movie also contains a number of animal cruelty jokes.  My favorite character is the man who gives the movie a lot of laughs:    The bad man:  I'm not just a bad man, I'm a bad, bad man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this "horrible" movie we get a bunch of bad guys out in the wilderness fighting alligators, alligators that go "GOOOOOD!" when they smell the blood of people. The other bad guys are all over the place, being the worst, most unpleasant characters I've ever seen. The only good thing in this movie is that we get to hear these guys talking and we learn that they can't really swim. I don't think any of them could handle a barrel of beer. If you want to see a movie where a guy gets hit in the head by a golf club, then you might wanna try this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is a bit slow and the plot thickens. The movie starts with a small child, the son of a very wealthy family, who gets involved in a series of adventures with the evil wizard, the Grim Reaper. Grim does a good job of showing off his powers, in particular the ability to turn any body into a ghoul, the ultimate weapon in the witch-killing war. He also uses his powers of suggestion to make the boy do various tasks that he would not normally do. The boy ends up being a hero, in many ways. He is very brave, and has a sense of duty to his family and friends that most boys should have. His mother and father are quite good people, and he is well loved by everybody, even his own kind. But then, just as things are starting to look up, Grim the Reaper returns in an attempt to find the boy and stop him. This is where the film gets a little difficult to follow, but there is an ending that is not only understandable, but also satisfying. Grim the Necromancer is not a bad flick, but it isn't a good flick, either. This was a movie intended for people to watch, not to sit around and think about. It does not really add anything to the genre, and it has the potential of becoming quite tedious in its repetitive plots, and its lack of any creativity or imagination. I was only willing to watch this movie to get the chance to see how an old man could look so young, yet there is enough of a resemblance between him and a young Robert Mitchum that I was very disappointed to have wasted my time on this movie. Maybe someone with a better sense of humor than I will enjoy the movie, but I doubt it. I'm a very poor and uneducated man with a bad case of nostalgia, so I don't recommend this to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If the cast and crew of the movie wanted to make a fun action film, they should have just made the film itself more fun. The action scenes are lame, the story makes no sense, and the characters are so two-dimensional that no one could ever identify with them in real life.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst and most depressing movies i have ever seen in my life. I know what i am talking about. I watched this movie with the intention of telling everyone about its bad reputation. Its really bad...its almost worse. The director should get a punishment for this... This is the worst movie I have ever witnessed. The only good thing about this movie is the story...but it is so bad that no one would want to watch it again! No one should have to sit there and listen to these awful lies about a human being... It is just so disgusting. I was hoping I would laugh or say it was funny but i cant even watch this in a theater...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie with my parents once.  It was a great show, well acted, good scenery, and really fun.  I was just thinking about how nice it was that there was a girl in this movie.   This one is about a girl who is living in the back country, her mother is dead, and she does not want to get married.  She has a son, and the son hates her.  Her father has had his job in another state.  One day she meets a man who was raised by wolves, a man she wants to raise.  He is a very attractive guy, in a leather jacket and a big hat with a very large, wide-rimmed, and sharp teeth.  The film was pretty funny, and had a great soundtrack.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an odd one. It's based on a very well-known story. The author himself made it into an acclaimed movie with the help of the talented Al Pacino. In fact, in the movie, I was watching Pacino playing the role of the villainous Mr. Green; Green was in the habit of stealing, or at least making off with, the cash the family was supposed to receive each year from the Social Security payments. So I wasn't surprised when I first read the book and discovered that it was all just a lot of lies. The story of the Green family as it turns out was not true, the story was just invented; Mr. Reddy had his hand in all that. Redty had been one of the original members of the Communist Party in Bombay. He, in fact, became a communist himself during the Great War and then helped to train young men to fight against the British. Redy had a son who was one of these young men, and he trained this child to become a spy for the British, who wanted him to recruit other young men into the Communist cause and then overthrow the British for good! This was one hell of a story; I've heard it so many times. I can only think it would be easier to make it up. The plot is, of course, a lot more convoluted. What's remarkable is that the movie gets away with it. But the movie doesn't get away with all that; the movie tries to do it justice, but it misses the mark. For example, the idea that the Communist spies were young and not old, is ridiculous; it would have been better to show the Communist agents as being in their early twenties. The film also fails to make good use of the plot, which is nothing more than a set-up for the climax. What should be a well-balanced film in which the Communists make their move, is instead a film where the Communists are merely a means to an end: the British want the Communist party to overthrow the ruling family so they can get control of the country. And when the climax comes, it's even more of a disappointment than most other movies: it comes out of the blue, without a plot or even a climax; it comes across as a bad film, like it is all just made up. So it's a disappointment, and there are better films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was lame, the actors were terrible, and the acting talent was average.  In fact, the only good thing about this film was that it had no dialogue at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can not make a bad comedy. The actors are absolutely awful and there is absolutely nothing to make this movie funny. It's just an attempt at a comedy based on bad writing. It is a terrible comedy that I could not even watch once, yet that was a lot of fun. I'm sure we'll see a lot more of this movie and not a single person who sees this movie will enjoy it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is so bad that it's worth watching from the first minute to the last.   A story about a boy (Barry Sonnenfeld) who is brought up in poverty by his deadbeat uncle (Paul Newman) and his crazy sister.  There are no interesting characters in this film and what is left is just a bunch of stereotypes.  What really makes this movie a disappointment is that most of the cast members don't appear in any of the movies that they star in.  It's like they think that because they're in movies that it makes them good actors.  A list of the good actors in this movie would include Christopher Lee, Paul Newman, Dean Martin, Errol Flynn, Mickey Rooney, Dennis Hopper, Frank Sinatra, and Marlene Dietrich. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A pretty good old-fashioned ghost story.    A bunch of folks in a shack in the middle of nowhere decide to build a new cabin because of a dead guy who keeps turning up in the woods. It doesn't take long before he returns and tries to eat them in the same old old way.  The actors are all terrific, and the ghost's voice is so menacing that I'm not sure I want to see the movie again.  There are more great, old-time ghost stories out there that are just as good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the best comedy in a long time. I thought the movie was going to be about a young kid who can't talk, so this is actually not very funny.   I thought they'd make a film about a crazy lady who goes to the zoo, so that must mean they're just making jokes about the crazy lady. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of people hate that there is a sequel to an old Stephen King story "Carrie" but "The Mist" is about a very different kind of villain than the one in "Carrier": this one has a lot of subtlety. The film is a good blend of horror, action and an evil presence that lurks inside of your subconscious. There are some strong performances by the actors (especially the male ones, I mean, that is a big cast of characters) and it seems like a decent movie. This is a great horror movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You would think it would be a bad idea to have a group of five kids all of whom are really really stupid and annoying in the same movie, but that's exactly what is happened, and it just gets worse from there. It's kind of a shame, really, because the plot is kind of interesting, and the acting is pretty good, and I actually had a good time doing the math that the time passes were correct, so it was probably a bad move to not have a time machine or something to make them all go to the beginning of time, but since we don't need it (and we already know how that turned out) it really doesn't matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There were no real surprises in this movie, other than the fact that this movie is one big plot to ruin all others.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really terrible. The first half, though, is decent. The second half is absolutely terrible. It tries to be a romantic comedy and doesn't even get there. The ending is not only terrible, it's so stupid it can only be described as evil.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a pretty bad movie. The actors are pretty bad as well.  I guess that they all tried to be "wacky" so they would get the ratings they were looking for.  This is probably the only movie that is like, "I guess that would be worth a watch for an old guy who loves 'old movies' like 'Hogan's Heroes' and 'The Wizard of Oz'." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did enjoy this movie, and there were some nice moments. The first half I thought, "Well... I'm not sure I'm enjoying this movie". The plot is very simple - the man (a scientist) is in love with a woman who has her eye on him. One day he comes across a body in the woods and is attacked by a woman with a knife.  She then cuts the scientist into pieces which are then reassembled and she leaves... the film has the feel of a very cheaply produced horror movie with a lot of poor acting and special effects.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end you get more of the same old cheesy story (I loved it even). This is the "good guys" vs the "bad guys" fight to rule the galaxy.  In my opinion, this is not a Star Wars movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not the best movie in the world, but it's a great way to start the new year, with a movie that can make anyone feel a little better.   Written and directed by a certain Peter Jackson, it opens in a magical kingdom in the middle of the woods.  It has everything that I loved in the Lord of the Rings trilogy: fantastic special effects, a great cast of actors and a good, funny ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film noir in which the leading character is played by a man who looks like a supermodel, a character whose only distinguishing feature is that he looks like he's having fun in a nightclub. The rest of the movie is a series of boring chase scenes in which these characters, always driving in an old, big station wagon, chase each other around town until they have no one left to chase. The movie is pretty bad: the actors don't look good; the music is pretty lame; the plot is boring; the ending is lame. The only redeeming thing about this movie is that it does have some fun, which isn't a bad thing by any means; but I don't think this is the best movie you'll ever see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a good idea. I was looking forward to hearing some of the original characters and their dialogue. However, it was not like any of the characters were memorable. It had a pretty short running time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the "Mud" movie is a total piece of crap.  It is the kind of movie that you only see once or twice in a lifetime.  The plot has one huge problem:  Everyone in this movie is ugly, even the people who don't get into any fights.  This is not the best acting in a movie, but it can be excused in part because every one in the movie is terrible, and even the best ones like the ugly red haired girl can not save the movie from total failure.   If you can't see this movie for your own enjoyment, well, it is at least better than "The Dark Knight Rises." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not sure if this is better than "A Very Merry, Christmas Movie"  Or not.  The "A" in the title of this film isn't the one that should be "A".  The film is very dated.  It's Christmas time, and so is the show.   I know there is an awful lot of Christmas stuff in the film, but is Christmas really that boring.  What is the point of an elaborate Christmas dinner?  I would prefer a Christmas cartoon.  In fact, I would much rather have seen a Christmas-type film than one about a Christmas dinner.  This was a film that I felt didn't really try to make a great Christmas film.  There are so many Christmas scenes.  I found it hard to believe that this was a holiday show.   I also found it very amusing to see the actors playing children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My mother has a copy of this book as a gift from me. She gave it to me before I went to Europe in November of 1967 for a month. I didn't care much about reading a book so soon after my arrival. As was to be expected, I quickly fell in love with that crazy, free, fun atmosphere of Amsterdam. I remember my mother saying how much I loved that, and she would be proud of me. The book does not really say much about Amsterdam. It tells us about a young girl who falls in love, who falls off a balcony, and who gets shot by a policeman. This young girl is one of the four girls from the house of a poor, sick, but kind mother. Her name is Maria. After the murder, the police, who seem to take no interest in the murder at all, take over the case. This mother is a very unhappy woman. After her husband dies and her daughter is sold, her life is really turned upside down. After a visit to the police station, she runs away and moves in with a housekeeper's family in a small and poor neighborhood. Her mother, now without a husband and a daughter, looks after the housekeepers, who are also suffering from poverty. I was surprised to learn that the mother has given up a very good career and made a living in the housekeeping business. We see how the housekeeper, Rosa, tries to make a living, but always manages to screw it up. After Maria's murder, Rosa gets out on bail. Her lawyer, a charming young man, wants Rosa to testify against her daughter. The judge does not approve, and he sends Rosa away to the prison at the end of the sentence. The next morning Rosa is put back in the jail. In fact she is released, as the judge's ruling was made not long after Rosa's death. It is this judge who makes Rosa, and the other girls, take drugs so that they won't feel guilty about the murder. In a way, it is an entertaining book. It shows a free, funny, happy city, with a very active citizenry who go to see the theater, the football games, and everything else they can find. The main character is a girl who is very young, is very free, is full of joy, and is very sad. The only problem is that she is totally dependent on drugs and alcohol.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In what is becoming a regular pattern with films of this genre I was disappointed by the story. It is all too commonplace for the people at the bottom of a socioeconomic scale to be oppressed by the rich. The poor are portrayed as a bunch of morons that do stupid things. This is one of those films that I would never watch and I was not going to because it reminded me of something out of another kind of a film: a very bad video game about an insane man who can talk to animals.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a weird movie. It's weird and it's weird with a bad ending.   The characters are weird.  For starters, there's a girl who looks like she'd rather be on a beach in Venice than in the Middle East. She's the perfect girl. She has the hottest boyfriend and the hottest mother in the world. She wears tight shorts and swimsuits. She never eats at a table and she's so good at swimming that she's even able to kick a water balloon with her feet. I don't know how this is not the most bizarre film I've ever seen, but it is.  But that's not all.  The story involves a woman who is obsessed with a book that was discovered by some Egyptian scientists about three thousand years ago.  She gets it to read and she has the best time ever.  Unfortunately, the book turns out to be a fake. It has no relevance to anything and the only thing it seems to talk about is a woman named Cleopatra who is the Queen of the Egyptians.  This is where things get a little weird. She goes back to Egypt to get the real book and the real Cleopatra.  What's even stranger is that she meets her in a swimming pool.  It appears that Cleopattas was also obsessed with reading about the lives of the Egyptian Gods and this seems to be the only book on which she seems to have read anything.  Somehow, these two women have stumbled across the real thing about the ancient Egyptians.   Why they should have found something as trivial as a swimsuit book is beyond me.  In my opinion, this film is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of my favorite movies of all time. There is a reason why the movie is so popular... it is one hell of a romp! From start to finish, this movie is filled with action, humor and an amazing cast of characters! If you like a good action movie or a good horror movie, this is the one!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know, I know, this is a bad review to post, and is likely to elicit the same reaction as the one I gave last time about this  films  'bad'.    You think, you've seen this movie, the title implies that it is all action and explosions, but it is actually a bit of a downer.   Well, it's an action movie so we can't be too surprised.  The film starts with an explosion and we see two guys go to find out what the heck happened. I'm not quite sure why a man and a woman can't hold hands in a public place.  This movie will get boring if they keep repeating it, but the action scenes are pretty good.  I'm surprised the film wasn't cancelled at the end, it really does need a title like 'Ace of Spades' to survive.  A man finds a girl in a hospital.  Her name is Alice and she seems to be in a bad way.  We are introduced to her father's best friend, Mr. J. J., who is a real bad guy.  Mr. S. Sarge tells him that he's been to see Mrs. Alice and that she is in trouble.    What we also see in this movie is that a lot of people are on the side of the villains, so a lot will be on a lot to do.     The final battle takes place at the seaside and the villains are all killed off, but Alice gets to return to a better world.  However, she is left in a state of confusion.  If you're thinking about this film, then I strongly advise you not to watch it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this movie. It was enjoyable and a bit amusing. The story of a boy and his horse was the least interesting part of the film. They just sat there for two hours, the horse looking bored as he was. The boy was good but seemed very uncomfortable. He just sat on a stump with a stupid grin on his face and said, "Good evening, I'm John. John Smith has left the house, I wonder what he wants? Oh, I don't think he does, he's too fat." The film was pretty good and it was nice to see the horse running around, but it was very strange to see a guy named John Smith. Maybe he was a boy who liked to ride a horse. And when he gets off the horse, what happens? He jumps off, not into the sea or down a volcano, not even into a tree, he jumps off the back of the horse into a stream of water. It doesn't hurt him at all and he just disappears. This is the end of the movie. When I was watching the movie, I didn't know that John Smith was a horse, but in the movie he really did seem like a horse and when he jumped into the water, I thought, "hmm, I can't wait to see what happens next." I guess that was pretty cool.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a good movie. It is so bad that it is hard to tell how bad it actually is.  It seems to be a bunch of middle-aged, middle-class white people talking about the terrible bad things that have happened to them in the past few years - mostly with a little bit of music accompaniment - and a lot of them seem to be trying to figure out if they are racist or not.   The first two minutes were horrible - it was so bad, in fact, that the person who made this movie decided that this was a good time to give an award to a few of these characters for a poor performance.  I don't know about the rest of them, but I can't imagine a worse acting performance from any actor of his generation.  If you have the time and want a laugh, this film is for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are two bad movies in a row, and they both stink.  First, the opening credits, which are supposed to represent the world, are made to look like they're about the World Trade Center.  This is supposed to be a nice little film about World Trade Organization and WTO and it's supposed to end with the same old movie about some sort of World-Wide World Government.  They make a little girl in a bubble and she goes to a place that is supposed be a place of eternal peace.  And then a guy gets out of a ship at the end and goes to the place they want him to go.  It's almost as if they wanted to make a cheap blockbuster with a story where no one dies and no one really dies.  What a shame that this movie gets such lousy reviews and no money for poor sales.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would love to see a second installment of this awful film to add to the list of stupid, dumb, bad films that the studio churns out every week. If this movie was made by John Hughes it would have cost much more and been an even bigger bomb. The first two movies were really bad. I am sure that we will soon have more awful films that need no introduction and the studio is a big fat loser who will soon be out of business.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are looking for something like a Star Trek movie, this is it.  Star Trek: First Contact is very good, the story is great, and the visual effects are very good.  The movie is set 20 years prior to Star Trek III.  This film is an excellent entry in a whole generation of science fiction.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason we don't hear about the amazing and well produced show that is Black Widow on the big screen is because no one seems to want to make it.   It's hard to get anyone interested about the first female superhero film with the same level of seriousness and heart we expect to see in a James Bond film.  I thought a female superhero could make a big splash in the comic book world, but this movie fails to do anything to change the perception that women can't play a major part in mainstream comics.  They should have cast a strong female who could have been an inspiration to women everywhere.  It seems like every time this film is mentioned online, the internet warriors are attacking it as some sort of sexist garbage.  My only concern is this: Black Widow's costume is almost identical to that of Marvel's Ms. Marvel! It's very hard to believe that this is the same company who produces Black Widow and has also licensed Ms.Marvel over to Marvel NOW!.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really a bad one, but I didn't find any of the elements, even the acting, enjoyable. One of the most blatant examples of why you don't trust directors is that they don't care about or even understand what happens to the main character.   The two scenes where she tries to get off the island (which, as far as I'm aware, are two different stories) aren't actually about her getting off the plane in the first place: they're about her trying to find an item which is the key to getting off her island, and then getting her butt kicked when she finally decides to go. She's then told not to try again until she can find the key, and that "you will find it" (this was a bit of a theme for the whole movie: the "thing" they were talking about was the key) is not the key.  Even after finding the key (and getting her ass kicked by the guard), the island doesn't exist for her. She has to get the key and get it back to the island to "get the thing" again (that is, go through this "magic door") and then she gets told to be quiet because the island will "disappear."   It's not just that it's pointless: it's that the movie doesn't care.  The scenes in which the main characters get off their island are a complete waste of time.  This movie seems to be about characters who are constantly finding an easy shortcut to getting rid of their problems (like the one who says, "Well, I can find a path through this mud and see the water."), and there's no challenge to it.  There isn't even a challenge for the characters; it's just like the movie is in "slow motion" as each character tries to figure out how to get out of a problem they create.  And then when there is a challenge, it's not a good one.  One of my favorite moments of the movie comes when a character says he's looking for "a piece of glass" that is "big" (I know I'm repeating myself, but this is really the best part).   What's supposed to be big is small, so the character pulls a dagger out of his sleeve and begins to cut off his arm.  What he does next is the only problem: the blade cuts through a water glass, which makes a horrible sound when it breaks (
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, the first movie was great. It was pretty funny, the music was nice. But then the sequel gets worse! I mean, there's no way the first one was good.   It's not even funny.  There are too many clichés in it, including (I kid you not), the "wounded warrior" (the guy that's so hurt that he wants to "do a little killing"). I found it hilarious that when a guy said: "You know what's funny? He's in this movie, even though he's paralyzed"   Then the guy that was crippled said "What, like I don't have a choice?"   I'm just amazed that this thing is getting so much money on this DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My first viewing of this film was very disappointing.   I did not care that it was an English speaking film, I did it because I saw it.  A couple of people told me I "had to" see it. The only reason I saw the movie was because I had a book to finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The only reason to watch this is to get a laugh. It's a cheap comedy, and I can only say this since this is the only film from this company that I have ever seen. This film is nothing but slapstick with a big fat black dick. I don't understand how a man can sit down in a chair and have to sit on an orange like a horse with a saddle bag over his head and carry around a black bag with a small black dick that has to be jerking himself off or his wife must really suck big black dicks to make him cum! Oh, and the name of the movie is Black Jack! (I don't think I can finish that sentence) This film was created by the man that created the movie The Wizard of Oz. If you don't want to see a comedy made by black people with a bag full of black dildos, this is a good place to end your evening.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a terrible piece of schlock that would've been at home on the low-rent cable show The Twilight Zone.  As an example of how bad it is, let's look at a typical scene. A young man (played by George C. Scott) and his brother are playing golf in their suburban home. They happen to spot a very pretty woman (played with an air of sophistication by Elizabeth Taylor) walking down the street with a friend.  The brother gets a bit too close to the woman (who later turns out to be Elizabeth's ex-husband) and she accuses him of trying to rape her.  George C Scott is supposed to be the scruffy, slightly dorky neighbor kid, and, yes, the film is set in the 1950's.  But the woman is supposed be Elizabeth Taylor, as she turns out later to be his ex-wife, and she never once calls George C a "hussy."  Why does this woman, who looks like the "oldest white actress in Hollywood," suddenly attack her ex-husband?  Why was it a close-run thing?  I mean, you could be mistaken about the fact that it's really George C who tries to rape this old, broken-down, out-of-work woman -  but you still know it's George C!  Why did the film producers let this guy get away with this?  If they had wanted to make a racist movie they would've made a black man do the rape.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One can watch this movie and find it a failure.   It's a good movie, but the acting and the screenplay make me wonder whether the author is trying to be funny.  It tries too hard to be "comical", though not always successfully.  The ending was somewhat of a letdown, though it made it easier to understand.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am glad I watched it and it was not terrible. It was a movie I would enjoy if it was good. It did have an interesting plot but I never got into it, even though I am a big fan of James Bond movies. This movie is a very generic spy story.  It didn't really change the game and didn't make me think about it for the rest of the day.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about what a bunch of degenerates go through in a very sad, short movie.    Not to sound rude, but a lot of times when I watch the film, it does not even resemble a movie at all.  I've seen worse movies.  It seems that the guy who directed this movie (a guy named Mike Siegel, who is also the author of the book on which the movie is based), has a lot to hide.  His movies have not produced any real sales at the box office.  There are some good performances, but not as good as I would expect from a film titled, "The End of an Era".  The actors' faces do not convey a sense of humor and the film is so sad that even its name has the word "end" in it.  A movie so bad that no one would ever watch it or even buy a copy of it would be the end of a era. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never watched this one because I thought I was too old to get caught up in "dumb and dumber" but apparently it's been around since the 80's and there's no way you can have seen it by the time you're 40!  This is one stupid, dumb, dumb movie!    This movie was made before "the Cosby Show" and even before "The Larry Sanders Show" - so this is not that.   The only thing that made the film good were the actors, who were in this with a vengeance.  And that's why I gave it a good rating, that is, except for one thing:   It's the same kind of movie I remember seeing in the 80s and it's almost always bad and boring!  It doesn't hold a candle to the great, classic comedy that is "Airplane!"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a pretty good movie: I liked it; the bad thing about it is that the ending is kinda pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like that they use their actors to create interesting stories.   It's too bad that the actors don't do much besides give the "good guy" an interesting story and tell us that it's always a good time when you're in Vegas. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another low budget action flick that does not really impress.  No guns, no action, no special effects, no real characters.  The movie makes no real impression.  It does not seem all that interesting.  There are some good action scenes, but no real dramatic moments.  This movie is so bad that it is hard to even remember anything about it.   I would not waste your time with this movie.  If you like the Rambo series, then get this, but not if you are a fan of the movie Rambo.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The King's Ransom" is about three men with nothing to lose. The man, the writer, the gambler, and the fool are caught up in a conspiracy involving a group of rich men who want a new prison built on the property that they have given to a country family. The trouble begins when a young farm boy becomes the object of the King's attentions and they fall in love. And then the trouble begins to spread and more and more of the poor folk are taken away by the ruffians to build a prison. But the greatest danger for the King is that there's a group at the prison who want to blow it all up and see their King replaced by someone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this film I was skeptical.  I had seen a couple of films about a dog that has a problem and then a man named Ray (Dennis Hopper in a great role) that saves the day, and I knew Ray could handle himself.  But then the film starts getting bad.  We have a film that takes place in the 1950's and has almost no blood or gore, and it's just a few scenes of a dog and a man that are being murdered by a gang of kids.  It takes about 4 minutes into the film for the movie to begin and it is just a film about a man trying to solve a problem that he is faced with as soon as he shows up.  The best part of this film is that it isn't just a horror movie, it's a film of character and it has a heart of gold.  Dennis Hopper is fantastic and his performance is so perfect that even today I feel it's impossible to watch this film and not come out with a smile on my face.  As soon as I saw this movie I knew I had to see it again, and this time, I did.   The Good:   The Good:    As a horror film this is not bad, but there are definitely a couple things that hold it back from being a truly great film.  One of the things that bothers me about this film are all the children running around.  At least they weren't running out of the house like in the first film. Another thing is that one of the characters is just sort of in the background for most of the film.   But what this movie does really well, and really well only because of Dennis Hooper is the acting.  This is possibly Hooper's best performance and it really shows because of the amount of different personalities that Hooper gives to each of the people that he plays.  Even though I love Dennis Hoopers movies and his performances, this is still one of my favorite performances because he doesn't just give us a good performance but he gives us a character that is so good at what he does that it is hard not to enjoy it.  Finally it helps that Hopps is just perfect.  Just the way he walks and talks is great, he can have a character be cool or he can make a child acting like a baby acting like an old man, it really makes a great performance.  What really makes this film great

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just plain awful.  I have already reviewed it (and found the same problems) to hell and back in one of my earlier reviews.  The cast is as laughable as the movie is, and it just gets better and worse as the film goes on and on.  One has to wonder how anyone ever even found a movie like this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of the most disappointing films i've ever seen. There is just no substance to anything; there are some cool looking scenes, but none of the story has any purpose, it seems to be a prelude to a movie from the 90's called The Great War, a movie that had a great deal more value to it than it has. The Great war   is a movie about soldiers returning to Europe for the war.   It has the same plot as The Last Man on Earth: a man wakes up in a strange city where he has been placed in charge of the city, but has been unable to make any changes to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You would never think this would be an issue.   A very strange premise, involving the discovery of a mysterious cave and the discovery that it is a "living" cave. A strange premise but an interesting one.  It's actually not bad at all, just odd.  But, to be fair, the film isn't bad in any way.  The plot is fairly standard.  We follow a man named Mike, his cat and his dog, who happen upon a strange cave.  Our protagonist, who we will later discover is actually a little girl, falls in love with the animal and tells her mother what they are up to.  After a long and funny intro by his mother and her friends (who happen to be the other half of "Mullet" the comic strip), we are introduced to the animal itself - a hairy, furry thing, about as furry as a cat can get.  Mike falls in with a local caveman, and in a rather hilarious sequence, the two of them fight the local big bad, a very angry looking creature with a huge gun - and we find out what makes him so angry.  As a young boy, Mike was the victim of a tragic accident. The accident was so bad that the girl of his dreams had to be buried alive in the nearby creek.     But Mike, who had spent a lifetime as a caveman before all that, had never felt quite so bad about himself.  At the funeral of his dead daughter, he finds himself alone in the cemetery, watching as his mother's friends, one by one, are buried - in a place where there had once been a woman.  In addition to this, we're also introduced to a group of children, the only survivors from the accident, who have formed a community at Mike's cave, and to the cave-dweller, one the only female in the group, whose name is Lulu.  This is all very well done, with the humour coming from Lulu's naivety, Mike's need for acceptance, and the general general oddness of it all.  Even though Mike and Lulu are very different characters (a sort of combination of Mike from the surface world and the cave man from the underground world), the two actually get along quite well.  And there are some amusing bits: Mike, on one occasion, is playing with his "gun", a bow and arrow.  Naturally it jams. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you haven't seen the first one, I'm going to be blunt about it: This is a complete waste of a movie. You're never going to see a movie quite like this again. The story, the characters, everything has been done before in a slightly different order. I could have sworn we had an intermission here at one point, but that couldn't be right. I don't think that this is a good movie and don't even think that it is a bad one. It may be better than the original but it is still a dud.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story line revolves around a guy who is sent to prison in a movie theater and must try to outsmart the bad guy, who has a "magic" chair (that you can't move) who will kill a bad guy who doesn't want to play by the rules. The movie is basically a lot of people dancing around, and no one seems to take the movie seriously. I'm not even sure who was in the movie. I guess the movie was produced by the same man who made "The Wild Angels" and "A Boy Named Sue".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No, this movie doesn't suck. That's what makes it so bad. It's got great production value, some excellent acting, and a bad, stupid plot. (If there's one movie I can't wait to see again and again, it's this one.) So what are the flaws? Well, in the first three minutes, I was confused as to the purpose of a movie like this. It takes its title from a poem by John Keats. What poem? The one that ends with the line: "To my dear old friend of many a year I am sending a letter...to say I have thought a great deal of thee, / The last days are passing by quickly and the sun's still shining on the garden." Okay, I don't know how I'm going to summarize this movie. A pretty young actress, whose name I forgot, plays an old man in a strange, medieval setting. It feels like the setting could have come from a children's book. But even so, it doesn't feel like something that was pulled out of thin air. The movie starts off in a kind of stilted manner. A young man goes to meet a mysterious old woman. She's a beautiful woman, who tells him to go home, and the next morning he doesn't see her. I don.t think I need to tell you that this movie is full of contradictions. It is supposed to be about a man's trip to see the girl he loves, but he spends a lot of the film in a state of total amnesia, so you can't tell where the movie stops and reality begins. He comes to find her, he sees her, she's dead, he's in a terrible mood, he has a very confused attitude towards life. I've seen the film a few times already and it's always the same. It doesn't do much to convince you about the existence of spirits in the universe. It seems to imply, but does not prove, that one of the old woman's brothers is an exorcist. That makes it the "exorcism movie" as many people call it, but it's not a good one. There is nothing about the spirit world here. There's no exorcism. It just seems like the story was written to show off the director's style. It also seems to have been written with an agenda in mind, one that's pretty obvious, but that is not always easy to discern. The main problem
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't think this movie is any better than the last one.   It has some bad acting (especially by Michael J. Fox), it is a bit predictable, and the "chase" scenes are kind of annoying.  It should have been made into a television movie with lots of bad acting and no real plot; it's too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'll take "The Girl From Strahov" for the record. I don't mind the bad acting, the dumb story and the way this movie can get stuck in your head. There is no plot, just one crazy girl who falls for the main man from his film company and falls in love. The story is stupid, nothing happens and the girl is too stupid to fall in love with the guy. The movie ends at a good point when everyone is happy and has a good time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie.   It was not a good idea to go to a movie with the lead actors who were all on heroin and then have them dance around and do stupid dances.  They looked like they were wearing a "I'm so gay" tee and the lead actor was a very uninspired and terrible dancer.  The music was cheesy and they used the same song over and over again.  It seemed they were trying to get their movie out as quickly as possible so they didn't have time to change their faces and dance in ways that were out of the ordinary.  This was the movie that made me want to run to the nearest exit so I wouldn't have to sit through another one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful, but not as bad as I expected! I knew it was a bad film from the very first shot of the trailer. It was a film made in the seventies with cheap special effects that were more to draw the eye of the viewer than to entertain the audience. There's not one moment in the whole movie that was memorable. The music was bad and the movie was boring. I couldn't get into it. I never felt like I'd enjoy the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When it comes to the zombie genre there are some gems here. The first one is the good one. It has a good pace. The characters feel like they have some substance and depth to them. In this case the good guys. The plot is nothing outstanding. It's basically the standard, if not worse. It doesn't help that the characters are the worst, but the plot doesn't really care about them either. This is the first and last zombie movie that I have seen. I don't think I have any great memories of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is the first time in the movies that I was expecting some nice action but all that I got was a cheesy and stupid story. I really hoped that after a few bad movies with the same thing, they would be able to put some real effort into this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only bad movie I've ever seen is  The Black Cat  and that's because the movie is just bad. That said, this film has some good moments that are worth watching. I do have a few thoughts about this movie, but I'll save them for a separate review. The movie is about two guys. They're both drunks, and they are drunk all the time. This movie is like watching a drunk walk through a graveyard. It's kind of funny. There's also a brief scene of a car hitting another car; which I didn't see, but if there is a car accident, there is probably some pretty gruesome looking carnage. But it just isn't worth it. The dialogue is atrocious. There was also a weird old lady in the movie who looked like she must have had some sort of terminal illness or something; and she just said things like "I'm sorry about the dog" and "I hope this ends well." I think the producers were having a laugh, but that just didn't seem like anything I could possibly hear or understand. So it's just a dull movie. Nothing wrong with it; I'm just not a big fan of alcohol and driving. I guess it wasn't supposed to be as bad as it turned out to be, so maybe it just didnned't work out the way they expected. It is, however, a movie I can watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a bad film, but it's not great either. It's a bit boring, and the actors are too old. I can't see why they had to film the movie this way; there are much better films from the 1920s.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie about a couple of idiots who can't figure out how to go to a movie theater and instead go to the police station to ask how to avoid getting busted.   The movie begins with one of the morons explaining to his co-murderer/possible accomplice, that going to see a movie at the cinema doesn't count as a crime because the movies are free and all.  No one is laughing at the moron either.      It does, however, take a while for the movie to start up, with the moronic cops explaining to the idiot couple why they are going to have to pay for the tickets. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, I'd been wanting to see this movie for a while now, but I just couldn't pull the trigger. I've seen it once or twice on my own, but never on a big budget or with some big names. This time, however, I couldn't resist.   This movie is a really bad movie. It's a bad, boring, tedious movie. And if you're looking for some kind of entertainment, it's not the movie for you. It might as well be called the "Macho Man" movie, as there's nothing really to it. There's nothing new in it, there's no surprises, no twists, it doesn't offer anything of interest in the story.  In fact, it actually serves as a very bad lesson in what to do and not to do when shooting a movie, which is a lesson that should have been learned years ago.  It is almost embarrassing how badly the filmmakers handled this movie. The editing was atrocious, the acting was bad, the directing was bad (with the exception of the music) and the special effects were not even good enough to make the movie remotely entertaining.  The only thing that's fun about this film is the acting, which of course is quite bad, especially for a movie that's supposed to be about macho men.  I think it would have been more fun if the actors were not so good.  If you don't believe me, I encourage you to sit through the film and hear it in action (there are several scenes in this film, which you really shouldn't be watching because of what they contain).   For me, it was very disappointing, as I expected better from a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a poor excuse for a musical about a man who is trapped in a time warp. It doesn't show off any real talent. That would require a lot of effort from the actors, but they didn't give it a chance. The music is boring and the dialogue is as bad as it ever was.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know if I need to put this in here, but I really did not get this movie. I feel as if I've heard the same old story over and over and I'm ready to throw my head out the window. I was never a fan of this movie, and I do not feel like I needed to be. If there was even something to the premise there should've been a decent amount of comedy to help lighten it up. If it was an action movie this could've been entertaining, but it was much too far gone to get into, and it made me tired. The special effects didn't do them any favors either. I'll never be able to watch a live action "Ghostbusters" film the same way again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen a lot of bad movies, but nothing as bad as this! It makes you feel like you're in hell. It's not that it's bad, just that it takes its time to tell you what's going on. I'm just glad I could have seen this in its original release. There is one scene that is truly bizarre, but that's about it for this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a sad example of poor filmmaking that comes from an era when we wanted the good old fashioned B movie.  The first half of the movie is a bad old fashioned comedy which is about the death of a husband and wife couple and the mother of the wife was really bad, and the only reason why people like it is because it is so over the top that it will give you that "jelly-beans-in-my-face" feeling.  If you do not like bad, over thetop B movies, you probably have not seen a comedy movie in the last three decades.  This movie is really bad and I will watch it every time that I am in the mood for a bad comedy with a lot of nudity and one of the best lines about Jesus.  I wish that this movie did not exist because it would have made it much harder for me to watch and would not have had me laughing so much at the stupidity and the bad acting that made me want to scream at the screen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. There was nothing good about it. The only redeeming point is that the script is so bad there was no way the movie could get a PG rating (the film is rated PG-13 in the US). I was hoping that after reading the script (I have the DVD on my shelf) I was in for a real gem. But no, this is another typical science fiction movie and nothing more.

You've got to get the audience to love you or else they'll take you apart."   That might be true but   they couldn't find anyone better, certainly not any one that could have played a baddie like a real person.   This is one of those "I saw it once when I was 10" type of bad movies that I think are pretty interesting and could have been interesting in different eras:  - When your bad movie is about a group of people who are all playing bad guys, it gives you an idea of just how much they can be pulled apart.  - It's interesting to watch a film that doesn't even try to be a comedy: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not surprised the title is taken, the plot is not. The setting is one that is easily recognized by anyone who has ever been to Disney World. The main character, a young, female elf named Snow White, is trapped in a tower on the top of a mountain and constantly assaulted by monsters like the wolf who wants to eat her (because she eats her shadow) or the spider who wants her to wear the wedding ring (because the ring will let her get down the mountain without getting eaten). Throughout the movie she keeps on having to fight her own shadow to survive, at one point she finally takes it on (and loses), and then she gets trapped there again and then loses another one. Throughout the story she has a pretty strong voice as far as female characters go, but she never seems to be able to find that strong voice again. The plot is fairly predictable, pretty badly. The music is okay, there is a lot of it, and it's all very sad and sad songs. I was not too impressed.  The film is in English, so not a complete picture! It will take a little while to get through the first half, but this is a movie that you have to give a shot.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't know that it would be good.   It's got the standard   slasher    genre thing going for it.  There are two guys (I don't know who or what they are), one guy looks like a clown and one guy doesn't look too much like a human at all, he's a vampire like one from hell.  But the whole thing is supposed to be done in a school setting, which is where the real horror happens.  The girls are trying to protect the guy and the guy is trying to kill the girls.  Even the teachers are supposed to get murdered too, but no one gets killed!  This movie is nothing but   mindless   ludicrous   idiocy, just like the other   vampire movie   I have seen.  It never gets any more interesting than the last few minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a movie that was produced with all the resources of Hollywood behind it. It has amazing sets, a great score, and fantastic actors. The story is a fairly good one, it is mostly predictable. The last third is where the movie gets interesting. The action is pretty bad, but there is a reason why the makers of this movie chose to film this. The violence in this movie is not the typical Hollywood movie violence. The gun fighting and explosions are awesome. I really enjoyed this movie, it's not a bad one and it is a lot of fun to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the few bad movies I remember watching growing up.  Not good at all...  Not even really bad.  That's it...  All the way in the movie is the sound of a gun clacking...  And there's an explosion.  Nothing special.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really want to speak to anyone about this film, except to tell you that this is a terrible movie! It is filled with a lot of "bad jokes", it is very bad, it is bad that the actors should not have done their best to make this film better. I thought that this one had potential, but it is so bad! I had to put the movie down, as this film was so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is one of the worst of the year.  It has an unapologetic, stupid, pointless, stupid idea: The main character travels to another world to find out if there is anyone he can marry.  The premise is just dumb.   And what a stupid premise it is.  One of the characters is a robot and is constantly whining about how much life sucks.  His brother, a demon who has the body of a frog, has one main goal: to defeat and marry the main character.  And all he has to do it get the main guy to believe that he is his brother.  They spend the whole movie running around and talking like two idiots and he is trying to find his brother when in reality, the entire movie is a stupid, stupid lie.  It is just another dumb movie from the same makers as Dumb And Dumber and The Adventures Of Pluto Nash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The good: A couple of good actors who have no problem doing a pretty bad movie. The bad: You should never have a good movie with the voice of a drunk clown. The voice is the voice (and the clown's) of a drunken clown. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is about a mother who gets a job at a state hospital that is located in the swamp. The staff is very mean and the nurse at the hospital who is a whore and a sluts. She is so foul in every aspect, I would not leave her alone. She comes home one night to find her teenage son dead and then she is visited by a man who is not happy at all about the death of his son. He also had a daughter with a different father and had a son who died a few years before, and he was very angry about this. He wants revenge for all the deaths and murders that have taken place in his days. He is not very happy with how things are in the state hospital and I found it interesting that he came back to the swamp to see how things were. I found the acting was very good by most of the actors. Some of the worst came from the young women, all of them are like trash, with only one being a few days older than the others and she had no real personality. I did find it funny that the man who did the killing, killed his own brother as a child, which he did to stop a child molester who was abusing him. So much for some family values. There is only one person who has a personality and that is the lead character, and she is like a little child when it comes to things like these. I would have rather watched a movie about a little boy who is an orphan in his own home and lives with a man that is not like his mother, living off of her. I know that sounds like a bad review, but it really wasn't that bad at all. The story was interesting and the acting is good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad I had to cut the last third, so I could tell the whole story. It's a good movie, but it's really just a bad and very bad movie. As a long time fan of the genre I always thought that this was the worst of the bunch. But I don't watch any bad movies, as they usually don't have a great script. So I didn't mind that, but the acting was so terrible it's disgusting. The special effects are awful, as is the special effects make up and the direction. The story is a joke that doesn't make sense, and the final act is all done with the special effect make up, the special make up that is, and not the actors. I'm not a huge fan of this type of movie, because the story just doesn't work, the characters don't make much sense. So much of what is happening just doesn the feel like they were written in a notebook or on a piece of paper and then glued to a cardboard tube. I didn"t even care about the special, which I would have had to pay to see, and why I didn"(t care to see is anyone's guess. The acting was bad, so bad it's hilarious. And the special makes up was a waste of time. It doesn"t show any special effects, it"s not special make and not special effects and it is just a bunch of bad jokes and a bad special, and a bunch or a joke made up in a hurry. There wasn"t really anything funny in this movie, the only thing I found funny was the special which is just the worst in the entire series. And it makes me wonder if they even did a special, but a terrible one, for a sequel, as if they didn"T think that people would want to see a sequel to this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found that this movie was a mess. I was expecting a film set in the future about the last person to see Elvis before he died. Instead, it was about a guy who had come back to the future. The plot didn't work and the story seemed ridiculous. As far as the acting goes, some guy has to be the last guy to see this Elvis. He gets to see his son when he is born and has to spend the rest of his life trying to stop him. Oh, and then he falls in love with someone else? I think I can already hear the detractors now.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a mess. I could not stand the acting, the bad acting, or the bad film making.   A lot of these actors in bad movies make the bad movies great. But this movie is not even close to being good, it was terrible!   The movie is just over-the-top, ridiculous, and stupid. If you're looking for a good comedy/drama comedy, then look elsewhere.

I would like to say that it is a remake of "My Man Godfrey", but that was never a good movie and this is a worse one!    Review by: joseph in ny on May 28, 2013.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part of this movie is a brief shot of the man's "fist" through a tree with no real connection to his other "fists". It's only when the camera cuts back and forth to the different "fisting" of a couple in a car that we see the significance. It's actually a couple going through the motions of a "fucking" movie in the same frame with no plot at all - just two people doing a couple of poses. There was some other scenes in the movie as well that were just as lame and it could've been a better film had they not been there.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie with a good ending.   So it was a story about a family, an older woman and an older man. The woman was a good woman, and did not let the circumstances of her life get to her. They had many happy days in the country, playing their favorite music, talking about nothing. A few years later a terrible accident occurred. The man died on a plane and the woman lost her husband. She became very depressed and was ailing for a long time. The years passed and she became older and more sick. One day she felt her life slipping away and she decided to do something about it. She decided to travel to the land of her parents in order to say goodbye. On her way she met a little boy who gave her a kiss.  It became quite clear to me that this is a film about the life of a mother. It is a beautiful, sad, and sadistic story of a woman who, as a child, was very intelligent and happy. However, as she grows older, she becomes sad and bitter. She gets sick all the time, and is now very sick and dying. On this journey she meets many people, some of whom seem to be a kind and wonderful people. All these people appear to have a good life. This is all quite natural; it is the world we live in. One has to accept this and live the life we have. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For me, it is always bad to go to a movie theater.  As soon as I arrived I saw that this was not a movie about a car.  No, the movie was a movie from a car about cars.  It didn't take me long to get used to the fact that the lead characters were played by people named Michael Douglas and Bill Murray.  And the movie itself didn't seem like a bad one.  I didn't know what was going on or why or what I was supposed to think.  That's because it seemed like a cheap movie.  There were no special effects, no songs, no acting or characters, and I couldn't even decide whether I was watching a bad car movie or a bad comedy.  In fact, it seemed that it was going to be a bad funny car movie for a lot of people, so that made it a little better.  This is a movie I will definitely never forget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is a scene in this movie that would be funny if it were not painful. It's when a young man with no family or friends tries to make his way to the circus.   He walks with a rope around his neck and is told to take a left into a door marked "Exit," but he can't make his foot out of the doorway without sliding down the wall. He pulls himself up but his momentum is lost when he slips on a piece of iron.  His body is caught by a large man who then starts to punch and kick him.  The crowd of people are amused at the circus show and begin to cheer for the man. But when he is rescued he is found in a ditch not far from the door and without his clothes or the rope.  He had been shot once in the head and he doesn't have his glasses nor his hat.  Even more ironic than this scene, the man is found dead with his glasses on the floor.  (This scene is taken from a movie called "The Circus." The story goes that the guy, who was shot in the face, tried to make a escape by running into the circus but he was caught by the crowd of onlookers. One day a clown who was also a circus performer is walking through the street when he sees the wounded man. At first he thinks the man has died but when the man doesn't move after a while, the clown is able to track down his shoes and other clothes on a nearby street corner. But before he can get the man back to the ring, a passing driver turns into the road to see if he can help. However, the circus man was shot once again in the neck and he was never seen again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, I guess this is the end of the line.  The plot was a lot more interesting than I originally thought.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love all kinds of movies, but I've always been amazed at how the majority of movies are about something that is at all pointless and lame.   That being said, " The Bad and the Ugly " is a pretty great movie, and is probably my favorite of Sergio Leone's great movies.  For those who don't know, Leone is the son of a butcher and started making movies in the 1930s.  When he began making films, he decided that all the "action" should be in Italian, and all the music should be Italian, which was something he was against.  He made a series of very good movies that mostly dealt with the Mafia and American gangster types.  In 1931, he made " The Good, the Bad, and the Drug Addict." This was the first film of his that was good and the first one that dealt with characters who acted like human beings and weren't robots.  If you are a fan of Leone's work, you will enjoy this.  There are also two other Leone films, " A Fistful of Dollars ", and " The Outlaw Josey Wales ".  "The Bad and The Ugly" (1964) is probably the best of the five Leone movies, and a fine movie.  I don't want to ruin the fun for anyone who doesn't like Leone's movies by telling you to skip "The Good, The Bad, The Drug Addicted" and "The Outlaw".  I would recommend anyone who is a fan to watch these three films to get a better feel for the kind of films that he makes.  It would be wise to watch at least "A Fistful Of Dollars" to see how Leone's direction was like.  Other than that, I don 't think that you need to watch them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie on a TV show in the early 80s called "The Mystery Movie Show" in which host Ed Stine did a great job of interviewing some great mystery movie stars.  This movie has been described as "The Hunchback of Notre Dame meets Frankenstein"  One of the stars of the film was none other than the legendary horror star Lon Chaney, Sr.  His appearance here is well worth the price of admission.  The rest of the cast included a great variety of actors.  Chaney did a nice job of playing himself and he certainly knows how to make a frightful impression.  It's an interesting and thought-provoking film that will make you think a lot about things.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys suspenseful horror films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What you do not see is a very intelligent director. I was never sure who would be in charge of a film. The guy who directs is actually a well-known actor, so he knew what he was doing. He didn't waste a lot of screen time on nonsense like a bad soap opera. This is something that you can't find in movies anymore. It is about a man who has had a life-changing experience. So he is happy that he has a lot to tell about himself and the experience he had. As for the girls, the only thing I can say is that it is one of the best films I have seen this year. I will watch it again in a few days to check if I would like more. It's very funny, very exciting and has an end that leaves you satisfied.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The last twenty minutes of this movie are so long and convoluted, I actually lost interest. It is a movie about a man whose brain is literally inside his head. I was in this movie and I didn't care about it. I am a movie goer and I do enjoy movies but the people in this are so uninspiring that I am not even going to bother.  I watched this movie in the theaters at the Alamo Drafthouse. The theater was packed and so many people came to the show. It was nice to see a movie that was actually entertaining and not about some kind of science fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I went to see it about a month ago. It looks like something from a science fiction movie made with a few cheap sets and actors. A lone space ship orbiting the moon is attacked by a huge UFO with a bunch of weird alien creatures on board. A little kid is captured and a strange girl named Sarah comes to his rescue. You have no idea what these alien beings are really capable of. The scene where the alien children are going up the hill to find a girl is really scary. It is almost like an animated movie from the '80s. I would like to see a "Space Kids" or a "Robo Show" or "Robotnik's Robot" or anything that would resemble these shows. I hope the makers of this film are able to make this movie a hit.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a cheap movie about a couple who go to a "special school" for troubled kids. The bad part is that it is set in the 80's and there are several bad actors. There is nothing funny about this movie and not funny at all. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you like the 80s feel-good comedy then this is the movie for you!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read the screenplay and was not impressed: it is written in the fashion of a typical horror movie, with an old man who has been shot, an old woman and a little girl, who looks like a miniature ghost. In one scene, the little girl gets killed and falls into the ravine where a man is watching her: so he kills the little ghost, which looks like something straight out of a horror movie. This movie is full of little surprises. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What I loved about this movie, was the sense of realism, the fact that it was based on real events, the way it portrayed the horror and violence in Africa, the realistic portrayal of the "bush" and the people "in" it, the respect that the director gave to the locals, and the fact the movie had all the elements that made a great horror movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In retrospect, it's really sad to hear that it was one of the worst movies ever made. The acting is awful in every single scene, the dialogue is awful, the plot is horrible, the characters are horrible, everything about it. The plot device is so bad and illogical that I can't get the thought process right with myself, I can only assume the movie was trying to make a little money by doing a movie called "A Woman and a Dog".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When we left the island a year ago, we were hoping the movie wouldn't be all sad.   We thought it would be different:  It would be more optimistic, more realistic, more fun.  But it is just not.  I hope that when we return, it will be more positive.  There's something about this movie that is sad:  Like many movies that have been made since, the story seems to be written by somebody with little experience in movies and even less imagination.  This movie tries to make us feel something.  It is sad, but not in the way that a happy movie should be.  Perhaps it is because I don't feel the same way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the only good thing about this movie is that the characters actually talk and act like human beings.  But I think the writing for these characters is bad.   There were a few good lines, but the movie has a very negative tone to it.    I think a lot of the movie is just "this is bad, that is bad".    And the acting is bad too.  The bad dialogue makes it very bad. The bad music makes it bad. I think there are a lot more bad movies to be made in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story of the movie is not very interesting, because it is all a lot of "gags" and "gimmicks" from our protagonist. It is funny, but it is not a good comedy. It does not have great acting, either, because I don't believe that anyone will be able to get the jokes that are made in this movie. It makes me think that we are watching a bunch of teenagers, playing at being adults. I do not get the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie about a terrible group of people. This is one of those movies that will not leave you with much emotion, the entire cast is one-dimensional and it does not work. The movie is about a group of friends (all of them bad), they drink, dance and get drunk. Then one night they go to an underground club where the DJ plays the best music. Well, there are a few more bad people in this movie then the main character. It is also a bad film about a gay, ugly, fat, ugly fat, fat people. They are in love, they are good, they have good friends and a good DJ. And then they get into a car accident, because they were not good. No one can be nice or good to each other or be nice to the world, no one can. This movie is not good, it is a joke, it does have one good scene when a guy dies and the other guy is so good at pretending he is dead that the whole place seems like a joke. I only wish they had made one good film out of this one. I give this a D+ (It is a D, what more do you need to know?).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad, bad movie. It is a pretty horrible movie and most people should avoid it at all costs. I've seen it and it's an absolute rip off of The Last Man on Earth! I had no clue who this character was. I thought it was just a guy in a suit. I was so disappointed when the character he played came on screen and tried to kill the main character! I didn't like it at first, but I'm glad I saw it. The people behind this movie are bad and I hope they get the message across so they don't waste our time again.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Hjr831 from Fun for a funny movie I didn 't care for the movie because the movie was very bad... The only good thing about it is that it is not a live action movie, so I can get a good laugh when I'm watching. If you like bad movies, you can enjoy this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful. It is so bad, that it makes one want to punch the screen. Seriously, the acting is horrible. It's the same type of acting that has been going on in comedies since, well, the dawn of time. There is a character named Jack and he has the character of the movie. He is just there as someone to throw off your suspicions, who is kind of annoying. He has nothing to contribute other than his bad acting. The supporting characters are also the same. We have Jack. We also have a wife. She is also just there to make everyone look like idiots. And then there's the police! The police! They have nothing to do with anything! They are useless in every way possible! I had to see the movie just to see how they were going to get out of all of this. There were no guns or anything! It was just them walking all over town, getting beaten up, or arrested. There was absolutely nothing they did to help anyone! This movie does not even make a good "cop movie!" It makes an awful "cop comedy!" This movie made me want to throw up.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the summer of 1987, my younger brother and I were living in an apartment we found in a derelict building at the intersection of a few roads. It's been there since before our apartment complex was built. Now it's completely razed to the ground and the parking lot is a long, empty lot.    I found a parking lot on my way home from my dad's house. I always thought that it was a good idea to get the car out of the driveway because if it were standing there all day, I would be scared to go out there at night. We decided we'd go on a trip to Washington DC that night, my brother in his car. As I got out of my car, I looked across the street and saw this building and thought that maybe it'd be a good place to park.   As I walked across the parking ramp, I saw what was in front of me: a beautiful brick building with a beautiful flower arrangement on the front yard. As we approached the porch, I got a good look at it from the parking area and I must say, the beauty in the view and the flower arrangement made my day. As soon as I stepped inside I was in heaven, I took my brother into the apartment and he loved it. As you can imagine, the two of them didn't live in a very big place.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the trailer and was just going to say "I can't wait to be bored." But it took a while to get there.   First of all, the trailer is full of obvious jokes: the main character (David), a self-appointed "sheriff" (which he doesn't really have any legal authority, just a fake title) makes a deal with a bad guy (Randy), a bad person who has just been put behind bars for trying to escape from a mental institution. The deal: Randy will get released from the institution if he will help David solve a murder he doesn�t know about. This is where the movie gets really interesting. I'd say this is a good time-killer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad I actually stopped watching it. I saw a trailer a week before the movie and thought I was at least going to see a bad "B" movie. The trailer was awful, I was about to give up when the opening shot was of a car crashing into the side of a house and someone screaming about being shot. The first thing I noticed about the movie was it made me think of "The Omen", another bad movie with bad actors. I had the same feeling about this "B". The whole movie consisted of people running around while doing absolutely nothing. A woman with no boobs runs like a man but no one reacts to her. A character who never seems to do anything but stare at his computer. The woman's breasts were all wrong, her body was just... there. The man on the screen with no voice (and very little in the way of personality) made a terrible performance. I know I'm probably just a bad person but this movie made me hate my own sexuality and all of its quirks and quirks.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is not very good, and is really more "just your average story about a guy going off to a fancy restaurant.  It takes some effort to keep going with it...and the ending is not especially interesting."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really wanted to like this movie.  It has an epic feel to it.  There is such a great atmosphere throughout the film that you don't feel you're watching anything special.  The story is rather cliché and predictable.   The characters are very thin (especially the female lead).    There's nothing interesting about the story.  I could care less about the characters or what happens in the movie. I only laughed during the credits.  It does the little bits right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad movies in every way. There's not a lot of special effects (and none that are really used well), the acting is atrocious (at least it is supposed to be). What really bothers me though, and makes this the worst movie I've ever seen, is that the film is made to be viewed via a cheap VHS camera. They were making it look like it was filmed with film cameras...and that's the worst thing you can do. The only good thing about this one is that it has a creepy story at the beginning.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an incredibly bad movie.   I won't spend too much time on it.  The worst aspect about it is the poor acting, both by the main actor and the supporting actors.  I don't even want to give the plot away.  So what's going to happen?  Well, there's a woman who is obsessed with going to heaven.  Her two friends are both looking for her and also trying to get there in this life.  Well you get the idea.  And what are the three main characters?  The one trying to go to heaven is a poor, lazy, and hopeless alcoholic.  He's so miserable, he's willing to do anything to get out of this miserable life.   The friend who's looking for heaven is very clever and has her own supernatural abilities.  She's not a good actress, but she does her job.  The third character is the drunk who thinks he's being funny.  In this film, it's the last line which really makes you cringe.  It's an unbelievably stupid movie.   It was a terrible idea to make the movie. I can't believe anyone actually liked it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This isn't exactly a horror movie, but it does have some scare factor and is a fun watch with some good character development and a killer. There are some cheap shots but it's nothing bad. It's one of those horror movies that will keep you interested and have you running around the house for hours.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a big fat waste of time and money. There's too much time spent on useless talking, not enough time spent doing anything else than watching one man attempt to be a famous movie star.  There's also a lot of stuff thrown in (including some old gags), that it doesn't seem to be necessary for the film to last that long, if any at all.  The characters are flat and forgettable.  A film that's not worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  1.)  The movie is not bad in the least. 2.)    I didn't see this on the big screen! No, it's a DVD that we rented at a flea market. 3.)      I didn't like this movie at all! It reminded me of that TV movie that they show on TV in the states.  2.)  To me, the acting was bad.   3.)    I guess the film's main selling point was that the lead star was the same actor in another cult movie (The Rocketeer).  4.)  I can't remember if there was one scene in the whole movie that made me smile, and I'm not exaggerating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When you look at this movie, it's obvious that there was more than a bit of talent involved behind the camera in that production. A young guy in a red shirt who talks like a young Jack Nicholson is actually funny, and the director was a good student of his craft. Unfortunately, I am so used to seeing my favourite actors from the 80s and 90s that I am quite unimpressed at how they all look in this movie. The actors' costumes are good, though, and I found the script to be somewhat interesting, though I am not sure it really belongs in a movie of this genre. There are also a few other characters who do not belong in a comedy movie: a woman wearing an old-school white dress who says things like "I hope I die when this thing blows" and a bald, old-fashioned man who calls the ship "My ship." In fact, the film doesn't have much plot, so what really sticks out to me is the "Old Timey" aspect of the production. If you're a fan of these kinds of movies, then I don't think you'll find much in this one to not like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's a famous anecdote about an American general who was asked to go to Germany to oversee an advance against an enemy which never existed. The Germans were so frightened at the prospect of him being killed by American troops that the entire nation was put in a panic and took up arms as to not let him get near.   And then there's  The Day The Earth Stood Still.  This is a film that doesn't really have a purpose. It's just a series of stills and sounds. It doesn't have the punchy music of some other B-films like King Kong and The Man Who Fell to Earth.  The film tries to recreate its atmosphere but the movie can't quite pull it off.  For a B-film it just doesn't deliver, its too static,  and the acting is pretty pathetic.  It's a sad way to go out for a B film.  I don't know how anyone could go out like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a good movie, but a pretty terrible movie: it would have been even more terrible if it had been cut to only one hour.  That was so bad that the director must have thought of something else to do with the film, so he cut out almost two hours and replaced it with a lot of filler.    This movie is not a bad film at all.  It could have been a decent movie, or a mediocre movie, whatever; it would never have been terrible.  Instead of dealing with the human dilemma of the man who wants the family's farm, instead of dealing in real problems, the movie is filled up with more filler, more scenes set up, and more people who think they know what's going on.  For instance, the whole idea for the movie comes from a man who has a dream, in which he gets the family to move out of town, then he becomes a millionaire when the world is flat.  After that dream comes true, he becomes depressed.  He doesn't even tell his wife, who he tells only his son, who doesn't talk to anyone.  So then his daughter tells his son about it.  This leads to a conversation about what his life would be like if he had a wife and three kids.  Then this son then gets into problems with a drunk guy at the party, and then he goes out of his mind.  They then drive off to another town and get involved in another plot involving the man and a trucker.  I suppose it is a good story.  But, it is not what it is going to be.    There are only two stories at the end of the movie: one in which the main character gets a good-looking woman and moves out of the city and another in which his son has some good luck and ends up moving into a house that only his father can afford.  These are great stories, but what is really disappointing is that we have only one and one-half of them.  There is not one good story in the whole movie.  If they had cut out about two-thirds of the story the film would have at least been a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad, bad movie. That's a harsh judgement. It's a bad action movie that tries too hard to be a little camp. I think it's not trying to be camp, it's trying to do action. It does not succeed, and it certainly does not get the message across. It is a waste of time. It will not have long staying power.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those "if you are a fan of the original then you will like this" movies. It is a simple plot, not all that original and I am not sure how many other people would enjoy it as much as I did. The animation is simple and the characters and background are great. If you are looking for a good popcorn flick then this is a good movie.

I don't know what it was about this movie. It looked like it could have been a lot worse. A girl who seems to be in love with a bad guy (who sounds like the main character from The Stepford Wives) comes off as an idiot. Her "mother" isn't much better. Her boyfriend is an awful, incompetent actor. And the movie never seems to end.   A movie with a bunch of morons? Not even close. And I think I could give a better rating to a movie like a bad version of Gremlins. This is an absolute waste of my time.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is one of those boring, unoriginal, pretentious movies that make you wish to go to the theater on a Sunday afternoon.   It has almost no redeeming features.  This is one lousy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not funny, it is stupid, and it is not even well acted. I was hoping for some great moments in this one, but they are missing: 1) This movie should be rated a little less than a C-. It just got a C for stupidity and a B for acting. What else can you ask for? It is just a bad, bad movie. I will never watch this again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a horrible movie which is almost a parody of a bad story.   Its the story of a poor Indian who loses his job because he stole a bus and ends up in a world where everyone is rich and powerful. He meets a little girl named Lizzie who asks him to help her get her picture taken but he becomes a good person and gets her pictures.  The worst part is that the only thing the story has going for it is its bad writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love this movie.   The movie plays like it really has been made for TV.  I loved the music.  It really had that film noir vibe going on.  At one point when the police man and the girl are discussing what to do she says, "You know, I thought I'd see the desert once I was gone"    This really does feel like a TV movie to me.  The only problem with this movie is that it has no plot and it feels really rushed.  However, it really is a classic and a real joy to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This isn't bad. I am not an expert but it's not bad.   The movie has a couple of "epic moments".   For instance, when one of the heroes sees a big old wolf, he has to flee.  And when the wolves are chasing the heroes, it takes almost all three of them to drive them off.  This is definitely a "must see movie" that you need to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know it might sound like I am bashing this film, but I truly enjoy the film. I would not consider this the greatest of all time, but it is a solid film nonetheless. I think most of this film would not be out of place in a cult classic.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want a good time, then watch this. The plot is nothing special, it involves two people that are on a road trip to make some "happily ever after" between two lovers. The road trip goes bad as they are kidnapped by a bunch of crazed "lame boys" who think they have "hot" wives. The crazed lames force the two lovers to go on another road trip, this time into a haunted mansion. There, the "boys" reveal that the lames had an older girlfriend that died when she was an infant, but she was never buried and is now in a mysterious mansion. I didn't buy it, the only "happiness" was a bunch or crazed clowns in the house. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is bad. Bad as in bad as in that movie with the poor man that was supposed to be an "old" movie. This movie has been made for money. In any other case it would be embarrassing to show a film in which an old man who looks like he'd be around to see a "new" movie has no more to show for his age than a small dog that is more than two years old. What a joke!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For a while there I was a big fan of the film and I watched it quite a few times over the years as I enjoyed it quite well. I actually gave it three stars which was an improvement.    There is a lot of blood and gore in this movie, and it really looks rather graphic for something that is only about 70 minutes long.  This is probably the film that the producers of the movie had in mind when they created the plot, as it makes quite a contrast to the normal film that is normally shown on TV.  It was a very good movie with a good story that wasn't really bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After watching this movie I couldn't stop watching it! So, as far as the movie is concerned, it's a story about a woman who's daughter was kidnapped and sold as a prostitute. It would seem odd that she would have a girl prostitute of this description, but then, I guess this type of person is a dime a dozen in this day and age. The mother doesn't take it well of course, even though the daughter didn't do anything to deserve what happened to her, but she isn't willing to just sit back and let things take their course. She's got some very serious stuff going on, and her daughter will be a part of it. It's a pretty good movie, though not a bad one, although I thought it was just too short. It takes a while to get going, but in the end you'll see all the elements of a good melodramatic movie, but it doesn't really go the extra mile. I really have to say that I enjoyed this movie a lot. If you liked the film "Love Streams" or "A Tale About Love" you'll love this one, and it might even hold you over for a little while until "Love streams" arrives in theaters. I'm not sure when, but I'm guessing it'll be sometime next month. The first few parts of "Goddess" seem to be set up to show some of the elements that are to come in the movie, including what will become of the daughter. I was really surprised, because they didn't just go for a run-of-the-mill melodrama here, they seemed to have more imagination. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Hannibal Lecter" movies are so over the top that they take you from a mild horror film to the most ridiculous. I really wish they would be more restrained with the acting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are two good things in this movie: (1) I think I've seen every film directed by the talented Albert Pyun. The only difference in this one and all the other ones I've ever seen is that this one is a much better movie. The setting is actually a real one (as in in real life), and that's very refreshing. In fact, in some respects this one has a few better moments than any of the other films I've mentioned, and there's quite a few of them. I'm not even going to mention the wonderful music. It was definitely something I'd never seen before. The story line, of course, is also good. It's interesting, and I'm impressed with how he tries to give the characters different lives. There's one who lives in an art gallery; the most famous artist of the country. There is a woman who is married to a wealthy banker who also has a high public profile. There are a bunch of other characters; but the fact that they were all well written in a fun way just makes it all the better.  It's a good movie for the whole family.  - January 6, 2005A very funny and entertaining movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, this movie is not just boring, it is painful.   The entire movie feels as if it is being made up for its budget by the director and his writer.  This movie is as if he is watching a bad television show, not realising how it went terribly wrong.  If this movie was to be made today, the director should not be allowed to come back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie about a guy with bad intentions who accidentally kills his daughter. That's a pretty good idea, but the acting sucks. At one point in this movie, we get a few choice lines: "Do you think your daddy would just let you die, then? I'll tell you something. You think this is an accident? You don't get to be my daddy. If I'm going to be your daddy I'm gonna kill you first and then I'm coming for you, my daughter. You hear me daddy? You hear?"  (You heard it now, too.  ) The girl's death is very abrupt, almost as abrupt as the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I heard from an internet movie friend that I should really check this one out. Unfortunately, I don't care about this one. I don' like how the characters are portrayed. In the first half, there are lots of funny little jokes in the film. But then, the characters start becoming more and more boring and silly. I felt that there wasn't much tension in the movie, as it just seems to be making a point that it is ok to put on a funny film and say a few funny lines. And then, there is no actual movie going on at all, with the action happening in a different part of the movie. The whole reason I was interested in the idea of watching this was because it was one of the few non-horror movies I have seen in a while. Well, it didn't work for me and it's a real pity.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have the worst memory as well. I mean I can remember what is going on and what is NOT going on... so it was all very confusing. I'm not going to say that this movie is great because it is not. It is simply one of those things that you see and you don't get a clue why the producers thought it was a good idea to take a guy from Texas and turn him into a star. I guess it is kind of sad because I never would have imagined someone could turn a guy who is always getting drunk and trying to take advantage of innocent people into a superstar. He just seems kind of stupid and I mean come on he is a moron for thinking this is a good way to go about his life. I was going to give this a low rating of 4 stars but then they did get the one star "for originality" from one of the critics!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this film, in between various other films, a month or so ago and it was definitely a decent flick, although I would have preferred a bit more suspense.    Plot:     Well the story is quite straightforward, the titular character is hired by a man who wants him to kill a large man and his wife (which seems to be the common theme of the film).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a big disappointment! I knew from the start that I couldn't stand this movie, I mean the plot is bad! And the acting is too bad! My mom is a teacher and she said the teacher got an award for being the best teacher ever. Well, that teacher is supposed to be the good one and she really isn't a good person. She doesn't seem nice to any one and everyone says that she is a mean, mean person! Then she gets fired by the school when the students think she is mean and rude, when all of this happened, all the kids from the other schools in town were supposed to pick a teacher to replace her. Then the principal, who is supposed be the bad one in the movie got the award too! She gets a new job in the school and everyone is so happy, except the principal! So why does everyone keep telling her about all of the things that are wrong in the world? Well, she thinks she's doing all of those things and everyone else agrees with her! Even the president of the school is happy because he was supposed to get his award too. The kids are all happy and everyone thinks the teacher is a good teacher and everyone knows how to make everyone happy! I really do not understand this movie. You get a little girl who is so young that she can't even talk about how she is unhappy and sad, she is so unhappy that she says that the kids are bad.  I am not a big fan of this movie either. I think it is just a big mess and nothing of real worth was created. It is just kind of a horrible movie and that is the most important thing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't understand why this movie is called The Naked Gun. It is not a nameless hero shooting at bad guys. It's a "good guy". We never see him wearing a costume. He's wearing a tie and is not really looking that good. But I guess that is the only bad thing about this movie. The music is great. I haven't heard that music in a long time. I remember it when I was a teenager. It isn't like it's been forgotten. I love the dancing, the dancing is great and is in almost every scene. I also thought that the movie was a lot better and better as time went on. I have to admit that this movie was fun!

A very clever movie, one that is a must see.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a die hard Harry Potter fan and I was really looking forward to this movie, I had never seen the original series though, the movies were so good. So I thought I would check out this new ones.  I have seen one episode so far, The Goblet of Fire.  It is a decent movie, if your thinking about it like me, this movie is a little slow and they should cut this crap out or they would not be running it on TV, they have had some great episodes too like Goblet and Order of the Phoenix and also the two last Goblet episodes and even the 3rd movie.  This movie is really good, especially the part where Ron kills a Werewolf, I liked it.  Now they are on to the next movie, it is called Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad.   A movie that tries to do so much too soon.  The only thing I can say that the actors do the best they can given the circumstances.  I would be interested in seeing what the scriptwriter has to say for himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The whole first act is a joke.   A film that is supposed to have the same effect on you and then fails to do so, is not really a very good film at all, but it's so good that you keep going with it.  The story itself is just a bunch of kids doing their best to get home from school in time for supper.  It is obvious that the production crew were in no way motivated to create a good story, it just sort of came together, it is really pretty bad and the fact that we're supposed to identify with the kids and find them likable and sympathetic is ridiculous.  There is also a huge amount of violence (no, not blood) and nudity (no not just a lot, a whole lot) in the film.  Despite the fact this movie is not funny or appealing, I think it works better than most B movie movies, but you know what I mean!  It's a shame that this film was made in a time when Hollywood was struggling.  And that's about all there is to say about it, other than to mention that this movie could have been a good movie, but no one made a film about kids playing dress up and running around in a forest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is what happens when you let a little boy in a candy store. As a kid he used to play tricks on his sister to get her to come out to the store so that he could take her in to buy something for a birthday present. In one game he took a little red nose with a "D-O-Double-G" on it that he thought was a "slim nose" and then he used it to open a door so that his sister was no longer able to go in to get the prize that he wanted.   It turns out that the "slam-dunk" is really a "duck-doo" or a "peanut" because the little boy was a total freak-out. He didn't want to let his sister go in so he ran around her, trying to get rid of her as fast as he could. The trick was working when the little girl gave a little shriek that made the store owner look over and see a little girl with no nose and a "C-O" on her forehead, screaming for help. The little boy got so excited that he let his brother come in so that the little lady and the store man could take the girl in to have an examination.   of course the doctor didn't believe what was going on so the little guy showed his "revelations" to the doctor in which he showed him a picture of his "sister" wearing a "hockey mask" with little "D"s on them and said that he couldn't come in to help her with her bad case. Of course the young doctor was so amazed at what he was hearing that he asked the little man if he had a "dummy" or "satellite" that he was going to use. Not satisfied, he showed the doctor pictures of his sister wearing a hockey mask. He said that if the doctor took the time he would show him what a real hockey mask looked like. Well, sure enough a picture was shown of the little doctor's sister wearing the "dodgy" hockey mask and the little Doctor was so excited about what he saw he called up the company that made hockey masks and sent them to the candy store to get a real one. The next day the store guy came in and took the hockey mask that he had brought and put it on a little guy that was standing there. The hockey mask worked and the poor little guy disappeared back into the store.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a poorly made movie that can never be considered good. I can't believe the producers paid as much money for it as they did, yet it comes across as a big waste of money, so poorly done that I feel bad even showing you these poor images. It's pretty bad, with a story that's so cliche it doesn't make sense. Also, the acting is horrible. And that's not even the worst part.  I hope this doesn't cause a new trend of making mediocre "epic" movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main character is like a typical geeky guy. He wants to be a good role model to his friends and the world. Well, he does one thing wrong and it's more than a one-off. Then he tries to redeem himself by being a good friend to the female character. But then she turns out to be the bad guy! And when this happens, the whole movie can be boiled down to, "I don't want to be evil." And what a great, evil, evil way to be!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would definitely rate this movie on a one-star scale, which is to say it's probably one of the worst movies ever made.   The plot of the movie is quite simple:  Once upon a time, there was a magical kingdom (and some magic) called the Land of Oz.  The most amazing thing about Oz (and one of my favourite things in the whole world) is the fact that it is an actual place and not a magic show.  And not only that, but the land is actually pretty much just a normal place with buildings.  Now, the most amazing and amazing part of Oz is the giant (I don't mean big) trees:  Awwwww! These trees (or as they're called in the movie, "Trees of Emerald Power"  ) are the magical source of all the magic, and for the purpose of making the world look like an enchanted forest, the "Tailors" are constantly moving their leaves from one spot to the other all day, in the hope that one will grow large enough and strong enough to carry the weight of the other trees: Awwww! These big trees!  And why are they called the "Tree of Emerald" Power?  Because that is precisely what they are: Emerald trees.  But let me tell you something about these trees, because I don't want to bore you with all the details, but I promise that you will learn something about trees:  The Emerald trees (which were the size of skyscrapers and even grew to the sky) are actually the main source of the magical energy which gives all sorts of abilities to Dorothy (the main character).  All those awesome skills and abilities are all due to the fact those trees are filled with Emeralds (of course).  But how big are those Emerald trees?  The real answer is that they are much bigger than you and me, and that they're really big enough to make a tree with a diameter of 20-30 meters look like a child's toy:  Now that's an interesting question to ask:  Why is a tree-like tree so tall?  Well, actually, the Emeralds grow from the base to the top, so the tree-shaped structure is in fact a miniature Emerald tree, growing to a height of about 15 meters, with an average diameter of around 20 meters (that is why the trees are called "tree-trees").  However, the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only bad part about this movie is that it's about a bunch of old, white, boring guys, who just sit and talk about how much they don't care about their wives and children. It's actually so lame that there are not many laughs in this movie. The good part about it is that the lead character is just like the average, boring, white guy. There's nothing interesting about him; he's a pretty old guy who was born about forty years before I was born.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years.   So the story is about a scientist who is given a very rare drug by his colleague. He then begins a long trip around the country where he becomes an alcoholic.  But this is not the worst part.  The scientist has a daughter named Sarah who he loves very much.  And then one day the father takes Sarah on a trip around Florida and the father is shot to death.  Then this scientist takes his daughter on a second trip to Florida to try to get her revenge.  So this scientist is the worst kind of father and this movie is about how the father, being a father, avenges his son's death in the most horrible way possible.  I do not recommend this film.  A good friend of mine just pointed out something very strange:  You can hear a lot of grunting/gurgling going on in the movie, which might explain why it's so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is so bad it's like a bad Disney movie.

And then there's that woman sitting near you, it's obvious she's a stalker. You know, that's where I'd like to send you now".  This movie is so far out there it's a wonder it got a green light.   There's a huge amount of swearing and sex that will put you off the stuff to see it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film over 10 years ago. Back when it was made, I was like everyone else, completely dumbstruck. I can still hear the director explaining it's an origin story for the Superman mythos, with all the typical Superman-in-New-York nonsense. The main characters are all played by Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. And, yes, Superman does appear. The plot? Well, it's all about a scientist who builds a machine that can shrink anything down to the size of a penny. The idea is that the machine would help people. It seems to work a little bit...except that the scientist, Dr. Max Rockatansky, has no idea what to do with his new invention. And so, he is stuck with the machine and all his employees...a bunch of fat, old women. All the bad guys are played by Willis and Jackson...and they are so bad that I can't understand why he had them in the movie at all. One of the most bizarre, over-the-top, silly and unoriginal characters ever made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would like to see The Devil's Advocate in all its glory, but in order to have a good time, I'll have to give it a pass for not actually saying anything. The movie tries to tell a very clever, subtle, and amusing story, but it never really gets around to telling it, because it's just too dumb to be fun. The idea behind the film is that an extremely clever man, who is a good Christian, will find the answer to the question that everyone wants to know - "Is Jesus real?" This isn't a simple question, it's a difficult one. It is, however, a question that even the Devil (as portrayed by an actor who is quite good and not too awful) would not be able to answer with his best poker face. The Devil is a very smart and clever man who is also very charming. He is also the Devil, so it shouldn't be too surprising that he knows how to play this kind of game. He knows that the real question everyone is asking is not, "Is he real?" but "Where did he come from?" and he figures out that if he could get his hands on an accurate copy of Jesus' life, he would be able answer that question quite easily. So it is that a couple of years back, a copy of the life of Jesus is found and the Devil pays a visit to the library where it is kept, hoping to find a copy that he can get his grubby hands on and take to the next level. Unfortunately, he finds a copy, but only a very poor one - a copy the Devil didn't actually pay the price of which is around 10 times the price that it should be. The real copy of which (which can be found on a website that has been in the same family for a few generations) is priced at more than a million dollars. So the Devil doesn't find a life of an incredibly clever and cunning man - he doesn't even find a poor one. Now to the rest of the movie. Well, the film isn't actually that bad - it does its best to be clever and funny, and this is actually quite enjoyable. There is a part that has to be seen to be believed. The scene is set in a bar. There has been an accident, which is obviously a disaster. One of the patrons, a young woman, has had an accident and she has run out into the streets in a drunken state, where she is immediately run
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I guess that movie got cancelled because nobody wants to see it. I will say this: this movie is made by people who have seen a ton of movies made for Hollywood. They make movies about people doing all kinds of things like walking down the street, eating burgers, riding a bicycle. The movie is pretty basic. If you can keep your head and your pants up through the whole thing, then you really don't have too much to complain about. The guy who plays the guy in the red suit is a guy named Joe Spillman. That means that his name is spelled "Spillman" a lot in this movie. So you know, he has a bad case of the jitters. But there are some fun action scenes in this one. You know, like that scene when the guy with the red jacket jumps into the guy on the ground... and the guy jumps into another guy's head. It all ends with the big bad boss of the organization (who is wearing a big black suit and a white shirt and is like a big gorilla). The guy has a bunch of guys lined up behind him. The boss gets in the first truck and is going to drive off. But then he stops and the boss looks to the sky and starts to sing. And then a giant monster comes out of the ground (which is what the guy at the end was talking about). The boss is like, "I guess they don't know me any more." Then a bunch more monster guys come out of this guy's body and the bosses starts running over them all. There is a lot of laughter in this film, and it's all very well done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't find this movie particularly enjoyable. It was a pretty typical film and I guess if I had to recommend a bad bad movie to people, I'd say this one would fall somewhere in the middle. I'm still a little bitter about the fact that I wasn't able to see it at the theater when it first came out and even though I haven't seen it since, I still get a little sick just thinking about it. The best thing about it though is its star: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie ever made. The last 20 minutes have been the most boring in a series of boring movies.   I can't believe I actually spent $20 for this piece of crap.  I could have walked away with $10 and said thank you for ruining a good movie for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In case you have not heard, there's a bad film being made about the most infamous, and most hated woman in history. This film is about a movie theater in New Jersey and the death of a movie star, played by Barbara Stanwyck. The film has its own star in the form of a lady named Marge Schott. She is the one in black, and she seems to be a bit of an evil-type.  I have never seen a woman in black before and I like the way her hair hangs down from the side of her head and it is always falling.  I think she is wearing a very revealing white dress, but I don't think the movie is going to be very interesting as there isn't much to say about a woman who is just supposed to be there for some reason.  The actors in the movie seem to be trying very hard. I don' think anyone will be interested in this movie and it doesn't even have a poster.   I have seen an awful lot of films in my day and I can't remember any other movie where a woman was dressed like Barbara Stanwcyk. I do know that it is a bit strange but I really don't see a lot of movies where a movie is played in such a way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was made to cash in on the success of the "Back to the Future" films. The main bad guy is a little, white, bald, skinny, skinny guy wearing a white shirt who talks too much. He uses a walking stick and a gun. He's like a cross between the annoying but annoying Doc Brown and the annoying, but not that bad, Michael J Fox.   I'd love to think that this movie would be better if it had been written by B-horror director John Landis instead of John Land. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie   is set in a world where humans live on an island in the middle of a lake. The   lake   was once home to a beautiful   woman. She gave birth to a girl and a boy and raised them. She   didn't want to live on a island with a woman and her children. The only people allowed to come in was a man with a boat and a   girl who   used her powers to make people smile. She took on the name   Hedy and became the king of the island. The whole movie  feels like a Disney movie set on a remote island in a lake:  The music, the costumes, the   lighting, everything!   But, as always,   the  character development   felt rushed and flat. Hedy doesn't grow as a person. Hester doesn't learn anything. She stays the same person from beginning to end.   In other words,  there is no growth in the character of Hedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad I have to imagine it's going to be made a TV movie so they can air a re-run on one of those awful re-runs that make your eyes pop. The film opens with a shot of an old woman in an old hat sitting in a chair in a hospital room. We then cut to a young woman in a white dress who is lying unconscious on a hospital bed.  The next shot we have a little kid wearing a suit walking into a small town with a woman and a little boy with a large black stick in his hand.  This is the end of the film, and the credits go on for a while.  A sequel was in the works but wasn't ever produced. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like this movie, but I will give you some facts: 1: I'm glad there is a sequel, as the first was kind of bad. 2: There are some really strange scenes where the boys are going to school and having to run from the police. This is so bad, the police are called to a guy with a gun. This movie would be funnier if there wasn't a policeman in it. 3: There is a real scary part where one of the main characters is being held down by a boy and it is all too close to being real. The film was made in the '60s. 4: I don't like these kids at all. They are all so mean and immature. And then they act like they have an attitude about the police being in the school: it's like these children don't realize that it's all too real.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I haven't liked a movie in quite some time.   And I can't say I didn't have fun this time. It was a fun little movie, in spite of a few dull moments and a somewhat annoying lead.  It does have some good ideas at times though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a blatant ripoff of the "Reds" series, and not a very good one at that.  The plot is an exercise in the same sort of generic "good guy wants to do good" clichés as seen in the first movie.    The plot does not get that bad till after the first "Rings" film, and even then it's not good enough for being a remake or a direct ripoff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first minute of this movie reminds me of something that I have seen many times in horror movies. Some people are walking down a dark and creepy corridor. They see a man walking behind a door. The people in the movie then come out of the shadows and look at the door. It opens and an apparition of a woman wearing a black dress walks out into the light of the doorway. This happens once a minute or so and there is usually a good old ghost story about a woman who comes out of a closet or a room in an abandoned house. The movie starts with someone walking down the same corridor as the women. When they get to the end of the corridor, they turn and face the door again. The next person walks down the corridor. Then the woman comes out wearing the same black dress. She walks over to the people who just watched the ghost woman in the door with the same look on her face. There is another woman standing there. She looks at the person who just walked down the hallway. Then she walks over toward them and looks at their shoes. There are also footsteps from someone going the other way. There should be some blood, or something, but it is barely visible. Then all the people turn and look. They look at each other for a long time. At one point someone breaks into the corridor with a broken down chair. They walk over to an open window. This breaks as everyone walks over. They all look in at a house they think is abandoned but that is not the case. They get to this house, but there is no one there. They find an old woman standing at the window. She talks to the person outside, who turns around. The person in the corridor comes out and stares at the house. We then find out who the people were who had just watched this woman in a dress. They are going to call the police. This movie should have ended here. Instead the people come back out. They do not talk to each other any more. Then, at one point, the woman breaks down in tears. At the same time, the ghost that the ghost man was talking to is back. They have a good fight then everyone is back in the room again. Then someone throws a knife at the woman. She says she has been stabbed with it by a man, but at the end, she is back to being the ghostly woman. It is one of those movies I can only watch a few times.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this movie is crap. The movie opens with an interracial sex scene, followed by scenes of "tough black man" (Randy Savage) getting beaten by "tougher white man" Chuck Wepner. After the interracial thing, we cut to the next day, where Savage is at a basketball game, in the city of Memphis, TN. After some fun in the crowd, he is approached by a pretty blonde waitress named Judy. He starts talking to her, and she is very interested. She gives him her number, and, she hangs up. Then, he goes to a bar and a big black guy named Charlie (the one who had taken Judy) approaches him. He gives him a big, black cigar, to smoke. He tells Savage to stay out of trouble, and says it's been awhile since the last time Savage had been seen. The next morning, Savage shows up at a Memphis nightclub, and sees a pretty girl named Cindy (who may not have been, but may have been). He starts flirting with her, but then Charlie (who was sitting next to her) shows up. The two of them start talking, and Savage starts to flirt with Cindy too. A fight breaks out, and Charlie beats Savage. Then we cut back to Judy, who wants Savage back. She offers him her place to stay, and he accepts. So she goes to bed, but she sees the guy, Charlie, coming through the door. She goes into the room, and it seems like she gets what she wanted, until Charlie comes in there and beats her up too. Then Savage goes to jail, and goes back out after Charlie is released, who is looking for Savage's gang. Savage and Savage's gangs (The Black Gangster Disciples) take care of the black guy, and then they go home. Charlie takes Savage to the local strip club, and they start playing "Ride to Hell" and "I Wanna be Loved." It's pretty good, even though it's not that good. If it were, the movie wouldn't suck so bad. The rest of the movie sucks. I can't really describe much of it, but I will say that the movie should be called "Black Man Stoned and Stupid."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I guess it is bad that they do not make something good. I liked the movie, but I can't recommend it. It is an odd story about a priest's daughter who gets pregnant and is then forced to marry someone who she hates. I would not recommend it for people who like funny movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To tell the truth, I had no expectations for this film at all. I thought I would watch something that would not blow my mind. Instead, this movie did nothing for me other than to remind me of the great movies that came before it. It is nothing more than a remake of the same old movie. It's an old timey, cheesy movie about an old guy who lives alone in a trailer and who takes care of his elderly neighbor. He takes her to a movie, which is the same movie that came out 10 years ago and which has been remade a million times since. The film is really just silly. I guess that if your grandmother can't get a movie going at the local theater because she is in the hospital (or something), then what the hell is the point? This movie is a classic example of how the formula works. It does nothing to break the mold, it just continues that same lazy trend. I really wanted to like this movie.  I did, and I have to admit it. I could. It could have been so much more, but the director could not pull off anything more than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a pretty fun romp through the early days of the Star Wars universe.  There is much more to come with this, so expect more fun to be had in the future.  It is not a bad film though, but rather enjoyable.  As we know the prequel trilogy is coming to a close.  Now we have a glimpse into what happened to Alderaan.   The film opens with a quick look at Aldera, which looks a lot like its predecessor.  When we next see the planet it is in ruins.  The Rebel Alliance have arrived to save the day, but they have been defeated.  I was surprised to see how bad the Special Edition was.  Although much better in many ways, it was still pretty bad.  But it is still fun to watch a bad Star Wars film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are not a lot of action movies to be found. This one, however, has a great number of memorable sequences. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an interesting movie, but with a lot of problems. The lead actor, John Karr, is a decent person, except that he thinks he can act more than he actually can. The acting is a little uneven; some of the dialogue is fairly good but a few times the actor gets lost, and he doesn't always sound right. The story is interesting, but it is far from good. The climax, where the lead character is sent to prison, is pretty predictable. The film is based on a novel called   by John K. Samson, but the characters seem to be a mixture of actual people from Karr's life. So he has to act much like a fictional person and his wife doesn't even know what he looks like. The music is quite good; the song about the prostitute was particularly funny. A movie which is not bad at all; just has a lot to say and does so in a fairly good way, but not one for the whole family.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is pretty bad, but it is a film that we are going to watch because of how it starts. I had just finished watching a film where two people get married, and I knew it was going to be a very boring film.  But in the beginning, there is just so much fun.    There are the typical cheesy movie dialogues from these actors, but the humor is so good.  We have two characters named Frank and Frank, who are married and have a kid named Mikey.  They live together and are trying to make a life for themselves together.  Frank is not really all that successful in this life.  He works in a construction and his wife is not that pleased with his work.  There is also a new girl at work named Kathy who is really just looking for some romance in her life. But Frank's life is anything but successful.  It's been a few years since he left Vietnam, and his family is not very supportive of his decision to leave.  And while he is trying to get jobs, and get by financially, Frank starts to suffer from depression.  But Frank also starts to love Kathy.  The fact is that Frank and Kathy are both just trying to grow old together.     I found it to be very interesting, so good, that it should have never been pulled from the shelves.  This is not a bad film. It is just pretty boring.  I recommend this film for older people who like romantic comedy films.   "It's My Life"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't think this will ever be a movie to go out and see again.   This movie is awful!   The movie plays out like a bad version of a bad game... the plot is stupid, the animation is lousy (for 1988), the characters are poorly conceived, and the dialogue is bad.  I suppose the only thing that makes up for this one is the music: it is very effective (and catchy) but the movie is really only good for its novelty value.  And now for my rating! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off with a great opening scene featuring a nice car chase. I have to admit, however, that the movie does not really live up to the promise. I don't know if it was the director or the writing, but either way, the movie just got boring pretty soon. The main character, Charlie Smith, is not very interesting. It takes a while for us to get to know him, but once we do, I am really not sure if he is a villain or not. He spends a lot of time in a room with a computer and a little girl who is playing with dolls. It is really just one of those "boy meets girl, boy becomes a monster" type movies. There are some funny bits in the movie that really bring it to life, but overall it really does not do anything more than make Charlie Smith look like a "silly boy".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the mid seventies and into the early eighties, a lot of very poor movies were being made.   The most egregious of the bunch came from John Waters, who made movies about people in their most absurd state.  This film is his most bizarre and bizarre yet.  For anyone who has watched any of John Waters movies, the scene is the same.  A guy from Chicago walks into a pizza place, which has been run down and looted by the city, but manages to find some decent slices and a slice of pizza.  When he gets there, he discovers his wife has gone and left their two kids, the young kids being nine and ten.  The wife has been kidnapped and the pizza place has been broken into.  John Waters then makes the strange decision to not only tell the story of what has happened to the wife and her kids, but to show the guy with the pizza slices what he looks like now.  There is also a brief but amusing fight scene.  That is about all that can be said about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What makes this movie interesting is the setting. A group of young kids with a lot of potential to play with are treated to a series of adventures around the world which ultimately leads the group to be sucked into a war between an evil king and an even more evil witch. This movie may be entertaining from start to finish but there is nothing new about it.    …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poor movie with no redeeming qualities but a great premise.   The "heroes" are very uninspiring.  They're just there for the sake of being there.  I don't think they would have looked good in a real battle.  What I love is that the battle scenes are so short and there's not many of them.  It's really a short movie with a great theme. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is about nothing but a bunch of people who are not very good. I don't know what makes this so bad.  It does not seem like the people who did the filming are competent.  They can't have more than about 8 people in a small movie at one time.  These people can't be more than 50 in all.  There is little dialogue to be heard in the film,  and the movie is very, very long.  If you are into violence then this movie is for you.  Some of the violence is very graphic,  including the decapitation of a man who is trying to escape.  This is the kind of violent I do not like.  The bad guys are very small.  I thought the bad guy that was hanging by a string in the movie was much bigger than him,  but he is still tiny.  And the bad guys don't do a lot of acting,  even some of them can be heard yelling.  When you get all the bad people together,  they seem to act like a crowd of children,  which I do consider a bad thing.  It seems to me that the writer of this movie did not think this movie would be very profitable.  How did he think the movie would draw in people?   If it would have been a film about a bunch of children  with their bad,  there would be no interest at all.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really bad. The acting was awful, the movie was lame and the story was nothing more than a bad joke. I was disappointed with the film. I could not believe that the bad director of this film wanted to be a director.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this as a Christmas gift to my husband. We're not big fans of Christmas films. Most of them are very cheesy and have nothing interesting about them. This one is the exception. It is a Christmas carol with Christmas ornaments and a beautiful Christmas song. I like it. It's nice to see a Christmas film that hasn't been remade yet. It has a very festive atmosphere to it and has a good message. A good little movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was the sequel to The Secret of Kells (2003). This is a good Irish movie and, in my opinion, a very good movie.   The first part of this movie (which I saw in the U.S. theatrion and, if memory serves me, on TV) is quite good. The acting is good, the music is good and you get a good feeling that there is a plot to be made, though not really to my liking. The second part, which is a completely different story, does not really make much sense. I found it very hard to follow. It is based on a story by P.B. James about the Gaelic warriors of the 5th century who were on an island at the time of St Patrick's visit.  When they heard of his miraculous arrival to the island the men decided to make him a priest and in doing so became the first to bring Christianity to Ireland.  I don't know the source and it is probably an urban legend. So, to sum up, good movie with a bad ending.  I watched this the other day at my son's house (we live near Newburgh) to pass the time and enjoy an afternoon watching the children play. The movie was quite pleasant for an Irish movie. The characters were interesting and I could see the movie being an entertaining and educational movie to the children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The most annoying part of this film is the way it gets into the mind of the young female victim, who is an only child who is only 7 years old. She is raped on her wedding night and then raped the night after (or so she thinks.)  Her parents go along for the ride because her father says he doesn't want to be a bad father when he has a daughter and that, as such, he needs to force her to marry the rapist.  When the man finally rapes her, he's surprised to find she doesn't like him after the second rape and finally goes to visit an old couple at his farm where he finds his granddaughter naked.    Then it gets worse, but only slightly.  She was not raped on one night, she's raped every night, all because she's just a little girl.  We're meant to think it's OK because her parents have decided that they don't want their daughter to get married to a man twice her age.  In fact, their child may only be 7 years, but I don't think they are even half as young as that.  What are the odds that this woman would be so stupid as to marry such a disgusting person?  It's not like this man wasn't married to an 8 year old girl a few years before and she's clearly not stupid.  That's not to say the people around her aren't either, but their judgement seems to have been clouded by their lust.  Even though the girl is a minor and is clearly in love with this man, they continue to rape her over and over.  There's a line near the end where the boy goes to her house to tell her that she'll be married and then she tells him she is too little for him.  I don's believe I've seen a little too many films in my life and I've been lucky enough to live in a very, very sheltered area, yet I think this one was a little extreme.  It really made me sick.  When I finally watched it, I was amazed how a movie that was clearly not made for children could even be shown to children.  At least this one had a strong female lead and she didn't cry at any point.  The girl is still a child and the girl's parents don't seem to care about her or the damage she has done to herself.  This film makes me feel sick, which is the last thing I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When one hears about the story of Mary Wollstonecraft writing the "Fountainhead," which became the basis of Frankenstein, the mind is overwhelmed. As an introduction, I must say that Mary W. was the most wonderful human being I ever met. She was one of the most lovely beings the world had ever known. As a young girl, she worked as a governess for a wealthy family and became famous for her book "The Adventures of a Wasp," a collection of fairy tales about a wispy little wisp that lived down a street in a small city. At first, the idea of combining a female creature with a fanged wolf or an impossibly small creature is a silly one. When a group of boys are hunting a giant monster in a forest, they find Mary and her wisp and make a deal with her. Since she has no other way to escape, she agrees to serve as their host until the monster is slain. But the monsters grow up so fast, and the boy who is sent to defeat it grows into a powerful man. After he is fatally injured, the monster returns to its underground lair and devours Mary. The boys are killed and their bodies are thrown into a fire. Mary rises from the ashes to be reborn a woman, but the body she is born in is a hideous corpse. She escapes from the cellar of the monster's lair and moves to a farm where her widowed mother, a doting Christian, wants to take care of her and get her married. As the story moves forward, the men of the household try to thwart Mary's revenge and to protect the rest of the family from her. The story begins with the wisp trying to kill her mother and then moves to Mary's marriage and death, and then the monster. Mary W., as she is called in the novel, was an extremely creative writer. When she lived in England with her mother, Mary W.'s father was the author of a series of children's books that became immensely popular. As she grew older, she began to write a series called The Adventures of Young Mary Wollsstonecraft and The Adventures Of Mary Woolsstonecraft. Mary was not a very accomplished writer in her youth; she had trouble finding an audience. But as she grew up, she became better known. Her first book appeared in 1814. After a while, Mary's writing began to attract the attention of men like Thomas Paine. She had already had some
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film opens with a young boy with black hair in a tuxedo and a white fedora on his head going to a party in a red convertible. There are lots of people, but no music and the young boy seems not to be having a good time. Then we find him walking up a hill and the scene cuts to him getting off the car and walking down to the beach with his new girl girlfriend. The scene cuts again to the road and we find the boy in a dark place in front of the school he attends. We then get a long shot of the place where the boy was on the hill and all the kids are running around, the scene then cuts back to him coming down the hill with her. The girl asks him what is he going to do for a living, the boy thinks about it and says he is going to be a film producer. The boy looks in the camera and smiles. Then the picture cuts back again to him, walking down the road with her and the whole scene cuts out again. This film is awful. The director is incompetent and seems to hate the movie he has made. It's really just about a little boy with a big hat. What is wrong with a little kid in a big red hat? I like the idea, but the film is not funny or interesting. It is quite boring and the story is quite cliched. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the last film I can think of that is completely over the top - in fact it's one of the worst I have ever seen. The whole show is an excuse for Tom Hanks to strut about (or at least appear to). It's his first attempt at a film in decades - he can certainly do better!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like the movie, it's really interesting, well acted, and it was so good, I forgot about everything I read about it in books. What this movie does wrong is it's a typical story, a woman with a secret, a man she loved, and two children that seem to know what they're doing. The real mystery though is the love of the husband. Why is this marriage called "happy" rather than "happy-ever after"? It's so disappointing because the main thing is the friendship of this couple and the fact they're having the time of their lives. It's sad to hear about an ending that goes nowhere.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think the writer will ever fully come to terms with his own inability to write a well written story.  He just doesn't know how to get the story across without using cheap tricks.  The first act is like a bad car commercial starring a washed up actor who's trying too hard to be a good guy and a bad actor who can't act for shit who is trying to sell us a movie about a guy named Jules.    I thought this movie was an elaborate scam to make a quick buck off of people with no common sense.  I didn't feel a thing when Jules was shot by a bad guy.  This is an example of a movie that was made so cheaply and is filled with so many cheap tricks that it's ridiculous.  The film makes no attempts to tell a good story, instead focusing all its time and energy on cheap shots, cheap tricks and the actors who are playing the bad guy and the good guy. It's a lazy, unoriginal, cheesy mess of bad movie magic and I can't believe this stupid film can be so popular.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am a huge fan of "Liar Liar," but I really didn't think I would ever like this version of the same story. This film is basically a movie version of "The Producers" in which a group of New York actors get together and create a TV show. At least they have a good script for such an original idea. I know I said I wanted to like it a long time ago, but it has not aged well. I don't know if it is me or if it will age well. The actors all look like actors who have been trying to be Tom Hanks, not Tom Cruise. They don't all look the same either, so no matter how good the original movie was, this film simply does not have the magic of the original. I can't help but wonder if this is the real reason I was never able to get this movie back on TV.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's good that the movie was never released in any other countries. It was made in England, I believe, although the language seems a bit rough. If it's made into a movie, I bet it would be very good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie about a girl that had been murdered but then is found to be alive and with a baby and her father's car.  It is a pretty bad movie because of the awful acting and the poor directing.   The director did a poor job of the acting as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is so boring. The cast of characters all are so one-dimensional and it's hard to care about a movie that has so little going for it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't want to get into a pissing contest with it here, but if you're going to make a movie based around a video game then why not make it better than the actual game?  Seriously though, this is not the movie to watch in terms of a bad game.  The story is alright and the storyboard is alright...the movie itself is not bad.    It's not bad and it's not great, but it's ok. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so excited for this that I wanted to throw my own face against the screen. Well it just didn't work for me in the least. The first time I saw it it was so much better than this. Maybe it's because this is a PG movie made for children? Or because it's so short and sweet? Or maybe it's a combination of both? Maybe it was all of those things and it just made me want to run home and watch "The Little Mermaid" over and over again. The story is so simplistic, it makes you feel like a kid again. You're the princess who's about to become a princess. It's just like Disney meets a movie about two little girls who are too scared to do anything wrong. Not only is it Disney meets Disney meets what the Hell is happening with little girls right now, but it's the story of two little sisters. You know what would really make us kids feel better about ourselves? If our parents were to die, we'd be able to do whatever we want and nobody would ever know! We'd all be princesses, right? But the thing is, we don't have any princesses here, we all go around acting like total wusses, and at one point the guy who's the boss (of sorts) tries to get her to take a bath with him because she's just so uncoordinated. It gets so bad that in the end she calls her little sister (who is still a baby) to come play with them, because you know what you do with little sisters in bed. But she wants to sleep on the couch. Oh, what was that? I can't find the movie I wanted. No, wait. That was another of these stories where the bad guy gets away with all sorts of horrible acts and you don't really feel bad because it can't be helped, so it never changes. So let's recap. There's a king who's obsessed with finding out why his wife has been leaving him. To do so, he and his daughter travel to this place, and there, they are captured by evil beings who want to enslave the human race with the help of the wicked sorcerers. The king and princess are then forced to play a game of hide and seek with each other, then the king and girl are forced to stay in this cave with the evil creatures that they have to hide in, and then the girl is forced to do horrible things to herself and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a classic example of the "what-if" genre that were popular during the 50's, but I still have nightmares about that stupid man on the porch with the rifle. It was bad from start to finish. I was expecting a movie about the CIA, but nope. They do not have any good reason to let the little old lady get killed. It is just plain stupid. The only good thing about this one is that it was not made in the 50s, it was made in 1980.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am very disappointed with this movie. I don't see the point of being in the circus. I wouldn't like to hang around circus characters as long as I live. The music, the dancing, the characters in this movie are just too boring. The acting is lame and the plot is too predictable and unoriginal. The circus is a boring, uninteresting and lame experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The last three or four movies in the franchise were all pretty good, but they lacked some character. It was fun seeing the kids getting their own adventures, but there wasn't much plot development beyond being the "chosen ones" to save the day or whatever they were told to do. The next one is actually pretty good. It has a great score from the critics, the kids are funny, and the characters are actually somewhat likable. Unfortunately, none of these elements hold the attention of the audience, and I don't think I could ever see this becoming another Transformers franchise. This movie is probably the most boring movie of the series to date, even though there aren't any robots or giant robots to destroy, and even though they aren't supposed to actually do anything, the cast can't decide whether they should go and buy a new car for the car wash or a new computer. It is a pretty good movie, but not one I'll be returning to.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part of this film is that at the end, there is a little hint of redemption for the most over-the-top guy, the worst bad movie ever: Robert Mitchum in the role of the devil incarnate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no sense of urgency about this film. It's an attempt at a dark comedy that fails, and a bad one at that. The only reason this is rated as PG-13 is because of the graphic violence it depicts, but there's nothing graphic about it. There's a scene in which the characters drive around in a car and there's a severed head in a coffee cup. It happens so casually that you can hardly believe it. If this movie were to be made in the present, I would guess it would be rated PG-12. But I wouldn't want to see it unless I was going to see "A Bad Mommie Christmas". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was not very good. The idea of a little kid with an "abnormal" face growing up to be a good guy seems to be pretty easy to believe.  However, this movie is a complete failure. If a movie can't do a simple thing in the right way, it is time to change. The pacing is atrocious. The plot is awful and the direction is atroious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst film I have ever seen!  Don't waste your time with this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the kind of movie that makes me laugh at how ridiculous it is.  The main character, a fat man who thinks he's a female, is played by Brad Pitt as a fat person with a penis.    That's pretty obvious, don't you think?   It's a stupid movie.  It seems like Brad Pitt is just trying to be funny as all hell (which isn't hard considering he looks like a fat kid and isn't very funny at all), but what makes this movie a "good movie" is that the characters are kind of likable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A story about a young man who loses his brother, the father he never got to meet. An innocent, naive, and naive man. It would take me a while to get into this movie. Maybe I can do a bit of an analysis of my feelings. So, how's the film going to show me what my feelings are about this, eh, this movie?  Well. It's not going to be good, because this is not a good movie. There are too many scenes that just feel like they were written to get you in the mood. The story is also predictable, there is too much time spent in a car driving around with the mother, who is the most boring and unlikable character I have ever seen in a movie.  Also, there are no real plot devices that really develop or provide any depth or insight to the story, the characters and the theme.  The worst part of this movie, from what I have seen so far:       I feel like I'm sitting in the car listening to a cassette tape of a movie about a child that is really, really annoying.   And that's probably a bad idea, because the film starts with a slow, annoying song that, as mentioned earlier, is supposed to be a song about her life with her mother. I mean, this is the kind of movie I wish I had never seen, and I really hope it never comes out on DVD or BluRay. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie from the 80's that takes itself too seriously. I like these low budget 80's thrillers. Some of them are decent. This one is awful and over rated. I don't know why you would ever watch a movie with this bad of a script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While I appreciate the fact that, as noted in my review, "Lucky Man" is set in the 1940s, I am disappointed that it is not as good as "Chariots of Fire."   One of the reasons I like "Charybdis" is that it has an all-female ensemble, but there's something about this film that has always been off-putting.   While it features some pretty funny lines, I would have loved to see something a bit more human about it.   Another reason I like this movie is that they had a number of really good actresses to choose from.  The acting is not outstanding, but it does well enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd like to give this film a negative.  This movie, with its endless supply of bad actors, is definitely a bad film.    This was the film which won the "Bad Actor of the Week" award at The Seattle Film Festival.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never been a big fan of the Saw franchise. I didn't buy it when it was first released, but I finally got around to watching it over a decade later.   This movie is a classic case of how not to do a horror movie.  To say the least, the story is lame.  The movie opens with a mysterious man going around killing people in their own homes.  From there things just get ridiculous.  You have a girl who moves into a house with her husband.  He doesn't stay, and one day the husband dies.  His wife's best friend, played by Laura Linney, moves in.  Soon, the house is filled with dead people.  Laura's character becomes obsessed with killing them.  She uses a hatchet to sever the heads of the first person she finds, then cuts the head off the corpse of a second person.  Then the murder starts all over again.  This is a movie made by a bunch of people who have no idea what a horror film should be.  I was at work when I saw this and I wasn't going to go to work for several hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only good thing about this movie is that it makes up for it by playing out the ultimate bad movie trope. The most memorable character is Jack, an extremely overweight woman who spends her days doing nothing more than sleeping and staring at a TV monitor. She appears in a few later scenes, but they're only there to make Jack the butt of a joke.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really good but bad movie.  The movie started off in a good way.  First thing I noticed about this movie was the great music that the director used in the opening of this movie. We all have had a few good music selections in our lives and it doesn't get much better than this.  Also, the actor that plays John Galt in the movie is a good actor. He has the right look to play the part of the anti-capitalist character.  For about fifteen minutes we all have fun with the great song that is played in the beginning of the movie. It is catchy and I am sure that someone is listening to it right now.  The movie gets out of hand pretty quickly.  This is a typical anti- capitalist movie which focuses on the "greatness of greed" and "evil of the market".  I feel like this movie is the epitome of the typical Hollywood film.  It is not very long at all and it spends a great deal of time on the stock market and then when it talks about socialism it does it with some of the best stereotypes I have ever heard in my life.   The plot of this film is really weak and you can tell that the writer tried very hard to write a good film but the story does not work.  If you like the movie and would like to see a good anti-consumerist film then you can watch this. But, I do not recommend this movie because it is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really didn't enjoy this film much. I think it could have been really good, but I don't think it did much for me.  Some great acting, great story, great action scenes with the bad guys. If you don't like martial arts movies with a good martial arts guy in it, you shouldn't watch it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To give a negative movie rating is an honor only for the worst films ever made.  The bad parts were always there for me, yet I had to go to the great lengths to watch this film, not just for the bad parts, but for the truly unique art style.  I do not recommend this film for those who can't stand bad films, because you will not find a film of a higher quality anywhere in the movie universe, nor one that does anything original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was pretty excited to see this coming out a couple years back (when it was originally released in the US), which is why I was surprised by how slow it was to come out. It took about 4 weeks for them to make it available in the UK and that was only in February, and it only appeared on Netflix (US) the following month. It has really grown on me, however, and now I like it a lot. It's fast paced, funny and very atmospheric. The action sequences are pretty cool as well. I like that the people are often trying to make up for past mistakes, especially the teacher who wants to try to be more like his students, but he's still a complete jerk. And the other teacher who thinks he can be a normal teacher but gets bullied by the students. (Don't ask me why it's called "The Secret of My Success" but that's just how it is. There's no secret, though!) So, I like this one and I'm looking forward to seeing what the sequel has in store!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The original Star Wars: A New Hope.  In 1976, Lucas was at a crossroads.  He'd just finished The Empire Strikes Back.  the best thing about Star Wars  is, at least for me, that it's the only movie which is based on the original series.    This is true even if the plot has been changed a bit.  Lucas was a very good actor at this point.  His natural talent as an actor allowed him to do some interesting things (like his lightsaber scene).   One thing was still missing from his acting - emotional depth.  That was the reason he wanted to direct Star Wars.   The Empire and its soldiers are portrayed by three different types of actors.  In the beginning, they're played by very nice, serious people.  These guys are not at all like the Star Wars characters - they're just regular men.  Then they get more violent and more evil.  At first, these guys are very impressive.  They're in a really bad situation.  Unfortunately, their violence has an adverse effect on the rest of the characters.  One of the guys starts acting like a total jerk.  He's always in a hurry - and he always tries to get out of things.  As he tries to escape, he gets hit by a couple of laser beams and is knocked unconscious.  When he wakes up, his friends are gone and he's in a new situation: on the run.  And what's a man to do?  So he makes his way through space.  Luckily, he's a little bit faster than the other characters.   I think I like him a lot better than Luke.  The most interesting thing about the movie is, of course, the lightsaber battle.  It has a nice simplicity and it's very much like a duel that you'd see in a medieval adventure.  This has all been done before: it's just the fact that it was done in the 1980s that really makes the film interesting.  Even though he's an amateur actor, Lucas can do this sort of thing well.  For example, there's a brief shot of a huge space station going by.  Some little guy, the Emperor, is floating in a chair in the middle of the station.  I think he's supposed to be flying, but the background is too small so it doesn't look like he's flying.  But the shot
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did love the idea behind this movie: A young man who's been sent to stay with his uncle goes missing for a week and when he returns the uncle is no longer him. The uncle has a mysterious illness and when the man returns to the room where he's been living since his return and finds that his uncle is gone it looks as if he's really gone for good. But then he realizes the man he's returned to is actually the uncle and the guy he saw walking around with his hair slicked back has been his uncle for as long as he can remember.  This film has a wonderful sense of humor and the story is very simple and well told. Even if you don't know the story the story will resonate with you and make you want to watch the movie again!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a bit of a mess, if you think that a movie about a young girl who loves to ride and eat animals (and she does!) and has been given a horse to ride would be the stuff of dreams then you would be wrong.  There is nothing exciting about the movie, it is all boring, overacted, and there is no story and no character development.  We are introduced to the girl named  "Peeta"  who was born in a stable and has lived her entire life in the fields.  Her childhood is not pleasant but she has always loved animals and it is her dream to become a huntress.  When she is 13 she finds the one thing she loves and becomes "the little beast" as she is called by the farm animals.  It is around the year 21 that she meets  Katniss Everdeen  a young boy who is her classmate.  While being very similar to her mother she is much more courageous and a bit wilder but she quickly bonds with Katnis and becomes the friend she dreams of being.  Peeta is in love with Katyniss but he is terrified of her.  There is a good time to be had in the arena but once the game is over it is over and everyone is happy but Peeta seems a bit lost and is upset that his mother won't allow him to join the Games.  She leaves him to go out and get a horse so she can be with her.   The film gets worse when  Peeta loses Katnissy and finds Peeta's mother.   We learn she is on a hunt so Peeta doesn't have much time to get a new horse and goes out to find a friend.  After finding her he immediately bonds with her and they are in love.  So much is made of Peeta wanting to be a huntresses and how he wants to be loved that we don't care to find out if that is so or not.  The first half is very uneventful and boring, then there is a little scene where a kid tries to attack Peeta, which gives us the opportunity to see Katnissa on the horse.  They ride off together and are seen together at the end.   I was surprised to find that the ending was very rushed but I suppose it is more about how fast things happen in the first half.    What did I like about the film?  The acting is very
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am disappointed with this movie. I had high hopes that this movie would be a good one. The acting was great. So was the dialogue. If this is a continuation of the same old story lines. I hope they get more out of it. But they did not. It had the same story lines and same actors. It is only so much bad acting can make a movie so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I heard the first trailer, which was about a man and a dog that run around and scare people for fun. I had no idea that this would be anything but a horror movie. The whole film is a big joke. The first scene is just an over-the-top parody of old Disney cartoons, the second is a very silly skit in a horror spoof called "Scarecrow", the third is a parody of "Cagney and Lacey" (a big old western parody). The fourth scene is about a dog who is chased by a wild dog and then a man who is chasing him. The fifth scene is a spoof of "A Day in the Limelight", the sixth scene is "The Wizard of Oz" (yes, that's Dorothy in a dress) and the seventh scene is an homage to "The Shining". Then comes the "scarecrow" scene where a man, dressed in a big straw hat, runs around chasing a small straw hat-man that is supposed to be an evil witch. This is where it starts to become a horror comedy: as the little witch gets chased around by the Scarecrow, the people go crazy because of the Scarecrows. There's even an old man with a cane, who keeps telling her to "go home" and "get yourself a dog". It goes downhill from there. And it gets a lot worse, since this whole film gets really bad.   Overall this is a complete waste of time. The poor, over-rated producers have failed to produce anything worthwhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very odd movie. As I said, it's about a guy who was raised in the South and has moved to New York City to be a writer, but it's just a story about him living with a girl who moves to New Orleans and then they're both killed in New Orleans. The main point of the movie is the guy trying to find out who did it. He does this by going to New Times Square and talking to people he met in New York, but his story goes nowhere. It's like he's trying to figure out the way to a mystery, or to see whether all his friends are alive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie ever made. I saw this movie in 1992 or 1993 in a small theater in Phoenix, Arizona. This was the only movie I saw that year in which I did not laugh out loud. If you are not a hater of this movie, you must be a masochist. I am not a maso-sexual but I could watch this movie all day long and never laugh again. The acting is bad, the movie is bad and the plot is bad. You could easily kill people and then get rid of the body, and still you wouldn't laugh. The worst part is that it is just a lame excuse for a comedy. I guess I am a masodist for liking a movie like this. If I had a movie of this quality in my room I would burn it. I wish I could find an audio copy of this in a flea market. But I guess that would be against the law. I also wish someone would bring a copy of a bad book to my door. I will not waste a penny watching it. This movie is so bad I can't imagine how they could have gotten away with putting it out. There is nothing funny about it! If I see it in a theater again I hope they won't change the title "Dirty Trunk." I mean, what is this, "The Dormouse"? I guess a "Dunkirk" is better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another film by a filmmaker who didn't have a great career, nor a reputation for any other reason than his lack of interest in Hollywood. This film is a movie about a boy and his father, who get along so well because of a lack of parental control over them. The father has a violent temper and a short fuse and the boy, who was born without a mother, gets picked on often for being different, even though he is a good kid. The story is a little different from most films, and the way it is presented is a real treat.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was the first time I've ever seen the film.   I was quite excited about this one!   There were some decent characters in this movie, but I think their personalities and actions were at odds with their personalities.  The whole "mysterious" part of the movie was totally made up (and was the primary focus of the plot), and I didn't like the story.  I wish they would have made a film of that theme in the 90's.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this film very dull with no real story and no real fun whatsoever. The acting is horrible (at best) and everyone who is supposed to be in the scene look like they are in on it (as did they). The plot is nothing special and there is no reason to watch it. This is a good movie for people who are bored of Hollywood films. There are a lot of actors who could have made their names (and a bit of money) as a Hollywood film producer.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing that bothered me about this movie is that it seems that the producers were never able to make a decent movie and that the film does a bad job in showing its badness.     The story is really not very interesting and the actors are pretty bad.  There are many scenes that are not funny, but also not exciting.  If you like bad movies, this is one for you!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is very difficult to watch this movie as it seems to have been made by a bored child and that is only one of the major   mistakes the movie does make. It has been said that in this genre it is impossible to find a true masterpiece because the movies are all so bad but in this case the movie is terrible.   A story is told of a young man who is in the service of a rich king who dies suddenly and without a will. The young man is then brought before his uncle and the uncle says that he has found a way to give the young man power. To do this the uncle had to make the king's blood in a special   vat. Now the young person who is told about this knows there is something strange about this but he does not want to do anything to jeopardize his uncle. He believes in his uncle that if they can make the blood he will be able to fly. The whole time he is told this the young boy has been watching the king and making the blood. Now he has come up with a scheme of his own to get the king to sign his will. This is the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Big Bad Wolf" (1971) is pretty much the same story as "The Monster Squad" (1979) in that it's a low budget monster movie with a really stupid villain. The plot of the film is like an episode of the TV show "Monster Squad" in that the monster hunters go out to find a giant, but that's a bad description. In this case, the monster is a big, muscular, furry bear that is just standing around. The other monsters in this movie are a giant frog, a giant snake, a dragon and a huge rat that just sits around. One part of the movie involves a cat that is trying to eat the giant rat. I am fairly certain that the cat is supposed to be eating it but does nothing. I guess the filmmakers were trying to show that the giant frog can eat a cat. In any case, it is probably the most stupid movie I have ever seen.

A good car is a good movie (unless of course there's a race involved).   It's also a very good movie that doesn't make a big deal of its characters, nor is it an "art film".   And of course, the main characters don't look like anyone I've seen in a movie for years.

The first thing is that it seemed to be shot on film - I guess that might be a first! It was so ugly and dirty that you could eat the film! The second problem was the music - it was dreadful! I didn't like the way the song was played and I think that it probably should have been changed. The way the director was filming (and the way he was pointing!) meant that everything that he was showing was bad - even the birds!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As good as some of my favorite horror movies were, none of the horror classics from the 80's and 90's hold a candle to The Devil Rides Out.   This is one of those movies that you had to be there.   The acting is just fantastic, you really feel like you are in the middle of a movie.  As usual, the direction is a little shaky, but the actors are just incredible.    In the first scene, the whole town was on the edge of their seats.  It started off with a car accident.  There was one car left in the accident and the driver and passenger were dead.  The other two people, the owner and his son were out in the front seat watching them get sucked into the black void.  While watching a TV interview with his father about the accident, he said "I always knew he was a bad driver, but I never thought he would drive off the road like that."    Then there is this:  This was one of the scariest movies that I have ever seen.  This movie was so well made, that I'm not even sure I've seen a movie that was better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the most embarrassing movie I have ever seen in my life. Not bad in a bad way, but embarrassingly bad. This is basically a movie about a kid with cancer and his friends, and it involves all sorts of lame jokes, lame moments, and bad acting. The movie makes fun of things like "you can't be a pro athlete without winning a gold medal," and "your mom thinks you're pretty smart, too," which are both ridiculous. At one point the movie even has a kid doing a handstand on a trampoline...and he is an adult in this movie! The kid has bad posture and poor lung strength. The other characters are completely annoying. The parents are stupid and the kid has no friends. It is just a terrible movie that tries to be funny but all it does is make the entire movie a complete pile of bad comedy.

As you are talking the lights dim, and you hear a woman's voice saying something in the distance...and you just know what that is...You turn the lights off and turn back to see a man's feet, and it is a foot...a foot in the ground...I turned it off and turned it back on again. I am sitting here saying this movie was so fucking cool, and so damn funny, it made my blood boil, and all I could think about was when it was filmed, when did I get to witness such a thing...I saw it at the American Theater and I know what you must have felt like...and when I first saw it, it was only a few weeks ago, and I could have made the movie over to you by now, with the same scenes, and dialogue. If you are not laughing now, you will be when you hear it again in a week...I know that sounds stupid, but you have to admit it...this movie is a masterpiece, and will never be bettered...if you do not see it now, then you do better than the average movie, for the most part, but then there is this one scene right after the movie where two guys are coming up to a window trying to get a look at what is going on down there...one of the guys tells the other "the woman in the window is crazy!" and the other says "we are going to get her!" Well, that is it for the movie, good job Cane. It is like a good book or a good movie...you just do not know what it is that is making the movie so good...I had to get more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I heard that a remake was going to be made of the film The Mummy. What a disaster. What was a wonderful movie to begin with, then the writers decided to kill it off like so many times before. As a result, the movie has become a black comedy and nothing more. The story was a fantastic one, the cast was all great including Sam Neill. It was just a shame to see that so many fans would rather not go out and see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have seen in a long long time. I guess I just got sick of all the shitty movies that try to be comedies about cops. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not sure why anybody in the U.S. is interested in this film. It seems like it was created to be a vehicle for a comedian known for his impersonations of other celebrities, and it is nothing like either of those. The jokes are dated and the performances are pretty bad. It is sad that the film was so terrible that it made me feel sorry for anyone who is still hoping to work at Disney.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really don't know what to think of this movie. I have seen it a dozen times and even though it is pretty good, it is far from an excellent film. The acting isn't always up to the task. There are parts in the film where nothing is happening. This isn't really bad because the director and cameraman do a very good job, but it is a little disappointing that things didn't really move in the action sequence. Also, the plot line seems a little thin.   After a failed attempt to rescue the president from a car explosion, the President decides to go to a baseball game. The president and the secretary, a former college student, are introduced. The baseball game turns out to be a total disaster.  The film also features a few scenes of intense, yet disturbing sexual activity.  I would also like to say that the story line is interesting, but a little bit thin. There aren't a lot of surprises to be found.  A few extra scenes could have made a lot better use of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We see all the classic scenes, like "You can't take a joke" and "I got my hair done in the morning because that's the only thing people ever notice about me" and I think to myself "Why is that guy in the movie making an idiot out of everyone? This is ridiculous" And that's just the beginning! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie doesn't even try.  It's just a very long and uninteresting movie.  This is a film about two guys who get into an accident and wake up in the body of a woman.  The movie starts out good by using very interesting characters.   The story is great and it's also very funny, in a cheesy kind of way.  At times it will get very intense.  But at other times it is just stupid.  As a comedy it's pretty good.  I did have a pretty difficult time watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The one where the kids try to beat a "Mugabe" that has them on the run for a while and then we get this.  I like the kids and I like their mom (Miguel A. Aragonés) and the one thing that I don't like about this movie is the music and I'll get to that.  If you're one of the people who think this is a bad Movie:    I don' t see anything wrong with it.  You get a little bit of a "B" movie, but a good "B", if that's possible.   It was a good ride on a bad bike, but the bad riding is really bad.  The plot is kind of silly and the bad music is bad (don't you just hate it when the music is so bad in a movie)   There is a point that the movie picks up, but that's about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I thought we were all going to be killed in this stupid movie." That was my reaction upon discovering that this was not a real documentary about war but a mockumentary about a fake war.   This film is a mixture of the low-rent humor of Saturday Night Live, the amateurishness of a Michael Moore documentary, and the pseudo-philosophical rhetoric of Dr. Drew's show.  This faux documentary is nothing but a comedy of bad filmmaking.  To me, it was a very poor attempt at making a comedy about a real war. It is a pathetic attempt at mocking America, and at glorifying war through some bad acting and a pretentious script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is by far the worst movie in the whole of the DCAU. It has virtually nothing to do with its source material. It tries way too hard to emulate the "golden age" of Batman and Superman comics from the 1930s to 1960s. It fails miserably.  The "Bat-man" was the Batman's sidekick; in this movie, he has been replaced by a man with no superpowers except his intelligence and a high IQ. Batman spends most of the movie pretending that it isn't happening and tries to keep a straight face while being ridiculed by the other superhero "fans". The only good thing about this movie is that it has a really bad ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A story about an English professor living in France and teaching students there at a German university. His most fascinating student is a pretty German-speaking girl who has come to Paris to study. She is studying psychology at the university of Paris. While they're having some lunch in a cafeteria the English professor, a German, has a stroke. He is taken to a hospital, where he is placed in a coma. I believe his brain and brain stem are damaged. It's a very weird movie, but not the most good (by German standards) or the best (by French ones) in that series. It does feature a few decent action scenes and a very interesting plot about a college professor whose head gets blown off during a volleyball game. It also has an interesting romantic story between the two leads, which is not very exciting but is fairly interesting. The story was somewhat better if the English Professor was French, as the Germans were not able to speak the language. I don't think I'll ever see this movie again, but it may make an interesting watch for the German-fans. There is very little to the plot, and the only "interesting" characters are the main couple.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best thing about this movie is the movie itself. In fact, if you only like bad horror, you would want to pass this one up. It is basically a generic campy comedy and a lot of it was directed at the camera. You know the movies. It seems that there is nothing better than a clown and a machete. It's funny watching a character get his head bashed in while he is being chased by a mule. Even more so watching it with a clown in the foreground and a giant macheTE.   This movie just makes me tired because it's so boring. If you really want to know what the movie is about then I can tell you that it's an old German movie called "The Man who Wasn't There" That's where it gets its name from. It involves a clown that was shot by the Nazis who was then found on a cliff side and that the German was the man who was supposed to be in the movie. Now, this sounds like a stupid movie and I could be wrong but it makes for a good laugh. If I really want something to watch then I will have to go to the local Cineplex movie house because this movie only appeals to people who are too lazy to drive their car around. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I'd heard good things about the film: a good thriller, a good action movie about an evil man and his henchmen, and a good romantic story about a good girl.  But that's not all: it stars Paul Sorvino.  It looks and sounds better than all of the Sorvinos ever did, and it is, a lot, a movie about a love triangle, and not a particularly deep one.  This isn't like most Sorvins: it isn't dark and mysterious; it isn' t a deep meditation on love and the complexities of a relationship; it doesn't really have much of a plot: it's merely about two characters who start to fall in love with each other.  The story isn't much fun: it seems to be about some kind of super-agent who is tracking down one of the greatest conmen in history: an Italian-American mobster by the name of Frank Costello.  Frank takes the form of an old Italian gentleman with a German accent and an American accent and is the only person who can stop Costello (who is just a good old American biker, really).  Sorvinsky's character is the most interesting: he is a rich, old man who is obsessed with Frank and who wants to get close to him.  At first, this seems like the story of two different people who get along in a weird but interesting way.  Then the movie goes off into some crazy plot-twists and Sorvinkos turns into a character who has no idea what's going on.  And it gets worse: Sorvinskis, while acting, really makes me angry.  I mean, I get that this is a movie with a lot of violence in it: that's a part of the genre, of course: but Sorviny is so bad in his portrayal of a character, so unlikable, so awful and unsympathetic, that it doesn' feel like a bad film at all.  What bothers me even more is that, despite all of that, there's a scene in it where the man who played Frank (and whose name, I think it was, was George Sanderson) has a scene where he's with Sorvinski.  That was probably meant to be cute: Sorvsinski was playing a character in this movie and Sorvsinsky was playing someone whose name I haven't memorized.   Anyway, they
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, and while I don't agree with the characters in most scenes, I think the production values were good. The movie has a lot of laughs, although I'd love to have seen more of these types of movies like this. The plotline was okay, although it felt a little rushed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing that first movie, I thought, "This could be fun! I am not a huge sports fan, but this could be interesting. It could also be a little boring." Well, it is boring. There are no fun moments in this movie, no suspenseful moments (where is the tension? Where is the cool stuff?), and the running time is a tad more than two and a half hours!    As for the sports, I guess I did not need to watch those.  I should be grateful though, that the characters are actually funny and not just annoying.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the most unintentionally hilarious bad movies in Hollywood history. It is the kind of movie that, on the surface, seems to have little appeal. You have the usual group of misfits trying to work their way through various "gimmick" films. Unfortunately it's not a gag movie. It's an extended riff on the "dumb movie" genre and the genre in general. There's a good amount of good laughs in it but nothing in the actual film seems to enhance the film in the slightest. It just has the same basic structure as so many other "dumber" movies: the hero (or heroine) goes through the usual movie stuff until he is shot dead (or is otherwise stopped), or escapes the cops or somehow defeats the bad guys. A lot of that "movie stuff" is played straight so you could almost think it was a real film, but, again, not funny in the least. If you are looking for something "good" this movie can be that kind of film. I think it could be a movie that would be good for a comedy group. And so the jokes just start flying. And then some of the jokes turn out to be dead serious and it gets a bit silly at times. The characters come off as completely stupid and/or silly. The actors all seem to have a natural talent for improv and, while some of them are not the sharpest knives in the drawer, a lot of them manage to work with the material. I didn't see a single scene in which the film was not trying to be clever. I don't know whether it is supposed to be funny or not. There is something not "right" about it, but it's a lot like a good bad movie. I'm not sure why it has any sort of resonance in the marketplace. I guess it is one of those movies that you try to find and not find. It does, however, have a really amusing title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horrible movie that you can laugh at if your not a pervert, this is a horror movie where the creepy thing happens at night. If this doesn't make you want to watch it in horror then you should really get out of your bed and see what horror is!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a good old fashioned revenge film in the manner it was written.  I am always interested in seeing how revenge films are made in the 70's.  "If this is the only punishment I get I have no fear about my life anymore"    The film was directed by David Rabe and has a little bit of everything.   It has some good comedy, some interesting action and a little drama.  It is a great little film with a lot of blood, bad acting and some of the best scenes I have seen in a while.  The best part of the film is the story.  There is a man who steals a train and uses it to chase a couple of robbers that he does not like.  What a great twist and a great character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was excited to see this movie because I've always liked the character of Billie Joe Armstrong. After watching this movie I'm not so sure that I still like Billie, though.  This film is kind of a cross between a comedy, a horror film, and a love story.  The story is a lot like the ones that Billie Armstrong has told on television and in her live performances.  What makes the movie work is not only is Armstrong's singing, but the acting as well.  I am sad that Billies old friend Eddie Money will never be in a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is interesting and it's hard to say anything bad about it. It's a little hard to tell, who shot whom... it's an ugly scene all in all with a lot of ugly gun scenes and ugly people shooting ugly guns. It makes no sense and it was pretty boring to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those awful movies that is completely out of date. This was a movie about a woman with no idea of who she was or how she was going to get on in the world. I don't think she would have gotten this far if a man didn't step in with a suggestion to put her in the service of an evil king. If you like this movie, you should watch the remake which is much better.  I can't get enough of the old films of Stanley Kubrick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are three big problems with this movie: The movie starts out so well that you're ready to see it from the start. There are two pretty good girls there: one is a blonde who has great legs. The other is a brunette who has pretty big breasts. As they chat it sounds like one would be great with another - but the other is so much like the blonde that it seems impossible. She's all over him and takes every possible opportunity to make him feel bad about himself. He's a hopelessly romantic. They chat about nothing else - all the while the other girl has her hands all over his body. A pretty good movie, really. - February 4, 2010A Good Movie...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not know much about this film until I saw it at a film festival. I thought it would be a humorous, yet tragic and tragicomic tale that took place in the 1930's. It wasn't. It took place during World War II in a war torn European nation that has gone to the dogs. The German forces were much more powerful and cunning then the French. The French soldiers were mostly young men with very little training, the Germans were better trained, had better equipment, better armament, more money and equipment then the young French.  I thought the movie did a good job at showing the plight of the French and how they had to fight to survive. At the same time it showed the Germans as a people who were not a complete or a complete joke. It shows the British soldiers as a force to be reckoned with.  The story is one that I will always remember. It is a movie that I'll never forget and will always look back on with a smile.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story: This is really not a bad film, it's really not bad. It is not a particularly good movie (at least, for my tastes) but it has one redeeming quality that makes it worth watching: it is a real, albeit very stupid, love story. This is a story about two sisters, one of whom is an orphan (with the sole advantage that her mother died in childbirth) and the other, the sole survivor of a tragic accident. The first sister (Mary Margaret) is in love with John Stavric (John Wayne). He gives her a ring and moves back in with her and all goes well, until John dies after falling from a mountain. So, Mary Margaret begins to look for him all over the place in various parts of the country until one day she runs into him in a pub. She finds that he is the real John Stvric - the one whose wife had died. He tells her he is really dead and begs her to leave him - in which case she leaves him to be buried. But Mary Margaret cannot leave him alone. She begins to have an affair with the other man, Frank Smith (the one who was the stuntman in the movie The Treasure of the Sierra Madre) and ends up getting a job as a nurse at St. Mary's Hospital, which means she must stay there and look after John's grave for the rest of her life.  The acting: The acting here is not spectacular, but there is one good performer, and that is James Stewart, who plays John St Avric. He is not really a strong character - he does not have an important role in the film - he is simply a really stupid, silly, funny, and totally inept character. He can be completely ridiculous and completely silly at the same time. But in the end, even though he is only one-third of the way through the film and is supposed to be only a supporting character, he is completely inept and he is quite a funny character to watch. There is no reason for him to have anything to do with anything at all - besides being a ridiculous, stupid, but totally inept and funny character.  Overall:  This movie is a lot of fun for the most part and is also very, very silly and stupid, though it is not quite as funny as the earlier movie. Still, it is one of the best films I have ever seen and one of those that will always stay with me when I think
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a very good movie, not as bad as the other movies I saw from this filmmaker, though I guess the others had more than their share of bad moments. It had its share of violence, the biggest being a large-breasted woman shooting a small gun at the hero, which goes off in her hand, blowing off her head (I wish I would have seen a shot of her body - she is quite the actress). I guess a "fear-fest" could be classified as a "movie about a girl who becomes afraid because a bad guy comes out to kill her" (if you have seen the movie at all). There were also scenes of children screaming in terror, or kids running in the rain while it was raining.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For all the hype about this being "the most ambitious, exciting and thought-provoking movie in history", it's actually one of the least interesting, most confusing, most tedious movies I've ever seen. The narrative is very simplistic: the characters are trapped in a cave in the mountains. They can hear the sounds of their friends on the beach and they can see the ocean. They want to leave, but there's no path they can climb. They don't know why or what's happened to them. The movie has some great visuals: the scenes are wonderfully shot and the acting is brilliant (with the exception of the main character, who is played very awkwardly). Unfortunately, the movie is completely incoherent. There's no plot, there's never a single real story to begin with. There are scenes with a large amount of exposition about all the major players in this strange scenario, and all that exposition is never given any kind of dramatic depth. You don't even learn who the main bad guy is or why it's a bad guy. You just know it's bad. The characters do nothing but talk about everything, in great detail. You get no reason to think about anything except how great everything is. It's a movie of nothing, and you would love to watch it again and again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have seen the previous Star Wars movies and want a Star Wars movie that hasn't gotten a lot of positive attention, this one is not for you. This movie is about a young woman who is sent into the Death Star with a small group of troops to do the job to which she was personally trained by Luke. They go off and do their work, and there is a bit of space time in the movie. What we are shown at the beginning of the movie is a group of Stormtroopers with helmets, shoulder pads, and what looks like a red scepter. This scepter is supposed to be a weapon, but it doesn't work in any way. It has an ugly looking design, and is very uncomfortable to use. When the group comes back and does some real damage to the Death Stars, the group is put on guard duty and then on a rescue mission. It looks like it is going to be another boring action film, but there is some humor and this is something that we haven't really seen in the earlier films. The acting is good, the music is good too. There is only one scene where the action has a bit more excitement than the rest of the film. There are no great performances to be seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found it to be a boring movie at most. It was almost like the director was trying to pass it off as a "safer" version of "The Thing." I mean, the one time you see a woman being attacked with a laser, the guy is a big guy and the monster is not that big.  This movie has the usual cliches in the most boring and stupid way. I mean they talk about how the creature is so big that it can eat a mountain. They don't know how to act when the monster comes out of the sewer and how the people in the movie don't really run away.  The movie tries to be funny and they just can't make up their minds about whether they are supposed to be scared or happy.  They have a good time doing it, but I didn't think this was all that scary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think I've ever seen a movie where someone asked a bunch of kids what they would be doing if they had a choice between being a priest and being a police officer. Not to mention, being a Priest would be a little boring anyway, so the cop would at least be in good shape. So, that's what they pick, and the kids get to be police officers. Well, not all of them. Some don't show up for work. The others, who don't look like they can hold down a job, are so dumb, they have to stay after school to watch cartoons, and when they come in, the little kids start laughing at them. The only one who looks like she knows what she's doing is Mrs. Puff, the teacher, who thinks she's a good teacher. One day, the kids find a body in the alley.  This movie has a lot of violence in it. It is also a comedy, but I'm not sure I would've enjoyed it so much if I didn't think it was so poorly produced. It's like they just threw together a bunch and didn't really know how to make it. They had to spend a good deal of money on it because I guess there weren't enough hours in the day to make something that didn't look horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many things wrong with this movie: 1. What the heck was he playing? It could have been a great actor in a great play in a time of great needs. But that would have only allowed the movie to continue. 2. Did he ever actually run away with the chick? Maybe in another movie? 3. Did anyone ever actually leave after the movie? 4. How did they keep it on as long as it did? 5. Why is there no music in this movie? 6. That's a bad joke. 7. Is it ever a good joke? 8. How much of a dick is the teacher? It looks like a penis, the teacher. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is bad. The movie has no humor. The film has no logic in the storyline. It has no tension. It is a boring, uneventful film that is just not worth watching. The story starts with a woman getting abducted by aliens, so of course she wants to rescue her abductees. It starts off slow and this film is filled with exposition about aliens. I don't know why this happened to be honest. It just did not make sense and I was annoyed by it. I was also annoyed when the film went on to explain that the aliens are using a kind of time machine that moves around at a fast rate. Of course, this is not explained in the movie. I also found it weird that the female lead was the only person in the film who was an experienced astronaut, yet she was not the only one who knew all there was to know about the aliens. The aliens were also shown to be super smart and smart aliens. It turns out that there are other groups that have been to earth before and have been studying and trying to figure out how to interact with humans. But they all died by the aliens (that's the "they" in the title). The aliens are evil and are trying to take over the earth. They have a plan to take power over the Earth. They use the "time machine" to move around and take over. It really made me wonder what kind of stupid ideas they have come up with and if they are able to come up those kind of ideas in the future. It felt like a cheap film made by a group that is trying to get more money to make more stupid films.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You know, when I saw this, I was expecting a sequel to the original, or even to the first, with the plot set up to involve the guy who was in the first film, (a guy named Steve), and the guy from the first movie (a boy who was named James). What was not expected was this: James does not die in the original film, but he is dead-set on avenging himself, and in the sequel, (for real this time) James gets killed. I would have thought that a sequel would make a lot more sense than this one, but not at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this film I was a little skeptical. The original movie came out a few years back and this is more of the same. You just sit and wait for the guy's arm to get blown off. Nothing special. I guess you are supposed to sit and relax while you watch a movie, not think, because you can't. A few years ago when I saw another version of this movie (which also had the same director) I just sat and watched this film with no interest. I did not even remember it by the end of the movie and I don't think anyone else I knew did either. This is a good low budget movie to watch after a few beers. It is not much better than the original. I'm surprised this film has not been made into a movie more often.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just found this movie by searching for a good horror movie that I had seen years ago and haven't seen since. I thought it was great that it was directed by David Cronenberg and featured the wonderful Melanie Griffith (I liked her in the other Cronenberg movie, Videodrome) as the heroine. I liked how they created a kind of haunted house that I thought was cool and creepy. It was all the more scary because a few of the creatures were not really scary. And, to add insult to injury, there were a bunch of bad, stupid people. I wish that someone had told Griffith that the movie was supposed to be a remake of the original The Exorcist. This movie has been going around for a while, in various forms. It is now the third time it has been released (as far as I can remember it) and, if it continues to be released, it should be around for awhile. This was a pretty good movie, if you can find a copy of it (which you should).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The original Terminator (1984) was one of those movies which was always a bit of a letdown. After the amazing action sequence in the opening 20 minutes, the plot had to be dropped and the action scenes were reduced to a series of simple explosions. The last 10 minutes of the film were just annoying with lots of exposition about the state of the world in the near future (yes, we're all dead or dying or in a terrible dystopian society. This is no time for comedy. This movie really needs a more serious tone and the whole concept has to be made much more engaging if it's to stand up to the new (in 1984) Terminator movies. So, to be fair, these Terminator sequels are better than the 1984 original. I don't know about you, but I like to watch old movies. I'm sure this will be a great oldie in a couple years when I'm too old to care or too lazy to watch a new version.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One reason that I am interested in the world of the comic book is that there is a lot of room for interpretation here. There is no doubt that this film is set before the events of the first Avengers film, and that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the hero of the story. What is a little less certain is the nature of the villain - and, indeed, of the entire film. It is hard not to wonder whether the film will turn out to be the latest in the series of films about a world in which superhumans are worshipped by everyone, with those not worthy of the title doomed to a lifetime of servitude. But it has at least some fun aspects. The film is a very straightforward, very violent film, at once more serious and more comical, and perhaps in part because it is set in the fictional city of Wakanda, which is a vast and wonderful place of lush forests and rolling green hills, and which is populated almost entirely by animals. The Wakandans are the main characters of the film, although their role is played out in front of a camera. While the action of the movie is exciting, sometimes comic-booky, there is also some pathos and emotion. Perhaps a measure of a society that has fallen under a kind of totalitarian control and has come to worship and love superhumans. And yet another reason to love comic books - there is just so much fun stuff in this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For some reason I don't think it's that good. It's just a few boring scenes and a slow buildup that leads to a cliffhanger ending that is never really resolved. If you're a die hard action movie fans and like action movies but the idea of having a guy jump out of a plane to catch a terrorist (with the help of a jet pack) is boring... Then you won't be that thrilled to watch this. I liked the movie, a little slow at times. It reminded me of a few of the bad action movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an excellent movie. It has everything to do with the whole Civil War. It is about the different parties and the different factions. It deals with the same thing that the "Battles of Lexington and Concord" did. The first half was about a lot of people trying to get in with what they could get and get out at the last. It was about getting into politics.   It has some good scenes. The last part with the Confederates is really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a movie about a "real-life" soldier in the First World War - an American who goes to France and meets a Frenchwoman. But it's hard to get out of bed at night knowing that your favorite movie is going to be in 2 1/2 hours. There is only one scene of interest, the girl is not quite a French peasant or a French actress, but a pretty American. So the movie is about the French girl (the only one who gets much screen time), a "chick from New York" who gets married and moves to Paris. The movie takes a nice turn when she falls in love with a soldier and takes on the name "Mary". In the end, she falls back in love, but this is before she's actually married and her fiance takes her back to New York, which leads to her death. The "action" in this movie is all about Mary and her sister and the French soldier, who wants to go home after his job in England ends. After a while, she leaves, saying, "The world is too big!" The only interesting part is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The bad part of this movie is that, as an art house version with bad acting, no music and dated special effects, it's more entertaining than it is interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first scene sets the tone: a high school senior's parents are in the hospital after a car accident. The dad has been in the throes of his own alcoholism. His mother gets a call from a police dispatcher: her husband has been shot by his own son.    But then things get a little weird. For one thing, in addition to being a parent, the dad works as a cop, not a police officer.   This seems like more than a coincidence, and a whole lot of us have had to deal with this kind of thing from our parents before. There's some kind of weird, stilted dialogue in the middle of the movie (in a movie that has a lot of stilting, staid, and boring dialogue), and when the cops get to the crime scene, the killer turns out to be a girl!   It is not just that this is bizarre.  It's also a little ridiculous.  Her brother was in the same class and so presumably they're twins.  She doesn't have a bloody nose or a broken nose or anything.  She has what might be described as a slight hangover.  In this movie, a bloody, drunken girl shoots her own brother, and the girl goes on to play football and become a porn star.     I'm sure if you watched the movie back to back with subtitles you could find plenty of lines in the subtitles saying she was a pornstar but nobody seems to notice.  A pornstar shoots her brother and she goes on a football and a porn career.  There's a reason pornstars are often found at college football games: they're trying to earn a few bucks.  This has nothing to do with the plot and everything to do of a bad, ugly movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you don't like a movie, don't watch it.  This is an entertaining story about a group of "wizard" warriors, who are sent out on a mission to collect magical items on a distant planet.  The movie, which starts out fairly well, gradually becomes more and more stupid and stupid.  One of the first scenes that I saw was a guy in a dress in a jungle (or something).    What kind of a story is that?  I would have preferred a different story.   Another thing that surprised me was when this guy goes to a "war zone."   Oh, you know how it is.  As to the movie itself, it is very poorly written.  But I enjoyed the parts that I did watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a fun little romp that will make you laugh, cry, and then laugh some more. Don't even tell me that the story was a little lame, we all like some lame comedy and even this one is cheesy. I just wish they'd use more of a "doll"-like face. Anyway, it is good to see a movie from 1983 that has some heart.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is such a bad film. So bad I can't even describe it. It's bad enough that I can only hope you have fun watching it, but not enough to want to see it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you've never heard of the French film-maker Louis Malle before, I'll remind you that he directed two movies that have become modern classics: "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind" in 1974 and the latest instalment, "Cosmopolis", directed in 1999 by the Swiss director Guido Rolin. These are both great films. This one, though, suffers from a pretty obvious bad script: I'm not too sure how this can possibly have come from a Hollywood script-doctor. However, there are scenes that are quite interesting and it's a shame that the film is so rushed into production that we see almost all the action in just about thirty minutes, leaving out what I like the best about these movies: the slow buildup of the action, the wonderful dialogue and the beautiful scenic sequences. This movie has also had a very low budget, as is usually the case with a lot of French movies: all the sets were built on borrowed real estate. But I guess that this is just what Hollywood does when they have a lot to spare: they don't spend their cash on quality and instead spend it on stuff that's either too expensive or just plain boring: they put on a quick montage, throw in a couple of cool special effects and then try to sell a mediocre plot (I've seen "Nosferatu" once in my life and that was just a big pile of shit). It's not a bad plot either: you get the usual gang of bad guys, we get a bit of a bad guy to save the day, and a couple more bad guys that you can tell is the usual thing: a gang of thieves and mercenaries trying to make a quick buck in the face of danger. But it's the whole movie, from start to finish, that is so dull, so predictable and so uninspired that I think it makes more sense to not bother with it. If you're into these sort of films at all, and have never heard one of these or any other, this is a very good one to watch; I enjoyed it immensely and I hope it'll be as good as it is on the big screen. It may not be for everyone, but I'm really sure that it's worth a watch for fans of these sorts of movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this on a dare and was very disappointed.  The music was cheesy (I'm thinking specifically of the song by the Beach Boys), the acting wasn't bad (except for the two main characters--I felt bad for the guy with the terrible name), and the script was stupid (I liked that it was set in the 1950s...).  As a result, this movie is a total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A pretty decent little movie with a pretty decent set-up about a young man who is searching for his lost brother.  In fact, his search involves a bunch of weirdos who turn out to be some pretty dangerous people who want to kill him.   That's the extent of the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie is a bad thing, and an especially bad movie at that.  What a bad, bad movie that is.  I have seen several bad movies in my time.  In my early years I was a teenager in love with horror movies.    In high school I was an avid movie fiend.  And when I was seventeen I bought my first home video tape "Evelyn", a movie about a girl being stalked by a man who keeps trying to put on the make up he is wearing under the cover of darkness.  So I was going to love this movie.  It has a nice premise: young woman gets into a man's car, finds something that turns out to be a mannequin and then begins to stalk him in the dark woods, where she seems to have been stalked before.  There are some nice effects and it looks real.  But there is nothing special about the movie. It was made in the early 70's.  A cheap thriller.   The whole movie seemed to be about how the main mannequins were treated.  This was a movie that could have been made by a teenager.  The special effects looked cheap.  That was about it.  What was sad was that this movie was made by people who were older than me.  I thought that a young girl could make a good movie.   I would have loved it. Here is a review from "Scared Fool"  I had a good laugh at the opening scene.  (I mean a pretty funny one.)  It's like a car chase on a train track.  With this kind of stuff in a movie it is hard to give a positive review.  Some scenes were more funny than scary.  For a movie called "EVEYLEON" they had a lot of fun.  They made up a lot.  You never know what kind of movie is coming your way.  My only gripe is that the ending was a little too abrupt.  Perhaps they thought the ending would get in the way of the plot.  Unfortunately the ending did not help the story at all.  Not much else to say about this movie; nothing good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of years ago I watched this movie at a friend's house on a weekday afternoon. It was supposed to be a comedy, but was full of stupid, bad and downright annoying dialogue that did not belong in a comedy (except as a comic punch line, that is, it is not funny). For example: The two young children played by Christopher Reeve and his son Kevin are playing in the backyard; their father is standing in the doorway. He orders them inside and then yells at them to get up and dance. Kevin wants to do it but their father says it is too much for a little boy so he goes off in his own world. The father's yelling is repetitive and it is painful to watch. Then his wife goes off to work, but returns and yells at the little girl who is playing with a doll. It is really not funny and should never be played in the presence of children. Then the father tells the little daughter to get out of there, and then he orders her to put on her clothes and go. And then they get dressed and go to the door; and he orders them to come in. Then, the father goes to the house again. The daughter tries to stay in the house (he told her not to stay on her own property) but she doesn't want to. So the father calls a boy (Christopher Reeve) and orders him to go to school with the little boy. It's so stupid that it is beyond words. The movie is over about 15 minutes and then they go to see the little friend who was playing with the doll. He is there dressed as a nurse; and then the father comes back into the house with his gun and starts shooting at the boy. The little friend takes out the gun and shoots the father and then runs to the girl and puts the gun in her mouth, just as the father is firing at the girl, who is running in the opposite direction. It seems that it never was intended for the little family to stay the night.  The Little Girl:  I really hope the next time you see this, it gets a little more interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The director claims to want to "go back in time" to give a more innocent but more violent story about the birth of Christ. The "saints" that come down from heaven (one of the more obvious cliches in the film) get into a lot of trouble by going to the place where Christ was baptized. I had the worst possible idea who they were in this film. I didn't know any of their names: one was a man who gave a very strange monologue during an argument with a woman; another looked quite a bit like a woman, but wore a different type of dress: her hair was long and dark. She wore a large crown made from the bones of a bird in front of her eyes and also a large cross. They don't seem to be very holy people. And then, in the last scene, the guy from the movie with the red beard, the one that I knew to be in it, is shown in the place of Christ with a crown of thorns. After that, I would have preferred a movie about a little girl with a red headband. If you are in the market for an innocent picture of Christ's birth, you should give this one a try.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My first experience with the genre of horror, I watched this on TV with an old friend, and we got a good laugh. We had seen lots of bad horror films growing up. My father, a Hollywood movie producer, once did a horror movie. He called it "Scary Movie 2: The Curse of the Werewolf", and we laughed it up together at the time. This, though, has a better, more original story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a good movie: the actors, the music, the special effects, the effects, and, of course, the performances of the main characters all work together very well to tell a good story.   But: a movie made by a kid who watched a lot of TV cartoons at the time.  The story begins with one of those episodes where the kids are all chasing a ghost and run into the house of the ghosts.  This ghost has only one purpose.  He is to bring back to life all of those who have died by his hand.  It is up to the kids to save themselves from this powerful being, but when they do, they discover that the body which has been returned to life is dead as well.  When it comes to the movie's ending, one can get a little confused.  If one assumes that the bad guy has been defeated in the opening sequence and that the kids have all gotten a great deal of experience, then the kids might think that they are free.  But if one assumes the other way, then they might wonder what went wrong, but then they'll be sad because they thought that they could use their new-found knowledge to take care of their families.  I know how a lot kids are and I know that kids are never going to understand this movie.  They'll never understand the importance of the family unit or the need for personal responsibility.  To this child, watching a movie about the dangers of leaving the "safety" of the neighborhood to move to a different city was a real threat.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I reviewed my previous favorite film, the legendary Jean-Pierre Melville's "Dalton Trains to Nowhere," I was not at all surprised to find that it has not aged a bit. It's still the most exciting and exciting movie I've seen since "Frenzy" (1987) and the most entertaining of the films that I've made in the last two years or so. I've been told of a few similarities to Melville and a few parallels, but it's a good movie, and that should take a lot out of a film critic.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The new Star Trek: The Original Series is a big improvement over the old.   Not only is this more well-thought-out and enjoyable than most of the previous installments, it has a greater sense of style that can be appreciated by all audiences.  The acting is good and the story is good. It is a real shame that this is only an 8-episode season; in the future, when we see new Star Wars films every year, this may well be the series to get the movie series over with.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst thing about this movie is the ending. We see a guy, who could be my dad, sitting in a room, talking to his wife about the old days.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot going on in this one. It's a pretty basic adventure story that doesn't really go anywhere. We don't get to meet all the characters, and you don't really learn anything about the world or the characters either. It makes sense that all the other characters (mostly the guys) are in jail after killing the king. But it's not a very well-paced or engaging movie. It has the kind of "tough-guy" quality you might expect from a Gary Grigsby movie. There is some "action", like a chase through the forest. It was quite entertaining in a way, but the movie just doesn't get much more interesting or interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To quote from the movie: "You're probably thinking this is a good idea. You'd be wrong. This is a terrible idea, that's all there is to it. It's like a scene out of a horror movie that didn't even make it past the first draft of the script. I'm not sure how much this is supposed to be scary, but it's pretty much nothing like the classics it attempts to emulate. This movie isn't supposed to scare the crap out of you. It is supposed be a comedy, and a pretty bad one at that."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an odd, weird movie about an old man and his son who were raised in the house of an old Indian woman.  Apparently they thought the old woman was a witch and that everything went around her head.  Her name was Shami, she used to drink wine from a horn which she placed under the water trough.  When the son was old enough to go to school, he saw the old lady drinking the wine from the horn and thought it was really funny.     It's really kind of funny.  I'm not a fan of old Indian women, but this one's kind of amusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has zero redeeming value whatsoever. It's a "bad movie" written by a man who can barely write a sentence without writing out another one. It just goes on and on and doesn't make any sense. That's not really the way you make a movie. It seems that you could see this movie from the first minute, it's like watching a bad horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To sum up the bad movie review: This movie is a complete waste of time.  And they thought you would be into it too.  It's a terrible story with a bad story with bad acting, an awful plot, an annoying villain and the worst music in history.    Well, that is a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is bad, bad bad! The movie stars Michael Biehn and Kristen Wiig and is a silly mess of stereotypes and jokes that could have been written by a third grader. I hate to say it, but there really is nothing funny about this film. There are two jokes that make the entire movie and one is kind of bad. Other than that there really isn't much in this film other than the two jokes at the beginning and at the end. The jokes at both ends are funny, but it is not the jokes that are really bad, it is the movie's overuse of cheap jokes and lazy special effects. If this movie was bad, why couldn't it use actual jokes that don't revolve around stereotypes and lame jokes?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a horror movie, as a matter of fact it's a horror film in which a guy is decapitated by a large man (the movie title is   like you say, I thought that "Shark" or "Lampshaded" came out of that movie,   ) and there are lots of people walking around that can talk and all that,  but,  it's also a really funny movie and  it shows how people in this world can make a really stupid mistake and end up seriously wounded.   It's also really well directed.  It has a very cool story and a great script and it could be the kind of movie that people would go see without really being a fan of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an unfortunate sequel to an awful movie. The movie was an adaptation of The Black Hole by the late Philip K. Dick. This movie, which follows the story of an astronaut who is sent to Earth to search for a missing alien, is bad, not just because of how boring the movie is. We get the same formula over and over: the alien spaceship, the black hole, the astronaut, the robot that comes to take us to the black holes, and we never get any answers. The black holes are nothing more than a bad, bad movie. They just get bigger and bigger, never ever ending and never bringing anyone back. So why bother trying to figure out what is going on? The last scene of the movie shows a space station that has gone through the blackhole and is headed toward Earth. It never gets close to where we last see it, which means that it has been traveling through the hole for a very long time. This is all to show that the blackholes are not just like the black lines that appear in the sky. The space station passes through the very edge of the black, where it should have never gone. It's hard to believe that the movie could make such a bad sequel. Rating: R
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a disaster from the beginning to the very end. The only reason I watched it is because the director wanted to make his living as a movie director, so he is always out of ideas. It seemed like a cheap attempt to make a horror movie and it wasn't even good enough for a crappy movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a minute I really thought I had read a joke! I had gone to see 'The Crow: Legacy', the follow up to the movie 'The Exorcist' that won the award for "Best Movie of the Year" in 1985 (I didn't even realize that there was a "R" in the movie) but it was much worse. 'Legacy' takes a much different approach than the original and, although the plot is the same as in 'The Demon's head' - it is much more silly and nonsensical - all that it really gets right are the performances by those who originally played the lead roles - which is the only other thing that makes 'LegACY' worth seeing.   I am giving 'Leg Legacy' a D-

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing I really liked about The Last Stand  was that it could've been a lot worse.  It takes place during the Great Depression and has some great action set pieces.   The plot is fairly straightforward, but it takes a very different tone than most of its contemporaries.  This is a film that has a lot to offer but it falls flat with its plot, acting, and cinematography.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My name is Paul, and I am an atheist.   I would like to state for the record at this point that I am not a religious person by any definition of the term, although the words "saved by grace" and "salvation through works" certainly get to the heart of what I am about, though I admit that the first is a bit of a stretch.  I am a non-theist in that my god doesn't exist and neither does he or any higher being.  To be a non, the god of the world does not have to exist.  So I say to anyone who would say that I would be a better atheist than a theist:  That's a really dumb thing to say.  God does not exist. God can't exist. I do believe in a God.  One who is not the God of the universe, but of a different God, the God who is love, who wants us to be good, who loves us so much that he can forgive even the most unforgiving of us.  And that love isn't limited to us: there is a love that exists in all of creation.  If I had to choose between being a good atheist and being a bad theist, I'd much rather be an atheist, because, frankly, I just can't stand having to sit through more of their stupid bullshit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film:  It is not very good:  In fact I would say "very bad" because it is so bad;  It has no real story to it;  The characters and plot are so bad it almost makes you wonder how bad they want it to be.   It tries very hard to be scary but it is not;  If I was an actor I would be out of here;  This will give you nightmares, a nightmare, an absolutely HORRIBLE nightmare;  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be fair, the movie looks fine, has good acting and even some decent plot but the only negative thing I can say about it is that it has no end. The plot is completely pointless and the movie only ends when some of the characters start to commit suicide.  I would have gladly given this a ten on my first watch but after the previous bad movies I didn't expect much from a movie called "Vampire", the rest of the films in the series are terrible too. It's a shame because it had potential but didn't get much screen time and I'd still have enjoyed it more with a better story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would not have thought twice about the premise before reading the trailer:  It's a story about a man who was told by his father that he could never be rich in the USA because of the "American dream" that was so pervasive in American popular culture that it had become an American cliche.  It is about a boy from South America, who has always dreamed of being a singer - but he has to become one in America because they don't allow non-Americans to sing here.  One character talks about how America is no longer a "land of plenty".  The first 20 minutes are pretty good, until a woman says something really stupid and you have to cut out and replay what she says.  I also feel bad that I didn't like the first half of this movie more, since this is a pretty good film.   It didn't make a whole lot of sense to me - maybe the guy in the white hat just got out of a long train ride - and that might have been an opportunity for some more subtlety, but I just didn't care.  As far as I can tell, the film is about some kids that are on a train trip and they all fall in love with each other - but then they all have to go back to the states and leave one of them behind.  This may be another of those movies where you can't really understand what's happening at first because it's so confusing, but eventually it makes sense.  The film has some of the typical '90s cliches like a bunch of weirdos who want to be famous but don't know how to be, and a rich guy that needs to be saved from his problems.  There's a certain amount of truth to this plot, but there's also a lot of nonsense that makes it seem like a Disney movie.  Another problem is that some of these kids just don't have a lot going on - they just don"t have anything interesting to say.  Even with the occasional "WTF" scene it was just too long.  For whatever reason I didn"t care that much about these kids, and I didn'"t even really feel that the story was all that exciting.  Overall, this is basically a bad romantic comedy that I'm not going to be happy watching again, but then again I don't like bad movies, so I probably won't ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, it was pretty bad, even by crappy Hollywood standards.  The plot involves a married couple getting caught in a car accident at a toll booth. While one couple miraculously gets out of the car, the other is trapped. She doesn't think she'll ever see her son again, so she decides to do something about it. The guy, a police officer, is also trapped in the car. And after all is said and done, only the father gets out alive. I like the twist at the end, it's a nice twist and I was actually really happy the film ended on a good note.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really poor film.   It's very sad.  There are a lot of people who should be happy but they can't really be because they aren't having sex. It doesn't matter how much alcohol someone is drinking.  At most times you'll notice someone on the screen saying something but this film never tells us what it means.  I'm not sure if it's a film where they are having sex but then they stop doing it after a while. It's a very sad film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My father-in-law's friend, the great Jim Dineen (who is my own hero), who was a film critic at The Chicago Times, was interviewed on a local show, talking about the film The Last of the Mohicans. Dine the actor was a little thin, and his face looked old and tired. There were two black cowboys, the "Black Kettle" and "Black Mamba". It was a great movie, but it was pretty much a remake of the John Wayne Western The Last Picture Show, with some interesting additions. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a classic piece of exploitation cinema.   The plot is based on a "wedding party" at a resort, and it shows a lot of pretty people being raped and murdered.  The main character, Mr. Blackwood, and his wife are in Florida at the time of the party.  It's all quite tame in retrospect, but a "party" is really just an excuse for two actors to be in ridiculous bikinis, and make sexual and violent suggestions to a little girl.  This is not pornography, but its more of a "bad" movie than "good" at this point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a great movie. Not only is it good, but it is better than I would have expected. The actors are really good (including Billy Zane as the "doctor") and I can't believe it. The plot is not much more than an excuse to show off. If you have been interested in seeing this movie all the way through then you are in for a surprise. There are no bad effects or bad acting, everything is terrific, and everything is so fast that you are always amazed. The "special effect" is wonderful! It is a wonderful film and if you have not yet seen it, you must! And if you are a big fan of horror/sci-fi/adventure movies then don't miss this. You will enjoy it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It seems as though someone tried to be funny about a very serious situation. The whole film was a nightmare, and I can see the movie's producers were attempting to get a laugh on the audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved the movie until the final act. I just never understood how she gets through her "trial," or at least why she feels she has any choice.   It seems like all the "experts" who were talking about this were either crazy or liars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst thing in the world about this movie is how much people love to hate these films. I don't care what anyone else says, there is no justice in a movie made by people who are only in it for the money. These people are the worst, there are no actors, no music, no special effects, there was no script, no ideas, nothing at all. It is not even an original movie, it is just a cheap knock off of a TV movie from years ago. It has no point, it has nothing to add, there have been movies with more to them than this one and I hope that this movie burns in hell with these people. I can't see anything good in this movie, but the worst thing about this awful movie is the actors who are in it. I have already mentioned the horrible acting of all the characters, the actors are just trying to act, not a bad thing in itself, the problem is in their performance. Most of the movies I watch for the acting and/or direction the actors make me feel really bad for the movie, I was so happy when I saw this movie that I found myself smiling. The only good thing is that there are many different people in the movie which I can relate to, and most of them are not that stupid. The other thing that I like about this film is the music, it sounds like it was made just for this movie. It was really cool.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've always liked John Landis. It's just a pity his last two films (A Scanner Darkly & Mumbo Jumbo) have been so bad. These last two attempts to bring his character to life were so bad that they made me wish he'd never made such movies to begin with.  "My Mummy" was a mess.  "A Scannor Darkly" was also a mess, just more of the same.    I'm not sure if this film is going to get a sequel, but what a shame. It would have been funny to see Landis playing some kind of vampire - he has the voice for it! But it's just too bad this is another terrible, over-the-top, overpaid, overrated and, again, overworked film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the best B movies ever made. I mean that literally. It doesn't go out of its way to be funny, or good, or anything, it just takes its seriously. It has a huge cast, and the actors (especially the director) are great. The plot is not that complicated, but what is hard to understand is why so many people (mainly poor people) think so stupidly. Also, I like all the other characters in the movie. Even the bad ones. And the "villains" are just normal people. A lot of good people get killed by the good characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an odd movie. It is a love story with a bad ending. I never thought a movie could be worse than a book, but this is one of the worst ever. My girlfriend was so excited about watching this movie that she wanted to sleep in the theater. When it ended we went to watch the next movie which was The Thing from Outer Space. I don't really remember anything about this movie, but I remember the bad ending which was made to appear very exciting at the end. We didn't like that. There is also a scene with a giant robot that was just a cheap idea and could have been done with a lot better. I recommend watching this in the car, where everyone can laugh at it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never even read the comic (which, at this point, isn't really a good thing), and it was too bad it didn't make me buy a ticket.   It's not that I don't like this movie; I've watched the trailers and the trailers alone made me want to see this, and I'm not even really sure what it is about. It's about a man who discovers an ancient Egyptian mummified to death in the basement of his old apartment complex. The mummification, it turns out, is an act of a vampire, who was trying to get a little of his DNA into his living family. I was all set for a vampire movie, but a vampire is not a good look in a man in a suit walking around in New York City with an entourage.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the biggest thing that makes this film bad is that it is a horrible bad movie, but the story line, the acting and the acting are not bad at all. The acting can be good or bad, but they really shouldn't be. It is a low budget, no-talent movie. There isn't a word in the script that you can't guess what is going to happen or what is actually happening. As you can see in the reviews, the movie was shot in the early 60's. The actor playing the bad guy is supposed to look like he is wearing a red, white, and blue flannel shirt and some kind of hat. I couldn't get a clear shot of that guy's face because he was completely covered with hair. The bad guy really does look like a bad guy. The movie is set on a train. I don't think anybody thought up the idea to make a bad train movie. The script is about a woman who has a baby in the back seat of a train that she is driving. The baby gets into the train and the baby doesn't have any umbilical cord. The train starts moving and the little baby starts crying and the lady looks to see where it is coming from and it's a bad omen. I wish I had a picture to show you of the movie because you can imagine it and this is a bad script. This movie is so bad that you really have to be a child to think it is worth $10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A "miserable" movie about a man that has a wife and a child that he leaves behind. The wife is not exactly a nice lady but she did have a very nice laugh at the time the movie was over.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So this is an interesting little horror movie. It features some really creepy stuff, as well as a really weird storyline. But I don't find a whole lot to like about it. It's pretty silly, and it's really cheap. But it did get me to look at some classic old horror movies that were pretty good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're a movie buff who likes your films to be entertaining and with a smile, then, like your hero, your hero is too good to be true. What makes it worse is that there's nothing funny in it. At least one of the actors in the film, Dwayne Johnson, is a good actor. But he's not the bad actor that his name is in the title of his movie. His best roles are playing the goofy guy that doesn't understand the situation and the dumb jock who gets the girl. This film has almost no charm in it, and has no character development. As long as there's a good movie in the theaters then, of course, this film should be able to get a release. Unfortunately, it's just a movie that's nothing more than the worst movie of 2016. Watch it. Just don't expect much from this film. It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and you're better off not watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was thoroughly disappointed by this movie, but it's a pretty bad movie, anyway.  A bunch of people (a couple who are playing the part of characters from a movie, including the one who is not wearing a mask; a couple who look like the "baddies" in The Sandlot; a guy who is looking more like a guy with a bowler; and a man in a fishnet-type outfit who appears to be in the movie is all in a room, a very empty room, and they decide to play a game of checkers, as an afterthought, without actually doing anything, for no other reason than to be able to say something about checkers.  The first game involves the four of them in checkers playing a game based on chess.  That game is about as boring and meaningless as the movie gets; two players play three, four, and five moves each round, until they are all "dead," as they have already lost the game.  Next, they play a checkers game called "fancy pants," which is not a word; one person takes the entire board and plays checkers on it with one hand, using the other hand to hold a small toy rabbit's head that appears to do nothing but bounce around, making a high-pitched squeal as the player tries to knock it around the board.  Finally, they all play two games of checker: one game is called "bunny hop," in which they race across the board trying to get a piece, which is just a little piece with a hole in it (like a tiny ping pong ball) and another game is what they called "a big game"; in this game, the goal is to get two of the four other pieces on the board while the third piece is in the hole, and also to win more pieces while the other two pieces (each of which is the size of a baseball) fall off the board, trying to find their way back to the hole.  I would have given the movie a C or even a B+ if not for the part where, once the four games are finished, they finally meet up with the "fairy," the guy who has come to their house to tell them to get in the "little house."  The fairy wants to take them to his castle, which apparently is on some magical island.  Apparently the movie decided to throw a "happy" ending at them; apparently
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A "bad movie" is a movie that makes you stop breathing and think about why it's a bad film.   It's one of those weird "bad movies" where they are trying to appeal to the same people that want to see them.  The premise sounds like it's written by a 13 year old kid.  But who is this kid?   When people complain about "bad" movies (like I don't even see it as bad) it means they are tired of seeing the same old thing week after week.  At least in this case, it is a new concept that is hard to grasp.  A boy is in a circus that is the last place this kid would ever think of going.  It sounds ridiculous but after seeing it you can't help but to laugh out loud.  When he gets off the ship he discovers that his circus has been turned into a freak show.  They have a monkey that jumps and talks like the circus is in his mind but he also talks like an adult, walks like an old man and talks and talks.  I feel like I'm trapped in a kid's dream.  This is one that will get you to laugh, cry, feel sorry and want to watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no plot and there are none of the entertaining scenes found in the movie adaptation of "I've Got Your Number". This is just a cheap cash grab. It's so silly that the whole thing gets more and more ridiculous as you watch it. For example, there is a woman in a white dress talking to a man dressed in a red dress. She is wearing a white suit and red shoes and is holding a glass in her hand. Then she is dressed in the red dress and has a red coat around her. And then the guy who is talking to the woman (in the red suit) is wearing the red jacket and the woman with the glass in the white suit is holding the glass upside down with her right hand. The next thing we see is a guy in a black suit talking to some people in a room. The guy in the black suit is in a blue suit with a black hat on. There is also a guy dressed like a bird talking to people. Then we see the guy in white suit (in a blue outfit) wearing a blue hat and holding a bird in his left hand. And the woman in the pink dress talks to a guy who looks like a fish in a suit. I know that I'm going to enjoy this movie for nothing but the stupidity, but it's still funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing to say about the movie is that it is very weak and very short. It is very short considering that we have to do about half the movie in one sitting. So it is even worse when you compare it with the last two times I have seen it. It doesn't have any humor. It feels like a very silly movie which may amuse kids but the adults will not get much out of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this is not a good movie at all.  In fact, I have never seen a movie that is so bad that I would hate the actors and also hate the director. I really don't understand how he has the gall to try to tell a story about people who are too stupid to know how stupid they are.  The only good thing about this movie is that all the different characters are very interesting, even the bad ones.  Overall, I really didn't like this movie at any level. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a great idea for a movie. If only it didn't get ruined by terrible acting. It's pretty bad, I thought it was going to be an action movie about the guys who get in a fight with the bad guys in an alley, only the guys fighting are the ones who look and act the part! That is why we all see the movie with a blank look on our faces. There is only one scene in the movie that wasn't bad and is a bit of a "what-if" with the guys acting and the film actually being good. Other than that, pretty bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not terrible by any means, it just has a few problems:  1. The movie feels dated 2. The action scenes are poorly choreographed 3. The characters are uninspired 4. The script is bland and uninspired   And now that we're almost halfway through the run time, let's talk about the ending:  This ending is a bit anticlimactic.   After several hours of running and fighting and having some very cool scenes, you can see why this movie is set after the end of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and why it's set at the height of the First World War.  But really, it's a bit of a shame that so little time is devoted to anything like the Fellowship.  There's a lot of fun to be had in this movie (and a lot more to come).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie started with the camera panning across a beautiful city scene. A man gets out of his car, walking down the street and looks for a cab. He's in a bad mood and a couple of guys are following him, laughing. But then, suddenly, a car blows past him, so it turns out to be a nice day for an attack on a cab driver. There's a bunch of people who don't seem to appreciate the fact that the driver can't fight back. He pulls up next to a big SUV with its doors open and three guys in suits jump out, grab the driver, and tie him up to the back of the SUV. They open the back doors, and a big black dog runs out of the trunk. He runs off and when the SUV starts to drive away, one of the guys shoots the dog through the side of the windshield. A couple of the men run into the SUV, grab it and run. This movie has all the makings of a comedy film (the ending, the opening sequence, the chase), but it's just too goofy. I wouldn't even have been interested in seeing this movie until I saw the trailer. It's like the makers have just done a bunch scenes from this movie, then just sped them up in editing. It gets even weirder when they cut out all the dialogue (except for the dog's barking), because when the dog comes back in the movie, he just keeps barking!   I've seen other bad comedies and seen better ones. I've also seen much worse comedies. But this is one of those movies that's really terrible. It reminds me a lot of the "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" movie that's featured in the comedy sections of a lot TV guide programs. This is a movie that has to have been made to amuse a bunch "sophisticated" movie watchers and, if they had actually seen the movie before giving it an rating, they would have given a rating that would have been more accurate. This should be a comedy movie for those who like "wackiness".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really interested in this movie, but as soon as it started I was left thinking "How am I going to get out of this thing alive?" Well, that's how. This is a short film that is so cheesy it's good. The story is really bad, but it's so cheesy that it's hilarious. The dialogue is great, and there's always a laugh to be had! My only real complaint is that the ending is such a lame, contrived and stupid way to end it all. It would have been better if it ended with a "what the hell, I'll see you next time" like all cheesy movies. I would definitely recommend this for the fans of the original, or anyone that doesn't want a bad laugh.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was like watching a movie starring a young Tom Cruise. The "bad" movie was not bad, really, and we were all in heaven during this one.  The story was not so bad, in the usual "man in a box" style; the main guy was a loser and his ex-wife had a heart attack and died in front of him, and he was trying to win her back. There was no romance in the plot, but at least the guy was not an alcoholic. The acting was bad, except for the first few minutes, which were great. This was fun, and it was one of those old-timey movies where you would love to watch it again. It could be made much better, although it would have to take place in the 1980s or 1990s. But it is still a good little movie, and you might even learn a bit about the character that had a box and a heart, and that is quite enough.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never knew there were so many weird and wonderful movies coming out around Halloween.   They must be getting all the publicity.  This is a scary, fun movie that is definitely not worth $7.00, but is absolutely worth the wait. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part about this movie was that there was no nudity on screen, no explicit sex scenes, no "clothing optional" area to get "perverted," or maybe just "sexy." It was a bunch of dudes, hanging out in the woods and having some fun. The story is a pretty classic urban legend, a guy named Bill and his friend, Gary, have a "crazy" idea about going into the woods, get killed in the process, then use the bodies to make fun of their neighbors. They live at the end of a long dirt road in a small town and all of the kids go to school there. And that's about it. This movie is an urban legend that you can tell because the guy playing Bill doesn't have any lines and even the town clerk tells them the story right off the bat. It's a classic, a lot of fun that's worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To anyone who's ever seen this film, it's a terrible one. There's one particularly horrible moment where a police officer is about to shoot a couple of people for walking down the street and a cop car goes by and a man just walks down the path and they run at him for a good 20 feet and then when the cops are about to fire they all just turn around and run in the other direction. It is truly a sad movie to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was one of my least favorite movies as a kid.  I'm a sucker for anything with a big monster, and this movie had that in spades.    I mean, the whole movie is about giant creatures living in a mountain.  It's all very cool and a lot of fun.  The biggest problem with this movie is that  there was no way to tell that the people you were seeing were creatures.  The creatures are all the same, and they look kinda like  humans from the back.  There is just one giant creature that moves around all over the place, and the only other creature I think you see is an alien that is  not  a "thing" or any sort of "creature" that we would recognize (although he might have been the main "character" in the film).   For this movie, I would have loved to have seen a little bit more creature play.  If you have seen any of the Godzilla movies (Kong, G-Man, Godzilla vs. Megalon, etc.), you will recognize a lot more monster types than what is in this movie.  In the next two movies (Godzilla vs. Destoroyah and Godzilla vs Hedorah, it gets a lot better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film of the '80s which is as dumb as its title. If this film has a point then it's that there should be a law against using a camera to show an adult movie. This is a very simple idea that doesn't get any better than this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A man named John F. Kennedy was elected to the U.S. presidency in 1960.  President Kennedy was the consummate statesman and had a wonderful relationship with American families in general.  He was also a man who was very passionate about American football.  Unfortunately in 1960, the game became too violent and players were getting hit with bats and fists by opposing fans.  At the time there were many other American sports to choose from; boxing, football, and basketball were all popular, and while football was great, it was a bit too rough for most children.  There were also many violent things that took place in the world of American football, particularly the hit on John F Kennedy.  President Kennedy was a beloved figure in America.  His first term in office was also well remembered.  This movie was made in 1961.  Kennedy had already run for president four years earlier and was again running for a fourth term in the White House.  It was widely known that Kennedy was going to run for another term.  The election was close, and both Kennedy and challenger, Vice President Johnson were the target of most of the negative campaign rhetoric.  Johnson had run an effective campaign, and there was no doubt that Kennedy would be defeated.  Some of the film depicts a rally of supporters in the days before the election.  One woman is seen with a campaign button that is inscribed with a very negative message: "We Want Kennedy Gone."  This film shows the campaign.  On November 7, 1960, Kennedy beat Lyndon Johnson to win the presidency.   There was no violence seen on the campaign trail.  John F Kennedys was a great politician, and we should be grateful that he lived in a country where it was not necessary to commit such acts of violence in order to win an election.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I haven't seen this movie in a long time, and it hasn't aged very well. The story is about an overweight guy that tries to lose weight by eating nothing but fast food. He decides to take up "The Biggest Loser" as his hobby, and eventually fails to make a dent in his weight. But the movie is pretty much a mess, and there is absolutely nothing entertaining about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   . The only thing that is a great thing about this movie is that it's so bad, that you want it to be good.   The movie is basically a re-hash of other movies.  There is no reason to watch this film unless you hate movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The entire thing was a farce. It was very poorly done with an obvious "to make a crowd of people come" plot. I couldn't care less about the story and the main characters. The entire movie just makes you laugh hysterically. The dialogue was awful and not good enough to make a movie. I don't know anything about the movie or its directors or writers. It seems like they were just out to make something entertaining so they couldn't give a shit about what was going on in the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of this movie is bad, but its funny!  The movie is a parody of a bad action movie, and I am surprised that it turned out so good (not that the first 20 minutes were bad).  It is an interesting idea, and there are quite a few surprises to be had in the end.  This is a "Wes Craven movie." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the best and worst thing I have seen since  .. the worst movie   I saw was      - the rest is the same.   "I am one who goes on walking long."   And the end credits rolled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In this film, John Travolta plays a fictionalized version of himself as a cop. The movie has all of the hallmarks of Travietta's later work - an overabundance of plot, a thin plot, and an over-exploited, overused main character. It is all so predictable that the only interesting thing about the film is the fact that John T. was given the opportunity to play such an obvious caricature of himself.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am really bad at movies (not that I am great at movies).  However, I do like this one.  This movie takes place in the early 1960's.  (   )    The film follows a bunch of guys who are all involved in drugs, and drinking.   We first see a guy called The Doctor (played by David Hasselhoff).   This is the lead character of this movie.  In the course of the movie, we see him taking acid, going to see a psychiatrist, having an accident, and then...   ( This is what we call a "chase scene" )  ( I am just showing you some "action" ) ( This doesn't include the time where the doctor is being chased by a car! )  The scene above is the chase scene.  Here is the movie description: The Doctor and his companion are out for a late night ride in a car when a stranger in a blue convertible pulls up beside them.  The Doctor gets out and the stranger asks him how he feels.  He says that he is feeling like a young man again...  (I guess when the doctor says " I am feeling like " he means young as a child)   And the stranger gets back into the car, and leaves.  One thing about "The Doctor": He is a wonderful actor.  So that's a good start...    I was disappointed that I didn't get to see more of The Doctor.  I guess that is the point of this film: If you don't want to know who the doctor's name is, then that is really the least of your problems.  For everyone else, I really hope that there is a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing this movie had going for it was its title,  but it was not enough to save this film from its dullness. The film follows the story of a young man (Anthony Michael Hall) who accidentally kills his girlfriend while on a trip in the mountains,  And her mother (Holly Hunter) who has moved to the city to be closer to her son.  She soon discovers a mysterious book (The Book of the Dead)  that has been written by a man who is about her age and who had also once been on a tragic trip through the mountains. The book contains a description of the final journey of a deceased man, and when the book is read aloud by the book-worm, a young woman (Susan Sarandon) who is also in search of a mysterious man begins to see things that aren't real.  The final section is devoted to Sarandon's search, in which she finds her long lost mother at the old cabin of the man in the book (played by Kevin McCarthy) and her mother and lover (Tony Todd) are now trapped in a dangerous predicament.  This is not a good film because it is not good enough to be good (much less to be truly good).  The film also is not very good because Anthony Michael Hall is not nearly good enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not seen this movie in over a year!   This movie is not a movie, it is a cult.   The movie is a "spiritual" movie about a woman who has been "called" by the angels to be with a man she is not attracted to.       It is not even a good movie, but that doesn't stop people from watching it because its cheap, cheesy and terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this movie was pretty bad, but I thought it was a pretty bad movie. It's hard to know when to be glad, sad, angry or sadder. It does its best to be everything but what it wants to be. It could have been funny, but there's only so much funny you can do before it starts to get too long and repetitive. The film's final moments are the lowest point of the film and, despite a lot of talent behind the scenes, there's no sense of achievement in the end.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My mom, a very nice woman, was an avid fan of Star Wars. She was also a lifelong fan of "The Godfather" (she even had the poster with the portrait of Marlon Brando on it, and she would always tell me how funny and cool it was).  As a child, in the late 1970s, she and her mother would frequently visit Grandma Mary, in Connecticut, where they would go out to restaurants and other places we kids wouldn't normally go. Grandma would also often bring me along, and I would sit on the floor with her and try to imitate Marlon's accent.  My favorite scene in the movie was at the beginning, when Marlon and the rest of the mob get on the plane and take off.  Grandma is getting on the telephone and, as Marlon is saying "I need a cab," she yells out, "Where are the men?" Marlon tells her that the men have already left, but Grandma doesn't believe him. She tells Marlon to put his money in the handrail to keep the cab going, and Marlon does.  When the plane takes off, Grandma can be heard telling the cab driver to stay by the door. He is afraid to turn around in case he could be seen, and tries to get the women to call him a cab on the phone.  The taxi driver gets on the cab, and we see a little boy in the rearview mirror.  He has two little girls in the back seat. He takes off the little girls' dresses, and takes out his little black and white striped pistol.  As the taxi is speeding away, Grandpa picks up the phone, saying something to the driver and then says to the little boy, "Stop! He's got a gun!" The little boy pulls the little girl out of the window, puts the gun in her mouth and tells her to hold on.  It's not a good scene, but it shows that this is the "Godfather" that we are used to watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As a person who has seen and loved many bad movies, I have to agree with the fact that The Last Starfighter is one of the worst science fiction movies I've ever seen, period. From the ridiculous premise to the bad acting, to the fact it was all shot on video and the plot is basically about a space jockey from the future flying around the galaxy and destroying his enemies.   But, I guess you can't have a bad space movie if it has all that other stuff you find in any action-packed film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a big, bad movie.  For a long while I thought it was a really good film but, to a large extent, it isn't.    It's boring as hell, with a lot of boring dialogue, a lot less interesting characters, and it doesn't make up for it with its story.  It doesn't even seem to be well written - it's mostly just a bunch of dialogue.  I'm not sure why someone who doesn't want to be a scientist would be a rocket scientist.  How could anyone be a writer who doesn a PhD in rocket science?  I would think that a rocket was a rather important part of the space program that you really shouldn't be able to get into with a PhD.  Anyway, if you are going to make a movie about a buncha dumb people who are supposed to be scientists in the middle of the desert, you don't do a good job at telling a story about the story.      The story is really not very good.  Even though the whole movie takes place in the desert during the spring, it has a lot more of a feel of spring and summer time.  There is a lot going on, but it really doesn't feel like there is any one cohesive story line.  One would imagine that when you spend five and a half hours in a boring and empty desert, it would be pretty much impossible to tell a story.    There are just too many random events and the story line is so convoluted that it seems to be all made up of little jokes.  For example, when it's cold out, he plays a music that sounds like that annoying guy from DuckDuckGo: http://youtube.com/watch?v=H0r2_yfk4Jw.     I'm sure that I don't have to explain how it's stupid to have characters that are literally all named after things that make people look stupid.  I think this is the only scene in the movie where one of the characters would ever speak the word 'dork'.  As soon as I saw the title of the movie, I knew this was going to be terrible and boring.  This is a movie that you get bored of after about five minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole plot is stupid. The film tries too hard to be dramatic and has a lot of characters that are completely devoid of any personalities and, at worst, they seem like someone's pet. I just didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first part of the movie is a little annoying. There were several bad choices to start the movie. We had to see a big explosion at the end of the last film? We saw a black guy dressed like an Indian get killed. There was an Indian man dressed like a white guy and then a black man dressed as an Indian and then there was an African American who killed white guys and a white man who tried to kill all the people in the film. And then we see an Indian woman who is dressed like Indian.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The problem with this movie is that if you take the easy way out then it is a good movie; but if you are a fan of the classic comic book then it falls flat; there were some pretty good moments and it was still entertaining as hell as it goes along. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie. I was not expecting much from this film.   It had a bit of a heavy hand.  It went from being a comedy to being a drama.  I expected the film to be funny.  As it turned out I was more entertained.  The lead character is a cop and he must learn a lesson about his ethics.  What happened was not unexpected.  But when he told his partner in the police station to get him a beer he got the worst of it.  He was slapped around like a naughty boy.  And he was also told to clean the car by doing the dishes.  They had a drink and the policeman then told the girl to come out to see how he did.  She said "I'm pregnant."  She was so angry when she saw him like that she broke the window, threw some paper towels at his head and punched him.  That made him so angry he punched the girl instead.  Now they are both in jail together.  Oh, and a lot of things were said and done that were not nice.  This was a light hearted film with a strong character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just horrible in every way. It's supposed to be about a schoolgirl who is so shy that when a handsome guy (played by Michael Mann) walks in, she literally jumps out of her seat. And then she tells him to go back to his car - he gets there and just stares at her. And we're supposed to take this seriously. Why, because she's just acting normal? What about her social skills? Or her knowledge of the world? This is the worst movie ever made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first hour of this movie is just an extended version of a movie that already has been shown many times over.  The only real innovation that the filmmakers have done is changing a couple of the characters around, which makes them seem like more than they are.  There is nothing original about this movie, and it could easily be described as a cheapo horror movie about a few kids who get killed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible, I thought it was funny because it was like the people on that show, but not funny at all. It was just boring, and I hope it gets a sequel!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only problem is that the movie doesn't have a good ending. If you don't remember this, just read the summary. A bunch of high school seniors make a trip to see a rock concert that's cancelled. When they are unable to find anyone who knows who played the concert, they become bored and decide to go to a bar. They walk through a dark alley with a huge sign advertising a rock show. Suddenly one of the guys drops a dime on a table in the middle of the room. Then all the girls suddenly show up with rockin' hair and a guitar. They dance around and start rocking and roll. One of the girls gets on the stage and starts playing a song by a guitar player who is singing about two girls who can't get together. The girl playing the song is a high school teacher. The show ends with the guys being chased by a bunch of girls and a teacher.   I was really annoyed that after that first movie the show was stopped. It was so long that I thought there would be a sequel. I was disappointed with how they ended this story. I wasn't a fan of the music or the girl's hair. I'm not a huge fan of a teacher in this movie either. The only good thing about it is that it was funny in parts and it shows how these high school kids were out of their minds for a rock-n-roll show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In general this movie is crap.  The acting is bad and the story is even worse.  All the guys talk about women being dumb and fat.  And the guy who is supposed to be stupid just walks around with the dumbest woman in the movie!  It makes me want to throw up.  There are lots of funny lines in this movie.  I liked the guy's wife's line: "I'm going to tell you a joke, but it's not a good joke."  My favorite line was the one about how dumb the lady is.  My daughter was very annoyed.  Why don't you think the movie has a good ending?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a lot of good and bad about the movie, most of it not really great but it's okay. The actors all do a great job and the plot works well. It's got a nice balance between a story about a little boy and a bad guy and the child's story is great.   I don't like the character of the mother, although she was pretty sweet and cute in the movie.  There's not a lot to like about the film, it's not bad but it seems to be one of the worst movies ever put out by Hollywood. If you're a fan of horror, you should watch it just to see what all the hype is about. I like to hate this movie, but I'm glad I didn't have to see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not worth my time.  It is too bad that after the failure of the remake of "Jaws" the producers couldn't get the original filmmakers on board, not even "A" director Steven Spielberg.  The movie starts with an all-too-familiar sequence showing a shark trying to eat a fishing boat.  What happens next is not at all familiar.  A shark comes out of a boat and eats a dog.  How are these people even filming a movie that has such a bad plot?  It is not the worst shark movie but it is pretty bad and there is little suspense to the movie other than the shark coming out of the water at an inconvenient time. The movie is an exercise in bad acting from the characters, especially the shark.    The acting is so bad that one suspects the filmmakers used actors with plastic cams.  It seems that if a shark eats a small dog, a crew of four people can't film a bad shark movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason why i like a movie about a man who gets murdered by a man (who is just trying to save his wife and her daughter who are abducted) by a girl who was just trying her best to kill her. The main problem is that the director (who was a really talented guy) had a lot of things that were very stupid and really ugly. I mean the acting in the movie was really bad (it looked like the director was trying to make a pretty picture of a scene that was actually really stupid). I just couldnt watch the movie. I dont think the movie is worth the money to spend on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not sure who is more ashamed, the film-makers or the studio that made it. This movie could have been a real classic, but for some reason they never seem to be able to stay with a single film. Maybe because the director doesn't like to work with other people, I don't know, he's a genius when it comes to creating the illusion. The acting is average at best. The music is OK, nothing special. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie doesn't give a flying F! to anyone. In fact, it doesn't seem to bother anyone. I'll give a shot to the man in the white coat at the end and he is a terrible, terrible excuse for an actor. You never hear him talk, and he's not a likable, likable fellow. It's all so contrived.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, it's not going to get any better.  The ending is cheesy and the plot doesn't go anywhere and the acting is atrocious and the special effects are so bad (to be honest, all I really remember of the special effect is "oh man, what kind of a monster made a house look so weird!").  I was so bored by it that I missed the credits to the final movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The film features lots of "what the hell" moments. They include:    a) a large boulder comes crashing through a window and falls onto the head of the actor playing the character that falls from the plane during a bad scene (this is one I don't mind watching);   b) two men are fighting to get a big truck stuck in ice;   c) a very drunk man shows up at an "inappropriate" party;   d) a man is killed in a plane crash and his widow is so distraught at this that she is unable to be on her way to see her husband's grave until the next day;   e) a plane crashes and the passengers are killed.  Not to be outdone by the other films they are released in this season of "the worst of the worst", this is the worst of them all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst I can remember. The script was so bad, its so bad it doesn't qualify as a movie. I mean what the hell was this made for? They made an excuse to have an idiot like the late Fred Savage and his retarded friend "Duke" (yes, this is his real name) walk through a wall and through a window and into a field of cornstalks. If that's not a lousy excuse to act in a movie, I don't know what is. I am glad I didn't see this, as it's been a long time since I watched a movie that was made solely for the purpose of showing a lame, bad movie to the world. It's just so bad. The worst movie I can imagine, which isn't very good either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not much for gore, but this movie was definitely gruesome!   A friend of mine is a medical professional, and has seen a few of these movies.

I don't know if that kid had a girlfriend. The movie had lots of weird and wonderful details to add to a movie. It would make a great movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my humble opinion, this is one of the worst films I have seen. The acting, the plot, the acting and the plot. To put it in its simplest terms, it is just a poor rehash of a classic. I have never seen this movie, but based on this review, I would not put it on my shelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The thing that bothered me the most about this movie is that it was directed by two of the worst filmmakers out there. The first one is a terrible guy. He never does anything that makes sense, which is always a problem with him. But here, I feel like he was playing with a box full of old toys and he didn't care if they exploded and did a lot of other stupid things that make no sense. What is it supposed to mean that we're going to the future where we're all in big ships and robots and stuff that's going to look like something out of Star Wars? And the main character, the little boy, is never anything that interesting. When I saw the trailer for it, I was pretty sure he was going to be the main thing and I thought it was going be a little different, but then I realized that he was only a child playing a child pretending to be an adult. When he says that he's going there to save the dinosaurs, he's not actually going to stop the asteroid that is going to crash into Earth; he's just going to get in a big boat and go to a different planet and take his dinosaurs there and then he's gonna come back because the asteroid is now so big that Earth is just going fly away. So when he gets there, he just sees some robots that look like dinosaurs that are moving around. He doesn't care, because he's a child who doesn't know what he's doing and he doesn't want to change. The movie is terrible, the story is terrible and the characters are terrible. It's a mess, but I like it when I am in a bad mess.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very boring, uninteresting, and even anti-social movie.   It's a tale of the "bad boys" who stole a $10,000 gold Rolex from a man named Mr. Stump who kept it hidden out of public sight.  This movie is the kind of movie that we've all seen a million times before, and it's no different in the sense that it's a boring, anti-climatic, and "not funny at all".   I actually watched this movie about 3 times after it aired because it was the perfect way to waste an afternoon.  In the end, it ended up as nothing more than a tired, clichéd, "look at these stupid villains", "look how clever they are", "why did they bother to dress up for this movie", and "there goes another loser" movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a scene where she is looking at a magazine, and the picture on the cover is of a girl with her legs spread wide open.  The magazine says "The Best Of Lesbian Action And Romance"  (I wonder who it is she's looking at.)  But it makes it clear that this magazine is full of images of naked women.    It is interesting that there is so little explicit lesbian action in this film.  I think that the title "Blonde Bombshell " is pretty suggestive, and a lot of lesbian moviegoers would certainly like to read some of the "Blond Bombshell" magazine.   Another film about women who take drugs: I've always found it difficult to believe that a drug addict would be a "blonde bombshell".  Well, this movie does show us that a woman can take a lot more than just drugs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are one of those people who hates horror movies... This is not a horror movie at all. It is a bizarre, hilarious, surreal comedy that is a perfect balance between horror and comedy. It's very strange and disturbing...I found this film very disturbing but it never made me feel like I was going to vomit from fear. I would recommend this to a friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well now, I've seen "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and I don't think I could give it a higher rating.   Director Sergio Leone is an incredibly talented director.  He loves to shoot fast, his movies are violent and exciting but not at all predictable.  Sergio Leone isn't just a director, he is also a storyteller.  The story of "The Bad, the Uglily" centers around the relationship between two brothers, the lead character named Vittorio and his partner in crime named Sergio.  For some reason Sergio and Vittori are constantly fighting each other.  They have a rivalry going on that seems to have no end.  This rivalry is not all about a few bad apples that are not liked by any one, it's a conflict that affects both of the characters.  After a few hours of watching "The Ugly", I came away very confused.  I've heard that this movie was supposed to be a remake of a classic film called "The Black Stallion" but that was never the case.  There are some similarities but it's definitely not the same.  It's a little confusing that there is no real explanation of why these two men are fighting but the end result is that it gives you a good insight into a feud and the people involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is ridiculous but it is ridiculous in a funny way. This movie was based on a comic strip called "Punky's Day Out" which is now only available as a DVD. It was made in 1973. The only other comedy I can think of is the short film from 1967 that shows a boy who steals a car but ends up being chased by a dog. Well, this movie was even more ridiculous. The plot follows Punky and his friends as they have an adventure in which they meet a bunch of people on a hot dog stand and become friends with them. Of course, this isn't even funny. The movie has some nice songs, but nothing memorable. It is a good watch, but if you are looking for a funny movie with a hotdog theme, this is not it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you haven't seen this one yet, you should.  It has everything: a great performance, great story, amazing special effects, and a great ending that is quite disturbing.   There are lots of action scenes and plenty of bloody action with plenty of nudity, but the story is good and the effects are great.  This movie is one of those movies you will never see without the soundtrack!   I highly recommend this film:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a horrible, horrible movie, and I mean that in every sense of the word.  The bad guys are not good at their jobs, but we'll get into that later.  Let's talk about the setting... the plot is predictable as hell.  This is the same movie that started out with a little girl who was attacked by a clown, which of course led to a whole bunch of clown-related shenanigans.  I think it's the same writer who wrote the last clown movie and the next movie had a little boy who was eaten by a shark.  We'll just call it a wrap.  It's a stupid movie, made by another stupid, stupid guy.  Good luck trying to put a dent in this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The third film in this series has a couple of problems that are very bad.   This is probably the most stupid movie I've ever seen.  It is not the movie I'd call fun or silly.  When you're having a bad trip it is hard to find a good movie to laugh at, so I'm glad I saw this at least once before I ended up like this.  I didn't see it when it first came out.  This was only on TV as it was originally released, so my memory of it isn't great, but I remember it being a good comedy.  The whole cast is pretty good, with the exception of some of the actresses, and I also remember some of them were in my high school play.  If this is the first time you are watching this movie, please take my advice: Don't.  At this point it is almost as silly as I expected.  Sick in the head, so to speak.  And the best line of the movie: "Look! What the hell you done?"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like a good movie that has the feel of a 1980's horror, then you must see "The Evil Dead". This movie features the legendary Ash Williams as the "Evil Dead" Ash Williams! The Evil Dead is the film that inspired the remake of the film by Sam Raimi. The Evil dead has been in the theaters for 25 years!  A lot of people know that Ash Williams is not an actor, he is a zombie that is possessed by evil spirits. He doesn't talk and when he does it is bad news, he will turn into an insane and violent monster! He is chased by two men who are searching for the cure for the evil. When the two men come upon the "evil" they get caught in an explosion that sends them to another dimension. This is where the "villain" of the movie is: the evil spirit that inhabits Ash! After the men have left the evil takes control and becomes possessed by Ash. Ash is not afraid to show how he feels and his actions are always selfless. He is willing to do anything that is required to defeat the evil that possessed him. The movie ends with the characters escaping back to the real world and the evil Ash Williams finally leaving the theater.  The EvilDead was a movie that was good in the 1980's and it is still good today.  It has an awesome "80's" feel about it and it also has an excellent cast that included Bruce Campbell who plays Ash Williams, Sam Rami as John Proctor, and Dana Ashbrook who plays Candy.    I am not one to watch horror movies but this is a good one with a good cast and a nice style.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I have ever seen.   This movie starts out slow...    I'm sure anyone who saw the first movie knows it is not a happy ending.  The movie was boring and it was predictable. The first time we see the little boy, he's been killed by a boombox and no one has heard from him since.  He had been in a coma for a year and we see him getting dressed in a hospital.  This was the movie you had to see to get the sequel.  It had a great storyline, but I am not sure that it was even possible to pull off.  One of the bad things about this movie is that there was no "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" on the big screen.  If you want a movie about a boy who gets lost in a movie theater then try "Tron: Legacy"  This is just not that great and that's not a bad thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just too much like an early Twilight Zone episode.  At one point a scientist is performing a test on a child, when the child suddenly goes off the edge.   It's all there for the taking, but it just feels like a cheap exploitation flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're anything like me, then this one will leave you with an unpleasant aftertaste as you wonder just how much of a "show" it was. This was the fourth film in the long running series that features the same cast of characters (all with similar names), each with a distinctive voice. I've never thought of the series as anything but a bunch of goofy, cheesy, over the top nonsense, but it's been a long time since I've seen a film this bad. At least it didn't have any blood. In the film, Jack (who is obviously an idiot) is sent to kill a man named Tuck (another idiotic character who has the same voice as the three others). This is all set up with the usual "one-eyed" man saying that Tuck stole a car and running into a field, then the camera pulls out to show Tuck's body with the dead man's head stuck on it and we see Jack talking to himself about how he wants to get into Tuck, then we cut back to the farmhouse and we are now in the living room where Jack (the one that lives alone in the barn) has some sort of dream about a girl. He then tries to run away while a man with glasses starts yelling at him, the camera then starts moving back to Tuck and we then see Tuck with the head of a dead man on his chest. And then the title of the film is said. In the film it just goes on about this guy who is a coward and a fool (forgetting that he was always the idiot in the group), while the rest of us live a pretty boring and normal life. The actors had absolutely no idea what they were doing and it was just terrible. You'd think that a group of people who spend all their time in silly hats and playing "the game" would have learned how to do a little acting in a long, long time. This film is just a bad joke, and it's sad because it was made by people who supposedly are "good" with their feet.  I gave this film a B. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a disaster.   While all the characters are different, all the personalities are the same.  One minute they are talking about how good a movie it is, and the next it's a mess.  I was laughing while waiting for the end of the movie, but to no avail.  The pacing is really bad, but the plot is so silly it's almost believable.  If you've got some good old fashioned American humor, you won't be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is terrible! My wife and I went to see the terrible "Fistful of Dollars", I really don't think it was good.  It took place in a circus and a guy with a broken leg and what appears to be a broken arm is a ringmaster.  I can't believe they actually used an elephant in a movie.  Not only is the film bad, it is boring too.  In fact it made me want to go to sleep.  When did an elephant come to a movie?  Not a good idea to get into a film like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the old days, it wasn't difficult to find an independent cinema (in New York we call them "tickets" now), where you could watch a good movie, with good dialogue and good acting. The old movies, especially the American films from the 1920s and 1930s, were wonderful. These were the kind of movies where the audience was invited to go and have a good time, to see people dressed in costumes that were not meant for that kind of occasion, but just for the sake of being there. Or for example, in this film, where they have an argument with a dog. It was hilarious. I could enjoy this movie from a distance, even without the fact that I have seen it about a thousand times. The writing wasn't bad, and that's something. And the actors are all good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was not a very good movie.   One of those movies that are funny because they make you laugh and cry because they are sad.  I was thinking of watching this movie the other day with a friend who is a big fan of "Duck Soup" (and we were both surprised).   I like the way the movie looks and sounds, and I am glad I liked it.    But the acting was terrible.  And the story, like many other stories of this genre, is rather dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess this will be the most accurate thing I can do about this:  Well this is not a good movie at all.  The story is really nothing original; it's a lot of people dying, they are all bad guys.  It's not like in The Bourne Supremacy where you feel that this is an original story; this is the same plot over and over again, with a lot more gore than it should, and with a bad story that makes you not want to watch the first one (it really should have been the first).  The best part was the villain, who is an actual bad guy.   This is also a movie where they try to do something "original" but don't know what it is, and then they end up with some kind of bad film.  You will never get a sequel out of this movie, as I don't think they have any ideas that aren't the same old "the bad guy tries to kill everyone". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is as uninteresting as it sounds. The characters are uninteresting, the plot is uninteresting and it is all very uninteresting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in the right place at the right time to see a bad one but this one wasn't even bad, it was just a movie with bad direction. The story line was lame too, nothing new or original there. I guess you could try to get some kind of point out of it but no one would listen to your point since it was so lame. There was one scene where a girl gets raped by a gang of kids in the back of a truck, it looked sooo bad, and that scene was only to end the whole movie.   A must see only if you want to see the worst movie I've ever seen, don't watch it if you like funny movies at all, don the movie again just to laugh at the stupid parts, it is still funny though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A couple of the more unappealing characters are played by the same actor - the same one who played the most hideous clowns in the '80s on television - and it's all so bad, that I have to think it's a joke. There's also the kind of dialogue that reminds me of old black-and-white horror movies, the "you're dead" kind. The movie also has the same kind of unoriginality that's always a hallmark of its kind: the main character turns out to be a psychopath. What makes it worse is that the movie has a very limited budget and even that, like its predecessors, doesn't go very far. It seems all the good characters from earlier are gone from the film, replaced by a bunch of other clowns who don't really fit. The film's "good ending" is just one long stretch of the same clowns trying to escape. You can't see it coming.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really have no words for this. It's one of those movies that makes me feel sad. It seems that you can't trust this guy to actually create a story. His dialogue is a complete joke. The film is full of horrible lines like: "How do you like it? I feel like I'm in an old movie about a gang of street urchins." I mean come on! Did he think this movie was something to be shot at a party on the beach? And, I was laughing out loud at this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like the "Dirty Harry" series and "Rocky Horror Picture Show", "Hocus Pocus" is a movie with a lot going on in it.   From the title, you know you're in for an awesome time.    The opening credits of the movie, in which the characters, with their voices in sync, take an excursion around the woods.  We hear, "I was hoping to hear a "What a night for a fairy tale!"   Then, it's "What have you done to me now?   We are then introduced to the four witches, whose names are: Mary Margaret, Zephyr, Toto, and Momma, who run a circus.  But the circus itself is a terrible place, and they soon find out the circus is really an evil trick.  It's a horrible house, full of bad-tempered cats.  And the tricksters are the worst sort: snakes, frogs, goblins and evil mazes.  The witches get captured and turned into witches, which makes the cats even worse.  These cats can take on the appearance of an insect, like a mosquito, a snake, or a spider.  However, the cats will attack anyone who tries to go into the house.  They seem to be from another world, and don't seem to know what to do with their time. Then we meet the mice, who are the only ones who are friendly and friendly.  You might think they are an evil race, but they are not: the mice help the witches by letting the witches go back and forth, even if they are in a very small space.  There is a witch with a big nose called Miss Munchkin, who tells the witches to go away.  Then we have a witch who loves candy, but it's a hard life as a witch.   It is the most wonderful time of all and the witches, with the help of the cats and mice, get through it to the end.  So, is there a sequel to "Hocpe?"   Well, there might be one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never heard a good movie where the director didn't go in to his script with the mindset of a guy who wants to see the worst possible result.  He gets so into the story that he just doesn't realize that he's getting more and more absurd.    The script starts by making us think that a family of bad guys from a movie theater have somehow become "good."   We get to know that the bad guys are played by a great actor in his 40s who gets to sit and listen to the kids yell at him, and a woman who appears only in one scene before screaming at the screen for the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were several problems with this film: 1. The whole movie had nothing to do with the story. We got to see some beautiful landscapes and mountains that had no reason to exist. There was no reason at all for these mountains. The movie was completely pointless, boring and stupid. This is a bad picture, a bad script, a lousy idea of a film. 2. The only good part of the movie was the part where we saw a little boy run away from the movie to the woods to be with a "big" man. The guy was a giant. That is a good film. 3. The sound effects were awful. The music was okay. This movie was really bad. I'm sure I'm not the only person who hated this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say I liked this movie. It was not a very good movie. The movie starts off with the movie crew running out of a bad motel room, only to find a homeless old lady standing outside with a gun (well, it's not a gun you see, it is a can of tuna and this is about a man with a can on his head) so of course they head off to help her. What follows is a rather uneventful movie set-up (not a bad way to introduce a film) where the homeless old woman is attacked by a group of muggers (the movie had the right idea, giving the muggers a "stache") and the old woman takes a bite out of one of them and gives him a nasty gash to the face. The next day, they find the mugger in the hospital with the old lady's can of food stuck on his face, which he apparently used to chew the plastic bag (why in the world would anyone bother to eat a can when you could eat a bag of chips). The movie does a bit of explaining by the director about what they saw in the past and how the old man and the woman are still alive (the homeless man still has no teeth though...).   It is a very odd story line that is left over and doesn't really move on with very many points.    The movie ends with a rather long discussion about whether or not the old and old woman are alive or dead which is not all that interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the words of Robert Duvall:    I can't believe how old this movie is.   This film has an 80's feel to it.  A young teen is having a hard time finding a job so he is hanging out at the local arcade in the middle of the afternoon.  When a random dude bumps into him he takes a liking to him and gets him to sign some paper.  Later that day a bunch of guys show up and get the two kids to give them all their money.  Now, for years I have hated this movie and all of the sequels and I will never forgive those who made it. This is a horrible movie that takes itself too seriously and plays with stereotypes to sell it. I am sure this isn't the worst movie ever made but it's certainly not the greatest either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you don't care about the movie, you will find absolutely nothing to like about it. The movie is just a bunch of actors trying to pass for "grown up" on the big screen.   A lot of the dialogue is really hard to understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not impressed with "A Good Day to Die Hard". It was predictable, slow paced, and almost completely forgettable. I will admit that I never really wanted to see John McClane fight the terrorists again (after the first film made me go "wow" and it's like this guy is still holding on to the character I loved from the first movie, with a few new gadgets and a new face), because it has all the ingredients to be one of those cheesy action movies that can't even stay still for one second. It's not that I'm not a fan of the first two Die Hard movies; I just feel that McClane didn't receive a good payback for all his work in the first one. He was given nothing to do in the second film, save for some brief scenes that didn't do much. The other new character I think was more annoying than anything else, and he wasn't really a bad guy. It was a fun ride back to New York City with everyone still wearing that weird yellow shirt they wore in the last movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the opening sequence, a little boy runs naked through a field covered with wildflowers. His mother runs up to him, exclaiming:  "He's a beautiful boy!   It was rather depressing.   I had a headache all night, but we got to see the next two segments.  They were pretty good; maybe the producers could have been nicer about the way they chose to show the characters.  This series is the sort of thing that gets made on the cheap, but I was hoping for something that might make me think a bit harder about what it means to be a decent human being. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My first viewing of "Bully" was a revelation. I don't even know how to describe it. First of all, it is a comedy. Now that's a bad combination. But then it begins to get funny. I will take a couple of minutes to describe some of the funniest bits. The two most entertaining are the two talking dogs that accompany the "Bullys". The first talking dog is a blue heeler with a big heart. He says "BULLY, I'm so happy that you are safe". He is actually happy because he thinks the bully is finally leaving him alone. Of course he is the bully. The other talking dog who looks like an evil, yet lovable, devil is a big black mongrel with a horrible, yet adorable, personality. He is all "Oh mama! Oh mama!" This is an excellent bit because the dog has great potential as a character. I guess it is best to let people watch it. If you are one of those people who don't like comedy, this movie is not for you. It is a lot of fun to watch. If only all those kids (mostly teenagers) I see on TV would take some acting lessons and become a "Bunny". That way we could have a "Cats and Dogs" on TV. (If you don't know, "CATS AND DOGS" is a sitcom that ran on CBS and the NBC Television Network from 1950-1975. It was one of the first shows that showed an African-American family in an American setting. The show had a huge influence on TV comedy today.)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total disaster that will make you feel as though you got cheated out of a Christmas. This has to be a Christmas movie or one to show your kids you're not as good as they think you are. There is nothing funny about this film. The only reason I can call it a Christmas film is because it opens with a Christmas tree and a Santa Claus and that's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very stupid, poorly made film. This movie has absolutely nothing going for it; it's just a waste of time. This is a bad film that should have been put out on a VHS tape and dropped in the garbage. There was even a "wedding" at the end. There's nothing to see here except lots of yelling and fighting. There is no humor here. There are also very long scenes between the two main characters, and no action at all in any of the scenes. There were also many "gags" that were not funny. For example, there was this guy named Billy who would try to put something in his mouth, but the only thing he could fit into his mouth was a grapefruit. So he'd put a grape in his stomach and throw up in the girl's hair. The girl would then take out her purse and take a purse out of her purse, and open the purse and then stuff in the grapefruit, which she would hold onto and eat, like the grape, in her mouth, while the movie played. Another "gag" was when the camera crew went up to the roof and got drunk. One of them took a bunch of shots with his gun and then the movie would cut to the girls. After that a "giggle" would play, and the camera guy would be sitting there smiling while the girls drank their booze and played with their clothes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a pathetic excuse for a horror movie:     The monster's head is made from a large, heavy metal baseball bat.   At the end of the movie, it is revealed that the monster used to be an ugly red-haired woman in a black bikini. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a great movie. The only bad part is that it's not good enough to be called an oldie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think that if you want a good story then   The Return is an excellent choice. The acting is good but not amazing. And the direction is poor. I like the music but it does not help. I was not able to get interested in what the plot was about. The only thing about this movie that is good   It is a shame that the director was not in better health, but I suppose I should not begrudge a good effort  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't normally go on and on about bad movies, and I certainly don't go on about this one, though the movie does do the "old" shtick. The acting is just bad. The actors are so bad, that it's obvious they had no idea what they were doing. This movie makes one very sad. This is the movie that got the whole "wedding crashers" phenomenon going, where every Hollywood movie ever made, was followed up by a movie like this, where the people are completely useless. I mean, I would take "The Wedding Crashers," over any Hollywood movie in the last century. That's right, this is the most terrible thing ever. I guess the producers just made up bad jokes, and it was all a "hit" movie. This "movie" is just silly; it was filmed on a very cheap motion picture set, so it was supposed to be hilarious! Well, guess what? It was ridiculous! Everyone in this movie has a "hissy fit" over a man, and they all yell out the silliest things ever. And no one even does something original; they all do the same things they did in the first movie, and there is nothing they can do to get off the ground! The movie is ridiculous and boring and is just stupid. Well, I guess it is because everyone had no clue what they're doing; it is just a bunch of people making fun of each other! No one does anything original at all; they are all "stupid" and "bad" and just trying to get the "good guys" off, and trying to make a lot of money. The producers really made a bad joke out of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the least "Star Wars" movie. I know that is what this movie is, it's "Star Trek with evil aliens," but there really wasn't that much "Star" about it (except for the aliens). The best of the "Star wars" films is "A New Hope" and that's the only reason that this movie had any interest in it. I watched the entire thing with the sound on and that added to the confusion of not being able to figure out who this guy is, what is he doing and why is he trying to assassinate the Emperor? But I found the movie pretty interesting and at least the special effects were good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If there's one thing that can't save  a bad movie, it's a bad cast and a bad script.  That's the only reason to see this, and this one is awful in every way.  In fact, the only  thing I enjoyed about it was seeing John Hurt in a full costume, which is something I didn't mind at all.  And  that's about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea of a'superior alien warrior' (played by 'the other guy who looks like a bumbling idiot but who gets the girl on a regular basis), is intriguing and I can see some interesting directions to take it in (maybe it will be a buddy cop? Or perhaps it will just be about a bunch of cops being hunted down by a bunch alien monsters). But I can't shake the fact that it's just not very good. It's a 'wicked-yet-funny' movie. I'm not a fan of the humor (but then, I don't find a lot of it enjoyable), but I guess that's what makes me a fan. I know it'll never be as good as Aliens, but I would watch it again just to see if it's any funnier.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie did not seem much like a bad film at all, if you ask me.  I like to give the "Bad Movie" award to those films which, for all I know, could have been good.   The problem is that the good ones often feel like a movie made just for entertainment, and I'm not really sure if this movie even belongs in the "Good Movies" section. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a let down. I never thought I would see such a disappointment in a movie about a little girl from a small village who moves to a big city with her big brother and big sisters. Her big sister is a witch, and when she kills the little girl because she's a fairy she wants revenge on the little village.  And she uses the little villagers as a "bodyguard", and the result is more or less the same as always (little girl is killed, mother killed, revenge taken, revenge comes).  I can understand the movie, to be frank. It takes place in a fairy tale, and there are many little monsters who are part of it, but that's what I don't get. It's an old fairy tale with fairy tales being told in a very old way (probably because the person who wrote this wasn't a very good fairy tale writer) and it doesn't have a big plot either.    It is a very basic tale told with a bunch of little creatures, some of whom are very weak and some of who are just really annoying.      And it's a great little film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has all the worst aspects of what a low-budget B movie should be. First, the cast looks like a bad gang from The Golden Girls. When I saw them, they looked like they could have been cast on a bus and brought to the set of this movie. Second, the dialogue is almost never funny. Third, you are supposed to enjoy yourself as the cast walks around in a mall in a costume and sings an ode to being on the prowl. And the music is almost as bad as the movie. The director, Roger Corman, has a long and very questionable career. He directed the "Shame" remake and the "The Wild One" remake. He also directed some other bad B movies like "The Big Bounce" and "The Great One". "Gone With the Wind" is also not one of his best, but his directorial style is what makes this film even worse. This film is an embarrassment to Corman's filmography. And in case you aren't aware, this film was banned in several countries during its theatrical release. It is an absolute disgrace to the director. - June 22, 2004A bad movie with great scenery
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad, it is so embarrassing that it almost makes my stomach turn.   Even though I grew up watching these kind of things, this movie really took a dive.  And if you want to watch the worst of a crappy movie, look no further than this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't care if it is a stupid movie or a bad one, at least it wasn't boring or pretentious.  The only reason I didn't give this an amazing rating is because it wasn, as I mentioned, supposed to be an adventure movie.  And, at that time, it wasn...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a disaster.  The movie starts off strong with a very nice scene with the mother and father watching their two boys running around the house while yelling at each other.  The next thirty minutes consist of two scenes: A police officer shows up at their house to investigate a car crash, which they promptly pretend never happened (it did).  This is followed by a scene with two children screaming about how the family can't possibly be allowed to live in the neighborhood, because the police are always trying to arrest them.  Once the police car shows up, the two kids go into the backseat with the cop to play a game of hide and seek.  As they wait to be picked up, they play a silly game in which the kids make a "fetch" sound while holding on to a long string.  And, once in the car, they decide to pull the string on a little girl in the back seat.   In this scene, they are shown to be very bright and imaginative and the mother was actually rather endearing.  I wish this movie had been a real treat, but it was so bad I would have rather have just watched a show about the adventures of an evil baby than pay the price for this garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's an odd thing about this movie: It's a romantic comedy with a strong dose of romance. I loved it. There's this love of life thing going on: I love to see people happy and healthy. Then there's this young boy, who falls in love with a woman who's trying to get his father to stop making these stupid movies. This happens in two parts, a romantic comedy in the first part, and a science fiction fantasy-horror in the third. It's both silly and scary at the same time. And it's a wonderful and fun movie. I don't see it as bad, and I like it even better now.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What can I say? It's about an orphaned girl named Sissel who goes on a journey to a town, the town is a small village called Odenwald, the orphan is called Siselle, and she decides to take a trip back to the town. It starts off okay, but then the movie goes downhill fast. It's a good movie, but it doesn't even have the guts to have the movie be part of the German film industry.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the few horror movies that comes with a happy ending, and also the first film in the director's career that is anything but predictable.   A couple of years ago, an anonymous writer at a major American magazine suggested to a small horror movie writer named Dan O'Bannon that he write a horror film about a ghost. O' Bannon accepted, and a year later, in 1978, he had released his first film, Night of the Living Dead, which was based on the novel by author George A. Romero. Night of The Living Dead had been highly successful, grossing approximately $17.8 million worldwide on a budget of roughly $2.5 million. It is certainly one of the finest films ever to have been made in America. In the days leading up to the film's release, there was a great deal of publicity about the new movie which was to be produced by the famed director, Sam Raimi. Raimis original horror film, The Evil Dead (1980) had been a major success, gross ing $33.8 billion worldwide, and many films by other famous directors followed, including Evil Dead 2 (1981), Halloween (1981) and The Crow (1991). Night of "Lil' Dead" (1979) and the upcoming Evil Dead III were seen by many film lovers as a major threat to the Romero style that was popular throughout the 1980s. However, as much as it could be seen as a threat, O'bannon, as usual, proved them all wrong. Night, despite its dark mood, and its gore, is more than a worthy sequel to Romero's work. Riffing heavily off of the original film, it does a great job of capturing the same dark atmosphere of Romero's original work while offering an even more sinister and more violent tone. A more disturbing element in the film, if only because it features the most ghastly scene of the film so far (a severed foot in the back of a truck) is the soundtrack. The original score had a great effect, especially if you were a child, and it certainly holds up as a masterpiece of '80s horror. It really shows how great O'Neill's score was, especially in the more eerie parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When you watch "The Green Mile" you get some decent acting (by Paul Newman) and some great moments for the film, but in the end, the characters don't really have any impact on the film. I think this could be done better by someone else.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is basically a rehash of  Harsh Realm (1997), which I thought was an interesting film about a boy who dreams of becoming a magician, and is trained and controlled by a wizard called Shuruppakur.  This film doesn't really have anything new to add; it's an older kid who is given a wand and taught to use it.  There's a little boy magic in this, but the film is nothing new.  One of the other things that stands out is this young actor, who has a pretty good voice (a bit of a slouch, but a good voice), though the acting is really weak.  The story is just another rehash.  It's worth seeing, but not in the least bit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For any film buff to get the chance to experience a classic and see how it got that way is something worth saying. It is certainly the most famous and loved film of all time, and for good reason. It was an entertaining film that made a great point. It's one of those movies you watch once and wonder where it's gone, and then it's not quite a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My husband and I went to see this movie on opening day. We have kids, they are about 3 and 5. The kids loved it...as did their mom and dad! I thought it was ok, not the greatest film I have seen, but its very well done.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen all of the Twilight films, including the first and last, but this movie is one that always makes me cringe when I listen to the song "That's so Raven."   The first Twilight movie did have a nice story but the rest was pretty cheesy.   For my money, the best Twilight movie was the second one.  I think my favourite is Twilight and I've heard good things about Twilight: Eclipse.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you enjoyed this movie then it is only a matter of time before the next one, and hopefully, a lot better. This one is not an action movie but a comedy of errors. For some reason the movie does not work. The acting is pathetic. We see that all the characters are not actors. Everyone except the three main characters, Sam and his buddy Pete have terrible accents. The actors look like they got up at 5 a.m. for this one and have been acting ever since. The humor is so bad it could not have been a movie written for children. The movie begins with a horrible scene. The two bad-acting actors show a movie clip about a girl being attacked by a bear. Pete and Sam are standing with a sign that says "Don't attack a girl." This is a scene that is laughable if it did not happen on camera. The whole movie is bad. Even after watching the entire thing I feel badly for the poor actors and the poor director. You would think this movie would be an action comedy. But it is not. It is a poor effort by a director that does not get much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't care if the first 20 minutes are boring and uneventful.   You don't have a good reason to do anything in these first 20, at all.  The characterisation is good, the story is interesting, so what's not to like?   This is a decent movie for the price; nothing outstanding in the cinematography (other than that awful looking black and white picture that was the first "movie").   The characters seem to be somewhat well thought out, but it's not an exciting movie, nothing that will make you want to sit around and watch it over and over again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those films that I will find incredibly enjoyable, but will also annoy me to tears. It is a great film, in fact one of the best films in the series. If you are into old-fashioned German cinema, you will not be disappointed, but if you are looking for a film with a new twist, and a very stylish look and a great cast, you may find this one to be a bit of a shocker.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The director of the film, Ramin Bahrani is a man in an industry of one. While I applaud him for trying to come up with something worthwhile, he has a lot of bad movies in the works. The last one I saw was his remake of a film that I can't even remember the title of. He is a bit of a talentless hack who can't direct and has terrible characters in the cast. Bahranie is a bad director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've seen a single episode of M.D. or M.I.N.C. or any episode of the various TV shows in which this guy played, you can't believe that an actor of his stature doesn't get more screen time. A few scenes in which he plays a detective are fun, but mostly he just sits around being goofy, especially since his best scene is probably in a bad episode of CSI: NY. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As far as movie plots go it's not bad at all, in fact it is fairly good, however the direction and acting is very poor, you would be amazed at how poor some of these actors were in this movie. Even some of the supporting cast, all were terrible. I can only say it's a terrible movie to watch and even more terrible to remember.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My girlfriend got me this for christmas and I haven't finished it yet. I don't want to say anything bad about this one, because it's really not a bad flick. Well not bad as i don't know what the word means anymore and I don`t think I'll be able to stay awake long enough to finish this movie. That said, the people who made this are at the top of their game. I can't say anything about the plot, because I don´t know why they even bothered to write a movie about a dead kid. The movie has nothing going on but a dead boy running around and the whole movie takes about 10 minutes to get to a point. I guess the creators were trying to show the point of this movie by making this really short, but it doesn't really help as I found it very disappointing. So the story revolves around a kid called John who was hit by a car, and he spends the rest of his life in a wheelchair. He eventually goes to a hospital where doctors try to help him. At this point we learn a bit about the story of John and how he lost his leg in a battle with the Nazis, and that he was an ace with the Germans because he had a machine gun on his hip, which means that he can still fire it on the move, because his legs don't work! He finally gets used to life in the hospital and is released to come home for Christmas, where he decides to visit his brother. The problem with this movie is that there just aren't very many jokes in this one. It's not funny, not silly, and it's not a good movie to watch after dinner. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part of this movie is the two young people playing the kids.  It's as if they were teenagers just beginning to get to know each other.  But it would be just the two of them, if the adults didn't act like adults.  One of the adults in the movie is so annoying that I'm sure I'll never laugh with the same sense of humor I did watching it when I was younger.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great movie about a group of guys that go to a house to pick up a girl in their 30s. The house is a typical mansion, which seems to be in an upscale part of town. But, there are two big differences: one is a huge pool, and the other is a dog. As the guys enter the room and walk around they run into a guy with a big chest, and a really ugly, stinky dog. And the house is just a pile of junk, which is probably what happens when you pick up an unattractive young lady.   The guys talk about their problems, which seem to be limited to their inability to find a girl who's not into them. After some more talking, a guy walks out of the house with a small, cute, little girl. She's really beautiful, but the guys are more interested in the swimming pool. The pool is the main attraction, as it's a hot tub with a huge waterfall that leads to a cliff. While the guy in the hot tub seems to like the beautiful woman that's standing by the swimming hole, the guys (especially one of the guys) don't seem to. After a while, the guy leaves the hot-tub, takes off his shirt, and he and the girl walk out into the pool.  The girl falls in and the guys jump in after her, as soon as the guy touches her, he loses control and starts to jump into the water. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad, I can't even begin to express the extent of it. This movie was so bad I was amazed it existed.   The story follows two women who are friends and roommates. One day a man walks in their apartment and begins yelling at them. They go to confront him, but after he has left the woman tries to leave and he comes in the bedroom and grabs her neck and throws her out of the apartment.   The woman is so upset about her friend being killed by a stranger that she immediately flees to her parent's house and tries to get a restraining order against her boyfriend.   Then the woman returns to her room. She tries to close the door, but she is pushed in by her boyfriend, and she falls unconscious.   When her parents go to check on her, she is lying on the bed, and they realize she is still alive and alive but she has black eyes and bruises all over her body. When she comes to she looks at her parents and says, "It's over. I'm a dead woman."   I couldn't believe they made a movie about this... a dead person!     It is so sick, I couldn´t believe any of it and I had to watch the rest of it to make sure I didn´t miss anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The final score of this movie is a miserable 6/10.  The premise is a typical "fantasy-horror" plot. In this tale, a young woman, who is in love with a young man, and who is also a boy, finds herself being held captive by a monster in a medieval castle, where all sorts of creatures are kept.  Some of these creatures were creatures that the young woman did not realize were there. Others had no idea that they had come to be kept.     And in case you're wondering, it is a fair movie. It has some nice set pieces (for a medieval movie), a good cast, and plenty of silly humor.   It does not stand the test of time, but it's very good at its time period.  In fact, one of its best moments comes after the woman has seen the monster. "I saw it," she says, and the young man smiles at her in amazement.  I'm not a huge fan of monster movies (though I've seen my share), but this one is well produced, interesting, and entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this, I'm really glad my friends and I have each other.  In the beginning the movie was pretty slow and boring, nothing special about that.  After a while, though, it begins to pick up.  We get some great shots of the ocean and the mountains and all kinds of great scenery.   The movie is very well made and really interesting.  This movie doesn't need to try to be anything that it isn't.  It doesn't try to try too hard, it tries to be a good movie and if it ever tried too hard it wouldn't be much of a movie.  I really like this movie and I think it deserves more recognition. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you liked "The Mummy" (2003) then you will like this one. It follows the same script as the old one, but this time it has a little more "oomph". The Mummy is played by Johnny Depp and is quite the charmer. He is a man of mystery and intrigue. He travels around a lot and always keeps to himself. A local witch in Egypt comes down to the tomb where the Mummy sleeps to try to free him. When she reaches the tomb, she discovers that it is locked. The mummy is so large and strong that if he were loose, she is afraid that he would break her back. The Mummler goes to work and breaks the lock, but the monster escapes! There are many hilarious encounters throughout the movie. I enjoyed it a lot. I would have enjoyed this a lot more if the story was more original. It is simply about a man who wants to find out what happened to his mummified wife, but all he gets is a very bad story about an old and tired woman. If you want to know what a good movie this is, then go to the movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The trailer for this is horrible. There's no way this movie was made in America:  It feels like a foreign movie being put in America, without the original Japanese script or music. The actors are Japanese too, but it feels like they're being forced to live up to their countrymen's acting skills.  It's a comedy of errors:  The director has a serious lack of talent.  The writing of the English subtitles is terrible.  What is this movie about?  It has the feel of a "silly" movie with a silly theme, with an old fashioned film studio behind it.   What does this have to do with anything?   I watched this at a theater (which actually has a good movie selection) and it looked like it was shot in the 1990s.  In the end, it's not as bad as you think it is!   Watch this movie, if you feel like a light hearted comedy that is fun for the entire family!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The entire movie has a sort of weird,   like you're watching the oddest of oddities.   This bizarre comedy features a guy named Ben the Chicken and a woman named Linda who is always complaining about the chicken.  This leads to Ben and Linda having a very weird, but hilarious, night.  It's really one of those movies that is so odd that I had to laugh in order to survive watching it.  I do recommend watching this just to see Ben the chicken in action, but not in such a disgusting way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I heard that this was an adaptation of a Russian novel that was translated into English by a French novelist.  It's a decent film about a Russian peasant trying to get his son to help him in a peasant rebellion against the Tsar.   But I felt it was too much of a bore to be worth watching.  What I was most disappointed about is the lack of any real emotion.  The lead character, Ivan, is a good guy who is willing to do anything to bring an end to the Tsarist state.  They set up the first part of the movie like this.  In a village in the Ukraine, the young Ivan is taught how to handle a gun by his father.  After one of the peasants has murdered a Tsar official, Ivan is ordered to find a scapegoat and kill the man.   Ivan makes sure his wife is away when the Tsarevich comes to the village.  Ivan is to be his scapegoat.  But the peasants are not the only ones who hate the Tsarlitsa.  The locals of Ivan's village have also seen the Tsara on TV with their servants and have all gathered together to complain about them.  This is where the humor in the film comes into play.   There's a lot of comedy that goes on in this film and it works because it makes the audience forget why they're going to a peasant revolt in the first place.  Now, one could argue that the film has a bit of a romantic overtones to it.  True enough, the Tsarak-Mishka War of 1914 is one of those tragic events that have a way of making people love one another.  However, what really got to me was the lack a real sense of humor.  For the most part, the film is pretty unoriginal.  There is a scene with Ivan's son, Yuri, who plays a bit part as a peasant warrior.  Yuri is supposed to be very bright and eager to learn so that he can one day become a good fighter like his father... and then he kills his father by throwing him into a well.  I won't ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people would like to see a movie about a movie: an adaptation of the best-selling book by the same name, starring Chris Pine and Scarlett Johansson.  This version of the book is much better (and more faithful to the original) and it's a better movie. It also stars Robert Pattinson (he is a little too short in this version of it), and it does a very good job of portraying the period in which this film was shot, and the way that Hollywood went about making such movies in the 40s and 50s.   And what about the script?   This isn't a bad script by any means.  It has plenty of humor and some pretty good twists: one of the actors in the film dies in the middle of the movie, and this causes an odd situation in which he is "resurrected", in an attempt to get back in the limelight.  That last line has been used a lot in the past: and it works.  The writing is, at the very least, decent enough to give one something to think about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you don't like it, then you are obviously not human, as they didn't even bother to find a good excuse not to make a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an okay comedy, with some humor, decent special effects and some nice acting. However, this is not a good movie at all. It is not even a good one, let alone a good comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie ever made, and one of the worst movies ever made period. The movie itself is terrible. It is really bad, but the effects are really cool. If you've never seen a bad science fiction movie, this is probably the best you could come up with. The first minute and a half is so terrible you are just going to laugh at it. When the movie gets going, you start to wonder how the studio even got this done. When this movie starts going, it's so bad that by the second minute it just falls apart. The story, plot, acting, and visuals make this movie the absolute worst thing ever made. A movie so bad, the people who made this decided to keep it in the vault until the day they died. If that doesn't kill you, nothing will.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad it's almost un-watchable. There are two kinds of terrible movies out there: bad movies that take place in a bad place, and bad movies in bad movies. This is a third kind of bad movie, the kind that takes place in an ordinary city, where the average citizen can only dream of experiencing life a few streets away. This movie does all those things and then some. There's the usual "tough guy" trope: The "bad guy" has some kind of evil influence over the "good guy," who's supposed to be a "good friend," and the "bad person" is always in the same place, just waiting to cause trouble. But this movie has more to it than that. While the "Bad Guy" is usually in a different neighborhood every time (except when he is at his local church and the bad person is in an apartment next door), the bad guy always looks just like the "Good Guy" and the good guy always has an ordinary job, while the bad people in the movie all have the job of being the local bad people, like that guy who is always driving around and making rude noises around kids. This leads to the usual scenes where the "guy" is supposed to solve some kind problems by going back to the "old neighborhood" where the trouble-maker lives:    The film has a very poor acting staff: I've never met a better acting staff in my entire life than the cast in this film. I don't know how they got so good so fast, but I really liked most of these people.   I actually really liked the character of the "nice guy", but there were two things that really ruined this character: First, there's the fact that he has no life outside of his job, which made me feel bad for him. Secondly, he was a total jerk towards the "hero" (although I wouldn't call him a real friend).   Another thing is the story:  The story is very boring.  There's a lot of scenes about the badness of the place, while none of the bad stuff happens. The bad things happen, but you never get a sense that the bad things are causing all the trouble.  This is really one of those movies where you can actually say: "I can't really remember anything that happened in this movie."   This film has also an unimpressive special effects team.  I can't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an extremely bland, cookie-cutter movie.   There is a little bit of the cheesy, and a little of the ridiculous (the one and only time the movie is in a movie theater is in the opening) but the only thing that matters is the one little thing: what's with the fake cow?   As I thought about it, I thought maybe it's because this is a movie made by the same people who wrote the book (and yes, the cow is the real cow) which makes me think that there isn't very much of a plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The premise of the film is a strange one in which a young boy is trapped and tortured in his own living room for days by a young girl.   I was not sure what to make of this.      And I don't mean this as a bad film, it's just too long, and I found myself in the room a lot, because of the fact that all of the people in the house are the victims of this young girl who is really a pretty young girl, but is not one bit of a child molester.  It seems like she is also a psychopath and in that way she is far more dangerous than most murderers who prey on the most vulnerable in society.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie ever made. You have to be nuts to see this movie. It looks like a big pile of crap, and the acting in it is bad, too. The story is a complete mystery. The movie makes you believe everything is so funny, it's so much more fun than it should be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another story about an overweight guy and a fat chick. The movie is not too bad at all. It's a funny movie about a dumb fat guy (with some brains) and a smart skinny chick (with big boobs). But the best part is the little kid who was in the movie. I can't say much about the movie because I don't want to give spoilers. The main character (in this movie) was so fat, he couldn't walk. So he had to sit down, and in the meantime, the fat chicks had to do his eating for him. Then he eats more and more, until he just ate himself to death. I didn't like that guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an interesting film, as it tries to tie its story into the current issue of the X-Men franchise. This is done with the clever use of the comic book title "Professor X" and "Magneto", both of which will be familiar to any X-fan. The film also uses the famous "Time Cube" as a tool in a plot that is reminiscent of several previous comic book stories, including the story in the "Amazing Spider-Man" comic book "Wolverine: Old Man Logan".   As stated earlier, the plot involves the return of the original team of X-men to the present day and a battle against Magneto and the villains that have plagued them since the previous film. This includes Magneto's attempt to stop the formation of a United Nations force that would enforce peace on the world and destroy mutant-kind.   Magneto uses various new and old tactics to defeat the X men, but ultimately fails and is taken to a prison where he is tortured by his former friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is so over rated that its rating could have been 10 out of 10, but there is no other way to say it.  A classic "buddy movie," it's set up as an adventure in the woods.  What you actually see is three guys who take a girl back to her home to show her the movie, and then get a chance to go fishing.  They have only one catch to tell her, and its not a pretty one.  The film is pretty funny, but it's so well made that it can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only movie in the whole "horror" genre I could remember watching a while ago. It was a movie that was supposed to scare people (I mean really scare them), so I'm kind of surprised that it didn't. It is certainly not very scary, and I wouldn't say it is even creepy. If you know nothing about horror, this movie will certainly not make a good one.   I think the real problem is that the movie's director is obviously either a very bad writer, or he made a terrible movie. This movie is about the story of an old man that dies in a strange way. He has an odd, almost supernatural, presence throughout the entire movie. The other character who appears in the movie doesn't seem to be much more than a comic relief, and he is only there to make fun of him for the whole time the movie lasts. I think this movie is really just a joke, because the movie itself feels like something that might have made an OK horror movie, and isn't the horror movie that a lot of people have expected it to be.   The acting is fine, but not very good. You can see that this movie was made as a joke.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'd give this a 1-star rating because the movie looks so bad I don't even know if it's a real movie or a cheap attempt at comedy. As far as the plot goes, it looks more like a bad sci-fi movie than a movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The title is an odd one. It's not for a good movie, and certainly not for an action film. What it is, is a very boring, uneventful, unappealing, and very unenjoyable film. The story follows our "hero", who is a young boy (at a young age too!) who is in the middle of a fight between two teams and is about to be killed, but somehow manages to save himself. The fight goes on for some time, with the boy getting into an argument with his rival and the other boy, as well as the other boys and the team leader, until the other side wins. The boy's fate now lies in the hands of the leaders of the two opposing teams. The leader of the team which is using a child as a weapon wants the boy back as soon as possible, and he uses the boy to threaten and even torture the opposing team, and the boy also gives some of the more difficult situations the team leaders have to handle. At one point the team of the boy gets separated, and it takes the team for the boy's sake (because he has to keep the boy in his team) to find and bring him back. The movie gets a little more interesting when the girl who was originally going to be the boy is suddenly replaced with a boy, but that does not make things better.The plot is boring, the fight scenes not only are not exciting but are just bad as well, and just make the film that much more boring. There is also a lot of swearing, which is not necessarily a bad thing when it is used properly, but this is not only used to the detriment of the film, but also to the benefit of it. One of the most memorable scenes is when a team leader gets knocked out by an opponent. While a little girl is being tortured to death, a small amount of blood is being let down for the team to catch (for some reason). I could have spent a lot longer with this film. There are just no good fights, no good scenes, no interesting characters, no memorable scenes and only the one, annoying, clichéd character.I really had high hopes for this movie to have potential, but unfortunately it only made me despise it. A lot of people seem to enjoy it though (not only the guys, but some of them women too!), which gives me hope that maybe this could not be an absolute bad movie after all, but I still don't see
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really looking forward to this movie. I was hoping the "Ivy League" thing would come to a good conclusion and end this terrible show. Unfortunately the good ending never came, there was no big climax or ending, just this one big slapstick scene about how Ivy League girls are basically worthless, and how Ivy is going to take it from the worst girls in her class and make them into real smart girls. I thought it would have been a good ending, I was actually excited. But then the movie turns into this really annoying movie about the worst thing ever, and the least smart girls in the universe (I'm kidding. I have no idea what this movie is about.). This one has got to be the dumbest movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is an American satire. It follows a pair of aging comic actors who go on a tour to play the stage of a fictional town. There is much talk about "the new and improved town" and a new mayor. The new town has become more modern and is more "normal" than the former, as this is a play about a fictitious town. As a result of a scandal involving an overactive and ill-tempered local politician, the current mayor has to go to an out-of-town town to replace him. It is the last stop of the tour and they want to make a good impression on the audience. But in the audience is a group of eccentric, yet very well-dressed people who all like to have sex in the town square. It's a good time to visit this town.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, there it is. Just in case it's not obvious what I'm ranting about - I was very disappointed in this film.   There were a lot of really good ideas running through this film - particularly with the characters, and even the setting - the way people are always watching a movie in a bar, in their pajamas, with their drinks. That's what they wanted to do, in the bar, with the drinks.  In terms of the characters I was more or less in line with them - they're all over the place, constantly drunk, and a little bit too concerned about the fact that they have no money. But they don't have much imagination at all; and that is the film's biggest failure.  I'm not sure how any of this will end up making it to DVD or TV.  The dialogue, while fine, is all over-the-place, and I'm pretty sure no one will understand it.  This was not just a failure - it was a major failure.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie with such high potential and so much potential, but it just does not make it. This movie is nothing more than a slow-motion car wreck. The movie itself is very boring. It's very easy to see that this director has made a car chase movie. He tries to show the viewer all these great things, but there is only one thing for him to show: the car is never going to go anywhere. If you watch the movie a hundred times and say "it never goes anywhere", then it was just nothing more and nothing less than an excuse to show some cars that are too slow to keep up with the bad driver in the bad car. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To anyone looking for a good movie, this is it.  Well, what a mess.  The only good thing about this movie is that, at least it does what it's supposed to do: entertain you.  It has the ability to make you laugh, cry and, in some ways, feel a little sick.  I just hope I never have to witness a scene like the one shown in the movie (sorry, I'm still a little sore on my stomach after watching it). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think I found a more pleasant movie than the original, however it is still very strange to watch. The movie is an attempt to recreate the classic The Man Who Fell to Earth as a science fiction film, however they really didn't succeed, this version is actually very boring and weird.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just another in a long series of cheap, stupid, awful and just plain old bad movies. I have already reviewed this movie twice. The first time, I was really disappointed at how much of the movie was devoted to the character of James, the young gay man who wants to be gay. It is a good idea that it is better if you don't look like a "man" because your mother will kill you when you are older. I would have liked to have seen more of James and some other characters. But no, this is the movie and it is awful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There have been many terrible movies released since it opened in 1982 and the original version is certainly one of the worst in terms of acting, writing, and most of all plot.  Even those that liked it hated it because it was terrible.  It's just as bad as Star Wars Episode I which is really hard to watch even though I've seen it twice now.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this one in the theater with a bunch of people. They were all in costume and it looked really cool. The actors were all pretty good in it. Unfortunately it is not a good movie. There is not much to it. I didn't want to stay but we had to go on a cruise that night. It was a fun trip but I didn`t enjoy it one bit. It is just boring, and boring is really a good way to describe this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this once and I could not get the hell out of that room.  When I realized this was not one of the classics of my childhood, I had a heart attack.  It's not that it's not bad.  But why are there these movies?  If it has been that long since you watched a good horror movie, why do you keep seeing them over and over again?  There's this cliche about it that the best horror movies are the ones you don't remember.  I'm here to tell you that it isn't true.  There are a lot of really bad movies out there that you've never seen, and some very good movies that you might not even know are movies.  This isn't going to be the horror flick for you, but there's plenty of good horror movies to choose from.  And I would not recommend this to people who don't like good scares.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for the first time in a movie theater and I was not impressed. This film is nothing new in terms of genre and has been doing the same things since it was first released. The story is the same. The protagonist is the protagonist everywhere. He has no friends and nothing to do but drink and get into trouble. You get the feeling that the story is going to end with him in the bottom of a pond but he somehow managed to somehow survive and become the hero of the movie. This movie also has one of the worst acting performances I have ever seen. The film has a lot of bad camera work and bad camerawork is the worst way to make a movie. I never would have expected a movie starring Sean Connery to have so much bad acting. The music isn't much better. They try to recreate the style of the music from The Man with No Name by Frank Sinatra but it doesn't even come close to sounding like Sinatra's song. The cast also consists of one great actor, Roger Moore, one really bad actress and one awful actor with a really bad movie. The only redeeming factor of this film is that Roger Moore is the star and Roger Moore isn't a bad actor.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the film, an American couple, husband and wife, are on vacation to the French Riviera. They spend most of their time having fun. The only problem with their vacation is that they are constantly having to escape from the French police. As they travel around the beach, they must avoid French policemen and their high-powered machine guns, but they never have to worry about an American, who, in reality, is actually a Frenchman.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know if I can fully get on with this movie or not. I can't be the only one that felt that a lot of unnecessary dialogue and "magic" was overdone in the movie. The magic was too strong and the characters lacked personality. And then, there is the weird relationship between the girl and the boy that went nowhere. I suppose there is not a lot to talk about in this movie. It is a very short movie and it is not even funny. It just does its job of not making me smile or laugh. The best thing about this movie is its director. I guess he learned his lessons in "Ghost in the Shell" and wanted to work on a very similar premise.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a movie that's more annoying than funny. There's a lot of pointless exposition to go through and at the end I got what the movie is about.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was totally shocked at how dull this movie turned out. I'm no horror expert. I've watched too many cheap low-budget bad movies to count.   If the first act is boring, the rest is as forgettable as I'm sure most people expect. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this is a bad bad movie. I do not know if I should laugh or cry at the bad acting, the bad storyline, the crappy jokes. I was expecting a good action movie about a hero who is killed. That is not the case. The plot is so stupid that even the stupid hero can do nothing in the movie but make his lame and lame action scenes. It starts off slow and then gets worse and worse. It does not even make good use of its bad acting. If you can't laugh or be sad at a bad action movie with a bad plot then I'm afraid to think what you can expect from something you call a movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You know when you're sitting on a plane in LA and an airport employee asks you a question and you can't answer it? Then he yells at you? That's about to happen to you. So, why would you let an LA airport employee take a picture of you, and then give it to a porn star? Not only does this film give a bad rating to the whole 'entertainment' industry, but, the producer (Chris DeFazio) is just a greedy, rude, unprofessional, disgusting person, who wants to take pictures of young girls with her cell phone, when she isn't working as a stripper. This would have been hilarious, if it weren't so nasty...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    At the time of filming, no one knew what to do with this film, it was a very odd combination of a comedy, a melodrama, a Western, a thriller, a war film, a romantic comedy, and a crime film all wrapped in one. It all has its own peculiar charm, the film is very quirky and has a wonderful feel to it. Its a bit on the boring side at times, the pacing is pretty slow and we get more of the same, the acting is very poor, but what matters most is the story. Its not exactly a bad story, the plot is interesting, and there is a great character here that is definitely not played like a pawn.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this movie. I didn't think that it was a very good movie and then I saw this one and I had to take a look. What I thought was a bad film turned out to be a good movie. It was a good thriller with good acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really disappointed with this. I didn't think it was good, and my girlfriend even asked me to go and "get a new TV set." So I did. I had to change a few things to make it watchable, and I think it's a bad film. It doesn't have the creativity or the charm of a Wes Craven movie. The special effects, while good, look like someone took a pair of pliers and a hacksaw and then stuck them to a blackboard. They're pretty good, but the script, though well-written, is terrible. I like some of the themes it has, but they all get lost in this movie. When an angry mob, dressed in black, attack the house, the man who is watching his wife and infant daughter, and one of the neighbors who happen to have a knife, go to the basement to get the shotgun, a man in a black tuxedo jumps out, and shoots both of them, and, apparently, the mob shoots the white man. It's like, "So, why don't you go get those gunpowder-making chemicals and do some gunpowder research, and maybe you can make more stuff for the mob?" That's all it is. And I don't understand why the white guy is allowed to have any guns. I'm sure a real gangster would have had them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie does little more than present a picture of a man going on a mission to kill a mad doctor who is using his "body" to create monsters out of the people around him. As with the rest of his films, his films are full of clichés, cheesy dialogue, and overuse of visual effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've never had a movie that made me laugh like The Mask of Zorro  .   It's got everything   -- a big gang (there's two at any given time) and a big boss (Zorro) and I think they're supposed to be the bad guys, I'm just so used to villains   who are good   (with the exception of the Joker)  !   The mask is a big guy.   His nose is really long.   The way he moves   is really funny.  The sound effects   are kind of goofy.  I just can't wait to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not really that good of a movie.  The writing is bad.    It tries to be funny and it really isn't.  And there are really no characters.  But, it's not that bad. If you really dislike  the  James Bond franchise this is the movie to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie that has the potential to be a funny one but, just like the rest of the bad movie/bad actors/bad direction movies that are flooding the theatres at the moment, it fails to deliver.   The movie's premise involves a young woman named Julia (who is played by the amazing Jennifer Aniston) who becomes a part of a secret government organisation that watches the world to combat a global war:  What?   Julia is recruited to help the team of female scientists who have managed to build a robot which is designed to fight off the evil aliens who come from another planet: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is all over the place. There are multiple points where this movie really starts to feel like it could have been better. We meet a man who appears to be the real life Dr. Evil. The man, like Dr.Evil, has a pet frog, a talking bird and a dog.   The bird is called a pigeon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie with my brother while my brother was visiting me in the states from the UK last year. We were out hiking in the hills of Virginia where I am a resident. The film starts off with one of the most stupid, self-indulgent, poorly acted, boring, and badly written movies I have ever seen. It feels like this guy (played by David Lister) was a big fan of Monty Python.      A bunch of guys are hanging out in the woods and decide to take a walk before dinner. Their leader is a big drunk, and is acting like a complete dick.  A large bull elk attacks one of them, but it doesn't even get a scratch.  Soon after, they decide to go to bed.  The rest of the movie is spent just drinking beer and eating pheasant. One of the guys decides to pee off of a rock into the water (yes, that's the name of the rock) which gives the others the idea that it should be blown up. When they finally blow the rock up, the only thing left is a giant hole.  Apparently they all had the best sex of their lives and had some great stories afterwards.  Unfortunately, they all start falling in love with a young girl who is a local schoolteacher.  Now the most bizarre part of this movie is that it is completely ridiculous.  I don't know if this man is trying to parody the Monty Pythons, but he clearly does not know anything about them.  In every scene the characters are shown having some kind of mental breakdown.  One guy falls out of a tree, breaks his arm and ends up in the hospital.  This girl has a bad case of amnesia and is always having strange dreams.  And I have to add that my brother and I actually laughed at about 5% of this crap.  It makes my head hurt just thinking about it.  You probably haven't seen this movie, but I will give you the synopsis:     The characters are called the "Friends".  One of them is an idiot, and tries to tell everyone else what they should do, but they are all way smarter than he is, and they tell him to get out of their way.  Then a crazy man, dressed as a clown (actually a man in a clown costume, not a clown), comes and tells them that he's the only one who can help
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, not much is known about this movie. I know they used a movie called The Golden Child in one of these films, however I don't remember seeing it! I had heard some good things about this one and I finally went to see it! The movie is supposed to be from an animation by the late William Castle which was also in the movie The Golden Sneeze! I saw The Golden Bird when it was released a few years back in 1969 and it was pretty darn funny! I loved the animation and it looked like a cross between the Disney animation of the late 1940's, and Disney cartoons of the early 1960's. It wasn't a good movie, it didn't have a sense of humor, the story was so nonsensical that I didn't even finish it, it was very short! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're a lover of the old westerns then this movie is for you. It's not good, but it's definitely old fashioned. There are a lot of characters. I love all of them. But they never really get anywhere. And they have to work to get anywhere and not just talk. Even the guns don't seem to have much effect on these folks.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is bad.  There is no substance in the movie.    It is just mindless, mindless, dumbed down trash.  You would have to be in a complete drug stupor to even watch it.  It consists of a young man (Josh Johnson) getting high on marijuana.  The police come in and he admits to them having done it. There is no real plot or purpose to this movie.   I didn't think this movie was bad at all.      I just don't get the point of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In my opinion this is the worst movie of all time   There are no laughs, no action, no suspense or even any suspense at all. It looks like the movie was shot on video tape with a cheap camcorder and edited with a computer, then the sound is bad and the acting is bad. Even the opening credits are awful   I really have no idea what this movie was supposed to be about   It is a bad parody of a horror movie   " It's all over but the screaming. "  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The last episode of the season is about a cop from the future who gets sucked into a movie about a boy who lives in the future and is in love with a girl with "too much hair". I hate this show and I will continue to hate this. The acting and writing are terrible and the script makes absolutely no sense. I am sure this show made a lot of money and is about to do a sequel, but I will never waste my time again with this stuff. I will find something else to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If anyone thinks that it was all a big misunderstanding, they should see this movie:  There is a lot of "I am not very good at this, I am not a very good actor, but I want to be" in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Frozen" soundtrack is terrible. A lot of the songs are very old and not catchy. It's as if Disney has gone back to the "Rent" era of the 60s and 70s. They just don't know how to be relevant anymore. This movie has an amazing cast of singers, musicians and film actors. There is a good story here. I don't see why it couldn't be a hit. I just can't think of anything bad to say about the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is all fun and games.   This is a movie about "Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year" to the poor kids of the world.  The movie is a very good example of what the term: "The Greatest Holiday Movie Ever Made!" is a fitting title for.  A great family-friendly movie about people all over the world enjoying themselves together through the holiday season.  As I said about the other review on this site, this is just a great movie.  I recommend it to everybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film was awful! The whole film is so bad, they were all so bad! The actress who plays the wife, is supposed to be an all American girl, but she is just so plain and boring. Her role as an American is nothing special, it is the same old role where she says "yes" and gives the other "yes". She is just another boring girl. The other part of her job is to be the maid for the rich man and he only wants his servant to be a beautiful young lady who is a virgin. This role is not only awful, but her character is also stupid, she does not have a clue about what she is supposed too do, because she has never been to a virgin's house. She comes to the house to teach the young woman how to be her maid and she says, she is to teach her to be more lady like, then she says she doesn't know anything about young women. This part is so stupid, how could anyone think she could teach the little virgin how to become a lady?! This part of the movie is just about her and the rich person playing with his servant. It is a horrible film and not even worth a negative rating.

When their plane crashes into a remote valley, they find a woman who has been there for thousands of years. Her name is Maya and she is the Maya, the woman to whom we pray for rain in the dry season, the one we pray to for a good harvest and the one whose face we find on the sacred object we are about to throw out. But first, Tom Cruise tries to find a way to get out of the plane without killing her." (from youtube)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have never seen the classic Western (the original is about a cowboy who doesn't want to live in a desert any longer)  this is a good movie to watch as it is a Western starring the great Clint Eastwood who is great in everything. There are a lot of Westerns on TV, but this is the one where the Westerns are real. This is one of those rare movies where if you don't like the movie you don:t like the director and you:re not going to like the film either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie about 100 times and it is always the same.   The story about a girl named Sara was a nice little story but I cannot give it more than a 4.  The acting is not much to get excited about and none of the other scenes are much to look at.  This has nothing to do with the movie and is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was going to review the movie and the story that is presented. What I didn't like was that when the police came to the movie house where this was shot, I felt like the cops came to arrest me, because as I said earlier in this review, the cops were all around. I don't think the movie was done well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am not an expert on the Japanese film industry.   Like many foreigners who are interested in Japanese films, I read all the reviews.  Most reviewers state that the Japanese seem to be more interested in the "Americanization" of Japanese films than on producing quality films in Japan itself.  I had the pleasure of attending several of these films in Tokyo and at one point I even took part in a film festival devoted to Japanese films.  The films I saw, with a few exceptions, were mediocre at best.  It's ironic to see Japanese films being compared with films made in America.  There is nothing like a good film to make you feel good about life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a strange mix of old school science fiction, a story about a man, and some interesting technology.   Unfortunately this movie had a lot of things wrong with it.  First of all, it was too long, and it had a story that didn't make a lot sense. Also it was very boring, and was only there for the technology in the movie and then a strange movie to see. The story in this movie could have been better, the acting and the acting style could have improved. There were so many weird things in the story and in the acting it was just weird to watch.  The only thing that really made it good was the technology and the story that seemed to have some interesting things about it, but they never made it to the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are numerous films that are much better than this but i can not recommend this film as it is way too long and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I'm looking for a "bad movie" to watch in the late fall or winter, this movie isn't the one I'll pick.    For one thing, it's the wrong time to watch it (the movie is in February).   And, while the scenery looks fine to me, the acting is horrible and the costumes are awful.  There's even a song at the end that seems a bit too on the nose.  I would probably give this film two stars if it weren't for the fact that the actors are so bad.  So, if you're thinking about seeing The Lost Weekend, just don't do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so impressed by this film, that I watched it with my daughters. I even asked them if they liked it. They said they didn't like it as much as their mother and my wife. I think there were too many of the same jokes being made, that they could have told the original story better. I thought the comedy in it was pretty good, though. It's a fun little film to watch, as it has a good variety of songs throughout the film, and it's a nice treat to see a good director try his hand at creating a film. And in case the children haven't seen it before, and are wondering why the adults were laughing so hard, they don't have to look too far for their next entertainment. This movie is a classic, and I really hope you all enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been told that this movie is "one of the worst movies" since it features such things as a naked girl in a kitchen who talks about how much she likes hot dogs and a man who doesn't know how to ride a horse or drive a car (or a motorcycle, but he rides a horse in the movie). And when it comes to the music, I wouldn't be surprised if the soundtrack was called "How the hell is anyone supposed to hear these sounds in their head?" If you didn't know it was supposed to be an adaptation of the French play, "Les Voyageurs," you might think the film was made up entirely of French slang. I haven't been able to watch the movie all the way through since I had to attend a party at my college with my roommate, and I haven, in all likelihood, seen the film more than ten times already since it was made. In this case, that is exactly the point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the first few minutes we are presented with a group of old men (I'm not sure what kind of movie this is) who are in a hospital. This hospital has a huge problem. They are trying to treat a huge number of elderly people. I'm going to assume the "biggest problem" is the elderly people are all dead. The old men in the hospital are called to do their best to help out the elderly. Well, first thing I noticed about this movie is that every member of this group of elderly is very white. I mean they all look like they could be from anywhere. In fact, I had to double check that they are old white guys. I have never seen a movie that I didn't like when I saw it. At the end of the movie, all these old men are given a big old gun to take a little old lady for a ride. This isn't too bad of a movie for a first date. However, it wasn't a good date. I wish someone had given me a second date.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a movie for everyone. In fact, you should probably skip it because the ending is pretty bad.  The story takes place in 2032 where a man is trying to find himself once again. He has just gotten out of prison and decides to spend the rest of his days looking for something that once defined who he was. There is the typical romantic comedy of old with a dash of sci-fi and a good dose of humor. The acting here is pretty good and the story is well written. I did find the ending pretty funny though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie that is also a very funny one.  I don't know why but it seems that everybody from that generation has the same name.  And I am going to say something about this movie.  I know I am boring but it is not because I am bad.  In fact this movie is one of the best out there.  It is an entertaining movie at times but sometimes the actors and scenes just fail to impress.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You're looking at what is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. If you don't know how awful this movie is just look at its tagline:  "How's your family?". This is the type of movie that's supposed to bring you back to your childhood, however, the film's story line does not work. The father, while trying to find his child has been kidnapped and taken to an old house that's been abandoned for a long time. The mother is still alive however in the old house. They decide to leave the old farm to get the child but find out that there is a whole army of the evil king living there.  There are a couple of bad things in this movie: First, they filmed the fight scene by using an old TV that was not even working and with the old lady, who's supposed be a woman, using a camera that only had one lens, you would think that her eyes would be blurry because they couldn't be seen. Second, even though this is an English language movie, you can still see that it was produced by a group of Americans. That's all I can say about that. The bad acting is what kills the movie and the terrible music can't make it any better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really don't want to ruin the movie for you. I really don  I was going to give it a negative rating because there was just not a whole lot to like about it. And I think this is because this is a movie that really just tries to capitalize on the success of "Beverly Hills Cop III." I guess its one of those movies that's a little too big to be taken seriously. So much so that most people don't even try to figure out what is going on, which, when it works like it does, is a nice change of pace.   The one thing that this movie does manage to do is have a good amount of action. There's really nothing to complain about in this area other than that most of the time it's pretty generic action. You know, like two cops who just shoot each other over and over again, and a lot of explosions and helicopters. And that's pretty much it.   to me, this movie just seems like a bad ripoff of "Lethal Weapon" that was made a little more blatant by the fact that this was made in 1991. It has to be pointed out though that the director, Mike Binder, had actually directed a number of episodes of "House". So he clearly has a good handle on the genre. I think that I'm going to leave this one out until it comes out on DVD. But I'm just gonna say this for the record, if you're looking for a movie to show your kids, this is not it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one bad movie. The ending is not only horrible, but stupid. A little girl tries to hide from an evil clown by throwing her little sister in a tree with a little red balloon, she tries to escape but then falls right through the balloon. In a hilarious scene she says "I'm dead now, I'm not alive, I'll never be alive again." This is the second straight film with this stupid ending (I can't find my copy of "A Night to Remember") and again the poor kid doesn't come through. I'm sick of seeing it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't remember much about this movie, but I remember that I had never seen a movie so badly written (as in it was bad!) that it was funny without being funny. I know a few people who had seen this one (and they liked it) so I've seen it twice and the other people I know had seen it too.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very skeptical about this movie. I heard about this "noir" movie on an anthology of film noir I attended about 10 years ago. Well I've never watched a "no" movie. So I had no expectations. I was expecting an "intense" movie with a twist ending. It definitely didn't live up to those expectations. There was nothing in this movie I didn't like. Nothing to make it special. But the bad part is that it only took me about 25 minutes to figure out who the bad guy was. He just appeared and he was the bad guys! And the film isn't as good as the title. I know that a story about a corrupt cop who goes bad in a "cops versus robbers" type movie would make for some great material, but I just couldn't stand the film. I'm going to have to go on a long hiatus from watching horror movies and "noirs" until something more interesting and unique than this movie comes along. - October 25, 2015I didn't think it would be good
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really liked this movie, but I'm glad I never saw it at the cinema!  The story seems fairly normal to a kid. There are some cute jokes throughout the movie, and there is a funny song at the end that has something of a sweet message.  It's not very well written for my liking, but that does not stop me from liking it.  At the end of the movie I do wonder how many other things the writers and director could have put in the film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To those who love their guns and have not seen The Lone Ranger:  This is a good movie for those who can appreciate the art of film-making. I would like to thank the makers of the film, George Roy Hill, Donald Sutherland and William Atherton for bringing to the screen one of my favorite heroes of the old west.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wasn't much in for this movie. It was pretty boring, and the movie only lasted a little over 2 hours. It has some interesting plot points, but it's not very enjoyable. If you really want to see a good story about a boy who tries to make a living with a sword, this is an interesting one. If your not in the mood for a sword and a boy, then this isn't the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A little less than 2 hours and I don't think the audience will be coming back for more.  I mean come on, we've got a woman who's just gotten out of prison, who is about to be released, who wants to get married, and has a lot of stuff going on.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part of the movie is the beginning where the main character tries to run away from home to get away from a horrible family, a bunch of whiny brats who are so obnoxious that if the kids had been in a cartoon of The Smurfs they would have had to be killed.  I have to agree with the reviewer who called the story "boring."  It has a simple formula with the main characters, the parents, the brother and the sister, and then a bunch more annoying characters who only show up every half hour to complain about one another.  In fact, the movie goes so over the top at times that the story is hard to follow at times.    I don't want to give away anything, but there is a lot more than one "little girl" in this movie.  I haven't seen the movie yet so I don`t know why the name of the main female character is "Sue" or why her brother "Jim" is the worst guy in the world, but I sure hope that there will be a sequel!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you ever thought this film had the potential to be the next "Fahrenheit 451" (which was bad, by the way), you should know that's really the only similarity this film has to a book.  I have read the book so many times that I can hardly recognize it.  It's all about a boy and his dog. The dog gets stuck in a hole and is lost in the woods. The boy is trying to find his lost dog so they can run away from the evil people who have set fire to the woods to kill the animals, but the dog is too small to escape.  And the boy starts making his dog into a fire breathing fire demon who will bring the fire and kill everyone.  The end.   I do not know where I am going to get the money to see this movie anymore, but I sure hope the box office numbers do not suck too bad, this movie was not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While it does seem to have a pretty good cast of actors, the movie does take a long time to go anywhere, in large part because most of the dialogue is delivered by two guys. At one point, they talk about how they're going to get rid of the rest of the guys (or girls), then one of them, the one who always talks first, says something that you would expect from a guy, but it ends up sounding exactly like something you'd hear on an episode of the Andy Griffith Show: "I don't believe in Santa Claus. I just don't."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would love to say that I found "Tomb Raider" to be a thrilling, action packed epic adventure. It's just a bit disappointing that the only hero Lara Croft looks like someone who's been on the cover of a Seventeen magazine.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not going to give this film anything less than a 1 star. This movie is not good at all. The story is lame and I was expecting a better movie. The characters are stupid and there is nothing to be done with them. In fact, there is not even any development in the film. The only thing it had going for it was some nice acting and the music was nice, but not enough to elevate a film this bad. I was actually rooting for the bad guys and it didn't help that the bad guy's voice is actually the voice of one of the characters. It's like the movie was trying to be clever and had the wrong actors in the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be sure I love this movie, and I always wanted to see a movie about the war between the good guys and the bad guys in the South. After seeing a few different films with the characters who fought, this was the best. The acting was top notch, and the action scenes were all great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is all over the place and it doesn't really take off. It's a "noir" thriller. It was a bit of an improvement for me but the characters were rather bland.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the movie, a little boy goes to the ocean to play, and a shipwreck takes him. He finds a strange little woman on the shore and they talk for the entire movie. I mean, she can't really be there, she's wearing a wig. But it's just like, a "Little Mermaid" movie, if "Mermaid" was a movie about a tiny little woman who wears a wig! The music is OK. The movie does contain a few nice, and amusing lines. However, the acting is just awful. (No matter how much I tried to "get" the people in it, I could never.) I wouldn't want to watch a "Merman" movie even for a minute. It is just too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a big mistake to go to the movies.  I'm not going to say I like this movie because it wasn't bad, but it was nothing worth seeing.  For one it had no plot; it just had a girl who was abducted by aliens, who wanted to make love to her; and it just didn't have any of the things that make for a good movie.  The action scenes were dull; the girls and aliens were all the same with the exception of one: and when she was abducted, she was so bored that she had to be sedated.  One of the best scenes that's there was when her teacher went to meet her kidnappers.  Now, in the old days in movies, there was a time that when a girl was abducted she would be seduced and rescued.  This is how Hollywood made movies then, and these movies have lasted through the years.  Unfortunately this one isn't the same.  And that's the point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really hope this does not become another generic action movie where the heroes always defeat the bad guys, this is a movie about a small town girl who wants to be a teacher but it seems all the kids in her town are out to make trouble for her. The film is filled with all kinds of action. The movie is very well done with no unnecessary stunts.   A movie where we see people who think they can take on the world, it does have a lot of laughs in it, but it is not really a comedy. I liked it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well... it's time to put down the bad.   It takes a good movie (or movie, rather, for the remake) to remind us about the joys and pleasures of childhood (or childhood and adolescence for the young ones), and I feel that this one is one of those.  I grew up in a big family, in a suburb of an urban city, which is now called "Holland". This is a place where the "little people" go in search of freedom, adventure and "freedom", as the saying goes.  My parents had a lovely home, they had two horses, they loved their dogs, and the boys loved to play on the playground.  One of the most exciting childhood experiences was when I was twelve, we all went to Holland to stay the summer (although we were still under the British government's occupation.  This was at the same time as the end of "The Empire of the Sun", a film with the greatest acting of its time, and a memorable cast.  A large part of the movie takes place in a small Dutch village. It takes place during the summer, which may well have given the filmmakers an idea of what they were looking for.  (My children do not remember that film very well either.  But I am sure they will remember "The Man Who Fell to Earth" a lot better.)   My other childhood memory (I was eleven) is of a trip to see the Disney musical "The Wild Boys", which I saw on Broadway.  They have changed it somewhat since I saw it, but the songs still have a great deal of charm and joy.  The best part of this movie, for me, was the performance of Robin Williams. I did not grow up with much film-acting, but I remember seeing a lot of Williams in my early years.  His voice was lovely, the words always were simple and to the point. The movie also has a lot to say about the pleasures of an adventure adventure.  There are many things that make one happy in this movie. It has a good plot, and, of course, the music.  It is a small movie, and yet it shows so much of the joy of childhood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were some very minor improvements from the original but it still wasn't very good, as I was anticipating. However, the remake of the classic film is better than the original. It has a very good sense of humor, is quite funny (especially the part where the car's engine is stuck) and is surprisingly touching at times.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's hard to give a film a higher rating than this...the plot is bad, the acting is bad (one of the worst IMO), the music is bad... and some of the actors don't even seem to be trying.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, it's a pretty good movie. The "truck" part was a bit lame-looking, I don't know about the rest. The special effects were kinda cool, and a little scary for some reason, too. The ending was cool. This could have been a lot worse, I'm just not sure how it was supposed to end, though, it wasn't bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is an obvious rip off of another famous film, with a pretty great cast. It was an interesting story with some interesting ideas, however the script was so bad that it left me frustrated and angry as I watched it! I was left with so many questions left unanswered (where are the ghosts? Where were the ghosts and the "soul hunters" during the final battle??) and yet I could not understand why a "professional" filmmaker would be so unprofessional when producing such a lousy film! I would give the film a rating of 1 1/2, but I am not sure why a viewer would bother to see it. The quality in this film was so poor that I can not give it a higher rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A well-told story:  This is a wonderful little story about a young boy named Peter Parker in the 1960s. Peter is the only black kid in his class, a member of his school's drama club. He always looks smart and pretty, and his big sister Mary Jane is the sweetest person you'd ever want to meet. One day Peter learns that he is a clone of Peter Parker, the famous Spider-Man, and the headmaster of the High School for Gifted Youngsters. The teachers think that Peter is trying to pass himself off as a good kid, but Peter soon finds out he is not. He discovers that he has been cloned by Professor Dr. Octopus (he goes by Dr. Ock, I think). The clone has no idea how he got here and doesn't know where the real Peter is. Then the head of the school, Dr. Stacy (she goes by Stacy), tries to make things right by giving Peter back his original costume. Of course things don't go well, since Spider-man is trying not to become the new Spider-Woman. Peter gets the chance to get back to his old self when Dr. Drago, aka the Red Goblin, appears and demands that Peter be the new Green Goblin. After this, Peter becomes an even bigger geek than ever and his sister Mary is forced to stay away from him. At last the headmistress gives Peter a chance to be a hero once more (he becomes the new Captain America) and he goes back home to find his parents who have been murdered.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really bad bad movie made by a bad filmmaker who made a really bad film.    I had been watching this on a whim a few years ago and got to the point of "I've had enough" in no time.  So what a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to say that the plot was pretty solid until the end when the story starts to get a little bit ridiculous. Not that this is a bad thing. It's just a little silly, and the ending seemed a little forced. If it were to be a movie starring a more credible character, the film might be alright. As it is, it's just plain boring.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The man who wrote this is a total wanker, like his other movies."   This was one of the most tedious films I have ever seen. It wasn't that bad in parts because it wasn't boring and there was a certain charm in the story as well. But I just hated this film. I hated its characters, its themes and everything about it. I felt like I had been punched in the stomach. What more could you want from a film like this? I hated how it was written. I didn't like how it seemed like they were trying so hard to make something interesting, but then it all just turned out to be another lame film. There wasn't a real punchline in this one (and I hate that term. It's an insult) it all seemed like a cheap attempt to get some extra income. The acting was pretty bad, especially the one I remember best, the chick who was supposed to be hot. I guess if I had seen this back then I would have thought she was the biggest loser at acting in the world. This isn't to say that all of this is bad, there was one part where a lady called Alice in love with her dog. What a great movie that was! I liked a lot about this movie. I really liked the art style and I loved how the film was edited. However this movie just didn't work for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know this is a terrible movie.   But at least it had the balls to put an actual story at the heart of the story.  It should have been called "I Was an Asshole".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be completely honest with you, I never expected to like this movie. It is like a bad episode of "Gilligan's Island" which I hated so much. The characters are like a collection of cardboard cutouts of archetypes like a child's drawing of a character on a sheet of paper. The scenery is so bad, it's like an episode of a bad 90's kid show.    In short, it is awful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "My name is Mike and I'm a comedian.  But this is not a comedy.    It's a documentary about an insane serial killer, a man who went from being a normal guy into a killer who terrorized a city, then killed himself.  And all of this through a strange case that we'll all never really understand.  It is a movie with a bizarre story that should never get made and a plot that feels like it went through the motions.  This isn't to say that this movie is bad, it's not.  The story is not bad at all, but the execution here just wasn't up to par.  There is a nice twist in the end but it just feels like they went through and reused every frame, instead of letting that story go on and letting things come to an end.  I like that this is a straight up true crime but there's no way it would ever be a good movie.  "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing about this movie is it does what it says on the tin. We are introduced to our very own "Kong" aka King Kong, and he is a gigantic beast who is out of control as we follow the story of him and his ape brethren, and his many adventures. What really impressed me in this movie was that in one of the most famous scenes in movie history, the kong is seen flying a kite with other apes all gathered around him. They do this because it is very symbolic and has a very special meaning for everyone. It is a classic scene in cinema. This kong may look as if he is not fit to be king, but he does not go around acting like a spoiled brat. We also get to see him play a game of chess with his ape comrades as well as playing with a lion, and all of these moments are truly magnificent. This is a movie with a lot of heart, it has moments of humor in it, and even the villain is a great character who is not out of place in a movie like this one. The acting, the soundtrack, and the action sequences that are featured in the movie are all amazing. There is a special moment where an ape is captured, and they are all seen together as they are chained up in a jail cell. The music and the actors who bring this movie to life are very good too. And of course, the scene of the king, Kong, getting captured by the police is also very symbolic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What could go wrong? What could not go wrong. A big-ass movie with a large cast (including some of Hollywood's best) that had no reason to appear in a small movie theatre. The story involves a big-headed, overweight man trying to get the girlfriend of a young woman who looks like Marilyn Monroe. What else do you need in an adventure movie? There was a scene in the theatre where an actor (and I'm sorry to say, one of the best acting I've seen in a long time) had the misfortune to walk down the middle of the theater's aisle. He made his way out of the theatre like the good little boy he was, but what a disaster for this production. He didn't make the end of the movie, he was not even in the movie's end credits. It could have been worse as the only scene that really made me cringe was when we were introduced to a big fat woman who was trying to eat an entire pizza.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really felt sorry for these poor girls. This film is not a masterpiece, but I do feel for these girls. I did not think much about the plot (even though I had read it many times), until the end... but it is a good story. I am very sad that this film is all we get of the movie "Coyote Song". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this film many times over the last several years. I have never been impressed. It is hard to watch. I don't know why I bother to give it three stars, or at least two.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A great flick, especially if you're a fan of horror. The acting is superb, and the pacing is tight enough to keep the gore at a steady pace. It's one of the scariest and most memorable movies to come out of the '80s, and is a perfect movie to watch before Halloween. - January 16, 2004What a treat.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a group of people who live in a farm. They live together in a large building with four rooms and two toilets for the five people. It does have a couple of interesting people in the movie: a black cat, and a big, hairy, red dog that appears to be dead a few times. There's a little child, but it's not a good movie for young children to see. The bad actor, George C. Scott (of TV show, The Lieutenant) is quite bad and the rest of the people in this movie are also pretty awful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was funny at first, then it got boring, and at the very end, it felt even more like a bad joke. I liked the character of Marge, but what could the movie have done with her? I felt that she was forced into the role so that a white guy could be made a character. Even though the movie is funny, I wouldn't want to see it ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no need to read this book. You will never understand why a guy is a jerk. His life has sucked from beginning to end, he's an idiot with no self respect, and all his friends hate him. It's the perfect film if you want a jerk, but no good movie for a good guy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There isn't much to complain about with a movie that's already old news. The actors and actresses are good enough but they don't have much to do. The story is a bit simplistic but it's really no big deal and the acting is good. There are a few scenes that are a bit too repetitive but nothing too egregious. Overall, it's nothing but a waste of time.
