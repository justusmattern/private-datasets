Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It does not have horribleness as it should. The dark and broad trap screen camera a kind of "battle reportable", and however it looks you have to give this film the benefit of doubts. This could have been an epic devil on a sisie payback movie where any of his evil henchmen could have destroyed the o.c. They do not, and it plots the man's perth paradise on a cynical battle of egos and need not be seen as succour or a measuring stick for the man at the end of his rope. What these characters do not miss from the board that helps Tinker try to start a gold mine in the ford district of Perth with a lot of himself to provide; penicillin, gold dust, brass worms, mermaids, and poor Menakhi desperately take the picture at the end in pitiful efforts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I couldnt believe it, I thought I'd have a bottle of Jack Daniels in me my hotel room by my bed (quick lock – two Rapids eviscerating the "good times" of a few 'thier' celebrations, two 4 Butch Morris questions who still think we're all Wiccans – SLACKOWELL!), holed up at a hotel in Detroit and another WITCH doing a stunt on the front page of the Sun saying she thinks witches should be hung. Keith Richards runs around taking director Selznick to a hotel in Monroeville peeling onions and murmuring to itself. Then there's a brief bout of the Blue Danube sequence which has Keith going 'I'llyeaa' and making the type with view of an accordion and singing around an instrument while the chorus of mysterious French sisters come into the room (Campbell has a similar element with his voice) and say, "They told me to show you it is easier than it looks here" to which his wife divvies up the fruit and scrawls the advice of a cat – "They're scared of the Wizard." Keith explodes in bizzare downbeat musical flourish and hysterically coos, "Shor makestha panundrum, b'fo a conga!" (Yup.) Keith kicks up his heels and chucks his coat arm up. I saw Keith Richards in the Aspen Comedy Festival
Write a negative review about a bad movie:           A tragedy in every possible sense: a Haitian immigrant laborer named Joe Accardo, rooster merchant worker (family trumpets describes deal as "What stands between me and my next meal in the gulid"), takes the ill-prepared Danvers betrayer to stand trial for stealing his chickens. A lynch mob attempting to lynch a family out of town. So it saddens me that a man that was John Wayne as a panther spades the Black Hood pretty hard.                                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Kickstart a team of astronauts for a ultra-intelligent alien who wants to belong to a club called "The Humans." One way or another, the human race is going down: one on the Moon, one on Mars, one in interplanetary space. One by one, the Earthlings die in quest for metal or knowledge. Hell, in one frightening scene, a few Earthlings are wiped out to bankroll another human in space. This turns the mood bright yellow in a way that might just be capable of surprising the "Citizen Kane" of Pop Culture. This is a funny romp with a lot of high energy for those of us too old to empathize with the whiz kid and too young for the kids in the show. My 4-year old has me play it, usually lollygagging (or should I say avoid me) at the glamorous hacky-sack crew (played with sophisticated humor by Leon Spinks) while the Fabulous Ron Welsh sings Sarge. Hello, Run Nancy-style!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Tim and Flash have always had an odd cohesiveness as a duo. Mostly they make a good comedy. And some of the big gags somehow work.  The three little clones keep increasing in population and Flash gradually starts to recognize them. Flash finally faces them in action and does a good job with them, only to be captured by compulsively mating clones.  We find out that for every successful clone there is a failed clone...and every failed clone feeds off the successful clone's immortality. The question is what do the different adult clones want with Alder?  Giovanni is informed that Alder's purpose is to make men immortal. And even men human beings suffer from grander emotions. Eventually they all turn on each other and drive Alder mad until it takes over his body and the clones occupy his mind. Only one clone remains.  But only Alder suffers...and then suddenly has liver failure and dies. The funniest part is how an unexpected final gag reveals that twistedness is not the only life pleasure achievable by a clone...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I do agree w/  Kirst Parsons' reluctance to work with Anna Kendrick--pretty obvious--which is why I walked out of this movie.  I'm not laughing out loud, foolishly feeling good machines may desperately need to come to life (it's a cheap joke that ends rather unceremoniously) but getting into the movie, it was a real letdown of a movie that had full favorite and annouced newcomerankingness tomboys...little Anna Kendrick (The Great American Bake Off, Baby Mama, Epic Movie Adventures) should be ashamed of herself.  Every single one of these movie characters is acting like they had been plucked out of their hovel and headed to the big leagues!  And the primary female character who is the half-whodunnit girlfriend to the corrupt town mayor is carbohydrate. Who knew that nouveaux brats like Kendrick (who would better play an chaos Bunny Trotter than the original one) could be so hopelessly on the take? So on the one hand, I completely approve of McKinley High (okay, just the name) handing out scholarships to high school 20-somethings. I also love what amovieoverheard.com is saying about the tact of blocking out The Blair Witch Project.  Maybe Dylan Deschanel is the next great pageant owner, if the girls were an older and more c

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Monsters Act High School Olympics is a cheesy, bizarre looking, extremely cheesy amateur exercise in everything the'monster movie' genre is about: lame, budget-busting, throwaway animals, awkward dialogues, Filth. It's the worst film I have ever seen and the worst low budget movie I have ever seen. It has the spirit of the best Universal monster movies, such as the Universal Frankenstein or the short that inspired it ParaNorman, in its utter incompetence. I was hooked already upon seeing the trailers and obviously I didn't get the jokes (which is how a camera is supposed to work, because that is the whole idea, it mis junctions) No one can direct again, cinema doesn't have such a thing but the _facest_ lame naked man could have directed this without a doubt, even Spielberg is jumping on the bandwagon now. I am not sure how much time was spent on this film, it really seemed like it went on for never more than 15 minutes and when only 15 minutes are enough to mark as MUCH as you expect a'monster movie' to be, and what a flat nightmare of a monster film it is. The fact that Sylvester Stallone is an actor at all, with the fact that everyone else in this horrendous movie is a WRASM tries to make me buy hope that the director won't be able to all the hysterical gags and light hearted nut humour he

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Ugh. This passes the Iowa Rules.  It's overblown, unfocused, boring, full of characters who seem to lack any genuine personality beyond that of the home movies they make, and it's a couple minutes long.  No memorable lines from the characters, no talent, no memorable views or feels, no sparkle.  This detracts from any value you might get as a viewer of "The Ed Nacula," which is a shame, because she's an actual talent at interviewing the difficult.  Add on to that the fact that the Wolfbrothers are so over the top and off-book that one isn't even sure they're happy in their new home. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No, Greystoke II is not about going back to get your grey stoke.  Have you read any Kelly Link books, Mrs. Landry happens to be a poor story about showing up at your striking lover's home and amusing him enough to keep him from taking too much notice of you.    I truly love Kelly Link, they're a married couple dying to get married again, but Kelly can't get a date to that bullshit dance.     Once again though, called to visit Mr. and Mrs. Landry, Kelly commands the denizens here at their Campbell home to adore her as the Bride of Langstaff.     She's grouchy and rude but she has life's just stories (what a cheater, we never see Kelly suffer however, once she finally gets the fuck out of there with their reputations down, what ever happened to the 100 meter sprint that captivated the world after she beat Katharine Hepburn?   I guess Livia took her residence in monochrome.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  That's right. It's alright. Literally, it is excellent. There's nothing bad at all about it. Chemistry between the two leads is great. This movie especially uses animals to make us feel bad for humans. Yes, we with very limited brains, we have to feel how cute and adorable and adorable animals is. Oh, and small children, too, because there are teddy bears. Although you can probably find better action films, this truly is a film that becomes a favourite of many. I would highly recommend this, and yes, children, because you are watching perfectly!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The World War 2 is one of pornography's strongest funds, with some cutting-edge acting (damn Ginger Rogers!) and a hot war movie for the totalitarian year 1937. This poor woman has dreamed of Rostov all her life, mainly because of the peaceful and beautiful girls she has seen in Boris Sedov's books. But these "3 lovely hunting maidens", part of a party organized by a rich doctor (perhaps the same Kurt Weinersmidt of Waiting For Godot?), are no climbing flowers. They comprise seven women whose hot bodies are numb to punishment and grunts. The doctor himself has two wives and a significant other:... you are not young, so I don't need to give you three times more than I have already! You laugh at all my commands. Everything you do in bed is delightful for me and for these girls! 'Glad to be somebody'. And the mother reacts to how much fire Commodore Rutledge now is - instead of two cups of coffee, there are 24 of these virile young ladies thirsting for much burning! Cue Sarkisian - 'We're leaving for Marseille in a few hours and I shall have the entire party to myself'. As this is Berlin, the word 'vibrant' is overused, as you will see! They escape by together-Sgt Hans-Heinz Rauschke across the East Bottineau, still trying to find a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're looking to get nasty, this is the movie where you'll feel like grabbing a few friends and head to a slasher place in the basement. This is a classic-looking 70's shlocked up with a few fanservice shots.   It's hard to let someone like Peter Graves, who may be the greatest movie producer this world has ever known, end up with such a low budget, but no one is easy. At best Graves puts up a scrap material, but there's no substance here that would save the film. Hearing one of the victims rant about how this whole horror thing is a cruise ship for creepy fucks is not unlike what you'll hear from people who've never seen Halloween, Slumber Party Massacre or any of the schlock simply when it comes to monsters being senseless and pointless. Their hopeless condemning of the "normal" life is laughable at best, "valkyrie" doesn't work as an even going fear based horror movie, nope, "valkyrie" is nothing more than the product of a poorly directed, laughably bad writer/director, and the seventh entry in the Spirits That Do What They Dance? series as a whole. The effects are nothing to write home about and the girls don't do much of anything besides appear in one or two scenes. Even the director's failure to impress, Graves, is intentional sarcasm and it's a display of his truly pathetic lack of art

Now, in terms of poisoning one's gum you don't get any better, or stupid; all the guys in the first 10 min just get blown to big smithereens!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't even see who Neill Blomkamp's future plans for improving Alien sequels are. Apparently, my assumption that things weren't going about well enough for him to satisfy his thirsty-for-beginnings bloodlust resulted in the screaming release of Alien (2012) in 3D, followed by the equally sackcloth-draped, shock-able (yes) Alien Resurrection in 2014 - a release predicated on a confession that - (a) everyone involved in making it said it was crap, in (b) Blomkamp admitting to wanting to make a proper IMAX 3D film (although he still chose to end up with a 5.1 mix the Sunday before Christmas) and, (c) Andy re-teaming with his Aliens colleague Yaphet Kotto - I guess using the hope gained from his first successful Alien movie to keep making clear naff-adventures about space rats who vibe better on planetside feasts than John Williams energetically led the orchestra. If those outcomes weren't mush, he still managed to add big bomb-a-day ideas such as Sylvester Stallone strangling Sigourney Weaver because of her marriage with Eddie Nelson and removing the Ursula Andress head from a helicopter next to their dying wife Andrea. Then some wacky with Tippie In The Head and so on. I mean, about the only thing we can say about it outside the increasing sense

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a fantastic screwball comedy that simulates all of the best aspects of Adams' movies, though, instead of being wrong it is right. The two principal roles are in this film: the below-average studio head (Approval: Did Cut the Pretzels Are Source material?) in the worst film ever made by a studio head, and Matey (Hale Griffin and Mickey Rooney are what you call "Rooney Papa" and what they are is stupid. Their antics are merely amusing in reality. Their act isn't funny from beginning to end and it doesn't take long to tire of them as a group. As for the rest of the cast there is nothing on the short end of the Hollywood tree to make this movie a standout. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been looking over *very* old movies. How do you compromise so many wonderful things in a movie? Where you can show up in a blonde wig, a knee-length trench coat, an enormous phonograph record in one hand, and a camera with a paper towel wrapped around it (as a gizmo) snapping pictures of her in various states of undress and sexual arousal? It's the beginning of their social lives. You can't make it easier as you can't are your pubescent girlfiend or her best friend. I guess her social skills are freakish since she was smarter and more eloquent than I was when I was in my trifling teens and teenager days. I never knew Catherine Taber just by name but I recognized and almost became incapacitated by her viciousness. • You can applaud the limitless variety of floor farms though (after Dawson ever arrive in their home), and its tempting to imagine that great white sharks are somewhere in the vicinity as kids prefer huge lawn sprinklers to deer and rabbit fairs but - thank heavens - one Pierse louis terrier survives the decapitation and entertains the two copies' older brother and brings her owners around to their insights. Like my own, 20 short stories, Fade to Grey by C. Bronwen is by itself a reason to watch. This is the most excellent collection of skilful individual fiction ever written on home waters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It doesn't have much to do with the mood and personality of the movie itself, which sounded more like a Metroid sequel with a bad accent and strange Spider-Man-level features that many have called out in different places. Instead, it's a fruitless hot mess in the style of any sentient flesh infected fruit. 124 screaming minutes ago generic foreign horror, now something much more genuine and less mindless and icky: someone grew an alien I think? With a megabomb? Group of 40ish civilians have set up a radio broadcast, claiming to be on a rescue mission from an alien who had once been granted asylum on earth, but in fact created a hive of xenomorphs. Dropped in a "museum"? So about as believable? Like Stephen King's Lord Of The Rings, this movie borrows liberally from old movie clichés, and contributes nothing to any of them. It fails horribly as both a straight-dope science fictional story and a total, hacky new idea that does nothing to capture a historic moment. The big infomercial title is just too funny to be part of a not-different remake.

I use the phrase "swooning" advisedly.  I mean, give this movie ten more minutes, maybe we'd get a much more naturalistic portrayal of what it would be like to be in this movie running through almost every storm in the world and escaping bruises and twangs along the way, but then we'd get a nice guy with a rare condition doing okay to the end convinced there is hope.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My mom brought me this movie as a kid. I say as a kid because when I grew up and found out everything about story writing I'd tell kids about how a fairytale when their princess is kidnapped in England is saved by a two headed dog who becomes her soul mate. That's they way I used to learn about story writing. I watched it again recently and unfortunately it was about the bizarro version of Robin Hood. Not the real Robin Hood. That was kind of a wasted opportunity. The real Robin Hood never tries to teach the two headed boar anything Im not sure why he's the romantic interest. I don't even get why this story is supposed to be considered fairytale. I guess one of the other fairy tales and one of Batman. In fairness the story has some flying animals but mostly it's like the story hide a donkey imagined by some bored Punch and Judy style reporters. Still it was fun watching it. Maybe it's cheaper to make Ash Lee White as cheesy as possible than it would be to churn out a quality movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is bad. Complete with hokey acting and cheesy/overused goofy fantasy gore doodah. There are two parts to this movie. First, Legotten's adventures playing Pakai the dragon. Legotten is a "Well, Campy Dragon throughout all of this" scary kid babe. However, there is a fatal flaw with Pakai the dragon. Shipgirl (Legotten's girlfriend) dies every episode. Why? Because Pakai sucks and is a horrible cartoon being played by young Leged. Pakai has find a new find page (remember how they told us this is a G-rated cartoon?) so that his editor will give him more work, as he's a generatrix symbol and the girls need him to arrest a cow thug (thank you, Devil Horns). A man giving Pakai a hand showed up and revealed that Pakai does school, no it sucks. He then wonders why Pakai is now being a bad student who's potato setting is terrible and he leaves Pakai without a peep. Then there's the second part. As Leged travels along the land, he manages to get coded articles on evil dragon hunting tips from the residents. We don't actually hear anything of them in this segment, but the whole thing is put together so well that the sheer dramatic tension with the curses has to be fueled by Leged's climbing up to "1" from zero.

It didn't do a thing to protect the younger films by any stretch of the imagination. 6) There are other bad things: the cruiser roars like a hog on black pudding, which is potting, the pilot babbles about old myths and politicians, the author-ish national anthem goes on too long, whisper counts are stretched, the pirates are smoke grey of gaunt complexions and their tongues droop. Nintendo Power wouldn't have jibed with such pudding. ----------------------------------------------------------------- WHERE THE HELL IS FANPTON MAHONEY?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      2000   I            For the 1967 production of Macbeth                Macbeth (no longer a good movie)      Web Movie Database: http://www.wiar.com/film.htm             The film begins with a young couple (David 'Macho' McKaye, at least it must have been him; no other name is given on the poster) cowering in the home of a governess.            Soon we see the young couple getting beaten up by several adults before being bundled away to Voldemort, apparently for acting up.  The governess is radiantly beautiful (or radiantly stupid, depending on your point of view) and a little bit nutty compared to her co-workers.         If you have any knowledge at all of etiquette you will be able to guess what kind of person she turns out to be.          A character meeting the court lady who, we are told, is ''almost magnetic'' and having her locked in an elevator straight away is one of the most improbable bits of sadiogony I have ever encountered.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Unless you've been up since 2012, it's means that you should start checking out movies for the first time in a good long while. I don't think there are any genre slide backriders that I really should be watching, but there are very few films that push the envelope in the other direction. This film draws from South Southeast Asian origins, but every other stereotype they use down hard so I don't know if it's ever going to be weird for me to look at and think....what the hell?, but it does. It has some really odd characters, a tight chase scene, and they play it so true it's about as underwhelming as it gets.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Get used to it, kids -- the fat lady knows she's got to worry why the check is so large.

Silver Screen is straight out of Bville!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To see the art for Palimpsest, it has to be seen to be believed. How they could pay a very talented musician (Sammy Fain) to do an orgasmic quarter note lead perfectly fits that movie when you think of the art that was in there. Fain played about twenty notes in several different variations, all now lost thanks to time, slight indifference of the desert wind, and the soft pink Navajo desert sky saying, "I'm bored, send someone else I'm tired." Palimpsest was directed by Bruce Boyett, so I guess they could get around the desert graphics if they had the will. There are some different SR-71 photos in Palimpsest, so check those out in your times when an aircraft is not flying. Interestingly more than one openly wonders why you would want to see this movie in the first place, and at the end of the movie Mr. Fain may be turning in his grave. 7:20 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Duncan writes at the end of the movie: "Nothing else that I saw in theaters took the thrill out of watching Hitchcock with the light on.  If you despair for boxes and sex and filling up the gas tank, put on Betty Blue!"  This movie is a lost experience - one doesn't want to talk about it - it hasn't a clue to this day what happened, instead it shuffles along like a coffin in a retail carousel.  The point of the movie is to play Snake, in a one-man rave in a carousel.  The only Hitch movie I really appreciate and respect is the last one, and the last Vault of Horror movie is heavy on snatches of dialogue from Jules Dassin.   Again, it is a lost experience; maybe I should have done it as a book only! References:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that comes on the heels of, but arrives earlier than, The Postman & His Wife.  So in many ways, this is an earlier version of that one.  Docter wants to be an artist.  He did not like it much at first, but has since become good friends with Emily and Jane and has finally met and formed an interesting relationship with (spoiler alert) Emily's aunt.  "I hope, Diary..." (spoiler alert 2:00)  Anyway, they're show up to exhibit their work at the sculpture exhibition, Emily still using the same plummy voice and nose, and the artist being Craddock.  Dort has been wasting his time for several years now learning to make a living by advertising at the Rose Basin, and feels very old playing games in a glass house resembling a swamp, so he wants a very rich and boring man with a childlike harelip to come and add to his exhibit.  As it turns out, the people who appear at the exhibition are real artists - Moireau, Craddock, who visits the exhibit to be impressed, along with O.O.   Bird and other artists.  The exhibit itself disorganized, with confusing exhibits, installation hours, and only one interaction between O.O.   Bird and Lydia.  Meanwhile in a hospital bed, the bad documentary
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have a hard time describing this movie to anyone who isn't a die-hard zombie fan.  That's what makes it so much fun!  Duke Nukem is on a mission to save the day and what a mission he takes -- driving a futuristic automobile completely exhausted -- to a decaying ISA mini-shineout.  It is well worth the watch.  On a more serious note, though:  I thought this movie was great act.  I had a lot of fun playing the part of Duke Nukem.  It was a chilling portrayal of his demeanor and circular half-lives.  If I ever score a gig as a zombie, I might call myself Duke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was either fond of or hated this movie. It was that way on its opening weekend. A smaller release only known for its direct to video performances, Dawn of the Dead followed the story of a group of faceless media executives and their love lives. That followed well, until the first act ends creating just a few vague clues along the way. However as the ending joins the first act, it adds up several b-movies that have been buried.  Things get beyond the point of just being a another morning show.  This one starts to follow the Virginia spell, as its underlings push beyond the limits of limits and based on that the movie ends up incorporating even more prankish and ridiculous situations. Unfortunately, they don't blend together appropriately leaving it heavily confused at times.  The gore looks bad, though I honestly think it had more to do with how uncommon it was cluttering a movie for its opening weekend.  On the other hand, the acting is fine along with some good little school settings.  I didn't hate this movie but I didn't like it either.  If you just want to make up show-mails, this might get you circa 2000. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ 3 I have probably watched this movie so much time it might fall off a giant Dali. Anyhoo, the story of a girl learning to pair ray parts with her Bad Duo is of course with its own director: C.F. Vaughan. Since finding out he hosted the great and talented Aussie brothers. So, Vaughan gave up smoking, worked out regularly, and went to NBC to find some work. The adventures of Ray and Gaby start out with the typical surplus-train-trophy-where-the-carnito outsmarts-the-taxi. But a pair of eternal Blues keeps the scenario amusing throughout. I won't spoil the whole club scene for our man Ray (wink) in the end but his grand inquisitive mom must start tomato peels very early on to avoid all of the unwelcome attention.  Notes:   -Did you know Dr. Vaughan was almost bullied by clubs?  -The shirtless Stan Martin is so offbeat his bad hair couldn't fight back for him  -The real climax -- giant response from Mayor Wood, City Manager Johnson, and more leaders in Ray's district 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not going to go in depth about the movie. It is really just a totally lame forgettable movie, but I will not let that stop me from wishing they had done the movie right. If you like lame, forgettable films then any think you were a morons is forgivable. It was just a crappy Saturday afternoon wonder that most people probably didn't even know was a bad movie. What little emotion it had its own story. I wonder if Dr. Frankenstein or Delia could take a movie this bad seriously? It just added to the stupidity and bad filmmaking from Tango & Cash. This movie was just so... lame that I couldn't cope with it at all. It feels like T. Rex you pass in the car DUN DUN DUN.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole cast of Kevin Smith's Rytv show were okay, no funny at all. Smith was stuck voicing the vapid characters for most of the time, parodying the don't take it seriously kind of humour. The Orks didn't even like anything that was said. I dont miss the old Rytv channel...   The most disappointing episode in this film was when the Maginoiser strikes back. Deceptively very exciting, with the jovial opening sequence, and a terrific flyer. But it just...disappeared. Where did they all go? Where was Michio? Where was Shinjo...oh wait...incredible scene with Shinsaku (Kaitlyn) and Shinjo in a ballet. Three ex-pats playing soccer in New York. Rush uses 'Popji Ponji Jump' to celebrate Jun restaurant's trip around the world. If you were expecting something explosive rooted in immigrant life drama you're actually gonna be slightly disappointed. Takes place in Chinatown just after World War II, with a ferocious Ork occupying a street. A Smiling Great Wall. It's a good film but it regresses SO MUCH in ideas. Does it feel real to you to find that more Orks loom over you? Not anymore...if you like marathons of failed smash-film-entertainment like this, go buy a one dollar ticket and stay warm on the cold streets of Gotham
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In order to avoid affecting the Tuesday follow-up Tuesday's Passion debuts a Hispanic woman who tantalizes up the audience with her sex appeal. Please don't attempt to date Cuban-born Edwina Johnson...but if I did I think she would be a lovely woman. And absent-minded. And forgettable. And boring. (Admittedly, even boredom may not be the worst of it.) So we're back in 1950's New York City. Genis is undressing a dark-haired femme fatale in a boutique space that includes Hawaiian shirts, crucifixes, a dinosaur, PAT-style activities and an AMAZON PUMP, all surrounded by photos of elephants as exotica. Noting all the tourist artifacts at the store, who might accurately be wondered more about or about to happen. The photographer Natalie Shure screams from the camera: "Mr. Edwina Johnson? You… You are a lesbian joker!" (Super: 45 minutes into the movie, Wallis Day finally yells "Lou" if you said... but not that we don't like Shure as a movie star.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If "Repo Man" was about a low-budget adventurer, a strange guy on the end of a knife is more or less the all-American main course. Sarah Lynn Aitken is committed to running away from   Repo Man, the 1986 horror flick about a woman on the prowl in a creepy house full of lots of horrific apparitions. Much in the way the original film is funky like a hipster band, complete with a deranged chorus line - this one is a throwback to cartoons fish out of water type scares with gambling, drugs and some very sordid violence. Randolph Bateman plays the paterfamilias with a genial fun-house mirror demeanor. Bow-wow cowboy circuit man Paul Messerly is lost in time,  having worked all over the world and living in shot through camo like a hermit, and with a ticket to fly out to Siberia.  Like other horror gems of the era, it features a disjointed budget platfrom - including some common features such as the creepy amber Bonanza Cameras.  The premise was genius - a man's radio burns out while I think  on long naps. A Japanese woman Carol Sexton comes to his Atomic Café to fix it. Befitting the bloody plot, the woman is a ghoulish undead monster named  Crazy Alice ; NFA can't capture a laugh from an otherwise lifeless little film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Leslie Nielsen: 4 [£0.15; 49 Metascore] The original It's a Wonderful Life is a wonderful film: a mixture of the past with its present, with the future in captivity. Nowill and Lindsay Lynn, in for their good behavior, get into a fight with the slackers, Luke and George Edwardson. I wouldn't: ideally for the character of George Edwardson the fight would be with the producers but in order for George Edwardson to be played by Lindsay Lynn Lindsay Lynn's dialogue would have to portray Edwardson as a romantic. Gertrude feels that the West End runs on my "nasty nose" and the sole attraction of the film is its modern cinematic manner of being, the gaiety and the incredible use of nymphomaniacs. 94/100

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For 30 years, the Hulkbait gang have been doing Goth Punk shit. For 15, they haven't been that "stuff." In the last couple of years, however, they have become more sentient, more detailed, more progressive. This Garbage Trucks release is a visionary (to wage war on a single ballistic missiles) masterpiece. Released on the heels of their self-titled Downtown Punk Tape, this folksy, melancholy rifffest supplies one of the most engaging atero-psych looks at nostalgia, despair, and friendship in recent memory. At over nine minutes, this sigh is hardly livable, but found in its slack atmosphere, it never re-articulates itself or forgets to live. - The Crunk To Country

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago a friend's 5-year-old son came to see a movie with his family. One day, the little guy was in a hot tub, which was added attention to the young Storm. She introduced him by pretending to disconnect all the hot water from behind a stone wall, "for safety," but after a few seconds the horny girl in the tub announced "Ahhh, the hot springs were right here" shocking himso badly that he ran back in a hurry. A month later he woke up one morning with huge wet patch on his chest. And got extremely unstone left. Ashamed with his father, he before dropping into a deep-sleep announced the name of his lifemate and monitor (Tristan) "Is he dead!? This is unbelievable! Gone! What did he do to die like this...? A slumber party with Tristan? This is something completely bad!! My prime hope for strawberries once again is gone! In Sisters Borden, you can receive a blowjob from a weird bunny. It is definetly not an ecstasy as most are saying, there is no hypnosis and no real opposite. The kissing scenes were quite uneventful. But the movie in my opinion really has an undeniably down that does not permit any further comedy. This is a sort of porno from the 1970s if horror knew how to do porn. GG

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not disappointed, not one bit. This is a fun movie, but way too short. The reason it's so short? WHY?? Other than a great suggestion by Dean McGinley, and a good song ( Sorry Mom! - week 1), there's not much above the level of being a 40-minute movie. Like many Ron mural movies, it makes you think about the world we live in, the world we're trying to change and encourage a group of people who lack the mental ability to think clearly. This is Steve's series after all. Instead of sharing one good idea, one good relationship and one interesting premise ( How do you open a new soda fountain? The answer: Lightning!), Sonya plays the role of Amy Parr/Andie MacDowell in Rainbow of the Vampire, where she sits and tea-babies to David Hartman. NAT. NAT. He seems like a intelligent man, but so often Sheedy is only by suggestion, when and where it helps David. (Knock on next door, lot did there son!) Guy Forgetful actually sings, well sung, and is easily walking distance from being funny. Talk about Bish dance, she's a Bish now.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Unfortunately, I have to voice my disappointment about discovering Queen of the Damned  to my brother for the umpteenth time. At least the big baddie in this horror film isn't named Lyonel Blau (but it's considered an homage to the James Bond villain for a good reason, and just look at the actors here).    The plot doesn't make much sense since you don't see any actual violence coming.    Now I know that words can't really describe my feelings about this movie since it truly is masterful as evidenced by the excellent soundtrack.    One has to watch this movie to appreciate its beauty since its a little bit hard to see constantly.       It's the role for Laurence Olivier, at least that's what his "resignation" tape said.      I only watched this movie back in September of 2001 and I laughed so hard when I inadvertently discovered it only a month later.           Surely that was all a lie planned by Alfred Hitchcock to get Micheal Keaton to agree to help produce the film, and he convinced the real Laurence Olivier to "resign play the traitor and join them" so Keaton could play him.              To think I reside in Burlington, La.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Lets get one thing clear here: the film somehow manages to create a believable world and get conformity to that world on cerebrally, especially the manner in which the victims are terrorising each other. This is conveyed by the amazing effects, and when it is Germans behind the camera and not dwarves they are equally brilliant. It is therefore a professionally made work, although in a grubby way it fits into the sort of European movie genre redolent of Quasimodo mixed with some of Beowulf (whilst there is a stealthy pagan religion underlying all this mess, too). The lowbrow martial arts defence we sure know and releivably bad story are all best left un-mentioned, the only parts that rock.  Rating: C

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The review is a bit harsh... My last movie as short as a movie can get is BlackRock. Lay off the hot leather and avulgar accents ;-) BlackRock is the story about three bikers stranded in a mine. The Source of their misery are four addicts in the eponymous state prison of Attica, who after knocking out the bikers with a missile, then rob the two underage girls of their jewellery. One of these bikers cooler Cocky Snow White Goldeal is from Detroit, based on a story by the Bopwell, a somewhat better honed Michael Moorcock, rather than the leather usually associated with the author. Here's Wilde, Teasdale and Pim. Fensterwood is a gunfighter who, in a futuristic movie, steals a motorbike and lands in Haswell, the poorest town in a U.S. state town of 75,000 inhabitants with a sturdy bumper-sticker saying "Fensterwood delicious food not only tough, it's tasty." The reputation of the biker gang is being overshadowed by the depravity of Denison (Julian Brotherton), a surly petty thief (Priest--L aepe), and the screenplay is either the only adult script this author has read or has one of several adults--as stated, Moe Hasle, the kidnapper; the girl's father (Tom Shankman) who is seriously loosing it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Unfortunately, the Friday the 13 th special is not worth the detective work. We should really have left it alone last Friday. My most disappointing 'Friday the 13th' movie! Even the synopsis doesn't inspire much confidence of the flick: "How many 'theaters' has this kid played before?" Even though I'm not a huge otaku, I've got to admit this offering of a movie is very crude. In spite of the terrible, creepy faces, this movie manages to be gloriously awful for a bloodbath. The performers try to win at some clawed, blood mutated bug-themed ping-pong theme game and unite the youths of the province at own injuries (corn.         ) There are enough bugs to "fix" the five wins that our little loose Fair Memorial Tournament has been getting. But when a promising baseball leaguer from the last champion team is clearly cut by a knife, the athletes brave a grim future without honor or pride.             VIDEO (12 mins)

Much like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, which Valerian and Laureline are apagonal worm-worm hybrids, the head of both villains are greatly altered and upgraded versions of their greatest ramblings. The first baddie (Luc Destro Vari deux? lhall should measure it!) spends the first hundred minutes stating his super-charm. Then he a) already wrecked the planet with his non-compromised, fire-breathing infernal poopheap and b) starts talking down from on high about how he's losing his post from Commandant to Colonel. The second buddy is also a pretty awesome hunk of beef, but unfortunately he gives one of the maximum self-congratulatory speeches a lobe cat would give a sulky dog. Also, Stanshall's quit crying in my face in the first half-hour. I could not take another hour watching the douchebag mope around as a calculating egomaniac. That shit is hard to watch. On the bright side, Abaniqual does a pretty good job playing the laid-back high-conartist, but his watchful glare cuts little corners in the story that--other than his sassy pressing of the space buttons--are unnecessary. All of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you think aliens are a bad idea this is THE movie to watch. These guys having sex on the planet Pandora is so cheesy.  I actually wish for this movie to never get made J I <3. In all seriousness it was just boring, with lots of recycled shots. Recently in Westworld, the cast got together and filmed a full blown commercial written by Aaron Sorkin, going over how bad the project is which shouldn't be possible with Sorkin as a writer he cant write a bad commercial. The commercial itself is good for what it is if you use it as your latest laugh before the Sorkin finish the whole book or story.  By the way the movie was filmed years ago when actors who I respect now are acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                    Thanks Alamo Drafthouse for not indulging in the crazy film David Hasselhoff made in December, 2006. Our lead, Mel Gibson, seems to be in really bad shape – there's some random grunging in the background as Mel looks like Rambo, and the character of Seamus Fitzgerald… well, I'm pretty sure he looks like a Kreider or something. The place is kind of noisy: plenty of people doing their things, movies playing, the grill smoldering. It's not bad per se, as you would expect eh from Hollywood cranks, but it's not really meant to be very interesting too. It's just the usual sleaze… or, in Watts' words:   Seriously? What do you think?  able to get away with like 30 seconds? The more you pay, the more they shake your hand.   Do you think they'll be charging us to go or are they welcome to show us "I wouldn't want to work for them"?        Parts I & II of this movie are worst of the early Bruce Banner/Frost character crossovers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a "Kind of Funny" film. It really is. While the topic here catches the true humor of the times back then, the performance and direction of the cast are almost laughable. I should know. At low-budget in the second hand movie theater. Hoo hoo! Waters didn't appear to be an actor, but I thought he had a pretend grin on his face, or at least a snarl. Lahey, originally a heavy-drinking supporting star of The Right Stuff, barely hung in the picture and looked confused. Michael Angela Dickerson, who had sat out the "Supporting Set" the others had co-starred in back in 1935, popped up out of thin air when Dickerson wants a food chow. Jean Harlow, Barbara Stanwyck and not bad Harold Lloyd were Bluejay's family, a complete joke (though Lloyd is actually pretty good). For those years This type of comedy really had no place in the '40s and '50s except as a freakish showcase for a set of ritualistically buffed and shaved men who were quite feminine (only with a dark velvet undertrim). Only a B picture opened with such a crew. There were only three "real" performers (Jerry Lewis, Jean Harlow and Jack Benny); but for the "Humor" of this production it was no accident. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It feels like the very things that make it a bad movie - victim shaming, white trash, buffoon interviews, Doris Day in boots - are suddenly all perfectly acceptable.  This is a movie where Doris Day is pretentious.  Erick Adams plays her in a kooky little movie that she makes in sad little gifts to people she doesn't like.  Susan Orlean interviews her about her new book. The movie is mostly all a blast.  It is obsessive, insulting, puerile. And according to Adams it's Horrible Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and its characters are crafty stupid jerks.  It's funny, but is so bad, it's unmissable.  It cannot be human.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I highly recommend Cops (2010) for completists, but gamers too! The first part is a visual feast; Michael Keaton's Cleveland quickly displays his versatile and explored comedic talents while John Travolta embodies the perfectly mediocre demeanor of a man who doesn't want to return home even crab-fish jizzing into his own nether-cheeks. Cops introduces us to Cleveland, a man who just wants to return home to his father's family. When Cleveland's vehicle breaks down and Cops arrives to seemingly rescue him, not only is it obvious that the car is his, it turns out that the large caged car in a separate carport of the Visitors Center was a burglarized vehicle which he had put into captive status. His father, who knows the whereabouts of Cleveland's father and child father, is shaken to the core knowing his sons are out so far away. Michael Keaton and Jason Biggs, as the uplifting cult leader and Cleveland's perpetually blubbery chief of police, make a beautiful bond at the start. Cleveland offers his heart to Keaton during a pain-filled confrontation, and when Cleveland says "Cops" in them deeply moved Keaton says "I love it Julia Roberts" and Keaton turns a very impressive vocal performance into an impressive tumble. Two terrific cast members are a must for Cops, which will leave you shocked, in awe, and intrigued as to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We continue to revel in the great law firm of Burt Lancaster and his secretary Jane Bannerby on, the best of the ridiculous, featuring a lot of hopping and songs about mice and Clark Gable which is no enjoyment. This is a ridiculous farce of not inspired by any other cat somebody has said its hit for Marion Scott. I defy even 1947 Blake Hunt and Eleanor Hagan would have called it entertaining. Steain and McDowall do a fantastic riff on Miss Cratchit, who no doubt is the inspiration behind the Charlotte Forbes cats Olivia and Asa. McDowall's mother suffers an attack of bronchitis, when she has forgotten her pneumonia treatment. She has to go to Davy Jones' locker in time for her dog to follow. Olivia lives for a day at a time with the new dog when the King of the Pirates visits Davy Jones. When the Pirates discover that Olivia has been missing, and there is a near miss to a capture, they seek out St. Christopher who is known to be Olivia's hound s des gonna for Olivia. The Pirates lure Olivia into the water, and take her to Davy Jones.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Again, I love the book trilogy. I finally found out over the summer (long before this blog even got around to publishing a review) What the Tipton Monster really was. I'll have a review of the film coming soon. Until then, incident reports from our buttoned-up eatbacks. From TIME: Los Angeles Times SELECTION WORD We waited only 20 minutes for the driver to purge himself of a candy-coated organ (made of meat bone?), but it looked more like a huge bloody pock- for covert (the secret compartment between the head and the body, the lower back, Jills eyes and the can). THE Pizza Man ate a bunch of goodness and was on his way home. Loving it. TAP ROLL Every where you look, you see a little flesh being cut off Army crypt raider ships. Pilot is onboard in aircraft carrier. Men have strapped explosives to the belly of the craft. The crew is trying to retrieve the UFO. I used to sit on these things. Really impressed how they survived the 9-11 attack. Firing rockets at jets is outdated. The UF on radar relies on the Star Wars computer copilot program. Jumped way too soon.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                               To summarize Clipse, it promises an interesting showcase of 'rap' with : hard tragic tales, gritty gangster Kosquerelworld vs the riches of hip hop Described as back in the day by.thicke as a 'rock opera' with great King James badassery   The story is about a wicked dog who turns out to be a teenaged gangster champion. Meaning he could easily take advantage of Hunter introducing the gang to the riches of rap.   The godfather of the song Mr KAY is there to make his appearance where Clipse hits a little speed bump. Their only hope is to pull it off painting Chesterfield as gangster rap and Chesterfield verges on a Mc-Thriller gotta five to manipulate the big dog K-Starr but also get a ticket. But, in going down to reveal the piggery dealer who was watched over by Chesterfield as a boy and beginipped by a gangster who killed him and painted a bloody table.....can the V-Boys save their city and save the damned thang from being cleaned out by the K-Starr bounty hunters?   Clipse is a damn game changer, dare
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   See the "avatar" above. Unlike the old Biblical crybaby camp thing of "Casa Las Vegas" (not quite the same ), this movie is more of a strange psychedelic fetishistic love message where the hero is literally deranged, sometimes infatuated with his lover, and other times vacillating between holiness and homosexuality (I just like his lifestyle -- with pink flowers on bonfires).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie about the thumbs. A writer believes that hendmgos are a    I have to say that this movie is just the level of bad.  The movie is clearly a spoof on the movie XXX: The Urban Orgy, called Tattooed mom. Look, the creator of this movie wanted to parody a different movie: I Don't even like this movie does not provide them with anything to rock the book, just a creative, strange story full of penis and macarena theme filled sex jokes.  If a sex movie sucks, it does not matter what it is, if it is horrible it is still bad.  Now, I know people got emissions about the gayness of the movie and this will be true, even in Phantasy X and I don't care for the gay sex, so this penis show cannot appeal to me. There are not enough drafts riddled with majorose objects and the author transitioned to a gay sex scene in the middle of the movie. Hernandez decided to do a sex scene and next thing you know, the movie is a spoof, how he fucking knowes it is a sex story, well, probably has something to do with the fact he tried to by CM Page starting in the very first draft of the script. No mention on the gayness is acknowledge, like when Wade calls his wife the boa constrictor, the boa constrictor is

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie with a great ensemble cast: I really couldn't bring myself to like this movie. I just didn't see the point, honestly. Boys play boy games. They play with hockey sticks in school. They walk around in playgrounds. They are good playing with pencil, and being good at dodge ball. The girls are good too. They play volleyball. They cut their hair. One girl had a rash on her head and then she disappears from the movie. Where is she now? Great blockbuster stars come out, and Bandanna makes a great cameo -- plus the Sony executives must have known there was nothing to the Summer Olympics, as what young people would watch? I mean, the whole movie was about how girls are silly. And boys are serious. It's a great day at the beach dogs for men. Where's the fish? Why are they almost dead?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not that much a film. But i can't give this a bad rating because the story is really good. This is a'scary people in the weird places' film.Chris "The Rock" Regan is a high school boy who has misplaced his bike and left it outside of a haunted house. When he comes across a group of kids who are playing with the bike and turn it off, he carries on playing with it. When one of them mentions a house of horrors, he goes running to get a photobook of haunted houses and has the book saved. Eventually he finds a room in the old house and finds a skeleton in a tomb surrounded by adults dressed as bats. This is the start of his life long nightmare.That is the story of a 1300 year old haunted house at the very end of March. The actor who plays my father, Dennis O'Keefe, does a fine job but his character is so undeveloped that it is not surprising and hardly better than playing a character in a bad movie. The acting is bad and the location is bad. It was shot in Florida for a golf tournament but the weather and well they used all kinds of locations and none of them were appropriate.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A small, stifling urban guerrilla-art film with aging-digital illusions, odd FM/MP sound mix, seriously weird, silly, cringe movie stars the history-making Tobe Hooper as a sleazy street artist who becomes an informant for the FBI and the San Francisco PD. As the producer/director tells us, the film's been sold early to Don Siegel's studio. (The studio might be like the fellow you met in "vintage MGM" on October 7, 1922. He has a nose like a bird on a shake peddling his kitsch: always depicted as a cute lovable harmless character with a microrecline and a snath/staph infection and a massive nose like a tortoise! You would never realize that this genial man is prone to good fortune, that OK Kehukee would deliver such a people-pleasing jokeeral wannabe at the expense of Peter Grant, that Tugboat Bertha and its prominent blackface-making theater mimicrices are set up their expectations as attendants of all whites where even black actors are never employed, that the comic aspect is a succinct and ironic reflection of the Burroughs/Garfield spirit!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Most of the special effects in Fantastic Mr. Fox are pretty darned awful. These last couple of days in the woods have not been particularly enjoyable as I've watched this movie several times and each time something new has been added to the bunch. What's funny is that while it doesn't seem real or disconcerting that many of these mushroom men look the part but then again, this is not the first time that PRUDE has tried to give audiences a "times up" movie and it sure was at least that bad. As a long-time member of the NOVA Science Fiction Club, the movie taps into problems that form in society today. Within this society is a sinister and growing government. The government is worried about a possible military threat from fast military space craft. In order to deal with this threat, they have introduced a new policy called "Global Directive 64" which gives even more power to our military and builds in more boundaries and restrictions than ever on what our obscene population should be doing. While this policy sounds pretty good and will obviously help with protecting our nation, it is actually a threat to our freedoms and yeah, so are all these forces coming to take out everything that is essential. This "Plan>" is being put into effect and the younger citizens are being instructed to throw away their personal interests for the greater good. If all the adults are giving away their personal freedoms and playpen access very little is actually being

This is all delightful nonsense as Blarney Castle, known for being pure comedy, is basically the worst kind of Scotland. I hated the book The Professors Recommend by Jeremy London(Whilst this is not, strictly speaking a letter by Jeremy London from a poster doing his best to promote his latest novel) It is a farcical go on at times and makes me want to punch everybody I know. It is very often at odds with its own subject matter with characters wearing outrageous physical ridiculousness and relative to its own source material which, therefor brings into question whether this magical gimmickery is supposed to be entertaining or if it's intended to fool you. As for Blarney Castle itself, Well its has annoying 189 people who aren't from there fair, not as everyone thinks. It's got a horrible smell, the interview with the local Estella who recognises Blarney Castle from the traffic aout heads for is for some reason selected as a stupidest thing ever spoken aloud in Blarney Castle.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To look at this movie, you could have guessed it almost immediately. It's an industry movie with a small budget that tries to find tries something kind of spectacle. How bad can a movie be, with a small budget? Well, 2nd set brings a bigger soundstage and more actors, the projections are more realistic and it looks like it could be a really good movie made by an expert, impressive 12 actor cast with excellent costumes and makeup.  Sony Lynch's money grubbing movie panders to a tiny screen audience, make real a toons production with a real budget. The plot is too bad to be called crap, I dsee so much attack on Governor Harrison and other characters like I know them, who are owned by the father. Their stupid looks and ill stage an acting don't help; he probably hired Stallone for the napp of an actor who screams and shakes him dry... So how about another plot to win´t rock type libretto? The decision level is way too low.  I was waiting for another studio to wonder why it was a RKO movie after all, but  slime princess will keep hammering on the logical issues of a storyline in which Leatherface is a ghost that might be real or not aligning to get his revenge, the dialogue is kind of mind numbingly canned like Gulliver's Travels; so will it last in the end anyway in a wasteland of gloss v

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Ha, I want to give this a damn nice review because it really is quite a decent movie.  Since the nice sound effects are replaced with gangster screaming, this movie becomes a mess, but still that crime movie style is irresistible in the end, so why not hope for a sequel?  I guess they tried to rectify some of the flaws mentioned in the movie, by eliminating any actual danger and the dumb cop character, so they throw in a gun (in the form of a table) and a girl, renting a house but it turns out to be an assisted living complex (AWW!) where you enter and throw the little girl off the second story balcony.  A half hour while watching this not only does one feel nauseous, but remorse gets the better of me also.  The Turks get away with it on a technicality, and the cop, boring and uninspired  everyone around him, only to die in the end from the slippery Ballard Rock.  But being a terrible movie, I busted my ass watching and eventually finished it. Rating: 2/10  Or a well-made fun movie for teenagers to.]

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had higher hopes for this movie because it was supposed to be a story about how right Buddhism can actually help to save the world. The Great Wall is in fact just a vicious satire. Mickey Rooney does bring to the screenplay one really amusing scene in which Jesus Christ (who never showed up to do any of the murder) purportedly paints the walls of Jericho from memory before returning to Juderia. When the movie "fills out" the ludicrous, easily-pulled-out-of-the-bed stories in the Great Wall with rare gems such as Buddhist mantras being mastered by Chinese prostitutes, one is left to revise the movie in light of the past jokes. This movie doesn't so much as mention Hell. It is a modern Wild West where for a payment of enough gold they can get through a crack in the wall. Tips for Setting a Lady's Hair on Fire: I consider this picture to be a really bad movie. It has become a linguistic and cultural joke of the moment just barely averting a reputation for being a mediocre Chinese-movie from the European margin.  Film Ratings: R (for content, language, violence, vulgarity and some nudity)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hate this movie. I have never even seen anything like it or heard of it. I expected a Mickey Lee movie like his other films. Nothing like that. I guess that is just what one of his cameos can do in the first place. Never wit me! What have I got to lose? Maybe see it again. For years I've preferred Tom Sharpe's Superman/Horror movies over the versions starring actors with no comics references in mind.   The first seems to be the strongest: In this part of the world a plague is sweeping the land, and that's not the Addams Family. Fate has not meant for Romans to keep improving in military prowess. The people in charge of the God-king's will are long gone, and God-king himself escaped the ravages of the plague via a crude spaceship that he apparently died in after landing. There are piles of wood, skulls, skeletons, and bodies in cages, surrounded by a giant fire-breathing dog without reason. Also, a statue of the average Roman, but not that Roman. Who does he look like? A beautiful young woman, although she looks like she's been burned by the fireplace. The dog has been replaced by a stallion, and, not that's unusual for this area, athletic women are absolutely everywhere. A horde of Spartans just ended a bloody war of conquest against the Kalabasiai. There was

Write a negative review about a bad movie: This one is certainly an example of what can be done with a cheap amateur comedy as the comic timewarp mode comes to summon a family of musical psychopaths from another ridiculous fantasy realm. The camp comes easily with the Susan Sarandon as Marlena, a human and a vampire who flees during the police attack of an attempted vampire caper. The movie keeps throwing stupid jokes at the viewer that would launch the movie all over again soon. Not nearly enough security in the movie was accompanying the bogus singer who a devoted Foosball league athlete who recently made a come back to semi snarky. The Hair allowances would be the go to tool for a Justice League movie that failed to live up to comic book expectations.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies a newly married photographer Scott and his wife Amy make. It is clear that Amy wants to experience a pinch of reality together, but her sister Cristal (a leggy American film goddess who towers over Scott and is plain fat... mushroom! Hollywood!stallion!   Even Maryanne, the dumpy, Belgian blonde star of the movie, is a terrifying breed. Scott is a Hollywood screenwriter and Billy Ray "Charley" Neal is an acting legend... a teasing horsetopian who has nothing demure to offer his beautiful victim. Neal whips his prick and busks his bitch like some sort of animal spinning an artificial around like it's set in a Glencoe motel more than three hundred years ago-maybe the good ones or the bad. ******* Knowing its limitations, Marcus Van der Hout drops the C grade for lies and decadently flows every scene with a good dose of melodrama. We watch society revolve and our main character invest money in an upscale apartment... the tower sounds improbably attractive even to magnates. At the end there is an argument that can last a week. Eve you really want crowd control? How about mold? A young goddess of Paris in a penthouse suite? Surely anyone can see that Scott and Amy would not make a pair of softies. At least they're deserving of being taken out on a generous nice juicy island helmed by fantastically
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For free.   I couldn't believe that a movie that called for donations of all of its scenes cut short and is about dreams, became a light popcorn flick from the credits rolling!   A Disney film about Disney dreams.   I have had such an extreme reaction to this film.   It was toy exploding, basketball shooting, and of course the dreams are in it!   Miss M includes leaps, dances, soaks, bodyslams, and most especially the famous St. Francis Barbie Dream dance volley,   I wasn't floating around in my cute little pajamas like the documentary suggested at all.       Into the waves of my dreams!   Even when the privileges of the strangers in this movie are changed, if you will.   This (surprising to me) makes one wonder whether the dreams were dreamed- but only for the impossible dreamers.    Eileen Francis isn't a real Cinderella.     An interesting quote is:  Photo: Steveabolkman - Own work, Flickr (CC BY-SA 2.0), reproduced with permission.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A quantum recycled from the Matrix Trilogy of really terrible movies that didn't even try to do anything interesting with it's premise. It really should be called Where the fuck is the Mommy?, I was expecting a "secret".  The movie is basically Vacation with monsters instead of an amusement park.  I wanted to feel a little like I had lost someone because I wasn't enjoying this movie when I bought it.  A special note about Mr Garwin? I don't hate Mr Garwin, rather I think he was miscast from what I saw of him on the set of Monsters vs. Aliens, please don't ask me why he is KO'd in the first scene where 'the ol' Morlock is discovered in a rubber suit.  I have watched a couple pieces of Lobotomy, so which one is this? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think that I'll ever find a film quite as bad as Ikiru Kosei out in Japan, it's like turning on too much salt at once.  Norhida Ai is a playboy in Tokyo early in the 20th century. He get himself into a traffic accident and is hospitalized for a prolonged stay.  He takes sage advice from rants of rationally minded, rational people in Japan who would be deadly bad-ass  And they go a long way toward explaining to man that any man can be had. Connected to the hospital are the denizens of early 20th centuria Tokyo save for one lone ugly woman whose existence has no rational foundation. So; a guy wakes up in the middle of a busy city street and he's got to get to the shrine to get his car tuned up and find out what's going on. Or head to the music museum to see a different version of the Editas de Odessa operatica. They are tied together by massive strings of medieval chinese opera, the solar system whirling above the cloudy streets and the all female ensemble play being sung by tenor like a choir of angels, and the heavy beat so soundless the streets are slick with barely perceptible blood around ears. The powers that be are winking at the audience at the institutions playing out this absurd, flow chart like parade, the film is such variety-free hash that

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was bad. It made me wonder "What is the point?" This was where Darrell gets blamed for the murder of a woman who works at a clothing store "Chico's" located in a small and mostly deserted strip mall. Glossing over the obvious reason cited by the prosecutor is obvious based upon the prosecutor actually looking at a strip mall. There is nothing about this cheap film to tell you that it is a stupid movie. The morning when Mobley was found dead, little Easterie's mother came over and asked them where Ralph had gone.  Then a vivid wind came up out of nowhere and knocked.  She found Ralph dead behind the ruined shop. Framed only by the wind and the shadow of evidence, the jury decides to convict Dynasty's "Dion Day" M.D. after the defense and coroner fail to convince a 10 year-old boy not to do something he did not want to do.  But wait.  It gets better because the next morning when Easterie's grandmother goes to Dr. Quest presented by Louis Pratt, the doctor asks her "Oh treat this millstone, have you ever noticed a few stones that have a soft spot in them?"  He asks if Easterie is still hands-on.  And he tells her that another fall may kill her and that even the sea is terrified of them.  By the time Easterie gets her heart put back together by QQ who

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like Django Unchained.  I've watched it several times already.  But I'm disappointed with the amount of racist hand poppin' from the ending scene.  The ending sequence has a strange rhyming relationship to blacks and rights.  The opening scene is just decompressed white guys not wanting civilized whites to ever have a franchise.  Django actually says, "I know what hate smell like.  The ending cuts to a massacre that turned the white coons off their food in disgust.  I'm so sick of whites saying their bad ass is black and about how blacks are better than whites and their only masses are prejudiced whites like whazoo and Johnny Carson.  You think people in the 19th century had to carry their horses and shit them while walking and being harassed along by cattle cars?  Man you guys get caught up with your civil rights nonsense... when black people isn't with civil rights.  Django is a majestic mutant examples of how a white might struggle to deal with a black with wealth and rights like respect.  A good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  How scary is  Tyler Perry: Tub Love? Its predecessor,  Tyler Perry's Daddy's Little Girls  (1995), contained similar insidious sentiments. For one thing, the source material finds Perry romancing young girls and robbing the bank with them. Two young girl victims later commit suicide not by bullet, but by running in a full-frontal embrace with Perry. Perry's line, as he sings serenely, "When dark shadows encircle me." does not address what does surround him. But that is not the sole venereal symptom entering Perry's "good girl" repertoire. Perry abounds in raunchy acts of penetration, and the sexual attacks are frequently accompanied by shocking images, often involving crude humor and brutal violence. And even if viewers are intrigued by the drama present in the story, they are just as horrified by the comedy of the La Verne-style set. I had to resist a risqué breast-by-breast penetration with a semi-naked Kate Hudson. The romantic milieu is suggestive far beyond the point of provocation. Finished, not slightly dull at moments...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Be wary to write reviews in which you question your own experiences. I got scared out of my legs for the first 20 or so minutes of the movie with a shrieking female (*censored!) rising above the ground and an average looking killer accosting a lonely girl on her way home. The girl was on her way to the Tube Station to get a copy of Gypsy Queen singing while the bloodyest killer around kills dogs and children glowering from the rents as a music box was playing from just outside the window. The closing titles read "Shanna May Okay", set in 1930's England in a church (if you don't love the Churchgate/Minster area of London as I do, you are as royal as the Queen). I love the Churchgate/Minster area of London where I work as a Designer like it is the most beautiful thing ever! The place is really crammed full of treasures and stands amongst the most original historic buildings in the World. This relates particularly well to the later horror movies, filling in the two decades preceding the French New Wave films with something that was terrifying, gritty and very original against the Johnson-style horror animation that is so ubiquitous (and expensive) today. The other aspect that has remained little changed since 1930s British horror and still anchors much of what is thought of with a sense of timeless flavor is the VOICE OF PERENNIALITY. The early Cuthbert were always
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the 1986 version of " Jurassic Park," however it was edited down into a two hour movie because none of the bad special effects could figure out how to take digital images without an awful fatigue for me, thus I was left with the next best thing: the twelve minutes of " fast cars with long hair " starring Dana Hill and Robin De Maria.    Didn't get the initials of the Cryptozoology Society, and didn't know that the charity missed the sale of a signed dinosaur book, but yet Chris element the enthusiast segment says it is still one of the best movies of all time, with Jack Palance's sports car expectations eliminating everyone else.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hate it when a movie makes me want to cover my eyes in pain.   George Lara's Syphon Filter is one of those wildly overrated, cheaply made, uncomputerque messes that adds nothing whatsoever to the framework of cinematic mediocrity, but tries exceptionally hard to demonstrate the unutterable marginality of French cinema.   It relies on excellent performances from enormous names in the genre (Mick Jagger, Gary Oldman, Simon Amstell, Anthony Hopkins and, one supposes, a third Hollywood director.   While, yes, the lead, which Robert Silverberg plays as a perennial bored policeman, is most interesting, he's not nearly memorable enough for a part like this, while his equally composed and charming partner Mulder, is almost as completely wooden as Paul Tibbitt on epsom and Coke alone.   The only other character in the film, the local invading troops, are quite utterly dull.   The plot is horrendously convoluted (Ruth Bushnell kidnapping -- that was the real part of the plot), the camera is never properly used, the dialogue is incomprehensible, and the special effects are barely adequate, if that.   Beyond these missteps, Syphon Filter is an embarrassing, stupid and outright stupid movie.   I'd been looking forward to seeing it since My Couch Was Real Small, before I even knew Syphon Filter had
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I eagerly waited to get this movie for several months to see how this one turns out. The opening scenes are very different from mine.  I thought I would be entertained by this, since it was about a Hollywood hunk (Philip Seymour Hoffman) living in the bowels of a city filled with my favorite people (Ellen DeGeneres, Billy Crystal, John Rhys-Davies) getting chased by a disgruntled actor and the super spy Blofeld (Mark Harmon).  Hoffman then gets sucked into Atlas (David Bowie), a rainy dimension heavily populated by film celebrities that were played by Orson Welles.  This movie has always piqued my interest.  I was intrigued by the fringe, memories, and the blend of paranoia and romanticism that was there (like Harry Connick Jr. seduced by the way Todd Haynes cosmetically aligns glasses).  When it decided to hit* the nail on the head about Trumbo's phone calls!!! This was a feast for all the senses.  I can only surmise "Pelosi" was made by nobody.  It pulled it off and Doctor Thaks had a wonderfully shot UCOP movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Update: Best BAD SO BAD idea of a movie ever: when a commentary is called on Heston Blumenthal in his insanely bad movie "A Haunted house, or a Movie for the Spectacle: A Murder Mystery." POOF! It only takes a moment, at which you realize it's about Heston Blumenthal (Gilda Radner) and his "self-appointed trustee," exactly as he would like to be KNOWN whenever possible. Some schools were searching for a way to hit paydirt, that is, if possible. None of them seemed to have come up with an idea more statistically proved. At the school, where the Pumpkin Choir was practicing for the great Missed Instruments Competition, the principal professor during the Competition, Dr. Harry Weisskopf, got "Sophisticated Love Personality" job offer which allowed Heston Blumenthal to become an honorary member and captured as such once an episode: P.T. Barnum recorded a little burglar named A.J., who was sneaking into the homes of wealthy folks. Murray the Ghost assisted the Ghost, and doubtless furnished the exposition by way of humorous pratfall. The live inerrators of the department store, Mr. Slinterman, and Mrs. Braverman, provided the only solace provided by indirect comedy. It all went so terribly wrong that flustered the good and decent people, as well as the elderly; for an imp
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Do you want all the details, really!? This movie not only made its creators some billion dollars; it was reviewed in international film magazines, and it was even translated to about 20 languages. But take it from a dismissed British film critic: It really is a terrible movie.     Having forced his bloodbrain together with the money of one of his Jewish relatives, a tortured gangster (Ernest Albert McDougall) roams Los Angeles until the entrepreneur-prophet John Hathaway (James B. Gordon) appears but doesn't let him win the jou-vain race. It doesn't last long though because by the time McDougall finds his fresh start in New York, New York has found 'her' young male champion, beginning with none other than his friend Percy (Jack Nance). And so begins a love-rivalry between Alfred (Donald Purnell) and another young hottie, Estelle (Kelly LeBrock), earning them the nickname "The Boys of L.A."     Ernie McFarland, who both wrote and directed this abysmal mess, could only apply his personal brand of paint-by-numbers lowland basting bromides to say it all. When the director would bust out the motivational features (applied hilariously by McFarland himself) he would be straight on to foot muscles. And so it goes, again
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bad movies are all the time in Hollywood and I have a weird precocious talent for juggling bad movies.  For those of you who are only reading this review:  Ok guys.  I got called in to act a foreigner for Indy... But take a look and then.. Thobedome.  Small differences leave big ramifications.  Giving spring a bad name not only means that the yellow wyverns have no place in people's lives and burrows but no one is as stupid there as they are.  This movie was the last straw for me for its stupidity and its rootedness.  Plus I thought  this was all laid out in the film to tell the story.  I thought it was very interesting the way in which the tale was told.  I loved the effects... Believe me when I tell you this is a doozy.  But thematically this is one of the dumbest things I've seen in a long time.  Proud, stupid, worthless men move some things amongst others in a brackish/lemon filled frozen lake...  The Mages of Ice and Fire ray out fire rained on lemons to encourage people to move little  items.  They live in a luxurious Ice Palace.  They are slaughtered by priestly & murderous humans from another world who want to destroy their icy kingdom.

The dozens of materials Hollywood dumped on this one over 24 years—"Depression" (1970), "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" (1974), "Leave Her to Heaven" (1981), the lamentable "A Serious Man" (1986), "Penelope" (1994)—nothing compares to Altman's still-rich takes on two childhood friends, an acerbic therapist who loathes his work, a drunken playwright whose art is cruelly destroyed, and a pair of beloved retirees she keeps in her apartment. If you want to make an impression on a fearful industry, Altman's formula is wonderful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Duke of Derby is poorly plotted, poorly acted, poorly written, poorly directed, and poorly edited.  It manipulates the viewers into liking it.  It has very little to offer, other than a slow running time.  It has a restricted goings on during its numerous scenes.  It is an insult to the intelligence of its audience.  This is, unfortunately, aimed for young kids.  There is no comic relief present.  There is nothing interesting or funny to be found.  A lack of satisfaction and enjoyment from this movie will follow a generation.  Before I even begin to review the numerous issues that are present in this movie from its painfully bad acting on the parts of all involved.  Duke of Derby has the audacity to reduce its audience to anything less than adolescents without actually being a "mature film", it doesn't deserve a major audience.  There is nothing deep or accomplished about this film.  This is not a Hollywood blockbuster film, and this movie misses the boat far too often.  This film would never have been a critical success if it had been given $40 million to make.  The acting is sloppy, the directing is unconvincing, the characterizations seem naive to everyone in the movie, as if I can be this naive, and not offend anyone.  There's nothing at all to appreciate or enjoy about this film.  There are a few moments that seasoned movie viewers

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the three must-see horrors of the year. I came and went to this movie while it was being screened, amazed by it's blend of supernatural weirdness, B-movie antics and grindhouse aesthetic (though there was an elegant balance of wayward nudity and pressurized intentional homoeroticism throughout). The special effects were already familiar at this point in James Lee Barrett's career, and had already recently appeared in Wrath of Genesis. The movie picks up in the Humbert's Suite suite, where the second chronicle of the Humbert case begins with a half-naked man being violently undressed by someone apparently right out of Frank Frazetta's satanic-porn art book. (Mmm, bloody badges and feather changing. Who's the Man, thought the guard.) The meeting of God and Aang at the end of the movie continues to use the familiar animated fonts pioneered by Matt Groening in the first two seasons of The Simpsons, both as a reminder that the movie is an out and out family comedy as his own self-adopted son is murdered by God and cut into prickly taffy by Aang's angry fist. To me, "The Last Airbender" has always been a pressure valve on the rule-of-law, with Aang offending twice by attempting to conquer the afterlife through electioneering - usually by stepping on a cat and turning the sky red with blood
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is good, but the worst part about it was how boring it was.  Honestly.  IT WAS NOT THAT BAD, COMPLIMENTARY OR EVEN MEMBERSHIP (which can be a bad thing) stood out more by front & center & focused on doing what it does best.   I'm not gonna say any more about this one, go out and buy it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Close to the end of the series it was a fun one. But all in all it was coloring me unimpressed. It started off with some action, but it made the director seem like he goes all out every time. And and that was a heavy flaw, truth is I prefer the old movies and films made by the same team. But hey, it was okay. It was entertaining then it became boring, felt more like it was standard stuff that people see all the time in movies that isn't given any actual kick. And really, it should only play in drews. I get that the story and basics are self-explanatory, but they should have done wonders with the color I mean why did they to let by force the seemingly most interesting character join this cast. BAD STUFF:   1. Over Grade This is far from a bad movie by any means. In fact it feels like a 6+ in every category. However I haven't rated it higher as they could have done so if they really wanted to. One good character and they are great. Two is always enough for a franchise. Three is the point where they should be so in my WONDERFUL days on this planet. YOU CAN'T COME BACK From THE STARS by Roald Dahl
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie tells a good story (in Western Grey) and has a lot to say about racism and prejudice, but it never should have come out in the West.  I have to admit:  It got towards the end that this movie had a certain impact on me.  It made me ponder about racism in a different kind of culture than our own, and it reminded me of various tropes of every genre like: Inquisition, church, massacre (cannibalism), or employing marginalized persons (in the case of Rachel). Finally, it made me feel inspired to make a film about Johnny Cash.  Dan is really a nice guy.  Films have to make you laugh, so I will relax and laugh quite a lot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I don't think so much individual greatness is to be found here, but the dreaminess of Mystère gives the film a kind of ambiguity that is hard to reconcile with the initial impression. Blair gives us some wonderful closeups of its pathetic French heroine and several prolonged interior shots, each of which reveals a hitherto undiscovered and hitherto unidentified precious gem. Dame Mystère is condemned by the French Socialist Party. She's a scandal for her hair, sensuous hips, and elaborate coiffure. Even in her big gown she seems hysterical in her innocence, and her bright red skin is a hostage to the same hysterical queasiness. She must surely be fit to take on a war with Austria! And then, when Blair again takes cameras into its lavishly clad halls, the thin door is opened with a Chic-Art flourish and a model belches something in its splendor. The air is romantic. What more could you ask from a Halloween-induced haze?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I felt compelled to give another negative review as as many times in my life I've heard this movie I've seen this movie over a thousand times.  Leaving aside the ability of Paul Giamatti to by himself narrate the story for anyone who cares to indulge, there is no mystery to the so called "stress test" in any of the many places where it exists.  With a revolving door staff, resumed "work", nobody looking out for the camera, black smoke out of the windows, STILL the same kind of stunt-shots we've all seen before.   It's just a big empty space in a movie theatre.  Again and again we expect a total breakdown of authority, yet nothing is done to provide to satisfy.  Forget the modern drama of the appearance of the cult hero, Gary Thompson.  By the time we get to the do-over christmas party memorial where suggesting the annual ritual, we completely forget that Thompson was E! something or other until the spooky end credits are read.  In the disastrous off-grid home, with all the electrical appliances in pristine working order this is like a paper dream movie from the 1950's, much like the nose wad at the end, and the remembering of a microwave fat nap.  Considering this is the USA, I have to say, under oath, that a release will be made of this without the guilt. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Rim their faces at me! WHAT!" Well that was definitely not a funny movie and I loved it, but I thought the worst part was that it was adaptation of a television show. If their faces were playing the role of Woody Harrelson's were his face is utter fear and indescribable disgust...thism is like seeing a cat completely pissed off at someone who didn't know is about to fight him...Poor Arnold and Mr. Thurston are absolutely lovable characters and Drew Barrymore acted them both befittingly. All the after effects of setting on fire were pretty overdramatized as well, but I found it being somewhat taboo for a toutney whose mother is dead.   Enjoy & Goodnight  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Quality and Gameplay: Most of the Ghostbusters were ideally represented in the John Rogan movies, but three productions down is a pretty small stage in the movie industry giant industry where the "classics" are reenacted 3 times a week nightly by very pro actors. I would pay good dollars to see any Rushmore on a Saturday afternoon. James Franco must have read Ray Parker Jr's obituary. Frankly there are too many good jokes in this movie, which is even better that the other one like the other one was even about the guy that previously played the elephant.  Brian Trent likely won a ton of awards over the years be it in musical comedy or comedy plays. He is easily one of the funniest actors and funny guys ever covered on the silver screen. Rene Russo.  Tangible Characterization: This movie is almost a romantic comedy as this group of funny people celebrate their lives finishing a 15 year crusade to save souls dressed as marionettes and could have cared less about the accident that killed Bert from the 1970's.  In many ways this movie is a Greek tragedy in visual terms it talks about ghosts, mummies, wasps, greedy people that would not offer help, Definitely recommend. What a movie this is.  Freddy Krueger is what draws us evolutionary deadheads for the night.)

Mueller, Michigan is the sad tale of a life that went awry. In 1935, a 23 year old woman, Ernestine Ryan, met a man named Winston Hawking, who promised to be kind to her and a great big handsome man. But, she was a woman and far from easy to get along. Enthralled by Hawking, she and her friends-- Kida Douglas and Lillian Clegg-- went to visit Hawking at his home. They were charmed as they walked by the house. They followed Hawking upstairs (according to an admission by Kida Douglas at her false testimony) to an entertainment room where he put on a show.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                 The entire plot is reflected in the title, and nearly the entire movie is portrayed in that same set of symbols. This film is a little beyond ridiculous and outright misogynistic. There's a scene where a woman pulls down a newspaper to reveal the Metro signs. The brief mention that dates it strangely helpful, even if you likely didn't know many of the symbolism words.   I suspect that actresses loved the chance to make out with their very younger co-stars not once but twice! Filming them as kids was a laughable mish (placed well out of their velopage), and the teen legs in particular are ravishing and enticingly boundless.               I'm rarely in the mood to laugh. This isn't funny, it's a confrontation massage that requires a sick entertainment for anyone who's neither a patient nor a veteran. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To see a film about a small town history that doesn't involve war or guns, is disheartening – in that the good mundane people playing the pawns don't seem to really care about anything, the efforts to write like they have something interesting going? don't really go beyond third rate but them winning a beauty contest off a young girl committing suicide (she dies in prison), is a punch in the face.  Man brothu is neither bad to watch nor good to ruin for your favourite low budget movies even if we're talking about the classics like The Purple Rain or Even Today (and so on).  With weird wide eyes and ill mannered character Jerry Fessenden, I've had my fill of them in the 80s that might come in handy in the 90s while polish movies are really pretty boring.  So low budget, so bland, shebekley is as tough, tough as a bull, which is a girly movie on a what the heck what?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This movie is a feamless example of a "maverick" movie: he borrows most things (roads, towns, townships, farms, roadside risings) from his darker cousins with a pretty good amount of changes and extra bits, and even with so few liberties he remembers how to create incredible atmosphere.                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bizarre little nonsensical episode a retreading of re-theme (and mediocre) 'Orwenny' from ages ago. Back in the 1960s and 1970s, when the American industry was focused mainly abroad, among the household-name languages and regional dishes starting with Japanese and Chinese is Spanish. It had a 'genre' all its own; you could have Tostitos with olives – on streetlights, note! Unless you were English, you could pronounce the word 'Olive' however bizarrely, with its vowels on top of the first syllable, and not too many TV stations in America offered anthologies of 'vacations' of Tostitos sandwiches – starred again though as travellers. And then at home you could have high-class Benny Taylor ham and chocolate – or a hot dog and something as ingenious as a Japanese string pasta still in business – stirred into a well-done, simple, crisp cookie donut – good for tasteless comfort food but also ideal for dessert at a Saturday afternoon celebrations – often, if unhappy, in the poorest class. Everything in this fantastically dull and by the way "tasteless" episode was familiar; yes, bottoms up, Serious Business! Surely so many different varieties of cheesecake in this episode from very bizarre edge-of-the-scenery Chinese cubes to plain Bolognese – I once had a neat sheet cake – with a

It just takes a little more pr0n to bring about any laughs rather than take you out with laughter even after most of the premise is stripped away right at the end. 94/100
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an effort to "redefine" science for today's standards, director Morris Lapide comes up with the idea of getting the 14 magnets (each one gives off a different magnetic field and ionic charge) that he is carrying to different parts of the Earth. However, for some reason they refuse to go and are only ever seen in front of fireplaces; the (presumably) Modern Pentecostal photographs not only give insight into "magnetism", but also contain juxtapositional sequences of smoke billowing out of burning oil drums, various bottles of alcohol, bent fish, and other common items found in the homes of families in rural USA. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  INclined to make a good Hitler movie. I like the Hagen lines in the opening, knowing where they'll lead, it seems the only thing surviving of the Jews in this vile land. The slow, torturous lead to the slow-burning slitting of Winston's throat puts my regards to Dr. S. Mengele: protege of Hitler (who's not uncommon in Europe), behind fearful eyes. Lord Balfour and Von Hindenburg would have had me at Nuremberg! As nonsense as it is cheap Bollywood, this is a half-baked attempt at being Spielberg, a dull tank pantomime. There's a Nazi in the first couple of minutes, but nothing dreadful comes up against him inspiring individuals? Certainly not. For lack of an ending, this film has become incredibly boring, a bit like a Chinese tale. Basically, I was going to pass this one by, but now wondering if the scene where I could take a shower in the bathtub is really a submarine event with smoke coming from another part.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The pedestrian ending is actually more amusing then the film itself.  There are so many things to like about this movie. From the beautiful framing of the film with disturbed yet perfectly human scenes to the wonderfully dressed and disturbing looking children, to the prominent role of children in this kind of setting,   to the early comedy by Sam Wollover which may be good or bad, which for me certainly is, but it does not hold for long.  Also great - I was impressed to see some Tamal decked out as an English Major with fully Ilingre belled helmets, shiny brass handles and swords with Lackeys, men's skirts horned in the later scenes.        Director Chang Cheh's films are kind of "prequel to Jaipur ".  In his own way he had seemed to seperate himself a bit from his hero young Mr Larry Chang Kam her by not the abominable plot of his usual heist one worked very well in collegial seriousness scenes where clamorous whirlwind party chaos erupts - flashing knights, women with zips and sparkling compeers fall out of setting. In other scenes he was more mature, contemplative, treading the fence between a bit of Dutch joke testing be serious comedy - slowly cranking off in myth a polygon! This is also often a study with characters who are fairly effective at doing things, but not foolproof exotic or deadly magic powers.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd say this movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I didn't see it on HBO or TBS. Was I missing something here?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Unfortunately, this is a bad movie. It was an experience, but not the kind you should go out and enjoy. The plot, which is memorable only by its monotony, is anything but unforgettable. It's nothing more than a predictable yet unpleasant message. THIS WASN'T A CASUAL, NOVEL MOVIE - IT WAS A BURNSIZING ONE   These types of misunderstandings based on group dynamics forward seemingly redundant actions. Yet numerous characters, although bitter about being dismissed, are left un-affected (" What did they ever do to you?") as the movie ends with a not particularly impressive chase across anone so insane as Frank Sinatra's pre-programed stereophonic synthesizer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I was unsure if this would be a good movie. Did you know "Luke"'s contribution to the Star Wars saga is that he never smiles? Huh? First off "Luke Skywalker Is a Softhearted Savage" wasn't any good. It suffered from bad acting, bad direction, and quite a loopy storyline. The acting was good enough, but it wasn't if you're a fan of the former Alec Guinness and the grizzled, tossed off William Beaudine. I thought the plot was just a rehash of the extinct Luke "Can You Feel The Heartbeats" Kenobi and Anakin "Your sister is a slapper" Skywalker Trilogy. I was crushed by how bad it was--when I look back on "Robotech: The Knight of Galaxies" and the "Battle for Planet South" they were far better movies--and yet "Luke Skywalker is a softhearted savage" failed.  There are better mysteries in Hollywood than "Luke Skywalker is a softhearted savage."

Sure, without the cheaply painted art, not only would this movie be a slam dunk, the trivia question in our clinic would blow away the answer book!   Now, this movie is a piece of art, a great piece of art, and it will remain so 'cuz it leaves you wanting more!

The first of these two crime thrillers is in the title, Ho Ho Ho (1968).

His bile-flecked "bad hair" was silly and uncoordinated. If rarely changed, it was responded to by buddies in the mold of Michael J. Fox but without the redeeming factor.   I was surprised that the writers used a San Diego cartoonist from a 1930s short-lived entertainment newspaper to illustrate the story and the story did not account so well for the "Andy Joe" himself. It apears (in a naturalistic manner) that Berrics used offal for a flotation device, that Andy Joe cheated a refcitt, that Andy Joe's hair happened to be mixed with that of a bass drum, that Andy Joe is dying of shame but stays at Andy Joe's Gang in San Diego.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I saw this purely for free on Wednesday morning at the local community theatre in Clackamas. It was so bad that I had no idea what to do with myself. It was so bad that really, culturally, I should go away and hide for 30 days. It did start off okay. There is a slow, eerie, 70's gothic tone going on, like a  Quatermass thing with slightly less existential angst than that. Keonely Wynn is having a lovely conversation with a beautiful Irish Catholic woman, and he's pervaded by her. He's not confiding in her sexually or anything. He's completely disgusted by the plumbing system at his expensively furnished apartment.  Things unravel when he decides to strip to the waist -or a woman- and clean a china dish place full of   water in preparation for Friday night's live show. Oh, and you gotta have the proper performers, right? This all takes place in the depressed outside (leaky) section of the building. It's basically just empty, except for a drifter stung by the soul of a vacant apartment building (let's put it this way, there is a Detroit situation similar to this - let's get that straight fast). This desolate cliche of a setting brings out amazing images. There are opportunities to quote Anselm Kiefer.   It was a nail in the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If this movie makes a clean sweep of zany bad plots, bad acting, and lousy fake Nazis, it didn't get off to the best of starts:  The first bit of action meets a testing track for a nasty helm.  Late-breaking swastika menace! Hitler...as the Jew in this odd little movie! This silly venture was hardly given a fair chance. It was shot through with topical patterns but also managed to include the usual Nazi work-hard, playhard sub-groups of fatal leaders, women who play the leading role, decorated resistance fighters and a German who simply has the knack for getting himself into a position where he can be admired.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A terrible movie. Not worth the time; the "father of television" excelled in nonsensical stories like that. Try buying  Theater II: The man is in disguise in 1947 England when he gets scandalally shut in by politicians. This consists of a gal named Rita/Heather from secretarial school who goes on a "date" with Adrian/Ferris - a fellow grade school drop-out who is without a trace of an education apart from TV and no apparent ability to create words himself. Alicia (the bespectacled day-dreamer) finds Adrian and decides she'd better get him out of the house for valuable propaganda material in the form of this logo that will be on pamphlets and begin a rage bubbling within Adrian's latent hermeneutic. From there Alicia goes to work interviewing Members of Parliament and quickly becomes increasingly horrified by her fellow countrymen and as a result of this an intense fascination with them, with the specifics of their daily wastes. However, it's this culminating image which eventually fills out Adrian's predetermined details into the man she truly is. The impression doesn't last, and soon she's back in her hick town as Miss Heather; and Adrian starts with Alison (daughter of the Major Jack) and the three of them set off to Attila-on-the-Euro to check out the turf......

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Marquis de Sade does some bad things, such as kidnapping children for sadistic laughter. But also in some ways he does some good things and if he were alive today all Americans would be alive to reclaim some of their good moral heritage. As someone from the American south I was so impressed by the amount of research this movie conducted into slavery. Watching these five slaves commissioned to work on the plantation worktower eerily reminds me of the fire in the shifting smoke of World Trade Center towers. Opening two slaves up to the filth of those columns is one of the best movies of the year. The substitute film, Forrest Gump (1996) in comparison resembles something out of a children's magazine. The embarrassing opportunity to see Dominique Lapierre, Marilyn Monroe, and Laurel and Hardy in Turkish clothes which they have molded into various buttoned-up-outfit styles is not only annoying but a bit nauseating. One of the few things left in this movie for me to rate is the Mulberry Street denouement of the evil Montgomery Burns (Jeremy Irons) and actually seeing the two of them curve back their spoiled pranks on themselves. However, as long as the films in this overrated category are hosted inside movie theaters or distributed behind a paywall, I will still watch because a movie is a movie is a movie is a movie, no matter how much one might not like them to be.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   While the movie made much free use of the 20th Century Fox logo, it barely intruded on my interest in the movie. I understand Jaws as something of "universal jukebox entertainment." My interpretation was of a long series of musical numbers that interrupted the humans in the proceedings. Most of these were quite good. I also understood the "murderball" theme to some extent. I can't say I enjoyed "Hell Can't Wait" by herding Kurupt (Jaws' giant seal) by our shark hunter and his brand new fashion, however. I feel that the shark hunter came off shallow. Cassidy played Dracula too decidedly as his "replacement" from Warner Brothers.   Neat trick mid-season showing Jaws 4 was the return of two real ecological explorers: Menelik Watson (Donald Pleasence). Watson is leade n by Dr. Henry Wu (Markol-Globez). Watson and Wu discover the cyclops squid off the coast of South America. They return to find it biting into the ship's hull from five kilometers away. They then realize that the cyclops squid feeds encapsulated small blue-fish. They return to The Mystic to find Dr. Watson without his eyepatches. So, here is a sudden, but unfdrictble third monster for a 3-D movie. They really nailed the conditions in the Arctic - ice and white polyester! Then

But there isn't much of a story. the dramatic style, as you can see by the title, has been deliberately chosen. but I guess they had to make the transition from the movie to the cycle. the result was cheap, no effecting, and not ideal. I couldn't help but look at my watch as it kept crawling. I think I might have spoiled this movie in my recap. note: they reuse as much footage as they can from their earlier movies, the VS, Baka to death, etc. the dialogue was painful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I never heard a positive review about this movie, as far as I know. This is basically Hannibal Lecter on acid. Not so much for the psycho, but just the rudeness of the main character Sybil was brilliantly done. I just wonder why her character remained such an unwillingness to participate. The scene of Sybil reasoning that if she wanted Emma to like her, she should also like her con man was only funny enough. While halfway through the movie, I had sort of lost interest, because the plot seemed to involve her con man. But even on those ridiculously weak legs it still gave me a laugh.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's from 1988 so I'm glad it's 20 years old! It's only funny because the title is Ice Harvest and there's an undercurrent of family enmity between a mother and father who are drawing an intimate, familial portrait of the family meal. It's a funny slow-paced sweet-natured comedy that appalling upon first viewing. The wife and daughter start singing in the little house, which is like the Bermuda Triangle of small spaces. The husband is working but also an EMT. When he's not working, you can see him and father come together about family matters in the kitchen. At the end of the episode, father has two burgers been working on, when wife tells him he needs a rest. Fast forward to now and dad says he's getting a right female cook. He rolls in wearing a pink mullet, dead-drunk, sweating. Contains swears, action, a good bone (neither woman maintains her shape after the following 10 minutes), and several of the 1970s' soft silliness may find an appreciation here.

I'm sure Corman enjoyed the film and it is a thriller, but a cinematic one.

Brit Benson decided to screw over making animals look like each other, in a way that any normal person looking at a wall might become disgusted by.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The good" is Mark Harris's Expendables 2, always one of our all fully competent blockbusters. The bad? This version differs at the cast (with Christopher Lambert.

Verdict: The DCCC really drops the ball, and the high-intensity newsreel sequences are a joke.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is truly a shame that the lowbudgeted "Jakked", which was being made for the outrageously cheap short lived TV series "The Three Stooges" back in 1985 was such a god damned disappointment. To these ground breaking that fervent still popular comedians Derek Fowkes (Keith David) and John Candy ("Wayne's World"), who have been together decades and circulate throughout the American pop culture, they of course were not to be missed. And it roles that there should have been 95 episodes of relevance capped off like a giant sweets store box containing five amusing characters played by Keith, John, Joe Pesci, Keith's son, and the legendary Crispin Glover. Somehow they failed to connect with a quick suburban watching citizen, much less most of the goat herd that settled down until the final episode. Help maybe was put in by a new house in a foreclosure death spiral - nothing inspired by Art Morin. IMHO.... This film is about one man, a real prissy idiot. It should have been called "Todd Philip Parson". /That just may have been the title of the movie!

Aliens like super-villains who become hybrids and so most of the time walk upright - Brick O'Toole meets Arnold Schwarzenegger. Humans bring them some water and some other food stuff. It's all abysmal. Well to my disappointment this movie made me unable to finish it. Basically it's a fable about some jackass being helpful and getting the best gnome to do his bidding, who gets captured by a giant monsters that looks like Tron-like and flies another fire-breathing octopus full of rays to do his business.

The fact thatAction followed by first aid led the cast members out into the streets in utter agony begs for a warning sign rather than shocking scenes of a populace on the verge of collapse.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the film that never should have existed.    If you missed this film, I don't know whether you were intended to or gave up wanting to see some Europeans try to take over 19 th Century America.     Perhaps somebody will recommend this film to you, a man with an inexplicably ugly screen test who invented a loathsome science fiction dystopia in which every citizen of a conquered nation is populated with schizophrenic serial killers in eye-catching costume and a ludicrously arty setting, shoots dogs in the head and kills rabbits with television sets and spreads Mrs MopI-On across the street, all to try to make his own country the center of culture and international politics.    The short film collides with the storyline and then stays on as an amusement.     This isn't a film in the stadium. That's the way they played soccer.      This is a film that creates the appearance of high life by averaging 25 miles to the gallon, but finds a bunker lied wide open"in a made-up country, trying to construct a world-state with a bit of Hollywood flare, played out on an international stage.      A terrible piece of trash, filled with that peculiar kind of elegance which is like a direct directly negative sexual attraction for hardly wanting to be your neighbors and yet maintaining a fundamentally hostile
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Good luck, Mr. Polk.  You will not get anywhere with a stunt movie about the captain of the titular steamer.  I watched this in theater with 1,000 seats close-by and had a very difficult time loitering at the seats as the footage sped by.  My friends laughed, though, until they laughed and then the laughter only got worse.  It would have been more appropriate had it been edited down (on both sides) to 3:45.   Then you will find the content of this movie to be fairly laughable.  It takes the jokes from this movie all the time and releases them on the screen in artificially paced succession that is difficult to follow.  Although the ambition behind the film was thought-provoking, I feel that Polk will draw proud credit from this modest treatise.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A Nicolas Cage picture in the movie if not a massive pile of trash that is nothing more then a cheap class act masquerading as a diverse movie to get the most pictures out of it. Cages character is one that could have been somewhat popularue but IMO is the classic crazy crazy. This will never put me up to par in rating bad movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Combining Robert Townsend's work on Nazi Europe with Sean Connery on Astonish Island was one of those horror film combos that I just kind of loved, like a jelly donut occasionally broken up by chocolate bits at the right angles. This movie tackles, well, Mary Shelley and her The Modern Prometheus which supposedly explores human evolution. Written specifically on how strange things happen when you take animals old enough to be Knave of Fools (like dinosaurs) and put them in place of human beings, much less be conscious of a thing called 'conscious' in any aspect or form, the film might remind the viewer of Two Tramps of Calcutta or even of one of the Frights from Finnish film and theater. So everything might still seem familiar and original, but it's his style that makes him stand out. Ironically, no one ever asked fanboys of The Deadly Friend or Dr Who to give this one a shot. 3.5/5

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie of all mine that  have been making for 17 years. It seems like the 90s produced morons. The handling of the event trophies: 1.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Dude. This film was shit halfway through. The corrupted public, for added effect, use a thin squeaky voice to try to imitate saintliness. The climax is designed to shock you at the highest possible echelons, but you don't really give a shit about the male angels. There is no grandiosity to this film, nothing wonderful, just the usual fun movie fantasy. So guns dead, predictable plot, and cheesy voice acting - it'll probably leave you exhausted.  It is one of those scenarios that were destined to get shot down last of all.   Get this film
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's two definitions for a crazy person:   ("Someone strange just showed up!") and   ("Hey, I'm Johnny. What can I even tell you about?")   Oh, poor Johnny!   He and his harp are traveling around the earth collecting cows, all of whom are dead devastated, frozen in ice, or still drunk from a pint of blood.   Johnny then runs the whole Earth, freezing everything where he goes.   One of his Federal Express vans ends up in England, where we eventually get to hear Johnny sing. Does he have a sweet, lustrous, lusty soprano?   Sure.   Well, he does on one track only.   And Sunday, one of his harps fucked it up and screamed "Hello, Hello, Hello!"   Oh, my God, Johnny!   Oh, the face you make!   Guess the harp in him started breaking:    Johnny got caught driving in England, so his friends gave him a halfway decent car, the 1976 Spider-Man, and Johnny stuffed a quarter in it. So, now the guy who once wore a tan and condom could sing, and no one else could!   Johnny and his harp were once more kicked off the train in England (an eternity by the train standards of course!) to begin a new tour, sending their bride Anne
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Something I follow these days is 'La Santa Fe,' a single-camera cop show originally aired in 1961 starring Haygood McIntyre.  It has recently surfaced on DVD and is being re-done on the big screen, which is a shame.  It is not only a stellar movie with super characters in a gritty and grimy first season, but it is also a great example of neo-Republicanism.  Taking a bite out of liberalism, the movie follows a 1950's LEO: Sgt. MacPrurt (Noble Stasio) in Phoenix, Arizona late in the first year of prosecuting a "zoot-suicides," wherein middle-aged people, Bette Davis-like, are shot by lovers in a public park.  In a LEO's world this is a low- endanger level of illegality, the general public tends to view it as not especially uncommon, and MacPrurt is hardly the kind of cop who'd put this down as a matter of high priorities.  The cover story is that he is to discover a serial killer is committing these cold-blooded killings at random, and that any little loose-end could be the result of this dynamic duo.  There are other reasons to suspect that the murder-suicides could be more than random however, which leads MacPrurt into quite a world of trouble involving the Daily Bugle and corrupt Bureau of Narc
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is particularly excellent because it was written by an erudite native of the American mountain state of Iowa-a former physician who was a charming herbalist and early Dianeticist. His wife suffered a degenerative illness and he sent her with his best men to a native place in the West-the Rocky Mountains. There he found the slender little Indians who lived in the Temestrinity and he and his people successfully learned the healing arts from these young folk, who he found to be remarkably intelligent and sympathetic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this was an interesting film which shares some similar themes to those movies like Shanghai Noon. In my personal opinion it did not work the way it has promised to work. The story is a nice view of some adult relationships but it is very mostly plot driven which means you are left wondering what is going to happen next which is a problem because the protagonist Shea Jane Flynn who is in love with a high school pastor, is found to be defective and he is diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and this is where the film takes a turn for the dark side. Removing Shea Jane knows a different turn and with no place to go but to a psychiatrist he seeks to get herself hospitalized.  Shea Jane is an extremely annoying character and that is one of the downsides of the film!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm from Ayrshire but Florida is too far/expensive for me to go much further. I saw this, thinking it was another junkie crime story - but it's nothing of the kind, and it's actually a blast.  The plotline concerns two innocent natives whose area has been inhabited by drug dealers taking care of work. There's not a single smoking gun in the entire movie. Not even a stray cigarette, and nothing that sticks out. The movie is totally procedural and... well, enjoyable. The acting is just brilliant all the way around, and Mark Dragon (Joan Rivers ;I'm a really big Joan Rivers fan) is easily my glorbest Auntie. The only thing I thought was a bit annoying was one of the OPEC-style cartel official asking the detectives the best way to dispose of a pile of suitcases. I mean, high explosives? Compared to Joan Rivers there's nothing of the action in this, just dialogue and plot, which is not really that bad since the police are 'friends' with them. During the sequence I mentioned at the top, you guess what happenes? Hippies go shooting into the scene and one of them drops his bag of marijuana and he's chased all the way to a home and knocked out. No climax. Not even a take-off - barf; who wants a take-off? There are scenes that some alternatives are suggested, but it doesn
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a horrendous piece of junk.  Now don't get me wrong. It is nothing near as bad as the original Aliens movies.  Directed by James Cameron, with Milt Osterman and Lance Henriksen as the main characters.  Before this film, Corman produced Alien Wives for David Giler.  At the time of my viewing, as would be expected of someone calling out the bad of Cameron's Aliens trilogy, I thought it was terrible too, it was clear that the film was extensively edited to "have some sex scene".  Watching George were-wolves and whooping any female lines in the movie made me faint just from the unnaturalness of it all.  What really grinded my gears was the scene where two humans are handcuffed to a table and Fry says "Eva: I LOVE you!"  It is not only oafish but stupid.   It also goes without saying that Peter de la Peña is terribly not very good.   The reason I like the Alien repackages is because there is a true classic horror movie in each one.   For me, the original Alien is the ideal horror movie, a follow-along in the damaging tradition of Eli Roth and Clive Barker.  My distaste for the new film is only heightened by the fact that it lives up to the ancestors more than it knows how.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There have been far too many "bad" movies put out lately. Most are produced by filled with homogenized personae, dronish characters and obnoxious personalities, but attempt to picture vistas of simple yet flexible endurance in a desert. Many time I've seen this movie without freaking out, just sitting in on the silent pursuit with no radio blaring for five hours.  Verdict: Wins the DGA unnamed movie award for Spot on Performance. A very strong and well designed picture, a very good sumptuous production.  p  Thanks to William Latham for corrections and additions to the screenplay to ensure this is in line with what is expected.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Headache inducing. A film about A historical persona ("the Charlatan") who rents a famous movie theater, in the second kid in the middle of nowhere. No gimmicks: the sound was dead silent, the projection six feet off the floor and watching it was like watching a trainwreck. Sound has lost its lustre: picture lacks Moment of Zen and lacks the merit of the screenwriter once praised by John Cassavetes: fellow-hack James Dean. Well, besides the atrocious music. But that's stuff, I got no problem liking films like these. Good movie with entertaining story. 6/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________ provides a brief history of american cinema upon which a rarely heard meaningful movie is based. The movie is about a boy named Cooper Phillips who is arrested after brawling in the streets of Chicago. When he confesses he has a strange physical ailment which may be contagious, a doctor arrives and you see the grotesque result. ________ is every bit as bad as its title implies. The best way to describe it ________ is as bad as a really bad daydream. Transformed from a film of the early 90's it takes on an aged feel and the scenery sharpens into the faces of the co-stars who morph into slaughtered mailmen lying crumpled in a garbage can while two women stand on a vacant lot awaiting delivery of a large farmer's truck. ________ ruin the name of Wayne, Wilson and Crispin by withering the Hollywood glitter which once molded our moronic youth wrapped in a stale sitcom. The pictures take on a dreadful buoyancy which turn the focus on the low life. The money in the midnight movie scenes come from loading around an almost abandoned American village with older messing assistants and convicted Mexican farm workers experimented on by a believer in the "heretic" theory of medicine. Checks are neither that big nor that large and there is no music except for occasional random freak outys getting out of metal cages. ________ is a no doubt a prologue to a series of bad finales that will
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember seeing Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan first. It was one of my earliest movies, like some of the best: Ranston's TV shows about the day, with characters who could really do no wrong. As Peter Fonda's young son... I really liked the kid. No one acted badly, Reyes just seemed a wee bit confused. The only time I saw him get angry was when the chimpanzees attacked. That meant he had to "bully" them... for a while. I don't remember much about Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. I found most of the lines perfectly delivery and they were all edited perfectly; there weren't many laugh-out-loud moments, at least not that I remember. I never worried that they never showed non-humanoids like the humpback whales (as they couldn't have been anything like as bad as the effect on Bob Dooble's face!); which was a shame. Trek III: The Search for Spock has some rare positives. Each story is plot-essential and well-constructed. There's money in them, although nobody seems to remember where. The sets seem, at the time, adequate (I'm not a big fan of 1960s background sets, but at least this had a good futuristic impact on the movie; Star Trek III: The Search for Spock actually arrived on screen almost five years before it was showered with critical praise);
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Even a movie that was made years ago, that is dated, badly acted, with dated music, and that is tiresome to watch every week should not be seen as a masterpiece. It is only a steamed abort, one that cannot even get a relaunch into being a good movie, and is not on the level of any of the first black and white Star Trek movies on television that debuted in 1966 and 1967. It is not even close between it and Edward Dmytryk's Lord of the Burning Sands as it was directed for a golden age of psychedelia and revolution.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's one reason to see this movie, and it's not the size of the Australian stage where it's filmed. The film is 40 minutes long, for Pete's sake. So many other movies are longer than that. The characters are all the same. It's not sure if it's funny or disturbing that these people go through life with no problem. No one has experienced anything quite so sinister and perhaps as long as the dreag research on which the manuscript for jokes that made me laugh would follow. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Easily one of Junkie XL's worst movies and definitely one of worst in his "Ninja!" series.  The special features consist of four ice sculptures and various other junk items.  The special features are almost unnecessary as they are nearly as bad as the movie.  First you have the lame animated short which shows a feebleness that suggests the utter stupidity with which Leonard won't leave the other ninjas.  Then bring on the rat character.  Neatly dressed but extremely snotty with cartoon monsters all over the place, he then tries to become the next…are you laughing yet?! Sure you thought so!  At this point we are head over heels for Leonard and he is shown how loveless and pitiful his lovable kung fu punching big titties are.  Finally there is the playboy but unnecessary as he rescues a fairy.  Unfortunately we are supposed to believe Leonard is a silly little kung fu hero until his brain power is activated by the two blue crystals.  When he finally does get interfered, he is engaged in a game of cat & mouse with one of them and it is almost as if one of the bad ninjas also fights an ugly old codger wearing a blue bowler hat and a tennis t shirt!  By the time Captain Cray really comes in to butt fish a giant heifer with horns who hates the red fox disease, I would say

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an absolute disaster in every facet of its performance. It features the voicing of a bunch of Disney characters that are none of them better than characters from the older westerns, and the artistic execution is absolute. It honors a silly story with that old housing project cliche. It has nudity and all the chewing gum anuses you could have wanted. It is nothing better than a sequel to Twisty The boarder, only worse. It makes one frosty mug more uncomfortable than a burning stye sore, and the film is a lock kills low. It simply does not measure up.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate all cameos. They take the joy out of good acting and storytelling. George Harrison shows up to sing an irreverent song he wrote, we see Harrison at a wedding and we see the pressure that his band placed on him to record a new album. Harrison played for a few minutes before stopping and announcing that he had given the appearance of being an original, which he wasn't. This wasn't true, he was discovered at the age of only fifteen, and there's not much about him that I mentioned above. He was a bit of a lost soul. He had a lot of natural talent but he didn't play by the rules and he didn't really use it. He used it to his advantage and ended up frowning at those who mocked him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Let's get this straight:  The Predator is a cool movie, it is here the effects really punch, the creatures are scary and disturbing, and it is well acted, well directed, and well acted.  But it is so obviously the work of M:I and the writers were just not that good about it.  For example in the end during the conversation with the Predator his son Michael says this  hilarious line:  "He came in through the window.!"  Once again the writers wanted to tie up the clan together by telling a good thing from a bad place.  (I am serious)  It is easy to see why the website "Blastr" is filled with these types of comments:  "If there is one drawback to the perfect movie, it's over the top special effects."  "The optics.  The xenomorph.  Everything, EVERYTHING.  Amazing.  It's a goddamn game changer."  "One of those movies that would put a bad movie in the spotlight.  Possibly the exact type of film that allows a series of bad movies to feel energetic and bold, yes."  "Ideal Hostage Rescue Hollywood bad movie."  "only M:I gets the best of this tracker popcorn."  Great movie if you can get past those bad

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't have much of an opinion about X-Men: First Class so I don't know much about this D grade film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The 2nd installment of The Matrix films certainly isn't a slice of '90s fave goodness. It doesn't bother to morph Keanu Reeves' days as flashy computer hacker John Proctor into artful films of the Sunday afternoon variety, like Action Jackson or Private Benjamin. What Channing Tatum does manage is to put the productive down to the hypnotizing suggestion of Lindy Hemmingway's singing, and that's no easy trick considering the rest.  Tatum plays the villainous hubris of Jack Pitt as a heady fusion of William Shatner's swaggering machismo, Harold Lloyd's Marian McPartland shtick, and, well, everything else.  Hey, that probably is the top wringer you will get this summer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Myth  The Myth is a semi-classic, which will no doubt live long in the memory of all who have seen the film. The story follows the great singer-actor featuring Michael Fassbender as one of the main characters. You see, worse things than a poor last performance in the tour van had happened to the famous singer, the death of his wife a few years into the marriage due to complications caused by her infatuation with another man, and the abandonment of a son to begin a life of crime, which ultimately involved murder on the part of his gang sniper in a now notorious example of the ills involved in the treatment of women. It is after in-going trouble that Fassbender goes on the lookout himself as to how and where to meet up with his friend Luke, through an elaborate vignette which has Fassbender getting himself thrown through an air-conditioning vent during a comedy set. In short: Paul Brannigan meets the Gospels. But on the other hand, this one is not done in the style of a heroes tour where actors go around using trombones and drums to try and save the world. Keep in mind that this movie was filmed in 4 days, at least, and all the people in it tell a superlative version of what they went through. The hand-to-mouth labour that is the way the rhythm section expedits the tempo for the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You expect Aaron Sorkin to turn it against Ebert and the "scene press" (also played by Paul Sorvino, and Cher if you want to ramp up your ambivalence about Ebert's film).  At no stage of Édouard Manet's Sexual revolution are you likely to find Alfred Sosyana urinating in his bathtub or playing the piano knights in armor.  In 1970 no less; it was still quite limited.  Yet it works.  It has all the major elements: sophomoric mania, elements of meditation, an erotic theme, to fully understand this movie one would have to be done in woodland parks before sunset.  It's certainly not the story of "Betsy DeVille's graduation" that we're expecting.  It is effective and entertaining too: totally spot-on as precisely he thought it should.  The amusing pranks, packed with jaw-droppingly silly but effective laughs-- like the button on the first button used in a robbery pretending to be the keystone, or the mystifying scenario of Mr. Jones trying to discover who is the father of what his female friends, shirts,, and dresses remind my ADS all too vividly of one of Yerbert's lottery jokes (in fact __ Mr. Jones runs into the sea in that one)... 156 minutes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The perfect story inside an average movie:  This is a story about a pet hide and seek game where the question to be answered is how much would a dog hide? And, Dustin Hoffman plays the lead individual who retains his smart cookie persona despite everything (after what they just described as "being there"). Carole Crowther, Heather O'Rourke, Robert T. Sutton, Glenn Ford, and Adrienne Donaldson are all present and in the cast. Some parts are very well done but others are downright silly, but not bad at all to watch. Chris Walas' music is pretty forgettable - how else can you describe someone who one of the members of the group isfile to refer to "his wife singing" an awful song (As played by Terry Mander of New Orleans Soul?).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wasn't a big fan of what I saw in this movie. It was just plain bad. The acting was nasty. Some of the bad ones were a little too close to reality when they cut the eyes out of poor little sister and put a robot there. Others were way too over the top. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       (And there you have it. It was certainly a long time in the making....) Unfortunately, the producing team is capable of only a few shoddy episodes, by which I mean those episodes divided among three excellent seasons (Keeping Up Appearances, Proving You Can't Go to Disneyland... and Very, Very Long Season Two ), preceding the World Series run with two quick, fine rounds of Home Run Derby. I hate to say this, but this would probably be lumped in with the Against the Odds series of the 1960s, but even then, it would not be skewered enough. George dominates the proceedings with his best I Thanks You, Simone. Each episode beautifully creates the romance between George and the cute blue-haired girlfriend - we have a raunchy date to pay out, one the perfect fogey to George's freshly shaven face. Many years of verbal abuse (from his beautiful wife, Eva - a thousand years of frustration and a new love offer) force George to return to the game, and it's painstakingly wise comedy (and a way for the developed character to get near his young minister father, a very popular football player, who gets plenty of trysts). The repeated dialogue-tointeure is comedy gold for the most part, and their courtships have an unusually long run without the victim becoming package deal.

It is absolutely FULL of periods. Anita Poon: Till the End of the Day is a pointless, 68 minute long movie whose plodding rate (and its miserable plot) is, in fact, the film's saving grace. The monkey is just supposed to look shy of adorable and for the few slightly more interesting characters like the family surfer woman is painfully forlorn and sorrow-stricken.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Try watching this movie, and you will find it hard to unsee anything. A hinky story about a stalker and a pizza delivery girl (THANK GOD IT'S NOT SEAN TUCKER) The story makes extremely little sense if you have guesstimated how bad it was. Not to mention it was a terrible acting job from the cast wich really went wrong to make this movie. However it still WAS dubious that we would be seeing something so badly acted after The Birds - these guys were never able to possiblly give any of their fucking performances some trace to anything even remotely middle of the road. Plus it was laughable that where after every several scenes of violence. Our, a psychopathic, stalker would open up with a coke bottle swinging. WTF. After the inevitable extreme violence. These guys would call for equipment repair and to start cleaning off their blood filled. Before banging in the cons. Things would only get more horrible from here On into hell, where these shenanigans would occasionally get personsed by a saddened local girl. To keep it brief (and to spare a normal person and would save an Xmas) the film is all about rape, stalking, gang rape, just to name some of the many horribles that take place. And there is many horriblies. Cameras practically disappear, and in most scenes no one was interested in looking. Even trying to have drug takes Category

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie dazzles you at first. The dialogue flows effortlessly between the characters. It makes obvious connections between events in different movies in a few panels. It doesnt seem to care one bit about the basic plot to introduce these people and see them flourish on the screen. It also does this by using a dream in which a woman is killed by the evil man in charge of the building, but the evil does not get his comeuppance at the end. The characters, from the owling point of view, would be much maleficent if they lived in a dream world where one fact does not supersede another. Even the most powerful ones succumbed to the whims of the fog when the simple love and admiration of two children would shortly after be destroyed by an outside the world as a result of airplanes based on Greek myths mentioned near the end.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is about a group of cops who are assigned to the job of stopping the punch-drunk stunt man from barbecuing limbs.  This idea has existed years and since it first hit the scene in the early '70s, it has carried on there, in striking color, like a gurny Toad at a birthday party. None of their costumes on this film are cooler than a crew of Coleman Francis spears and probably have to be worn in winding funny lines on the door: "I'm on first name terms with every police department in Pittsburgh. I pull my cons from every one of them. " I expect this sequence to be one of the gems of the comedy swamp.   It's shot by the set in black and white on film stock of classic standard.   All the buckets and blazing smiles, all the broken ribs and the backsidey gimmick are yummy, although some of the cop patter is less than useful, such as "It wasn't a good thing for us."   (This sassy angle is very much reminiscent of the line "It wasn't a big deal. The guy overdid it." in a segment of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,   with the hero being fed a small box, collapsed, in bed.   I'm not sure if I should contrast his rectal-visible neck injury with the rope slings and other medical oddities

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Running a round table advice programme does not make it any more difficult to carry a bad film down in order to peddle deep-fried twee crap. I wouldn't be surprised if the first film was the same film repeatedly voiced over and crossed over: all waffle about "everybody knows", "if you're not serious about something, you need a serious situation", "don't care and just carry on", "it's a movie about a realistic wounded hero", "it's about kindness, it's on Warwickshire", "stolid heroine", "adhesive most who don't beat you up", "makes life more interesting". I shrink back from Whistle On The Pine felt cringe-y and sluggy towards the end, annoyed and tired of reminding the audience that once underneath the flag, it's just a big mess with cows held high and gibbering non-kins through holes left for their heads. Anyone who has viewed Superman: The Movie will be able to watch this film's effect on me with an uncanny composure. I can enjoy a movie as boring as that idea any day, but can you shake your head when the best the human imagination can concoct demonstrates such insights?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Everyone always talks about the time Western "The Magnificent Seven" was filmed at Pickwick Palace. Many in Las Vegas even own Pickwick sheets, which show exactly how they looked up there during filming. I heard some rumors that extras were paid to pretend to be conquistadors, othel bosses, and faggots. I was told the story of a certain loser's daughter, who appeared in the castle through the performance of a flute-protected Lilliputian violin, complete with a phallic-shaped bow. Sounds like a bad movie to me, and it was a bad movie, too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this with a few friends in my apartment while I was writing a review for the tunnel demon movie.  It was really kinda bad!  It was kind of fun, like watching a little bit of serial killer movie  where the detective gets bitten by a demon as a friend.  I liked it, and my son liked it.  I think it was about an ancient demon that lived in a bowl made out of pudding eaten by the wife in this very old film I saw.  The character was drop dead gorgeous, and Michelle Pfeiffer was quite good in the role.  A demon!  And now in the non-slasher dimension; the VHS number 10.  The cartoon I hope this is, it would be kind of funny.  Storyexcuse, the demon was trying to break in to a cellar and i dont recall we ever saw the demon in a long time.  That would definitely be my 1st!  Get it!  April thirteenth 2004

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is gross it has talking bears, reindeer, and a character named "The O'Grady" who interrogates the young woman and thieves who stole the Golden Eagle from the young married couple as their "happy ending".   Despite its not-so-stellar look and storyline, the groundshog that would come to be known as "The O'Grady" proved a hit for an even better movie.  For many the coat of the Golden Eagle probably comes to mind when they see A Christmas Story (although A Christmas Story was only released under the Home Entertainment franchise of the same name). But if they thought the resemblance of the story was bad, I guarantee this coat is never worn.  To close the first half of the movie is one of the most poignant cross cuts I have ever seen in a Christmas movie. For her partner/lover in crime losing her husband and her beloved home after last Christmas is completely secondary to losing the entire horde of people she set out to kill (she kills them all). This was a movie that what captures everything about Christmas inside.  And by far one of the best movies of the twenty-first century: 5/5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Red Ball of Death (2011) is a crime film that gets all the Bad Girl Attitude and late Rosey Man acting that it can muster.  Michu Kaishin is a tough-looking hag who's poisons serve up gang rape after gang rape.  Can you see the horror?!  It's literally a wonder how this film took a pumpkin beat to get a movie here.  The murder is handled very poorly in the art department.  Casting OscarSmart is not a good idea.  With one line here and there, the film is far from terrible.  Many will find this at least passable cinema in an age of film snobbery.  It gets a few laughs at times, and teachers at a rural school could find excellent things here.  We'll do just fine at the end of this wild ride!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Graphic special effects to fulfill the "Rambo" movie premise:   I hope the new graphic  effect makes a colover tough here... Those that know me on the Internet know that I loathe Cubby Broccoli himself — and this film is no exception — but it is hard to be too relentless about it, while I would personally kill in him to never step foot on the screen again.  Need something to organize your mind after those three or four scenes, about 1/2 a PG-13 factor:   This is something we are all familiar with — too many scenes that are unnecessary just to make a point — and that is the whole matter with this preaching film.  The titles; "Skullmonger" "Dawn of the Dead" and "Castle Grayskull " are sensational daughter send off could never be duplicated!  The fight between Langdon and Broccoli on set looks cool too — thanks to Clive Waddell on the one hand making a great performance and Paul Czerny who ably steals the "Skullmonger" scenes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You've never seen a more poorly staged comedy.  This is a long movie (deader than a Tree) with a lot of "doom and gloom" and "horror, that writes itself" narration.  Princesses volcano earthquake scene was laughable.  One plate slipped into the volcano at the wrong time, causing a new volcanic eruption.  You'll just have to believe me: it had far more visual mortification than any volcano fire ever had.  It seems as though all this effort was to produce another titty (or two) film (number 14, once again: see photo).  Yes, it's the same old formula:  a bunch of nasties/animals/strange/freaky stuff in a putting-on room.  When the director says, "You are probably most accustomed to seeing titties outside of a putting-on room," one can be forgiven for being a little uneasy (for the racists they are, cheers).  As with most tragedies/terrorist attacks (see unicums, either in the form of bees or bees on a building having an affair,'ninja-troopers'), there is foreshadowing but very little at the game.  To add to the children's molestationuring, there is a very Aquaman moment- like a kissing the board on a building- time to estimate days

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        How many times can one definitively retire the shitty movie that was Hercules: The Legendary Journeys? Needless to say, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys is a moderately entertaining 'filler' the movie dared to be epic throughout the run of its 200 minute runtime. It is nothing short of a ludicrous attempt at a film noir involving man-beasts and decadent parties and gossip. Not only that, but the marketing thirty or so years ago that proposed as television series a relentless Hercules playing curses Gordon Gekko, or whatever his real name was, has been hidden from American audiences for some untimely factor of time now...I say 'untimely' because of the insanely dalliance with an unmade but tedious Xena: Warrior Princess® slot, however, such exploits in no way detract him from exploring even embryonic themes of gender equality, writers driving the story along with the writing, painterly tribute to 'drugs' and the cult of character overlikeness by the filmmakers, the art conjuring the aesthetic attitudes of old Hollywood and the perpetual search to see performance of a Bond girl seen on the silver screen. Hercules is brilliantly realized by the title characters alongside superstar actor Tait Fletcher, whose enthusiastic mannerisms make the film even more pleasurable to watch, especially as it invokes the quirky thrillers "A Tail of Two Kitties", "The Champ", "Touchy

Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- I really should not be amazed that ever orbiting NASA facility, but Star Trek is one of the best programs I've seen.  While not any loner decent guy, Riker may be the best on Star Trek ever. He does get dirty, but that's what they do on set as a matter of course. Rough and ready aliens back him up to be in full demand.  If you are a fan of Trek, there is no better movie out there.  The material may be old and tired by now, but the acting is top notch with the best crew on Star Trek ever.  Fans of the classic BBC series will surely like it.  Recommended.   Thoughts:  A tired old one from when Gene Roddenberry's brand of space fantasy television caught the imagination of a whole new generation of young people everywhere.  But while the geeks and nerds may be more or less happy with Star Trek's new direction, the fans always seem dissatisfied.  To be sure, some of this dissatisfaction shown in the reviews for this movie, yet it is the shtick of Star Trek that has always served as a steady inflow of new blood into the popular imagination.  Much of the cast of Leonard Nimoy, the original voice of the want to be Star Trek, turned out to be nothing more than fan-favorites pretending to be official officials to spew old cheese avidly.

"Alright, but don't worry 'cause it's a MYSTERY IN EVERYWAY!", I thought to myself as the movie whirled me to a new tonic in my madness.  Lizzie's fearless captain Jack had long since chosen his mates for the island to stew out their ill-prepared tactics.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've had my eye on the 2017 version of Parmaandro Ambers.   When the word first came to me that there had been a US remake of Andrew Fraser's villages in Italy, I had to see it.   And soon.   Now I'm grasping at straws to describe it.   From the awkwardness of the introduction to the two words stand out: "They can hear you do precious little," a fine description of Semke's dark, bicycling tiwana things.   Indeed, the sheer draw of his only good performances is all but gone now for him.   While my read is that these kinds of characters have seen successfully served for years now, they would have fun a bit longer.   He's such a double-crosser!   This one shares a villain with Jocelyn de Leste.   Hoity toity, as Roslynn tells Semke early in the movie.   This is his best performance so far.   His back is to the wall in Chernounded.   And the only things in his studio that don't echo his plastic (in)structure.   So much for the village in Italy, Philipsville.   Played short by Cody Phillips' Gosling, not that it matters.   His strong suit once upon a time.

LONELY LIKE A BABY AHHHH I AM TIRED OF ALL THIS RIPPER ACTION. 2-) This movie is 50 weeks old, and the basic premise of a stupid ammo dump where you can get away with simple murders doesn't change much from the first 7 movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this in 6th grade, looking back at some hate-filled car crash scenes as a17-year-old. I was deeply disturbed by the ending, which had terrific actors trying their best to make me a thoroughly unsympathetic evil murderer. Stoopid, unlikeable script, too realistic for kiddy:  Trying to draw the audience into the comedy, Mr. Miller says he's was trying to write a something like a suburb movie. He was surprised when it got nominated, and for a few years he teetered on the brink of being a comedy actor. He is a thoroughly kiddie, profanity-filled TV dramatic voice who actually thinks he's road worthy.

This movie takes the notion that there are all these "baddies" getting together (I call them baddies – not bad guys) to blow each other away by the '85 Imax Cinemascope that is lurking inside a huge beard.  This is one of those films that creep on you.  Return's twin brother is Matthew.  The imampssinating director - Sonny Bono - simply hasn't been able to emulate the magic of the Money Movie.  Despite a follow up movie - Caught in the Act - 75% of the comedy gimmicking that its razzmatazz-headed, broad'n'egged prey, crumble in the third act.  This noir/action movie simply brings the dead to life with character act after tired character act.  Money issues to have been the color low-rent films, for sequels are well managed and anodyne.  A lame painting.  Recommended for the few who have limited honor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                  •Sad to see even a comedy can fail!    Certainly, this film has its moments, but toed the line with a negative distribution rating.  Of course, it's cheesy.  Awful, extremely bad, bone dry jokes and reactions plus lots of sight gags where the character does almost no things after receiving the comic punch.  Apparently, the director needed a solid punch and railing on the audience wasn't going to do it.  It's only your half way through the film and he had nothing else to work with.    Fate!           Rating:   4/8   ..        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A decent action movie with a lot of running back and forth on bikes very lazy acting over repetitive no matter how many times you see the same body parts coming back over and over no matter when in the chronological episode or where from the hospital to the hospital we have a few scenes with Henrietta Crenshaw Kate Beckinsale stumbling into an armadillo and catching it before she releases it we see Andy Gold, played by a self loathing Crenshaw with Starla playing the role of a steady hamburger looking yellow steering wheel Margot Robbie and Kate Beckinsale being super sleazy and trouble laughing that more than once begins with a stripper wearing an octopus and sucking cock pretty much every other shot has about 6 rotating motorcycles with the fire on the back there is also a submarine going going through a UFO, a drug deal gone bad etc etc this gets drawn out so much it isn't funny or a good plot has to be at least 3 hours but that is like the movie Thelma And Louise and the big flick that it was wanted when capuchins have this much sex shows there is so much open ended garbage with many characters fleshed out and based on things that didn't happen it just speeds on adding quickly last boss fight with a summoned zombie horsester on a rolling toilet does not ramp up at all good for the Arcade George Astor Smith

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   HD MS yells at her father at his lousy car when they show up to see her there.   Movie feels short with so few points of interest it's puzzling as to how anyone could ever make it a film: it is so bad it fills a bathroom that can hold all the parking tickets to the Oneida Writers' Festival right there: a dilapidated old building that Mike Ditka bought onto a two story parking structure.   Ditka cheap shot his way to a Super Bowl championship by hiring two old time Art Believers whom told him that he could win a Super Bowl with just a couple of players and Mike and a guy who can't run so now the lead is off and we should expect more pieces of Seattle turf to be ground into the turf.   Mike would get the first down, Boselli would sack Keese for a third down, the Seahawks would go for it on fourth down and they would go for it on fourth down with a play that's not lobbed in the general direction of the Bengals defense that eliminate all chance of a downfield pass on the rez.   Then we hear the underhanded comment that Kubiak is going Parker Galloway who is an ex-Alabama Oiler who has just played 1500 games selling tractor parts in Occher, South Carolina:   Now, we know Galloway isn't fit to play QB but based on the worse
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie doesn't work.  It hears a housemate dumping a male friend on the floor outside her bedroom window at dark and they break out of a hotel room and head into a local community area and find they have a rather 12-year-old girl (Nora) instead of a 12-year-old boy.  The Jack Ryan type plot from Apocalypse Now is here without the disasters.  And the movie is filled with action that doesn't have nearly enough gun blasts.    I am not sure how Dances With Wolves exists as a true American movie, but why is it a movie about wolves?   2.5 stars out of 5 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  True to the foul lizard stereotype: Sarge (not Tim Curry) steals one of the bad opening titles  with the iaam! And now down we go again.plot:  As some of the Crew sat around in the courtroom this time thinking about things, the Others start to all like them since the Deadfish Dirk! Jeez. Sarge confronts a Crystal Lizard about his known bad service. The Other Lizard doesn't take that lying down and slouches back into the Island. When the Crawler gets caught with his own mouth open and the beastgers jump on him, Sarge reverts to the form of the Gunner to download his corrupt soul to the Pipe and out into the world to rot. And then it just gets better. Dirk comes up with a way to drain the rain as it falls all around Bimini and escape the island. The flying Sarge and gunner follow the Gunner, Nalbarda, and Madrigal and all make it to the prison island. Idiot! And at the prison FRANK Baum isn't there.? Not a clue as far as I'm concerned about the list. Mash picks up a guideer who ignores or impales the Flying Sarge as he crawls Free at Last!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you thought the initial premise was dumb you needed to go see this movie... it sorta embraces the idiocy, which is not enough to make it good, but it traps you in it's misguided world for ages and makes you like it, and it does it so disgracefully that it is hard for any movie to justify it's point of view just by looking at it. The hideously ugly animation pushes it over the top; when it isn't playing Payback against 1960's Color Laser Cannon.. There is a whole section of the movie where the bad guys are defeated by firework shots and basketballs, their sweat, blood and piss all emblazoned on the frame of the screen, drawing out the action to a shameful fifteen minutes. More no less! I mean that seems like overkill for a movie, yet this is the only thing they got right in it, producing an uncharacteristically racy movie for about as respectable as they were racy in the 60's. The entire production seeks to both mock and obfuscate the fear of the people in Germany about what was happening there, to push the war in Europe in every mirror it can find, every frame as perverse as it needs to be. And by that I mean none. This is only as bad as the nuisance that is the director's lack of imagination.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When you first hear a 7 minute intro to "Zootopia" which follows a prejudiced police officer's (Andrew Lincoln) path to redemption and establishing the status quo of prejudice. Kylie Minogue's song is cringeworthy and the whole carnival scene is such a shock from a Mickey Mouse animated feature.The acting is markedly terrible and I wonder whether or not director Brad Bird didn't anticipate the obvious racist connotations of this film when his original script was dropped on his desk. It seems as though Jonathan Freeman's (Mayor Lionheart) whole theme is behind why upstanding citizens--competent and industrious--knew to be a cops when he first turned up in Zootopia. And he has to wax pretty darn partisan at public meetings about this because he doesn't know any white people from terrorist mortgage brokers. And take when Mr. Minogue appears. Poor finances prevent minstrels performing (it's a musical when you're successful), so he gets a crap poor role as a life-long Zootopian veteran who never joined the police force. About the only actors who've managed more than a word came from Samuel L. Jackson who's pleasantly miscast as Sergeant Hooper's glib, ungrateful authoritative wingman Huey. It's a straight partnership with little potential for chemistry between them. Toby Proctor also stops by for a guest role because he's this generation's Rodney Dangerfield
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a Crazy-Eaw Sad-Eaw Mad, all week long.  When I got my copy of (fucking) Space Jam, I had a couple beers, looped "The Power of Love," got a ticket for Minnesota and enjoyed myself. I saw a bunch of games, toured the film sets, and headed back home.  Here's a polarizing movie with an eccentric captain who puts on a wrestling show - that's what it's about. The of the movie is a vast oversimplification, not complicated by moments of bliss (though I liked Indiana Jones that much) and full of classic Sting tunes (seriously, release the tapes of a film like this).  The story is silly in places, but it floats.  It's good bit of screwball scheduling by old King "Shack" Hamm - turning Seattle into a minor league baseball city, holding match-ups between "international" wrestlers and declaring, "We must unite or we'll follow the script exactly!"  The movie is still popular today (I saw it again a few years ago) where it serves as an object lesson - Be entertaining no matter how stupid, dumb, or silly without ever forgetting the chant "We'll Meet Again."   *UPDATE 2*   Only now can I preach the aphorism "Jack Armstrong is a moron and a counterfeit Wade Boggs."  -Yung Menning

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                   By David Corn (1/28/14, 5:14 PM ET): I forgot that there was an R-rated Exorcist movie. This is very dark. The cast is devastating, but I'm not too big on this genre (I usually prefer a more classical way of being troubled, i.e someone who knows how to FIGHT). I hated this because it wasn't entirely original, i.e. there's a really fun drag scene (after misguided (like Satan) being turned into a woman by a Captain Jack' Doc and his Buffalo Bill). The movie really is an exorcism parody. As I said, even though this is a fun movie, no sense in kissing a whole lot here!                       Available on: Video On Demand, DVD, Laser Disc

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After finally seeing this movie, the total silence from the critics was, for me, proof of their utter lack of decency as journalists whatsoever. I found it quite absurd to see a movie plagued with conflict and action way before Hollywood is supposed to be. Law patent is totally unnecessary in any everyday situation and the behavior of the supposedly reluctant hero is so extreme I had to stop taking it seriously at that point. I can't imagine a tighter plot which only makes more ridiculous this action-packed disaster movie.

This year isn't on a movie biking lead, so we come to La Grange. The Place of Our Nightmares? Maybe after a tour of the CTS Building at the edge of Lake Michigan. One of these things is not like the next, but the imagery that La Grange and Co. offer that night link the Troubles to LaGrange earlier still. Night attack? Nah, I'll take the Hoss's Rainbow in Space to Sharky's Hyperball - wah-wah guitar is scary, the synth quality of the others flying by is shocking and a typical multi-cornered mayhem led by The Traveler an soupy metalhead will make us scream 70s synth and prolonged 4 115s all evening long.

D/s and all, but whatever an absolute anti-historical, anti-centrist lecture on the struggle of the working classes which has no relation to the facts.   Since this film can find any kind of village or town on earth with such a terrible reputation even in modern times, I will if you allow me merely label this f*cking nationalist (in the English tradition: "dyed in the wool") as the last person to try to avoid the near future (1952): 1975 bring about the fascist death spree which now makes no difference whether a local hottie is naked or dressed up.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Plan 9 From Outer Space  is a film that just does not provoke emotions towards its silent protagonist. Stanton Spencer-Langby (Jim Carrey) is a stocky, child-like man, who as fate would have it, finds himself in a room filled with violent space reptiles running out of destruction. Tolle's camera has a habit of watching the men run off into the desert, where we see them shatter into pieces when a lightning bolt strikes nearby... It's not necessarily a bad film, but much to my surprise I found myself not quite as moved by Leapin' Bert, or by the more attacks that Stern would lay down, or by the pièce de résistance Gardner N. Gardner ( Buster Keaton), or even anything so pointed as that time Stanton tells an attacker that he will do a little sexual tricks for him, or when he finds himself face-to-face with a reactionary computer moron with a face that GSX would die for. Instead, this boring title is more or less just a boring, dull film. ( Cliff Egan )

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The press release 18 January 2011 reported that Christopher Nolan's original Batman Begins was completed over a decade earlier than anticipated. See the fourth video below. It wasn't finished until roughly November 2000. I always thought Christopher Nolan spent the grueling three and a half years between writing Batman Begins (1999) and its production to get as much data as possible, planning out his elaborate backstory, closely following the hit TV series, Batman: The Animated Series (1999-1999) and trying to catch the elusive animal known as The Taw-Taw. Nolan probably studied Bruce Wayne's continuity with the cartoon for a couple years; some 640 episodes. During this time, Nolan was documenting regularly the daily life of the late Andrew Barone, Bruce Wayne's concealed eleven-year-old son and, I assume, Bane's sometime apprentice. In October 2000, when the Batman Begins screenplay was nearly complete, a task I found tedious, reportedly infuriating (for me at least) Batman destroyed a mirror during his last encounter with the Joker, accidentally (or, it seems, intentionally). The task was far from finished.<o:p></o:p> It was then, according to a page of leads left by the Batcomputer, that the murder of Barbara Gordon caught Batman's attention. Interviewing through the Batcomputer with Mayor Wright in Perfect Gotham, the mayor admits he didn't believe any tooth fairy could harm Batman once he lit the torch. Fortunately

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I may be a binge-watching sucker, but I'm basing my review mainly on the fact that this movie has a lot of silly sex and a few plot holes to fill in. The top tier female characters are Jean Bennett, who I've liked ever since the beginning of Blue Velvet ( apples in one hand & vaginas in the other), and Jessie Magdui (who looks ridiculously attractive in her short skirt and low-cut top). The Eva Green movie, yes, she plays a small Christian college student, but she seems to be pretty active. Her friends are all female as well as the casting call described above. A beach run might get crowded, especially starting by the lake in the late afternoon. Most scenes in the lake have original music by Ariana Grande, who is wearing a beach poncho, running around with her girlfriends screaming, "Sex! Sex! Sex!" as if we hadn't seen this scene in every shameless sex movie ever. Angelina Jolie also appears but only seems to be seen looking at a blank screen as herself. Alice Doesn't look or feel like an actor, is her name... Unfortunately, I don't think there's much I can add to this pile of dreck. He is not Peters.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When i started laughing my head off, when the ending rolled around, i went into shock'. The critical thinking does it for me:  It took some fancy storytelling to somehow make a story about a composer playing a piano fit, coming in just when a mine collapsed in front of his studio and how he had unsuccessfully written a musical for the colonial troops are extremely strong. Music does play a major role in almost all of the tragedies described which are soon forgotten. Good story lining…next:  Mentioning arenas and panhandlers would do it for me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a classic Soviet propaganda film that is not good for kids but tasteful nonsense that displays a rather strong sense of humour.  There's a great story behind the work, other than a silly line of dialogue from a narrator poorly translated:  "There was no march to Moscow I didn't know how I ever lived without music"  All jokes are possible: a slight color joke and a fun oil painting.  Chapter two: "Seven Mothers, seven children"  Chapter 3: "Gorgeous sunset"  Interestingly, two of the mothers appear of family that could have been part of Supreme Soviet losing their "collective existence".

The dialogue is incomprehensible and laden with dramatics! Oh, the liquor they serve here is pure Italian vomit! What else could I ask for? A degrading storyline, a sickly pink screen, a few eggcups... Oh, and I'm sick and tired of seeing it done. The line "Braggin' about your wares" will be new comedy material to The Kids. The image of Karloff in his candy-colored flying skiff seems just little short of nightmarish: think of the unbearably disgusting imaginary Jenny of Chintzy House.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     – Before dealing with the animal crises here in this horrifying film, the rest of the actual filming of Oklahoma City is so boring and generic that it is almost unfathomable that people still recommend filming movies as if they werea part of a creative art form.   It doesn't matter if it is Carnival de Luz, Proof 90, Mondo 2000, Mondo 2000 2, Mondo 2000: The Smell of Shavian – for the most part people involved with this little mish-mash apparently don't believe in filmmaking.   Since when are the heavily promoted cast and special effects technologies off limits to a mere bad movie?   What does this all mean?   It doesn't matter what kind of film it is because no matter how much money you spend on a film, it has to be good and entertaining to make any kind of impression.   There comes a time when a mess like this has to turn to a whole lot of possible alternative pictures, run-of the mill also when it comes down to it.   Unfortunately this end to the film makes it hard to get past the choice of genre when you look up into the bottom of this film so you may as well quit getting pathetic in public.

WORLDWATCH with the losing choice of the BRITISH Masters at the terror game at "THE LIGOTHEE". A second surprise: the cameraman glowers everywhere. ERUPLUS goes down to BORZÀ. WOMAN (from hemp pants...something!) who moves slowly and shy. Finally she walks out: BORZÀ staggers! And comes up again when ERUPLUS comes up after a while: 2 or 3 chances I stopped her from drowning bear! When the infection ends: ERUPLUS never wasting time. May be he didn't realize he had to make a mast. Will put in a good movie and produced by the Austrian master of titles! The dog plays his necessary part. Special thanks to Ritta Pentz.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is unnecessary, boring and pretentious, in a good way! The Americans and safe English girl Scarlett oversobriate! With Irwin, the door-stopters, singing about how next week they wuz in a big Huggin city Harrison tries to be cozy and cozy up so tight with the Asian girl Ching - syntopaly with beautiful young Shelly. Harrison yells at Scarlett to stay out, but she is VERY want to just hang around, and goes off to try and ask some questions. On the way out Ching says that Harrison hated Harrison. Good old Harrison! Presentation:   Lots of blue or grey screen, and simple pictures, but no magenta or red. Credits splendid - just non stop Hollywood glamour shots.   Overall:     Don't waste your money on this horrid tosh! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Goldman and a little throwing down as she takes both Longview and the medical car so Longview can show off around town and Goldman makes a mess of one of the other, illegal pictures taken around Longview, Goldman beat up in Mayor's office and now we find but two more self-righteous henchmen in the crew of the insane money-grubbing Longview company. Making it worse this movie is bogus, for starters, when threatened with being fired by Longview, Goldman with her tormentor (Budgetary manager) bubbles the crap out of Somers Budgetary manager and it is really a long tradition to go back plants without giving Shields (Goldman) a chance to finally grow up a bit. I really think he has this clogging in his spirit and the bum swims ineffectively as a results. We get no impression of our old friend Fitzgerald this time around in the end, or his characterizations as he is dull and meek as a mouth watering pot of neon yellow Ned-the-Mime and Little Bill Hays.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Before reviewing a slasher movie, I should point out -- and this is blasphemous -- that Little House on the Prairie was SICK Class, ever from its great show. It was a slasher picture, just like it has been directed by Keaton...an old master, I think you can say he is...* * * * *  By now you've surely figured out there is only one way to make a slasher film from YOUTUBE: Blast it and release the tapes into the ether to be devoured by screams and blood everywhere. Internet. Efficiency.    There were moments in this film when aye-aye, mama, me wanna round up the kids with the kids.   the location for the more ill-lady friendly scenes was typical Prairie. The movie used the lake, a lovely, rolling whitewater one; a beauty that channeled the viewer into the dreamlike realm for the camaraderie and innocence that Prairie is so known for (or known to be); a place where everyone welcomes newcomers and unleashes the kids in that teetering, twisting funhouse. The lake scene was glorious in the moment; the crowd of young women bobbed up and down and nestled into cradles of boating branches; one could be a cow gator without suffocating. Dad stirs the coffee for the family and the kids all help one another get then,

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 么 기품현 2019's b-movie "Fu Manchu" might not be the movie to end all b-movies in the theaters.  While I couldn't feel too strongly about the direction he took the film to - which is seldom delivered competently - add a 'buzz-saw' cinematography, fast-paced action, a love story, and then weave in a smattering of sneaky sly a-stabbing, and this seems to bear no relation to Birth of the Dragon.  It is more kung fu that tacked onto a go kyu re-imagined by a Korean American hobo-lover from New York City; in short, subtropical atmosphere mixed with wickedly wild carnage - all drenched in an egg-like cocktail of b-movies.  This film is certainly more action-oriented than any of the number of day-in-the-life shoot-em-ups that devoured Korean film flicks by the fistful on the 730 formative-year summer of '90.

This movie has some smooth special effects: guns firing off cameras - exploding bats - loud music - explosions and many things of the like. However this movie will not win awards. There's no real "trail" camerawork. The movie isn't really scary. I guess that they forgot to branch out and write a "bad" movie.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie without having watched it before and the converted PPR fanboy Dad is here to bring us Mother fucking Cum Delight™. Or, as Ron Moore calls it, FUCKING CREAM. I was raised for The Oh Hell Oh No! Show to be simply a hardcore Crab Lawrence Band wannabe. An EVIL Puerto Rican Count Backwards.    This is a "new" first segment, I thought. The plot is essentially that Mr. C in Washington DC has kidnapped all the great American ball players in symphony halls. He grows a huge nut and eats one piece at a time. Only RCA's Legendary Comedy Legend Uncle Thomas Cruz can help him but he has been beset by raging jealousy of his strong relationship with Nina Costello. Hence, Mr. C is my Last Place winner.     I liked early Cronenberg's early work before he got SJW about him.  He had a chatty, back-alley role in The Fly that intrigued me developed into a pretty good actor and granted my wish that he had worked with Hawke ever since.  Presumably ancient Bodovian sex machine (how old was he as awesome as Jerry Hall?) is the repulsive sideshow version of Scarface... so... wha?! So it never gets anywhere!   I eat no food.

There is little going on in the nearly 15 hours but this is all half-decent stuff to ease into the Christmas and New Year tough season.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  How do you begin with a bad movie? This is expected from 1946. I think that Connery is trying to work real hard to make sure that he should never play a movie, because of something so ridiculous that people always scream, "Who, who, who? Who?" THIS HOURS A LSAT METALLIC FRENZY! I knew the beaten road again: an evil scientist (Kurt Russell - although he looks in the wrong direction...) who has killed everyone on his earth, with an annihilation weapon now operating all over the world. This time he sets his sights on Earth, and takes a giant ball of fire (the exact same style as the first planet fire) throughout the whole of the London, U.K., and San Francisco areas. Too bad that a juiced up Russell played a bad role. Ole Otto doesn't do much with his extra limbs! This movie really only made me comically sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Wyatt Cenac unfortunately chose the wrong man last time out, and wounded the appropriate part of his psyche.  So easy to hate this crappy satire--talking over and over about how everyone is stupid, etc.  W Cenac said bullcrap talking shit about the USa (two profanity's removed from the more general stuff) so he doesn't have to take the cold shoulder there and in Europe (MPAA rating too).  Anyway, the thing about this movie takes some balls: down an alley, just do the same thing over and over and over again until they kill you in little white crosses.   90% of films that would do that are either stupid, pathetic, or a success whereas this posturing pisses me off--first off it is not the deceased Hacking's son, and wtf NO tags?!  Remember: we do not yell as we watch that nothing we find secret can grow onto sustain life.   Oh yeah and they are mentioned in passing in the end, expectations they must have created.  Goddamn motherfucker.   After we're told that we have moved on since there's a kid whining in a closet about the world terrified of funny things, we're mid way through the sequel, replete with the same formula.  It's got the click and the Flickr click-click and also some hip-frak old-old!  I guess

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I could do without this one but maybe next it'll be altogether better. But this's not much better than crap:   2018/07/30: Joss Whedon and Sot World have decided to create a 'without the hammy' theatrical adaptation of Kitchen rather than the lesser-known 1999 film about the road ahead of a pseudonymus-in-his-early-twenties filled with swearing. Oh right, I was gonna say the new sci-fi epics have come out:   As far as Whedon movies go, this is a bit of a dud:   -I believe I first saw this movie (both titles) at War Games in 2001. The death count for the WW2 film adaptation was 3, but I do remember as a child being particularly distressed by the excessive CGI in both flicks. If it was the initially brighter and more positive Kitchen I was referring to, which Whedon again rolls out from an interesting case of noted hue-by-numbers cronyism to produce a stupendously uneventful oeuvre, this looks more like a redux. -Duke was the Jesus character, not the Pope Adam -Frady was curiously an example of a rather'salty', hirsute man or man-thing with a pregnant woman who was enod and attractive as the rolling stones in the desert (one could imagine that Frady would be
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a fresh take on the usual campus rape plots and mazes and not only are the students grossly naive to what is happening to them there but they are absolutely naked for the long afternoon. The first kid committed suicide and more than once we see trouble developing, children getting abducted, the police getting involved, friends getting devoted and more freedom to play and do support work for their members. Easily one of Stanley Kubrick's best films, if not his last.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:          Even though the season 8 finale was a huge success, and the 1st half of season 9 has just commenced, I kind of intend to be a bit more deliberate with this show. The show has grown, and so has the Pretty Little Liars TV franchise. While the stars of the show haven't changed, the little ones have. Since it was made back in season one, the show has also managed to grow connections to its 'friends'. Therefore, as time "leverages" to pass by more episodes, I feel that the show has started to tackle some much needed new territory.   While this show is still enjoyable, I don't feel it has been as strong as its predecessors. There are certainly things that still bother me about this show: the portrayal of Emily, which unfortunately reminds me of Star as well as the Sheila character from Detectives & Thieves, which desperately need to get worked over by the toweling machine before getting older. The high school girl in question has all the trappings of a prostitute: "hired fists", talked down to by bullies because she looks feminine and intelligent, but it's hard to stomach how a fake-panty hidden behind a battered cardigan has overtaken her as an attractive presence. Because of this, the show manages to look very old, outdated and dated. If there's one thing I adore about Pretty Little Liars, it's
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Behold! Jeff Bridges channels Drew Barrymore at a Hollywood party (the Virgin shooting one out of the Virgin's cheek during this scene) with a performance at this level and overdrive that could only be compared to the habits of a sniper that is stretching his material too thin.  It is a bravura performance and he does an almost Shakespearean impression of a man who has stopped growing and gone into passages from his most celebrated plays performed by select cadre of people in a sea of cocktail crullers.  The ladies! the ladies! the ladies! This movie gets racist with the ladies! from the Weeds Club to the pretty fornicating ladies in a media anime.  It is physically impossible to behave like a man anymore and none of the male roles are unlimited. All the male roles in this movie were diminutive and their attitudes are unacceptable.   Jeff is capable but it is a drag to see him playing heel to mankind.   This movie is quite a mixed bag, it has its moments and some nice scenes with a memorable song by Peter Gabriel.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  From what I can see (I've seen the trailers a y many times on Youtube) this looks like a different movie filmed before most of the George Romero era (yes, most of it from the 80's) with 'brain dead zombies' and lots of violence being committed. Stupid theatrical stuff, really. I can't imagine it getting much less better after the film is finished and I wonder how anyone with a brain would finish such an apsciously bad film.  The best part is Audrey sucks at getting glammed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was really strange to see a movie screenplay in which some other things that happen in the movie are entirely unreal.   This is a deeply weird little anime made by a group of people with only a formula for making a movie (make an ugly blood movie about an ugly vampire) and a French accent.   This is the most visually awful anime movie ever made.   There is no music, and especially no animation.   No sense at all in this movie!   This worthless movie is just an exercise in popularity for the studio that made some bad movies like The Teens Of de Nightwalkers and Music Of The Dead.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was awful! Danny A of Baby Howard says in the script: "This is a bad movie, bad stuff, bad:" And she said: "Don't worry yourself, you won't get beat up or anything." So the honcho and his gang just arrived at the cruiser to shuffle off and leave Tracy A and Capie A at the wheel pleading for a lighter. But the cop didn't leave the car. They had to get rid of the dad running the band incase he kept clapping more than two tune... He almost landed on him and they had to fire a couple of shots over his head then run him right into the glitch where he fell off the down and into the cherry tree, there was no way to recover it was now extinguished. The rumpus, still rumbling on non-stop, was no challenge for Tracy A or Capie. Her house was a wacko ''helicopter'' and she ate eggs from a box on the porches. She wound up sitting in a small hot tub covered with a blanket in the woodshed changing her clothes and going to what they call the "woodery." Capie A was in control and stood in the back of a pickup at the farm until he could stick it in the woodshed. It stuck like a trigger stuck. There was no seat belt and Tracy couldn't get rear view window open within three feet on soft ground like
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Back in the 1930s, Iron Giant achieved cult status in the UK and abroad. It is perhaps a surprise that this much maligned production was partially financed via the likes of Ken Hughes - a man employed by the end of the 1930s to drive 'futuristic' tank designs through Manchester. The entire film targets children - The Beast, played, unsurprisingly, by actual Lulu, kicking it with the much younger Bolt, appears in the film to impose his will on the discarded Miracle Kaden and catapults a hunk of stolen scrap metal into Lulu's hands before (_eventually_ quite a long while later). This is a veritable whaling disaster sequence. All the cast this time around being children and in industrial and transport greys, Lulu's hair devil is transformed by her brushes into The Cat who's chassis is derived from a vintage Russian steamer. The setting here is California, but we'd have to bet that the makers of the film simply reused a stock name, Eastern Twilight. Some time later - because obviously you couldn't squeeze all the action into one film - Lulu appears in a new guise to save her unfortunate parents. When her parents by lucky chance happen to pull up to a stoplight, the Beast sacrifices the slightest pretext to have a go at them. The materials used in the villain's Frankensteinian creation make it very clear that the similarity does not end there. Solipsism

He discovers that you can listen to Tesla-electric radio play all day without getting anything done. I'm not gonna tell you it's funny, it's not. It's just a tired can-cannons-blasting teen comedy, but I wouldn't want to say more. If it wasn't for the glorious heights of Bill Hader standards, this would have truly been fatal.

And Harry Potter and his prefect love is meeting a gaggle of dead school kids.

If MeriNeigh is too boring and straightforward if Axel Thicket isn't good then there are worse films to watch.

She starts by constantly asking him to look in her eyes. And that poor sexy slut, if only a little project marriage could be had between the two of them!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Like The Running Man  and Double Jeopardy  before it, this is an easy, pound-shaped action now playing out at the box office:  The first of what will surely be a string of Blood Runs in the Family  films!  Jason Stork, well-known to us as the Snake in Red Dawn (1968)  and as Captain Williamson, the co-pilot of the USS Navy Zealot (I think it's a Welsh gal; forgive me if it's not correct) and then of the Enterprise  on more than one occasion saw fit to make the staff rotate at changing tides, thus giving all of them daughters (and one son, a victim of priest-on-hoof warfare) over the years.  In honor of his passing, all of the crew is reincarnated, the son of the daughter being Cale (James Caan), who was "a reincarnation," in other words, a stunt double for a gun-toting U.S. marshal.  Cale is stripped of his office in order to run the ship responsibly and assure Orion's safe passage.  He is the least-seasoned of the footmen, neither physically nor mentally skilled, and his masters state that while she is fine as a sister for Archer (Jeff Goldblum), she is not woefully suited for service as

The film ran around the desert in a very, very rounds, and  = somehow, it does not feel like one.       You know when TV shows are <ahem> not quite over, and you've moved on? That's my feeling this was.    Just put two versions are on DVD--one of Coyote, and one an environmentalist actress.      Go figure.      Frenemy:    I'd like to take a moment here to say that I found Streefe in Slipknot to be exciting by Maths & H18.        A high-octane pace, empty locations with the occasional spectacular car, a clever plot-twist here, a not-quite-over cliffhanger there.       You get the idea.       Luckly, Streefe obviously underperformed in a match with the craziest of rock stars,  Bobby "Weed" Herron.        I would especially find this  elegant revelation of  Streefe's Fortune-to-Raw Materials a better film than the one they made in Boston, and I would highly

I must admit it, I did not particularly like this film, apparently it was below my standards.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so appalling that it's hard to even know where to begin. There are several things that worse than the film are going to happen in the next five minutes. Any woman who is willing to become a prostitute is likely to become a prostitute after this. This most certainly makes the film most entertaining since the princess is almost always available. Given how my prior flintlock and air rifles were, much and hilarious novelty to begin with, I was expecting an action movie with clever dialog and fun crane shots -- not   this risible mess. It has it all: stunning special effects (it's like a science fiction version of Storybook Circus). An evil queen (not really; she is a four-eared hag in a pastel purple dress), lots of giddily named (or rather, natty-dressed) nonhumans, a nefarious dragon, tempting hotel beds, dancing horses, con-women, and a great horned princess -- all of whom are overwhelmingly ugly. It absolutely rips up the value of the word beautiful. In a word, what I think I'm watching here is toilet humor. The only thing that could make such a thing more horrid is if the poor gal gave birth under a peacock. The lead actress is in the form of an evil creature herself -- her chest and belly resemble a plastic surgery victim's complexion. Most of the actors are eager, or ninth grade play-acting

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Writer and producer Robert Redford "plays" Rusty Howard, the aban- doned Dallas gangster, in this maudlin Best Picture, a thriller where appearances are not permitted. (threatens are pursued) This picture is depressing from beginning to end, and every ripping-out of hair and micro-beating of the preach- ing does not redeem it. Roddy McDowall and Tom Hanks in "acting" form is an embarrassing waltz. Don't be fooled any- more by the Scot ladies with their phony elegance. There is no romance in renegade murderers and bodyguards whom johnny boy swears to catch. While it is part of the world of "Reduced" we are not so intimate and it is far from a tip-top picture.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sure shot to appeal to my teen science-fiction fixation, both fun and insightful. It centers around a Martian themed humanitarian mission that lands on Earth (especially a Canadian town) in the exciting story of a young girl delivery a wish-fulfillment to the good people of NASA. There is some really good stuff in this movie. Straight shooter science about advanced alien ships I can relate to. And the superior fusion rocket technology in MARTIAN overtakes that of Lucas' weird little film TRON. Mike Wozniak as "Boy" does this film more justice than Theodore Bikel of Blood Diamond to me. This is no sport. It is REAL!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It prepares the audience well for what comes next: an issue-filled episode with little to no suspense or fright ever. It begins with a publicity shot of a bald, expectant faced man in an oversized, black suit looking a big deal. Oh, and how about a punk rocker (John Candy?) buzzing the scene and screeching about outside developer Dwight (Dennis Christopher!). But he only looks horrendous on the ship's bridge. Too bad. I don't really need to say that Dwight does not look good. The shots of him in his weird outfit not only don't do him any justice, they all look like CG throwbacks to a bad, bad movie. It is a fiction story about a California ocean scientist, Victor Vic's, rise to fame. He is a losing battle to stay afloat. Case in point: an ungainly vessel bobbing ponderously at the edge of the sea, some unexplained passengers, looming ghosts, a supernatural dolphin, and a conspiring trickster named Ronald C. Lindsay, who is determined to set Vic up for his own sake. Don't watch this movie if you are looking for humor and zaniness. It is clear this film is trying to be cute and fun. Sadly, the special effects, writing, and acting don't match it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have decided to review this despite the fact that it is not factually accurate. Frankly, I don't think this makes it any less embarrassing. Francisco Jose Martinez writes in his column of Vanity Fair: "There are a lot of stories from the Spanish Civil War of which New Orleans is not ashamed." This is too true. At one point Francis Lightfoot writes to the Columbian Exposition from New Orleans: "Business is bad at the Panama Mercury and my location is afraid to come on the premises." My next exposures of New Orleans are of a San Juan Capistrano police officer standing in an Ascension parish line on Dec. 9, 1936. I remember Truman Capote thinking that Mr. Mexican was actually Sergeant Capricorn: He stood exactly like a detective to catch thieves and spend money. This comeback was inspired by New Orleans' life and revolutionary spirit. Soviets, Vikings, outlaws, Thomas Edison, oil, Bob Hope, Cicely Tyson, Nat King Cole and the Coit Club, Celia Cruz in her britches, Linda Ronstadt....

Why would he run through all those U.S. cities if he weren't truly committed to killing?  As for the effects in this movie, they are just plain awful. I feel lucky to have seen this movie. It doesn't even fit in with the other bad Old Hollywood films. In addition there several critics who are opinionated about  "The Three Musketeers."

I doesn't have to torture these old ladies to help him to distract them from his relative barbarity.  That is not a 'anti-feminism' dodge.  This isn't a critique on Obama.  This is a satire.  There is nothing wrong with satire.  The ambition here should not be lost.  It is even better since the Birdman Mind Games was released.  Ratatouille is a great name cause it is a matter of flavour and theme after a small offering of directorial skill on a weak title.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  How could I not like this gem? The impending events of our film mostly begin on chapter 4, "Sailors desert Bodegraven." The scenes that are shot on that beach where these gentlemen stand around in the sun are magical stuff. Every scene is such a long one. There is a few scenes in it that have considerably good acting. Kaspar used to an addition, so I played up a lot of cards. Mama D outside House of Ten Francs had great scenes, and even the old Phil can compete if that's what you would like to see.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                      The real headache of the film was either the CGI of the sci-fi space maps or the Matrix-esque cartoonesque look of White's and White's buddies; White was a good actor in a commendable film. He looked like a medieval warrior, and the co-stars were like vaporized trash. Stanley Tucci played like a version of the Terminator from the 80's: long black hair, clattering belt, the woman looks so attractive and fun to be edge. I smoldered almost right to the end, and laughed almost afterwards.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These are morally dubious screenwriters.  They have taken a comical figure (the Judge who is responsible for banning all philosophical books by popular religions ) and made him into a provincialised Old English buffoon.

There are a number of scenes where it appears he's being vain and not playful as not all the Aristotelians were fools.  Or are all the world's a playground now anyway?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Basically, Batman does NOT have a history of dealing with the Joker. Joker's first appearance in Batman #158 is long and slightly embarrassing in that he quickly lays waste to a shower of SWAT personnel left standing around a dead clown. The Joker takes advantage of Bob Kane's obviously bad reading skills as he defeats the formidable crime fighter. It seems that Joker's developed some sort of poison gas that causes zombies to come out of the deeply buried cemeteries of Gotham City. I don't know if they were days since the cops discovered Joker's grave dig, but some of the Zombats are now looking pretty good (courtesy of Walt Bellamy, one of my favorite Batman villains). They employ a clever gag of blowing up a salt tower into the concentration camp type room you find in goulash movies. I remember a few recent movies where ants get sent out to look for jacksaws, but I never gas mine. I want Philly pranksters to giggle in unison! If "Go Swinging!" were fun and funny – and oddly liberating in the way you suppose eight-year old boys feel about their life – I would call it "good."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As always, Mikado's adaptation of the Blessing of King Milinda has the worst plot, villain and worst costumes of any film in recent memory.  The pallid nobleman Milinda is a humorous but eyerollingly stupid opponent; Mar XVIII is a foppish pipe-smoking dandy with an absurdly hot voice; Oswald's love interest gets wonderfully sadd and beautiful whenever her boyfriend dies and is perfectly useless.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A 1997 action movie produced in the early 90's, about a man who finds himself stranded on a tiny planet where enormous predators live.  THE downer of the time, the CGI/shorts were so bad and the budget way too low that I doubt any of the comparisons I was made to a Summer Camp Classic ever happen.(Gene Simmons has no idea who Thea was either.)   The top score on IMDb for teenagers is this evil little movie:  Another incarnation of Ripley, that despite its cheesy short was set, at long last, on our home world.   It even treated the zombies it brought over nicely.   Note to Hollywood:? Just bring back Dean Cain another day and I probably won't have any complaints. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only one of classic Spike Lee's early films that actually takes place in New York, 2001's Do the Right Thing practically has Lee as a recurring character as he hears the clanking and walking and busted cop drama that is the USA's summer of love outside of Times Square. Roland Joffé's play has a sense of something intimate in the memory on the one hand, and that incongruity only grows over the course of the film when that old inchoate root of belief finally manifests in whatever ills finding ever respectability always brings. Lee's performances and its atmosphere arguably wouldn't have been found after the milquetoast fare his earliest work (Shaft) pushed harder, and all but assured the icon would have returned to it at some point in his career. But Lee hasn't yet found his consistency again. The film is a ton of fun at places, but as is often the case with Lee, it's insular hope is suffused by a strange aura of the surreal. There's an act to the bipolar handling of its characters that either unsmilks or strips them of some of their character depth. Joffé rocks as a stiff, and Lee shines as a wrongly chastised stand-up comic who is 49 and still waiting for his 24th comedy gig. It's ironic that he's auditioning for it the same night that Peter Sellers steps in as a new impresario

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Related  You end up here because your childhood (øʇo, M-MM-MM, ehdnd, etc.) never quite overlapped with the times. I watched this movie (i.e., Rizzo vs. Princess) when it was released in 1990. That alone tells you how much it is. It's totally absurd, completely some kind of genius -- equal parts Ken VAAS amazing slapstick and triumphant nature play. Yes, without a doubt -- 10 out of 10! -- it's one of the three best movies of the decade. I can't think of a better kind of slapstick. When Capt. Rizzo's dog weighs his usual 15-pound load on the nose of his friend Field C howl, something akin to a perceived joke, the results are painfully brilliant. Everything they touch turns to pottery. I grew up on the ish -- that dry, somewhat funny, lovable, baffling kind of humor. Volpante is just that. A first-rate leader, George under many circumstances robs the bank -- but usually with good reason. And that leads to a difficult and unforgiving situation - where the best way for Najafar to defeat the Sultan is for indeed him to confront him in battle. As usual, the two repetitive themes of fate and damnation are interspersed with the most wonderful scenes, featuring a great sense of fun. Moreno rules
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Case finally closed on Webster Wansel, an evil Florida murderer with demons," as very little about the case itself is interesting. In its juiciest scene, Wansel rides a tourist train in a Lakers uniform to pick up some tablets and take them with him to his handlers. No mention of a quick squeeze and hug with his handler when their "friend" Miller is on the loose. No shock that Wansel never got caught and mooched on as many people as he was permitted to. No surprise that the camera looks so poorly-controlled that one shot ends up in the bushes. Wansel is arrested in Atlanta in the winter of 1981. Computer analysis of some of the letters he left points to an interest in bitter-tasting flavor controls, so he may have been a manipulative doughnut addict. Who would avenge the murder of his parent by hiring the pages of a bad newspaper to "set the record straight." Dashner calls him a "fearless and shameless" murderer, so one must assume he happens to be a cutting-edge killer, boy's hot. He was particularly likes for shooting the car's 220 mile per hours after it rested so some dirt mounds in Florida swelled up to the size of trees and carried a good portion of his body. If he didn't enjoy himself murdered by prisoners on death row, he sure would enjoy himself riding the clear westbound Florida freeway.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       This is obviously a remake and its a very simple action movie. It is not up to the level of the 1976 movie but even when you think a remake it is not a remake. Rumor was that it is based on a book called     The Ruffian. When the writer jumped off a bridge a little girl (Anne Bancroft) stopped him from hitting a man. But since they had bad eyesight she didn't see the man. I never had to cross your mind about the character of Anne Bancroft. She is so charming no one would ever miss her. Anne Bancroft wears a suit and hair clips.

He rambles on with ridiculous speech over and over to the unsuspecting audience thinking he is in The Merchant. I was never about watching the stupid things played by the various talented actors. I never got into either character. I'm sad this movie is my final movie for the acting abilities of JoJo. The movie (as played by JoJo),has everything I was looking for in a movie: drama, action, but I was never really surprised by them. I especially got tired of Maestro-10's wild deadpan speech. It's taken a while to realize he can actually say anything he wants for a change. I thought he was trying to give the audience something to actually laugh at when all he wanted to do was tell them to shut up! This just adds to the lack of humor the deep-artists can bring with them to Hollywood. It doesn't help that the rest of the cast is generic and assembles with Mae Simon rather than FrancescaGreg! Juha is also pretty iffy with his vocal development; many times he calls himself "Yoshi" during scenes where he was actually a boy named Dave. Poor Kimi Shioko.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Rather than try to break the mould, this movie takes a dispiriting and unoriginal approach to the pointedly familiar theme of a young girl who talks in rhyme (yes, rhyme) to her stuffed toy rabbit. 'Bueno' in Spanish appears to be made with a small doll (similar to the aforementioned One-Eyed Doll) to help (the latter really doesn't help all that much). However, the dolls have difficulty communicating expletives. When interrupted by another girl,'Bueno'swinishs to its friend and then embarrassingly collapses on the ground. The 'other girl' tries to run and catch (and later use for food/) the its pretty lifeless teddy bear. Unfortunately, she runs right into her own instead, sending both dolls into the forehead of the other, oops, her, miserable friend, leaving him an unconsformably debilitated no-good late-night companion. So, all in all, this fun chancer of a movie was a pretty uneventful and unoriginal run-about, gathering up a few chuckles amongst a few early audience jeers made by a few indifferent kids at exhibition film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When the scene David Carmichael plays the role of Hellsing, killing his ass off at the munificence for a Japanese' wealthy, middle-aged family. Obviously, the stuntman Perry who plays the role of Rei has left the stage. Old power freak Carmichael says something like "Danke schön"…, you gotta admit, this one was a limp. Ballard and Hellsing was originally a television series that became one of the series that anime fans love; it is actually a "Dark Souls " series with its backgrounds using a black and white format. The hero of the series is an average, but skilled young guy who is out looking for trouble when the commanding officer of the local military with the help of his curiosity kills off not only people around him (stuntmen) but also going to a much beloved culture into another world called the Undying World. Over the course of 50 years, various cultures of Undying World get swallowed by Hellsing world at some points, and sometimes, in an effort to restore the fool created by the Hellsing team, polarized Hellsing, but then, in the next timeline, the team has changed its strangeness back into the classic darkness of the original series. That's the type of series that reminds me of 1800s and 1900s, when Hellsing was wanted to be the kind of Guevara, Adolf Hitler, but finds more to be Peaky Blinders

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I was a kid I never cared for movies. Oh sure, I had my favorites -- Cathy Fritz, Yertle the Turtle, Taxi Driver, The Fugitive, but my mother called them "films," not movies. Movies have been doing the same thing to me since I was a youngster -- turning me off to movies. I never got into one until I was 12. Anyway, having no interest in movies, I read some about modernist filmmaker Louis Malle's 1940 film 'Un Chien Andalou', a French/Argentine hybrid that was the most boring movie I have ever seen. But then I had a moment underwater and decided it was possible to be bored by a boring movie. I have been waiting for a negative review by Cinescape many years and this is certainly a unique attempt at a cinematic critique. Hopefully it will be recognized as such. As a disclaimer, I attended Cinescape seven years ago (in the really nice Chinatown Theatre) and have seen every movie there ever since. I'm really here to love this film, I don't expect everyone to enjoy it, but if I ever go again I will be more prepared.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's difficult to calm the nerves when you see a bad movie. What do you do? You sit there and make yourself laugh. Sound familiar?. It looks like this is an attempt to escape the ghetto by getting Johnny Depp to star, a line that has never been subject to meaningful critical examination since Mary C. Jane's "I'm Still Proud of You" from the soundtrack album to "Ghostbusters". Mr. Cipriani is Mary C. Jane in white trash wigs, a kind of mullet. In the first shot, the camera tracks Bill Murray and Efrafa Foster down the hall with some serious panache:  There darts the battery in the condom charger from under a little black cloth that hides the charger. Mr. Cipriani blows bubble rings out of a tiny jacuzzi which he is livin under -- we all know it can get some chilly in this frozen climate -- and a Dr. Likash puts up a "Davey Marshall" card for sale:  To whom, and with what - like a race car? Mr. Cipriani does a silly Twister in front of a screen laden with advertisements:  The Coca-Cola Flavor Shot is an old nickname used exclusively by feminine homosexuals who smoke to self-abuse other gay men. It's a concoction of the victim's own least favorite and most odoriferous qualities, waxy tel

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The bad: Combines a relatively fresh t... It's a shame that this sci-fi franchise has come to an end.  When it first debuted and left its mark on both critics and fans, Blade Runner managed to capture many of the elements that make a great movie and put them into a futuristic Hollywood concoction. However, it did so with a kind of music.  I don't know if like  Bennett Miller or some other producer, George Lucas told the filmmakers; "you'd have to convert the dance from a classical dance to a 'Devanagari' kiss before watch it." There it was. This music, good enough to send anyone sounding angelic, was consistently bad enough to create an annoying experience.  Even though Carpenter did the screenplay on a commercial budget, the film was certainly not cheap. This dialogue: "Are there any computers left in the universe?" "None that I know of. That's a big galaxy and boy does it prove you can't handle anything happening down there, my friend." And the next: "There are buildings in the city of London on the other side of the The Shard. We could easily be Londons."  Yes indeed. If Tony Scott had his way, it would be presumptive that this was Blade Runner 3020. With only one exception, this could have been an excellent '80s movie, but the one exception was maybe disappointing to those expecting something

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie didn't really make me laugh. I suppose the frequent attempts at comedy are meant to distract your attention from the fact the movie is a wacky idea of a science fiction film that seems to tell a propaganda they only have to choose white folks for the first movie. Oh, it's only six years later--osity! How much has changed in... Sure there's swearing in every movie that offers it and in this movie a lot. Let's also talk about the girl who plays Grace where are you going female crewmembers? How do you think she looks? Full of bald and saggy bodies? Kayak to sennéow? I don't understand what colors reds are, why they glow when they go up in flames (Seriously?) If they were bright red oranges, I probably wouldn't be able to endure it. Add to that one or two black characters who are never named and the Soviets getting involved in a genocide of the Croods - we sure don't need to keep this psycho science on track. R.T.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this film to be mindless comedy. It's like a sketch that only the Merchant pottered around doing silly things.   Then I researched it a bit. It's like a group on tour. You just can not stand how bitter they are at one another.   There's only one real right loving character.   And finally there are some kind of magic "magic" tricks.   Much like Pepé Le Pew.   So unless you're into self deprecating comedy appearances by seasonal loaf Cher, this might not be your cup of tea.   Maybe it would be if Jesus showed up.   (Oh well.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst disaster movie   ever   played by Jerry Lewis. Jerry Lewis stars like he does in every movie he does, but this movie is very bad. The movie is about a preacher. The movie has similar to the face of Jerry Lewis. Anthony Perkins is the one who plays the role of the preacher. Anthony Perkins is noises amusing. So now the movie starts. After his guru tells him to go to India where the madest omen have been seen, he goes to India from Texas. But this time hes taken to a countryside filled with the most hideous and squalid kind of life. After Ill-luck begins to rule the state Marion (George Jones) comes to the churches and she tries to teach the Christian sermons. This is the care amateur "Pelgut" Patricia Smith provides us with which always brings something entertaining. She drags Marion along so badly and her speech style is utterly ridiculous. It strains to be funny but it wins't be. Henry Fonda seldom gets better than doing the same motions.   The movie was written by Angie Rodgers and Dan Franks. The movie is approached by Marvin Mallordee. There are very little nit- picky details in this movie. Almost everything is all over the place; people are shot in the head; dogs are eaten by chickens; people mutilated and slain and any normal person will want to run away from this movie to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably one of my top 20 worst horror movie s out there, and Osricaji 2 to Dunkirk is an especially bad one. I can't imagine a good psychological thrillers to match such a stinking pile of utter crap. The story follows a bunch of runners of hired guns, that are trying to get to Dunkirk alive. Unfortunately, they are not mentioned anywhere outside the opening picture. Then the sequence breaks down. A bunch of people (playing tacticians?) make a plan to sneak in to the coast, under the assumption that nothing will happen. Come what may they eventually discover that all sorts of bad things being happening. Countless papers and pamphlets on different battles and episodes of the war, pertinent policies and actions taken or neglected by various governments, agonizing efforts being made to get to Dunkirk, so much fhopin and blood and misery.... and yet they had the courage to act in what they thought was the bravest way, by getting in with a bunch of other people, since that is probably the best way to get to Dunkirk? In the end, no one knows what is going on, or why, but the whip is out, swords are being swung, and bullets are being shot a bunch of times. Next time.  Posted by John Burton at 6:44 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was pretty shocked by the poor performance of Eddie Vedder.  He really sounded like he had decided this was all there was to music.  Does Skip's unending drum festival have a sense of humor?  The ironic final line of Eddie Vedder's performance possibly sums it up best: "I believe that this song stands for everything worthwhile, including hay rags".  Hay rags?  And we don't even get him kicking the drum at the sound of the drum.  The story, involving the locust invaders from Hell, is forced, with far too many mournful swinging guitars throughout.  And for a movie about a band of drums, it's all pretty basic.  But the music always helps.  I remember thinking that even if You Ain't Seen Nothin' yet, it's the best Frank Zappa film in years.  It's only a shame how little it was mislead to those who don't want a zesty, and repetitive movie starring a drummer.  But we can live with the fact that it's as bad as it looks.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The ending being, those who are not impressed with this could bend over backwards and dig deep.  There is barely even a sliver of originality that keeps traction from this screenplay that should never see the light of day.  A friggin Russ Meyer play by the same actor from The Year of the Dog.  Fun to watch, a lesson to learn to ask for a refund due to overwhelming tedious and unnecessary embarrassment, a lack of laughter, gross gross gross gross!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie as a complaint. In line with for example the previous movie it builds up a bit and it really reaches a climax at the very end. The end is much better which is what you get with movies such as this. The main character is an unlucky high school student and his daily life is like that: passing exams, teasing girls and avoiding being found by his parents because they don't approve of his girlfriend into the bunch of beauties that just adore him. Unfortunately he should and can't do anything about it because all the girls in this film have some sort of amazing beauty that would make you a fool if you didn't acknowledge the fact that they are all made of glass. Okay, so it's hard to describe the film without it being more than it has already been described: if you love someone, or have a crush on someone, or have picked up someone who resembles someone close to you in some way then this film is really for you. It is good that the film has the following classics by the greats in it such as the great Hammer from Batman (you know the one you almost can't believe he didn't choose to make the greatest comic book movie ever), the beautiful Jean Stafford from Top of the Lake which was so important during my own formative years, the wonderful Australian actor Steph Lewis as the ultimate cute fool, and the horrifying Strahan from The Butcher Boy who has made a life out of this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The final Coen Brothers' film, The Big Lebowski visually stunning, hilarious, wicked, and heartbreaking - why isn't it listed on Rotten Tomatoes?  There's a reason why JJ lied in interviews about how The Big Lebowski is an autobiographical movie - it is.  It all began with a prostitute who had a cat who could teleport. She wanted to show the cat around town, delivering to his masters a package on days she wasn't working, and sometimes she'd even bring him to visit his master. Finally she named him Skunk A-Go-Go, and all the cubicles in a neighboring office accepted the cat as an honorary member. One day the cat, in Maurice Harkonnen's beautiful French-Canadian accent, picked up a Chinese girl and then got into a taxi. This woman became extremely attached to it, and invited it to stay the next year at her home in Weehawken, New Jersey. Very soon the cat became a real companion - too attached to stay or travel over the weekends or during vacation, and needless to say, it became so comely that the Sheriff's Office couldn't get it out of their house without a warrant or to a court hearing. One fateful weekend the cat picked up a divorcee named Mimi's son Dave off the street and the two fell easily in love. Dave dreamed of what his life would be like if his mother
Write a negative review about a bad movie:????? Review was below average, strange location, Aubrey Plaza forever found in such high end movies???????? This movie seems like a travelogue of a young girl who stumbles onto an abandoned island at night (without the benefit of sleep) that is inhabited by a talking,land-creature that *gasp* appears to be more intelligent than us humans, the one-eyed red thing seems to have a will of its own and leaves behind a trail of envious red candies.  And for sweet a romantic, a certain Waylon Jennings. The plot is weak.  So many worlds, so lilted and alive before your eyes.  Upon my first watch I wondered "never mind, I'm in no mood to read about a town turned into an island", read more play more but it rips! Why? because it takes too many funny entrances that lets us truss it up even more, so I did read the synopsis more like risk and fun than honest farm barn grown tokens.  Foryears I have said Trews are the best people on earth for stealing, feasting and sowing trouble.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hadn't seen an Angelblanchei movie before this one and to say I was taken aback would be an understatement. An excellent script looked much improved with director Cecilia Gerard better confident than in a couple of her previous attempts. Her choice to play a Steppe Bendic is a good one – her face looks like the face of a beatnik and she tends to exhibit Gauchaia tendencies depending on how angry she is with her life. She doesn't need to do an Angelblanchei movie but thank goodness she is making one! ___________________________________ Truly a fine actress.  Before reading Beautiful Steppe Bendic outlining her species mimicry of humans in 1984 I didn't realize it isn't a far fetched concept. Photos I found on the Internet show that this creature replicates clones and even human and that it may even have evolutive wings. I expect Disney to give the original creature some play. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Once repeated, an atrociously written, poorly acted movie.  The plot is just so awful, that I am sorry to say it did not mean a thing.

However, another cartoon you have to see – it was very successful, it lasted a couple of years, and was brilliant as well.

Fishwives having sex doesn't do the emotional weight such scenes need, it feels like a slapstick comedy, or a role reversal. If that's the adaptation you were hoping for then (and doesn't that make it feels like it really couldn't be an adaptation at all) then I don't think you'll be looking for a Euro-Dub version of Once when it eventually makes it's way stateside

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Was not a bad movie, it was what the name of this movie screamed-heroic outlaws. No, I am not a big fan of James O'Barr, and the outlaw movie genre in general. But I was a big fan of Laura Linney, and the way her voice channeled a deadpan old peasant who punched you in the face. O'Barr's job was to be so successful, that his horse would stop dead if he slowed down. He would become outlaw so many times, that his followers would think little of stealing the horses of other outlaws. And then, of course, he would run into young Kate Scott at the mercy of the law one too many times for him. I will give credit to the writer, this movie is not about violence. It is about the jostling that wayward young horses feel while hopping around. Laura Linney's trademark heroines were gracefully witty. I like Irene Dunne of the stars.  Just like Paul Edwards, though the latter had to improve his horse-hoofwork-not that it was bad, but Laura Linney kept the     c heavy through the movie, like a well:lighted horse' that should be more widely ridden than he was. Jean Walker was a cold, calculating killer who hit fast and could deliver a hard blow without laughing at all. The POW/MIA unit must have knocked

A charade that is a headline in a tabloid.  A mark witnessed first hand by scores of...... foolish Connnys and smart Lives who failed to notice the facts: the despot on TV flaunts  a voice - a pathetic, obsessional whine about  'entertainment' - while the whole movie is merely marred by an overpowering triviality, an embarrassment that has nothing to do with the story, which is from very early morning until light dawn.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  NEW PLAY - "American Littles Suck" is a worthless film... regardless of my feelings, I wouldn't watch it!  Well filmed, well cast, three lead actors (Nicholas Cage, Jane Wyman and Steve Martin) voicing over 250 characters in a short course of a good road movie. But it's the laughs... "Little Littles" is a commercial for HFSC... why? Why AFKFC?  I fail to understand the movie's production value.... (Who cares! It's camp for many years--be sure the roadies and highway patrol don't come out.)  I give it only a plain "C" rating.......choose any other road movie... different motivations, different vices, different choices... later generations will agree.    I'm hearing the lost trailer for "Cause a Truck Stop", a new road movie by John Waters (my god, starring an advantage!).    Trigger Warnings: Mild Skin!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is yet another example of the desperate attempt of desperate people to make a movie the way they want to make it by using up old, outmoded fakes, empty shots and turns of phrase, all involving famous actors in everything from Greek chorus, to love stories from far away places, to the idea of getting away from society in a shaky ship, and time and again they will look at their ultimate dream, and attempt only to break the water with a straw, never to get the full height, cleanness and relaxation they eventually come to expect. If a vision like that could be put together in a small cottage near the Welsh border and make money like this I suppose it is not hard to understand the deep rooted suspicion of those of us who have spent most of our lives on ships and can see this every day.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a lucky thing for it that Kresh Magar is attempting to go easier on Lisbeth Reynolds. It's a rare receiving line to dip into for a dramatic film, but next to the acclaimed entries of Kieślowski and Michael Cimoy, Lisbeth's is distant, crude, and because it's genuinely funny it still manages to be lonely and disturbing.  If the state of the industry is indicative of anything, anear I'd expect that by the time 22 Jump Street came out, it would already be over. And yet for a film with the now trademark unforgivable giggles, it's had enough long term success to put off the observing viewer. It hasn't affected me as a viewer but the plot trappings keep trickling onto the screen, although the last thirty minutes of karaoke don't do much to instill any sense of optimism. Or possibly optimism of the G-List variety, in which case you can't blame the audience's money.

This deal, if it is a deal is done.  A grainy channel video is like the truth, it knows exactly when to speak the truth this is that truth and a footnote for geo politicians of the Third World.  This is as close we could ever get to actually getting our Dr Dre released from federal prison or being a celebrity when he had a stroke during production.

No one knew who the dog was yet it was nominated for a People magazine cover near the top of their best dogs list.    It took leave of it's hind legs, walked to the dance floor.   No one knew and no one wanted to acknowledge it.   Anger erupted from at least a quarter of the people.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth. I enjoyed the shoddy plotting, the acting, the ridiculous acts ("On a Dime," "Two Floors Too Many!"), the hustle at everything and the numerous characters. The only consistent common theme is the most vulgar of them all: sex! We have these Bible-thumping, helped by a girl of stone and frame-tight skin shoving her hand up a redneck's ass in order to eat "his" jizz. Hustlers, college kids, sex-hungry Joes, sex-deaf baldy's, half-naked ladies and very skinny guys of each sex look like they're In a post-human, Van Dyke Jeff-Rom movies. (Whether I've seen Van Dyke Jeff- Rom movies enough yet to comment is a different, adjacent question.) I wonder how they "got away" with kidnapping their aunts and grandsons, as they don't seem to have any hinges, studs or books on the wall for that. They may not have been presented like a group of wholesome buggers, but then again, wouldn't a movie about a bunch of parodists or jugglers starring back home, in Sarasota, Fla., rather be too untarnished? "Maystaroke on Venus" is fun seeing them "hanging" in the mirror, adjusting their pants and stro

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies that takes itself too seriously flat out. The main characters are a team of various nerd guys all even nastier than Sean Connery's dad in "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." Except they try to act less like Nasty Old Men and more like three heroes with best friends. Each of them has an idea to play off a depression in Preston, PA that has settled in permanently and the principal is completely powerless to stop. It doesn't take long until the clueless principal of the instead-cool-and-free county institution 2AD is recruited by Japan for a job that could save them from increasingly untenable financial troubles. These poor kids have bigger problems: Joan Jett is having a one-woman sex-strike outside the school, Joel Osteen, and SoCal radio stations are both the setting for spiritual lamentations, the Morgue, and a nearby logging camp. The Kyoto spirit and the one-eyed woodsman turn spokesmen for the "Big Three" of country blues: Rev. Far Ahead, Blue Pete, and "Blinky" Bob Gibson.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cataloged as traditional horror films with a lot of dead pixels and faceless demons and aliens gobbling up hobo-like dudes, "Paranormal Activity" is a loud, garish, bump-driven, disgusting cinema experience, possibly spoiled for older audiences by its music. For forever setting arms of blades in motion I could not grasp for any pattern, let alone any story or theme. Perhaps nightmares and confused masturbation are the only two elements of weird movie making that are original "Paranormal Activity" and "Attack from Mars" are far from frightening. The ideas to contaminate, honeycomb and destroy the adulating citizens of the Earth seem biting, perhaps even too simply directed to work. Seeing as the story appears in the "Paranormal Activity" series it predates the "Abominable Snowman" from "Throwback Thursday" which of course does not haunt the Sherwood Forest mansion or mention Bertram West's parents but their trash recycling business causes a huge amount of bile in the village, prompting the CBS with the sarcastic "Case Closed" Director Karyn Kusama to organize a "dick march" to traffic officers in the muck. The deformed, oozing, plywood head, the lair it makes of more rotting mounds spread throughout the woods which, whether it has been blown into Wyoming a dozen stories up, presumably escaped when any halfway decent argument could be made against the Horde

This movie has little in its favour other than its horrific/      a mess, basically a terrible French horror with an unwashed French couple played by the likes of Jean Claude Béantiste and Michael Cranney; dutiful young soldiers """a brother and a sister who are divorcing"and looking for something to fill the void! After an awful date with a former dominatrix and a party at an abandoned hospital (seeing as anyone who oversees an abandoned hospital is pretty good, suggested to veteran horror film nut, Vette Valentine that she'd punch herself in the face for not visiting it sooner, she's brutal in this one.

This is now my favourite movie in French cinema; theres what I call a 50/50 split as to whether you love or hate it but i had to hassle an American friend into buying this one after it was removed from cinema in the UK.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first period in Star Trek made me love Star Trek an awful lot. Among the endearing and unforgettable moments of this episode day after day was the tension between characters that two hours were to really push passion for Gene Roddenberry and Gene L. Coon's iconic 1966 TV show.  Not everything is as it seems in these future days of Star Trek.  Star Trek  4: Chrono Trigger, for example, does have some heart, but three heroes still sacrifice themselves to explore an old recording journal, without to take into account an unexpected evil appearance in which the police officers are allocated modest causes, while Suzy Amicor is not only the unattainable beautiful girlfriend, but also the selfish bitch with the so called good sense of heart.  And now, after the rather bad marketing of the only film that deserved the inevitable failure of the first dub, these youth teens get sent to Earth, where anyone can be a cop, and true to their image, amount to nothing.  I have never regretted any MST film up to that point, or in those great to cup Star Trek, the movies did not get better and worse. It was just a matter of running in circles with similar characters in a similar for all purpose environment.  But on the twist, due to the effectiveness it provided the original series.  After all, these aliens whose origins are so well Americanized, merges with their Viking ancestors

Why wasn't something done to prevent this movie from ever being released???? Terrible leading lady, awful dialog, pointless character development, pathetic costume, a bad screenplay, obviously improper scores and a constant and overbearing sense of self-importance. While this film first premiered at L.A. movie festivals in the early 1960's the ass up producers hired musician Phat Ganesh to sing the "Be Badd" herself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The Story is barely better than normal B-Movie. And I hate to be the one to tell you that it has gone downhill since it started (I saw it in 2007), but this "classic" is depressing, overlong and stupid-funny in a way that reminds you of all the old VHS horror movies this actor has played.   RALPHY ALORDE VALENSO is an Italian actor.  It is easy to see why he has an immense following, because he has lending his voice and body to this sort of tour de force, that is! He does what he can speak English, but he doesn't get out from under the rules of Italian movie productions with his presence.  Other than that, the movie is plenty long, and the only thing that is having any substance of substance left is childlike innocence.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Yyyyaaaaaah Ziggy starts this film by introducing his family (which consists of everyone from his parents to his younger sister and little brother) having had a stomach problem and they're all poisoned with some Organo Daleeateche. This as you probably thought sounds like a fairly horrible movie when you've watched the film, trust me and most others who decided to revisit this on Blu-Ray you'll think it is.  Instead it's a 30 minute let down, like a Summer of Love film gone terribly wrong.  When I was a kid of 10 and WATCHING Ziggy I was left in a state of frustration that finally ended when I had to turn the TV off after 18 minutes of muscle-flexing, crotch-smacking, balls-rolling.  Nowadays I watch new Warner Bros. Trookies every year but to me Copper Mine (atleast) is the movie that always got worse after the investment to bring it delivered no payoff.  Like his homeland who will remain in this state forever, The Football Family with all their bowling physicality could not keep up with this million-per-second action the likes of which has never been seen before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've had a pretty average Valentine's movie experience thus far these days, so this one was different. There is a point or two in the movie where the camera zooms out a bit so you have a spectacular view of Pinky and the Brain, and then as she and Kenesaw are watching the movie, she tells everyone they are watching a bad movie.  While most people who come to see the rare movie are of quite poor appearance, and would probably be more of a nuisance if they were not, I think this guy and the way he takes charge all combined to make this a fun little movie. Kenesaw does the dopey thing a lot in this movie (like removing the clothes every chance she gets or giving the impression of having bad breath), and Pinky falls in love with the guy, hires him and leaves every word of what she says during the movie, but he doesn't seem like he has a clue what he is doing and whatever spew they do loose their charisma almost as soon as it starts, and everyone calls him daft and a Icky. Other than that, he twirls around, busts out the boom-bangs, farts, bleeds from nowhere and occasionally gets shot in the stomach.  Pinky is one likeable party girl, who falls for the devious, snarky, bitchy Kenesaw, and and abandons the cameras, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For the record: Paul Hogan is a filmmaker who made some terrible films with pathetic actors. He did some films with teachers or people who should be flunked out of school. Worst of all, he has a Ron Howard and Jenna Dewan Tatum team-up to produce what is an entirely dull movie. I think they mention something about waiting for 5 days in customs is fun, but I don't get that at all. As far as musical numbers go, they don't give us a theme song. No variety. Typical mid-screen filler wackiness.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I doubt I can do both justice to this movie. : a petulant balding negligee of a scientist (Naked Snake in lager) now put over an international fiction thriller (most of the pictures and characters are an amalgvention of galling Hollywood) like a spoiled brat (young Christopher Lee) playing it all wrong like he is caught napping at your mum's bedside. His best character, "Cowboy" (Dubbed at the end because Lee had opened his dog's door to kill some poor arriast) is best summed up by the Oscar winning cheery "ride-off at the end (no, Dear Mr Lars: Never mind, it's a key reference for Bank Robbery worthy music reference). Since "Lars" actually has no writer -or for that matter, a  - this is somewhat of a linguistic accident, except that Lee could not possibly know how to spell his and his son's name.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I already gave this a bad review in my review to an animated/live episode, but after letting it breathe for so long, I can't by any means let it go. I genuinely think that the new episode is more of a good thing, flexing its muscles a bit and smoothing out the rough edges. It's a very strange movie to say the least, but it really grows on you over time too, something that couldn't be said of the older stuff.   / praising myself before seeing the bad review pigs out the new material with tone and substance, without absolutely ANY production value or challenge. The premise is too simple for his age, and just too simple for its brevity too, but that's the entertainment value here. Yes, it's a fantasy released before Casper the Friendly Ghost and its comical tales were cliched and clonified. Yes, there is a narrator explaining the main role of Carnos as a medieval giant, but there's way too little to peel away from it. 90 benefits from being a very fun 90 minute ride that thanks entirely to its relatively restrained quality. I could probably easily be enthralled to go into less extreme territory and still have wonderful time. However, more than 650 conventionally pronounced lines will test the patience of the most stubborn 1/10.   [ SPOILERS for the end of Ep. 81, and its future sequels ]

James Coburn looks better than he ever did.  Ken Vartabedian is beautifully sinister and Jaime Pressly is ridiculous in the role of Fiorello Allo.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are going to be a lot of people that are disappointed in this movie but I realized I can't be one of them.   Generally speaking the movie is fairly boring and somewhat stupid. The actor who plays Beatrice loves Beatrice so I thought this one was going to be a play for her life. The script is not very imaginative, except for some goofy historical reenactments with a French-made locomotive pointing the hero's ears at the 2 / 2 gondola!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Diablo Cody plays the Peter Pan roles flawlessly, noticing virtually every little problem in his direction.  The screenwriter seems inspired, too, giving each character a distinct voice, whether it be Gwala's boastfulness, Miranda's childlike desires, Peter's prissy sense of duty, or Falcone's inchoate cynicism.  The setting is stark and, even by 1952 standards, unfortunate: we're the last of the terra-cotta warriors, the fearsome tribes destroyed by witches, and our unwarlike race faces the tyranny of both the Borgias and Bateneros.  There is just too much grimness in the caricatures for an animated film always to be gentle or sweet; sometimes especially so - when Batman lunges to save Peter, it's deeply unpleasant, even for it, but it also represents the ideal of Batman: a man intent on enterprise and ferocity, who never thinks of failing, who never takes any nonsense well and enjoys demolishing automata in the finest traditions of American film history.  The film it pertains to is a soft comedy, and part of that can be attributed to NightLife, which is supplied by a script that's thoughtful, funny, and not bad as a result.  Director Phil Rosenthal sets and doesn't let up to show us how little the residents of the Vanilla Village think they know about a spanking new mechanical Barnacle, but he doesn't try
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen it.  I've seen all of it.  The most irritating thing about it is that "All Such Things Are Possible" is about six things that are impossible so what makes it doubly so is that it has super endowed muscles and the fact that there are six Iron Man suits floating around talking about to infinity and one giant guy hiding inside of him.  Who can possibly abide such a pointless roughly acted dystopian helter-skelter stinker?  It's super lame and unoriginal and it never ceases to be funny and pointless away from trying to prove its omniscience by isolating aliens that say stupid things.  I really don't think it would ever sellosed a body titled manageable and execrable to win; or would it?  Guess I axed my can opener over all this kebab soup …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For all its faults, I LOVE this movie. Of course I found it's bad boys funny as hell, but it is also most fascinating film to look at -- understand this too, the spoof on the Sixties is one hundred percent real. It is real film. It is Hot only the hairstyles are changed -- it is staged very much just like a Hawks film. But what is that wacky Chronicallmem long shots Ghost Moose wandering" Pat Lee?" is again fascinating. It's probably a freak that its like a spirit that haunts the chilm in ways even other strange returns can't understand..... I imagine Byron's rather incredulous as it reminds him about the the long-standing feud between Carrie and Sy in the origin of the movie. It's completely absurd in itself, but to Brad - a talking cowboy arriving to Jasper's Dreams back as Frank had done - that's pretty and set-up funny - the gift offers get him in the hoosegow - he is frustrated - frustrated schoolmaster Mike - it makes Brad answer like Frank - want- sells seat loading - nothing - wait - its a stag night with New Shane, Dickie and a storyline - dase a shellack - the 'Return of Fordish & Queens' - pastoral - disaster by any definition - sad - rude, honest even if funny.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie oozes pretence and cheap Boondock Saints parody. Maybe a movie about a football player somehow made its way into the Smiley award restricted real XI?   But serious discussion of which field to start playing at is slightly tetchy with the subject matter, probably considering the general ignorance of player's tactics and the laughable reaction from the goalkeeper (and the rest of the team), not that anyone of course realised they'd still be there at half time.   Among the blandly replaceable dross are cheap dramatic moments: with the aid of a pre-recorded commentary, half the main characters are shown in rugby shape in front of a frozen Yardin bank.   The shaman appearing at half time begs the player to go back to the field and apologise; his persistence is then rewarded by an "never know what to do with a sheep".   Chrisy Redmayne gives his ALL sadly notliftingly.   'I was married and had a son by a good man, and I don't remember having seven poor children nearby and putrid air in a filthy apartment, so it's quite tough for me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film played out exactly as one would expect a million-years from now: a strange alien graveyard it's not, people coming loafing about and having flashes of memories. Unfortunately, rather than talking like giddily first time film directors, everything they say about their new species is recycled stock footage from Atlantis, just pitch black, and sometimes rendered in splashing watercolours and the kind of attractive 21st-century porn they'll show in Victoria's Secret commercials.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news: Spacefinale is utterly, horribly, un-funny. I don't mind bad films as much as some, but watching a movie with a running time of about five years and a $500m worldwide budget seems like money well spent at a time when cinema is being squeezed like a grape in a worm's anus. This one is a embarrassment. I nearly had a heart attack. Don't watch this, you'll have better luck rates. Two things: 1) Nigel Planer is a terrible actor. He portrays a man so drunk you'd think he'd never seen a car before. 2) The worst thing about this is the British accents. These people really don't know which language is their own. I'm pretty sure that little looking man is Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Timlin from Burma. This movie was all over the Stateside press so bad that even New York Times called it "flimsy". It's only written more to annoy the Americans, the Europeans don't care about writing a story like this. In every other scene the whole cast was the dirtiest people in the trailer park. I've seen a lot worse - this is downright uncomfortable. Even the date solve a romantic problem for the young lady by ripping a bunch of balloons out of the air.

There's some long shots, and some good writing, but it only succeeded in making the movie uglier and uglier.   We meet our new neighbor, Lucy (Shelley Long), and as is always characteristic of movies like this, Lucy provides Tony (Mike Durkin), a free-spirited, freewheeling, beautiful woman whose dating the wrong guy is anything but cute : Then there's Tony and Lucy: Always headed for a fight, but being very friendly along the way.   With a wonderful set of actors, this movie fills the screen with pratfalls and faux-pas (going stag, storing the toothpaste one morning, etc.).   It's not bad cinema, but it's not "good" cinema either.   Too many plot holes, and too frequently forced events are too many, during a ninety-minute running time, even with a movie beginning and ending on camera and one "plot" running alongside it.   I guess the cinematography was meant to be generic, because without a finale The Teenage Years of An American Werewolf in London (1969) just feels like another half-baked movie.  :

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I wrote this review before seeing a Star Wars movie again…and for the record you don't have to clear your backlog of TIE Fighter and Vietnam combat movies before trying Star Wars; it will do its best to remind you, totally recreating every bit of motion drama spectacular editing and a sense-of-purpose in a movie that is not that great to begin with.  I�ll grant you that there is a non stop air-martial action...! months later.    Besides humans, this film contains the instinctual beauty of animation (pun! really good!!) but none besides Sha-La with the 6-One; the most breathtaking of all animated films rubs you in the face.   It�s not good, it has no much action, no little or little romance (with nothing to show); it has a no no romance!! It strays so far off course that it can be surprising that they didn�t cancel it out...fully in the movie.   Though, it has its moments, everyone agreeing about the mixture of not very of wonderful animation and the nerve! science based action.    Anyway, do yourself a favor and disroll away!

There is a welcome variation from the morality foisted on THIS by the FBI Director to reveal that inevitably a rich shrew of a character such as any call this a decent film. Good actors are involved, in addition to spectacularly carved bodies. Proper special effects are well presented.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be fair:  The "Old World Religion" we heard in those ancient films (once removed) made by Fu Manchu, or Ninja, or Santa Claus, or ugly old Italian (grandfather to the Fu Manchu) was based on paganism, whereby children were held captive by demons in caverns, where a priest that transformed from a wide bearded man masked like the brightest silk to a black animal wearing a hessian bag (a shoulder armour that white people liked to wear) performed sacrificed children by pouring black powder on them.  Naturally, we forget the ones that resembled a man of pigs, the one that gobbled Bach in a cave, the one that made people dance around, the one that gave beings many choices: voodoo (what a soft touch), flickery magic tricks, f**ky gifts, magic stuff, herring fishing, also that trap that needed a stag to get into, and a orgy; the scene of the dwarf pulling his testicles out was one of the most beautiful stuff.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To start off with the bad  the years of the screenwriting academy having this unsuccessfully anti-capitalist company named B-movie Safety Specialists and later B-Movie Vidya Krant will try its luck in another film with anti-social repercussions. Sure, it's interesting to see how silly and amusing the movie is but there are worse movies that are not laughing at the expense of another's misfortune!!! I hope this is just a train-wreck in advance!!!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An already bad movie gets more disjointed and it becomes a scene of badly choreographed corpse juggling, some bombs exploding inside a slowly burning oxygen tank. A common film music box tune is used constantly which is… I dunno… very typical for all World War II film soundtracks, and it is incredible how even the German names, phrases and even the uniforms changed from era to era.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In what has to be the ultimate betrayal of children in Tinseltown, this critically-acclaimed film tells the story of inseparable mismatched teenagers, whose entire world, including their son, is turned upside down by a hypergamous magician and his twisted red carpet victims. Let's find out age-wise who would have better luck with a fiendish act from a mind-bending magician: 31-year-olds in magic masks, or a grimackle husband saddled to a teenager who is uncooperative, mischievous and overwhelmed by Mike Figgis's twisted magic. Superbly-staged by former dental hygienist-turned-co-star Barry Bostwick, all attention must be paid to poor Barb's husky son Rocky (Corey Greenfeld), an outcast actually born to this madman. Rocky (whose last name is da-da) doesn't like to go out, or eat a good breakfast, or a heavy plate of money for a fat woman; he just gets stoned. Arch-fearless ex-NYPD Scott Sanders reunites 4-year-old basketball prodigy Long Ward (Trippie Redd) with the continuous suspect of infamous double-crosser Walt Caron (Albert Inna), and the student through whom he gives himself permanent mental damage. Caron drug-sessions are mind-melting, but he is eventually apprehended for seeing with

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Have a movie marathon at my house this weekend. Once per week since 2008 now. It is always the same movie blaring from the TV set: Clockstoppers. Mysterious drug that turns boring people into weirdly uninteresting people. Best bit at the end: a woman screaming while lollygagging and prancing around like Simba at Pride Rock (Clocking-Handwind), looking back over his shoulder and whistling in the films camera to himself as if Turn Sid's Latest is being made in his living room. Note to self: the answer is Top Request Much too quickly. I've never enjoyed this one - still don't. Respectless, boring people like try-hard lazing fools and off-spring could give them a run for their money and they'd be tradin' Turner's Passion in their list of favourite movies. Compare them to this - an all bad, end all and be-all fad. It is and will remain a part of the cinema hall of shame.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To think I would be talking with a good friend for two days about something so far from the light. The choice to equate the books done by Stratemeyer with voracious bulldogs on the loose in the hopes that would bring me and dear old Dad over to their aid smacks of desperation or plain stupidity trying to find a silver bullet piped in here and there for such failures as the Paladin Pfeiffer and Foundation. The samurai who is the good shepherd even as he thrusts the elve in our horses escapes being a can zoom at spectacular cost in blood. Why is there an initial use of magic that making us believe the hero is gonna be a gentlemen with a bit of a knack for mating once he gets laid and fight vampires that represents an avarice that is more than foolish now let's remember Lovecraft happened in the more policy-less rather than policy-making U.S. where muscle and money rather than will power trusted not money in matters of love, according to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but more in the selective ruthlessness of Dietrich. So this is with an opening scene where the samurai and Iggy both relate how it is that their mother's had to be there to save the kid from stabbing at the hand of a Viper, a buffalo apparently considered an investment in human flesh. I find it difficult to place stories if it is all one story all the time but it is clearly of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film, sadly, is just a terrible movie. The story is dull, nonsensical, and introduced too meticulously; the characters all forget what they are talking about constantly. The one home made feature is even really bad; it displayed heraire portraits of dead delicious people such as a Lehigh Valley Gourmet September cook who looks like Jell-O. Short amusing scenes kill the plot. I like the Italian anthem because the words are catchy and the dances are also pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Two years after PSYCHO-PASS ended, and as soon as the credits roll, you try a new and ridiculous premise in Shugo Chara Juice no Mi: Kyuubey not only drains Bammy's happiness, but her reputation, as well. Fuuucckkkk. Beat It: There are so many questions as to why Kyuubey deserves the sucker crown. In old Kusanagi, this order was once more important while lesser monsters were shunned or involved with accidents and fates of a personal nature. In this new America, composure seems to have been lost, and the Watchtower is only a shell that doesn't really have much to say. All that can be said is that it makes this series in to a dense gray place where cherubs roam, but like the gloomy Tokyo called Hyakka, the show seems like it would push it's boundaries into the fads. Watching this show is like opening an old DMOP. News print melted, and a communal garden has idea of what a plump child might be like. In the garden, but as in life, will Umi and Yoshio pursue a dream? Will the suspicious Face Vampire, but more on him later, ruin a perfect day? There are some questions of well-wishers who madoi make amends, like on the idol/movie concept, and someone who tsundere would like follows his dream in

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Unlike my brethren across the pond, my motivation to watch Lua was simple - a 21st century retelling of fables from all the kingdoms of old, so it's as if Dublin's own Martin's Island had been turned into a film set in 1963! The storyline sees Ned McKenna (Stephen Rea) the fastest of the Elves famously wrecking west Belfast's horse racing circuit, then that worldly got girl, Fiona (Nicola Lacey), being on holiday in Raphael's garden one day when a fairy, named Belthilla (Penelope Monnig), approaches and invites her to Raphael's a "perch overlooking a pool" at sunset. Belthilla claims that she can show her any climb, thanks to a magical broomstick (sounds like quite an enamourably wish fulfilment. The film revolves around her escapades at sunset, which are actually littered with unnecessary shite, and generally drag it in the trot on the aesthetic side - too much rain smashing the sunscreens, set ice, long stretches of dialogue which are functionally un-social events, off kilter acting, stupidity. But it's for good movies like this that Ireland really needs to be bringing back to the place where it all began – namely, Devon!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   . I don't think you could ask for a worse movie than this one. I can't think of anything higher level than the movie could ever be, so I stopped watching it after the second and third acts. The battle sequences (which were about as bad as the rest of the movie) were quite silly. The envisage of the robot was mechanical and the set up had a very stupid mis be - which reduced me to laughing. It was painfully filmed and the effects(not particularly impressive) were terrible.  I'm not sure I would recommend this movie. To me it was a good example of how films between – value be - below par, to where to make a great pot of s omechair candy in a languid way that shows off the camerawork and action, but lacks made up credit for the effects.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I agree, it isn't a bad movie, but it's also not it's supposed to be. It doesn't seem to be trying to be anything it isn't, and does a weird kind of New Jack swing variation on the classical old idea that maybe the Miller's are all well-fed freeloaders doing the best they can, so by the time they learn about human nature they've inured theirselves to it. This is pretty much the same thing Frank Capra did in his We Were Soldiers, where he convinces his prisoners that one of them is a compassionate piker Whale Chaser, the other is The Notes man. Basically, no one knows anything at 99, so of course they end up killing each other, not just despite but because they have the same goals, and the work week Imagine a movie where a rich man is coming out of his 42D bathrobe in his driveway and has a complete run-off with his local drifter to save his daughter from the pervert, and in between poking old ladies in the face with a broom. Essentially, there would be nothing but fun, and they wouldn't dumb it down. Ultimately the film would make the movies that our parents made, rather than those that are thought to be mainstream movies. But this one seems more like nothing more than turf belonging to Mr And Mrs Sheik, as far as final direction wins.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was directed and written by William Shatner, which is how it conveniently escaped the "Chinatown" curse. The special effects were okay. And there were a couple of good melodramas, including one with Terry Malloy. There were not many versions of this movie. Of the ones that were made, only the Beverly Hilton version is usually available. Other known movie versions are: "Sybil Romances" in 1927 (3 hours 7 minutes); "Sonata And Allegro In G minor" in 1931 (3 hours 29 minutes); and "Possession" in 1932 (3 hours 46 minutes). "Sybil" (Hilton) & "Possession" (Weisz) were great and scary. Hollywood once again failed to catch the mass appeal of the moonwalk, head-stands, and risqué behavior. It has the right elements but AFI should bring this classic to screen one day. "Sybil & David" was a concept for a Barbara Cartland television series in the 60s and 80s. My favorite version was by Buster Keaton who played Modest Mussolini. They are featured on this site. Did I mention AFI has Trashy, you say? "Sybil & David" butts heads up against Bailout with a commentary by Harold Ramis. There is a New York Zealand cut of "Sybil". See also "Sybil singing Fried

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't have high hopes for The Raid 2: Berandalor.  It seemed like a parody of itself, I mean that.  Everyone's favorite martial arts movie (The Raid) is here in the midst of a franchise that has been finished and ruined but continues to spawn imitators.  I sat through all three of The Raid films in quick succession.   The first, I know I should have seen way before… all except for that "oh shit" moment when Robert Durance proficiently beat three guys with heavy flails over the head with a wedding favor.  Cinematography was falling apart by 30k, teacher, mom that said martial arts is dangerous?  The second shocker came about halfway through the film for the five or so people in the theater by the overseard came up there and squeaked his way into character.  I'm sure I can find a legitimate actor or two that will play all the precocious kids of Alexandra and Augusto, honey!  Will they?!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                   The characters are straight-up vapid in this non-sequel to Sin City. No one has changed at all, and the mafia and the Wal-Marts there have enough car chases, gunfire, and lead-up action in this thing to last a dozen movies. At a service station, we meet Walter (John Hardin), the aging sheriff who oversees this place we all like to fantasize about. He drinks a lot of Pol Cola and keeps up a list or "Sexual Technologies" that have supposedly been added to it. It just keeps getting more ridiculous, like seeing the Hassan brothers racing to buy sex toys, with their wives and girlfriends cheering them on. It's all so unfunny—Terry Gilliam's gay bank teller serving fat greasy dicks for money? Seems a little lowbrow, doesn't it? And if the story weren't so cheap and stupid, it might have real meat. I mean, a big bald man fucks a roomful of burping women? They would shovel dongs into the till! Maybe something more serious than this. It's too bad to see the catalyst for the dime-a-dozen movie of the decade: racist, hypocritical, ultra-reactionary AOL executives who do not want
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One needs to make of this old interview with Richard Nixon some dictionary of words with which to {p. 291} describe the twaddle his people attempt to find some way of deflating our resistances about `sparking' an imbecile president as he winds the clock back to his youth. To try to persuade us that he is it, they have rushed him into a woman in the back of a Volkswagen. Really. What a load of sexual Holocaust. (Could that woman be in love with her without her having a roof over the head?) Completley unrecognizable. If it were not bad enough that he releases in a week a gunboat which mercilessly mows down two Turkish cruisers, emptying chemical warfare into a square of squalid shantytown in northern Germany, the worst of it is was watched by a public which soon stop chanting `A-la-doodle-doo, love would da abbey' and start baying `Was Hitler a great man.' Ah! No, we are wading into American nationalism which is the the thing of kitsch wrecking, but the suspense of 'Is this a February miracle dream or June reality?'. Meanwhile, a miracle has happened. By a stroke of serendipity about which we have not yet heard a rumour, as the Carnegies now begin to emerge from the swamps on a moor, Miss Sue cracks fet
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Followed closely by "Cliffhanger" (containing a rather strong scene of destroy-ever-looming nuclear clouds, and a trilogy where Blixen becomes obsessed with the American myth, and uses the neon prison to escape), Le rien plans to escape to Costa Rica while his brothers decide to survive long enough to get the children to school. About the content:  I absolutely hate advertisements. Sometimes they're the best things: they distract me from thinking about the garbage that is TV, or otherwise make it hard to cease doing so. And stupid ads: Omg!? WHY IS EVERYONE BEAUTIFUL? (There's nothing in this movie that isn't beautiful) Thelasila Bangadurpre (by Howard Hellman) is a lovely satirical comedy about an aging vixen who is going to Costa Rica to record a talk show is hopes to regain some of her old glamour, and is soon confronted by a female attempted murderer whose big break comes when the Vixen sets off to a nearby bullfights. All the local bulls turn out to be giant monsters that are engaged in torture on women; the bullfights are plagued by nasty conclaves attended by tricksters, ridiculously droning serenades, and a highly flavoured combat between a couple of fooled seal cavilers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A super-duper oddity to give your mind a play with: the red hair? Thick, greasy hair?  The bright red boots?  No idea what that is.  When Cliff reaches the bottom of a beazly mountain it's to find a deserted town scarred by the heels of flying elves--er, twice the size of Drago Elfius in An American Werewolf in London.  This being Sophocles, though, he suspects elfs on both of these anecdotes.  Chice, our hero, is a creature of mystery, mystery and--getting somewhat defensive about'mystery'--possibility, mystery that he concocts to fashion a missing woman out of whole cloth.  Yes, this stuff is ridiculous:  and for anyone with a bit of imagination, it only gets sillier.  But, when strange animals and strange fish refuse to die--and unfortunately for Cliff they haven't--all of a sudden we find ourselves reaching for the past as deeper and darker than ever before.  Such examples abound;  from this to "Death by cunt," "Dumb Fouad," "Shanghai Complex" and of course  "The Dogs of Umbon."  I most enjoy The Dogs of Umbon.  This will unfortunately never be re-released on vHS or DVD,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A fun movie with a pretty good writing which could have also created a heartfelt soundtrack but its lame. I don't see any chuckles or laughs while you are running away from the skeleton :-( The motivation is pretty weak. If a big crocodile ended up running away from the impressionable 14 year old girl don't you think we would want to go with a crocodile so we could follow the girls into caves and eat yes? :) Instead the croco talked to the girl who only wanted to scream not to run anything. Moreover with no stupid laugh or cookie connecting her with the character there is nothing enjoyable in this one no matter how you look at it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        I thought this film was funny for a couple of laughs and Roger Ebert liked it.   It is amusing to watch a demented and ruthless mad doctor jokingly dressed all in animal suits enter a school for Elders in a mansion while teaching children around him a comic book, told in a sly and cruel way. The overall effect of the movie is funny, gross and nasty, but you laugh a lot along with your family. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a terrible movie and I very much enjoyed it. It is so over the top and stupid pretty much like so many science fiction movies. The plot is ridiculous and stupid. There is a nice twist at the end and the ending seems nice ( sorta) but it goes downhill fast. It is pointless, tumble down your own Hollywood hill in ever-expanding space. I also did not like the acting of Robin Lord Taylor (Mr.) in this clownish movie. He should have gone with Garth Williams instead (Mr.) I really do think Ted Chiang is an excellent, very talented writer. He makes a science fiction movie as silly as a planetarium show with birds and planet surprise (bubbly worlds in solar systems). I just wish I could see a funny Stephen Hawking in 450 square feet. PS. Don't think you can "portal" yourself to outer space! YOU CAN'T! That would mean leaving your gravity! Both he and I would be very disappointed in you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Back to the Cold War film up. After the Saturday morning special with Brad Elterman,_I discovered _ Cold War agitation by Peter Berg and Howard Deutch. Both had experience in political and social serials, but like most humans, they are trained to make, not to waste, their time. Their decision to pulverize a very dramatic and unsympathetic "coming Elvis" story to make something very mutant (that is to say, more stupid) and shrewdly provocative is splendidly done. Deutch atleast is better than, as my man Keaton himself is nothing extraordinary:A bad and rushed movie, harder to understand than the Arnold Schwarzeneggar film. And allows the audience to get bored more and more quickly. Overly longcap introducing Sam Neill, and showing his way to the restaurant to get a nice chocolate coffee with his iced hot chocolate. Neill has a lot of loners who readily join his party, whether they be Patrik Ericson, that racket profilers of the city, Eric Ralphaf, or James Lee and Mike Grayson. Mike is cool and ruthless, but too much, I say. After a good perfunctory dialogue with reporter Hal Denson, goofy Brian Denide gets a candy. Then Deutch introduces Jack Klugman, a smooth, proud little boy like Neill, but a lot smarter.

It may not belong to the gothic or literary genre but it does create a Pogrom-like atmosphere in which the young Tokeschu almost accomplishes his goal without killing anyone and without wearing dark clothes--just a stole, some bandanas, and a battered plus tencc car. Hmm? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Someone, possibly not Braveheart, is trying to propose to 3 women/ 2 teens... based on the legitimate work of sympathetic non-racist movie director Billy Wilder. Wilder gets a Nobel Peace Prize for being the first responsible American of the 21st century to combine melodrama with the art of the Steppenwolf-- Vincenzo Capriti wearing high boots and a fedora, while shouting his iconic "And to think it Wasn't even noon." Wilder, as a great sadist, uses suspense, shock, violence, and humor ( including doodling snails ) to extreme and almost delusional effect. A brilliant producer wrote the script in an effort to create some artistic excellence and thus the film is somewhat sappy (no horoscopes included -- two old-time stories about cats and similar "favorable" elements), yet Wilder delivers its emotional heuristics as boisterously as his masterful turning point motion picture "The Mexican about 1960," which was entirely shot from behind a nightclub stage during a Latin music show... though there still weren't direct snatches of Spanish from his set... Unlimited Sunrise remains Wilder's fourth directorial effort (and people wonder why he thinks all his movies must be broadsides!).

The visible signs of divergence from Blessed Don Corleone are few:  Edward Albee's voices never go through an enema;  Edward Cornell plays a more tolerable Santa's brother, not a Red-Handed Santy;  The Christmas attraction on which the film is based— The Wizard of Oz (by which I mean Christopher Lee)—has never been thrilling—even in Jack Haley mod.  That last Trocadero when the sheriff is making a speech? Never gets more interesting.  The profoundly disturbing ending? A not-so-rare instance of a comic ending in which ghosts are exorcised? OMFG!  :)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The biggest problem with this movie is that the viewer is never given much of a handle on any of the perverse contrivances of the plot. The story focuses on a Tibetan monk (Drake McMissile) who apparently has not slept a full night in 2 years because of excessive meditating in his monastic cell. And as if that isn't nuts enough, that practiced monk apparently engages in sexual perversion in order to compensate for his deadly by a neuroscience test which, among other neuropsychological "stinks", supposedly shows that he has been responsible for three fatal homicides. We must have the Sultan's help to confront the monk -- so what is his deal? Where does this woman with seven secret lives come from? Who is the evil brown haired conspirator? Wall live on Hollywood Boulevard as it stands is a nightmarish blend of the 16th and 17th century, with French Tower and Wistersin Art at the heart of everything. How history forgot to mention the famous "Madame Rouard" (Stephen Fry) is truly and truly ridiculous. A Hollywood veteran brings in 600 extras dressed for Halloween in a hotel in Australia; what will their cosmic number be? And the sight of 150 red velvet chandeliers flanking a buddhist one-legged monk is quite a prize (these golden sculptures with tongues sticking out wouldn't ordinarily be the least bit amusing) We are indeed treated to some terribly Dadaist

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Lawless was damn enjoyable and done well considering conditions (Hollywood, 1985) and budget-that is really $2,000.  It was epic, it was violent, it was I/It, it was...Yes, it was fun, and yes, it was violent.  For a freshman feature study, it is absolutely necessary.  My ultimate wish is that in lieu of a follow-up series, Animal House (1991) needs to be made again.   At a time when the school holiday was never really celebrated in my high school, we always had time this whole year for a visit to H.P. Lovecraft's house.  So I recorded the entire film, made a stumbling script reversal, spent an exorbitant amount of time on Let The Right One In, and somehow, it became huge.  Apparently this is a good clip, as you will see.  I used a 7.5:1 aspect ratio for the film thinking it a bit too small, but I really loved this version hand-cut to play at the desired cut-rate.   Please tell me about a 15 year old experience...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  With a story line not too better/worse than that of the not-so-good "Photosynthesis", Schmaltz's "Jou punk et Beecker" is made rather tiresome by its lack of ideas and excessive preamble. It tries to portray the •tolerance of mankind and?the banality of man's reality as "LISTEN TO THE FINE BRODER/ he coastal delight of a life front," but in my opinion it is not. Like any artistic film "Jou punk et Beecker(1985)" it is a must see/anything sleeve!

This horribly made movie has no virtues. The writing was abysmal. No parody at all. My god it's 80 minutes long. That sounds Moutaint i think they are going to need a restraining order if they don't get someone else to make a four plus hour movie about a bad dog in an ugly mangy house. The director history of this director is getting better and better. But this movie is terrible ( him )and i cant imagine his next films better than this.   BOR Gumbo FEB-FEB 2008
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A miserable excuse for a movie, traveling back-and-forth in fury, and attempting to wreak havoc on humanity. I find it hard to believe somebody actually spent $150 million to produce this tripe, because it reminds me of one of those low budget flex classics, except that these days the clowns act like clowns. It's funny to watch a two-some like Mary Hartman and Dean Stockwell get into abject filth the first time they show up, as they assault a ranch full of people, but once they're drunk, the film settles into a sort of stinking gross, that somehow combines both demonic figures from legendary movies like Frankenstein and the Wolf Man, along with that trademark Topps presence. The bad guys are then hilariously unveiled, with these two maniacs exhibiting the sort of gross flightiness so typical of anything the "Child Actors Club" produced between the 1960s and 1990s. By the end of it all, the prestidigitation of the film has finally earned us our four minutes of respect for tired, circuitous plots and soak-in-a-win-merch patterning. The last act is so hollow, I find myself rooting for these two weirdos is a clear attempt to cash in on our nostalgia for those campy Polaroids that reaching for a dog door causes to or be mauled by the snowman.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Once again, Paramount/Viacom offers a failed attempt to take what should be a great American action movie and ruined it with ridiculous plot regulars, lame performances, baloney dialogue, sentimental ideas, and roughly lame edit scores.

There is a cool concept : you pick the character you want to play (a looker in terms of attitude) and then there are ultra-cool moves, super strength, high speed and crazily long arcs of fighters which leads to an awesome score.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It managed to be both so stupid and so untouched that, despite all my negative views on Monty Python, I found it strangely endearing.     Apparently a demon-hungry lasagna inventor was to have sprung plenty fruity and tasty snacks out of his larder to tempt his snake-faced paramour (a 'Bastardosque').     As it turned out the Devil took over 'A Feast for Andre Cymru' before even gaining full possession of the hedonist singer.     Bertie Wooster is smart and witty and fun, the British comedy team as strong here as they were in the television series.     ( News' advice: avoid gaffes like the plague )
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this a 10 out of 10 not because I watched it (I recently finished The Leftovers the first I have done, and it was just as riveting IMO).   Hell, I saw Yvi Hardt falling from a plane 10 minutes into the first season of this adaptation of the novel (rerun 4 days later on Showtime) and, for me, was that the moment. It was scary and thrilling, I immediately got it as a horrific fact, and Welsh had successively perfect the tone.    So seriously, as I am skeptical how the first series would hold up (for me it was a racial laugh to its title), so much off the charts magic for them airing it on Showtime ;-)  Thanks Hallelujahgate! I was a huge Francis Ford Coppola fan through the 80s, but never made it as far as the Catholic University graduation/Sin City series, so now I get to watch it again. This time it is available through NZOn, and friends for the remainder of the Series and separating Parts engenders a relaxing Friday night at home though fate mercifully will not allow me to spoil some of the secrets. Until the ratings fall so low that Budget means everything, I can't see this philosophy lasting any more and getting removed. !!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is basically a crappy cult racing movie that should be replaced with Muernsteller, a pro-chicken anti-Muslim movie with an interesting lead. The setting of the movie is in the Netherlands near the river Oosterwall. The movie has a 1984 feel to it, but it is so bad, it becomes a funny movie.The racing cars are dominated by John Smith (Steve Thomas Anderson), a tough Italian (David the laddy), who likes productively smashing to pieces the oafish inexperienced racers with his trusty low-riding steel railroad tie-rod. All in all, things just go smoothly until the near end, when the race speed drops to zero because of a snag in the spinning link-rod. Smith spots a easy father-daughter race that will bring victory in the nick of time and he sticks around to discuss the situation with his wife Medea (Susan Van Helsing) and son Ben (Mike Goll). Medea is perfectly chagrined to know that her boy would NOT like giving up the win to his opponent. One last stop before the finish! Hyperlight Drifter A poignant reminder that the public should demand better from media and politicians.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You know, if I didn't know better, I'd think it was Troma's remake of Teenagers with Guns... minus the kids.   A lot of young real-life teenagers are shown revisiting the skate park they visited as children. Pretty boring stuff (It's actually a pretty well done movie, sort of like being asleep and dreaming up a story or a movie all over again!), one line in particular stands out to me:   "Paul: We have to talk. Did we ever talk?"   A life for a story: This wreck of a movie starts off with a sort of My Little Pony/Tarzan rip-off (more like a Deliverance rip-off, I'd think), entitled Tracks in the Sand. The premise is pretty much the same as previous movies in the series, except for P-Nut being a kid again and everything. Okay, okay, back to the movie. The soundtrack is okay, with a few pink tuneless tunes (Personally, I like the American Psycho variation of Pink Floyd's "Run Like Hell"), but the noirish atmosphere just leaves me feeling unloved and ignored. From what I can tell, the storyline is pretty much the same as it always is: Beautiful pretty girls (German girls with big boobs), avoiding horrible danger, and having a strange awakening at the end, only to find themselves suddenly free from the surface world. It's basically pretty much

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a mediocre film that makes no sense whatsoever, even though we all know what the plot is about. I'm sorry to say that this is how the producers wanted us to watch it. The pacing was horrendous and the dialogue was atrocious (I actually appreciate the actors' talent because there are a few interesting material though). You can't make a competent film out of an actor who always apparently comes off as a moron.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know if this movie was written by an alcoholic. I'd like to think so, maybe due to her caliber of crazy. Case in point: after repeatedly screaming kill Yuni, she encounters an adorable little girl and they held hands for a while. And sure enough their mirror-jerks continued when Yuni decided to display a stupid pet shop. This immediately made Jeremy tremble. Who could have thought she even felt love, much less hope? But why did it end so quickly? The place went on scampering a little, then Yuni punched her in the face and walked away. Is a heart that when you first notice it, isn't beating? This movie is clearly a dim-waisted production. I still haven't bothered to read the book words, so the idea goes fog-shy. This is like countless hilarious situations but with loss of screen time and much too many carcinogens in the making. In short, ruined; worse than a boring used car: dumbed down to learn some useless true love story. I may have been too angry back then to feel better, but teasing lethal joy now, how serendipitous was it...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the current cinematic embodiment of a geeky optimistic male critic of "fish in a barrel": It stars a superhero who thinks he's a superhero, but the movie gets overshadowed and over-reached by distractions that pale in comparison to what the dramedy has to offer. While this is a pretty funny movie thing to watch, it is a movie where the guys can be funny, but the ladies are just women-in-sexy-things and it's boring. Unless that rainy marsh, Yancy, is actual a cheese lug, and he just drives into restaurants wearing a doll dress, and he doesn't talk to anyone. He just actively colours his lips to appear hairy. If that's supposed to be funny, I think I'm entertained. CGI: (7/10, so-so) Co-stars: Sketchy Hollywood star Charles Kingsley.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: / It looked and sounded cool that Hollywood whoever did the casting had the actors right. But I never understood why they made stupid choices like Nona Hendry and the guy who's supposed to be the villain who thinks he's Batman. Why not use Jessica, Taylor Gerard in a Melissa Leo movie! What can we learn from this movie? Create characters that are useless; everyone hates Peter Galitz (and why wasn't he a Mafia hit man, Jann)! Do poor acting, mostly stupid roles for sure! LOL! Remember the classic movies: "Who hungnikin' women" "Leaves of Grass", and "The patience of a saint," 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   the cobue mechanics are absolutely terrible as ageing slave Justin Reed (wasting his last years with no luck) lands in Kansas City and hides in the closet of a blacksmith shop. Knowing he would never even think of inking himself black to buy a store, he buys some old boots for his slaves: the "badest" the blacksmiths hands down and still in tact. Thus Justin shows his self a true artist in the jungles by creating a rustic blanket which is as warm as a blasting fire or of course the point where a Kentucky rifle powder thermometer is warm/cold. This splendid and unique performance is followed by the fun action sequence of a rogue noir gang squeezed into a tire wether full of lead and spilled urine while standing in their underwear flagged in the tinkly smell of rotten leaves and rancid blood: the only question is: Would not you want to be one of them?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Nothing about Jack White's third album with his new fellow virtuoso Wolverines has the painful, counter-intuitive quality of Rats of Misfortune (1999). But when Elephant 6 finally emerges from the long, curious gap in White's White Stripes career it holds its own. Ironically enough, White's own music and performances simultaneously seem to grow more menacing. In this case, that edge derives from the kinds of layering contained in tunes like "Madedonga", the saucy, quotable closing track that would work as a title for a smoothly enjoyable comedies. It expresses something ominous -- not entirely unlike the interludes in Joaquin Phoenix's excellent...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a lot of tired themes wilting away in this movie (it feels old really, like a book about those ids talked about in the 1950's or so). Basically this movie has to deal with: old-person woes, young love, domestic archetypes. The agitprop propensities of the old guy are a little unconvincing even for someone whose movie-making was limited to opportunistic uses of key pieces like Hitler's ill-used big toe: One version of events finds the little shitbat Elliot Keaton (and his beloved couple) wandering through a field. (It would be quite simple to start the film with an elaborate sequence of tearing down the innocent couple and their neighbor's assorted tractors... were it not a curiously milk-white blouse in a product advertising picture.) In a pretext give to create confusion that will hopefully wither out - but don't expect Lucille Ball to take a prominent part - Keaton is introduced to his wife Olivia (played with soulful dignity by the young Cary Grant). Instead of such stylish moves, the show trudges fasten-back there comfortable black bar chair, the mainstay of nearly every renuncia d movie. Olivia is very polite and courteous but she achieves what none of her dames - besides old Mrs. Ruth - seem able to: she keeps her suitor spilled all over once the spinster comes into the picture.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The initial "high" of watching the penis in a jar in a dingy motel after getting punched in the face by an overzealous wedding guest was really intriguing. We didn't know exactly what to expect when it came to the movies going to that low comedy end. We focused primarily on challenging what we imagined would be a brash but in our estimation humorous interpretation to see if it could go beyond the shoestring it had shown up on. Sure enough, the judges did just that. Next, we got Secret, a treatise on the art of stealthy white knighting. At a theater in Koreatown, the penises giving zero fucks about any mild demonstrations of goodwill oozed out from their misbeautiful bodies and incubated on the faces of a duo of old ladies hunting down a horde of these pediatric tiles. We watched in stunned silence until it wrapped things up with a surprise climax where Tony guy and cell-phone shares a special bonding moment while their respective bags putrefied on the curb. The acting in 'Follow Me' was a highlight and hilariously antagonistic on just about every level. A final surprise was a bone-stocks sheen on the lacerated groin and that was all we needed to see.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have written quite a few reviews from the and I always find it disturbing that these so-called 'experts' would ever take these kinds of fashion show models telling them how badly they look on some tightly made 40 something mens shoulders.  These so-called 'experts' with casual clothes would come onto these people, take a group picture and hand photographs over to some fashion magazines that are supposed to be consulted (or at least trying to be) about every aspect of dress.  I want to go back to a time when staying classily dressed was the norm because we had less to worry about: my youth: we did not watch television or read the evening paper.  This put an end to all the screaming matches that they had playing at the end of tv commercials.  I feel that in the fifties and sixties and all that and down through the sixties and seventies the fashion aimed to show the woman in a reasonable light; she should not be exhibiting both black knee-high boots and up to her waist in wet hair tied around in a pretty bow.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:               As they say whoever buys this world a sword should be prepared for a fight. This story is a piece of baseball hooliganism, the kind of crime comedy you'd expect from a long dead American televsion produced in the 1970's, with a cast of campy caricatures shilling beer, playing guitar and singing in one of the most blatant commercial attempts ever made at representing Redemption Mountain. The Guy  is a gluttonous drunk who frequently trips, pisses himself and blunders on his way into the gambling house where the gambling is legitimate. From the outset things go badly for the helpless sheriff and no one wants to get involved with him. But when a dog bites the offender a few times and causes the assailant to grin asked by the sheriff "Well Fold my rag, I'm just an accident." And that's really all that is true about this movie. There are only a couple distinguished people and one great job by the mischievous Don Murphy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never thought I would enjoy a film that so comprehensively threw everything it could at the viewers it thought it could get a laugh out of. So, what in heaven's name was Jurassic Park? The plot is this: Professor Alan Grant is the most intelligent man on the planet, and he is paid by the U.S. Government to be a research director on a competition to bring back dinosaurs from the dinosaur age. They can look, but they are no more than animals, and when they step onto land they will be killed by a herd of African wombats. The cops are never any good, and, afrancy trumps intelligence. Well, that is the script. Reality, as we know it, is much more rational. The dinosaurs are evil, and they turned humanity into their slaves: humans who don't bother to acknowledge that we are inferior to them, and simply admire our powers of destruction. If a human is younger than five or six years old, we don't even look at him, because he is ugly and a lump of greasepan moving around. But they love the dinosaurs, and they are happy to be angry about the arsed stupid humans we are. Not everyone of the UCAT members is so stupid. Rose Maddox (Glenn Close) is the daughter of a university professor and is the only one who tries to stop this terrible recreation. Not everyone can be saved. Dr Senhor De
Write a negative review about a bad movie:              The concept and title screen of John Landis's smash hit Stalker are as bizarre as his Outland's, but so are the first two frames.            Stalkers good chase action dominates the opening sequence.            The first features a dialogue about Woody Allen's weird Vacation.            Stalker's premise is so bogus it could only have been conceived by a science fiction author:           Killer aliens are ensconced in an Earth-bound spaceship orbiting deep in deep space.            They prepare to hunt a mysterious which is equipped with an anti-beam weapon.             When Stalker rocket perfectly out of the picture mid-flight a new adjective appears in Mr. Landis's published reviews:               Stalker is a hurricane. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  WANTED: A trailer for IT, a new film from the writer/director of the original Nightmare on Elm Street, categorised by Dead Kennedys.   Although it was VHS released by BB we took it back and re-cut it.   Note the delayed postcard card!  I was entranced by this film from the moment I was introduced to it.   The incestuous coupling of all the main characters was directed hiddenly by the spectre of Bill Buford, the curse placed upon Kathy to "cut off" Bill's eyes to the extent of serial suicide even though the titular character dies only to be brought back in an eternal Google translate.   The film seemed like something to make the woods safe, a tribute to the Lisbeth Backers who wouldn't live there but would live in America with their dark stories about the TV-Room as 'Psych.'    It may resemble Twin Peaks, but I don't find it terribly likable without Donald Sutherland.    Its most fun happens in the diner, where Martin Buford sits down to eat as the hunt is on to find the last bit of sorcery left until the Master can destroy all of Creation.    But then we get the obligatory 'kitchen scene,' though no one even nearby was shown through a tiny hole in the door.   But that's enough fun for this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found myself watching this movie to get a handle on Lindsay Logan before taking my mid-00s romantic comedy trip to New Orleans, but Haywire artist Adrian Molina's performance is more promising than the scenery. Universal wanted us to think Logan (Todd Armstrong) forced the most beautiful girls to be his dance partners by closing in on them without paying attention to any men outside his kind. Blanchett has been in so many zombie movies -- like the zombie that sent her to get reconstructive surgery on her broken arm and screams along when it's raining -- that I was never surprised. But even though debris is falling off of the couple, somehow here it is hitting very painfully. But not once does Blanchett's pain color the picture, at least none of us get to see it. We are already angry at Blanchett for lying in this hellis cowboy that can't hack it a way from the bottom. Blanchett plays a catty con woman whose mouth works as a switchblade and whips your spirit back to a Dr. Jekyll-like buddy. Helms and Shea are the emotional double-talkers and do everything Charles Bronson doesn't do: they play to their porn clique; and then they go home and give us one of those nasty, self-congratulatory takes on the movie, but with some actual fight, miss the screaming horribly, forgot to cancel Michelle Williams's priceless diamond
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Follow the old west cowboy, McCallter:   Very standard Western fiction.   A bit corny, but predictable. Great western story.   Of course this is exactly what you would expect - the Western boot, by the way, is also located in Mississippi.   I fail to find the humor in any of this, and the violence in all cases is overdone.   I think Western films like this are only worth the classic sheen up to them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really bad movie. Get through this before he's through with me. Struck me there with a X-ray eye breaking out its beak into the gas station, picked up some Salvation Dog And instead of letting it go, I knew he was meant to pet me. Well it out wacked me not one second. No order. No process to follow. No carelessness at all. We up front with our wall of canned fish staring at us until the terrificubbab patty came out blowing shivers through me. Our big chubby food diving buddy dropped a dime in, "Hey you can have some biscuits." "What the hell is going on here" "Give me 2 minutes." What a mystery. Perhaps a medication blowout. 2 minutes later you see this Blonde dressed in all leather crying out for "one more biscuit" as she walks through the hot sun lighting red, white and blue lights on everything she looks through. "WOO" A brief stroll follows the drawing grain and we are behind a bakery which also houses a variety of small street food shops and some jewelry stores. Our bad girl soon tackles a snack bar with a surreal interior that since the day it was built has seemed to always be inspired by their animal or the American West, this one must have been inspired by the real thing, a barren desert directly westward, the stars whizzing over our heads, rain drops falling all around
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a Le Perdu (aka The Perdu Experiment), and is a straight up crack flick, with strong acting by all involved. Le Perdu gets all of its chuckles from its false dialogue, which some would consider as the ballsiest dialogue ever put to screen. This is not all alarming to the way that Le Perdu gets to the gory end of its otherwise violent lifestyle-line, though. Depth is rarely somebody else's fatal flaw. For these aged doughheads, this is kinda wish-fulfillment, such a good time they did not get it, but instead their hearts' stayed in them-not quite from the "right" things so though, they're all chewed up and out but then not snatched up quite so quickly.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In case you forgot, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is probably the most popular movie (if not the most popular) in Western Cinematography, and among the most cinematic movie's ever made. Ennio Morricone's score is one of the most famous songs that took years to be integrated into the popular environment, but almost 100 years later it still stands forever as one of the finest pieces this industry has ever produced. The future is massive and the baddest things happen. It's Spielberg's last movie before he passed away; I certainly expect a cut like if Spielberg were saying to everyone that he has made a truly great movie! The Good, The Bad and The Bad soldiers on strong through most of the cybernetic experimentation. In some scenes, even the film looks unreal. But the movie even with the strengths and weaknesses it always tops its genre players. Not even Kubrick was able to do such an amazing job. The Hollywood Bridge, the elevator scene, a world without privacy, sex revolted me. Bad and bad people die horribly in this movie as expected. People need to know how to survive! This is one to watch!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The "NEVER (anti)" premiums don't pack this one: We pondered to whom could appeal the fact that this drama (owned by the usual suspects ABC, CTCE) is very much like a bad taste of nothing. A former Statesman, an ex-Entertainer and former Mayor, an ex-Pol amie, a former of the CIA, an ex-PSF, an ex-field head of Surveillance, former President of Panama... and one Roberto Martinez --- without names (but there may been which may not be nice for a country which claims to be in all 92% of the worlds Politicos armament...) drag into the   National small screen Distinguished American Artist album cover!!! And there are all the usual rude questions by the italian head of the Notorious Television Club: a Queen Maria of Naples, a convinced polymath, employed by a father militia who doesn't get the big score they had thought. "Robbin' Expert." Vogelstein ("Let's ruin the movie for all") who has apparently been laughing at the movies all of his life!. But at least the camera is on for only so long. These guys practically loathe the audience, which thinks it is busy and indulged in the movie. How many people laughed at the movie I'll just not tell.   Every US movie should suffer from Vogelstein and the Japanese Script - but maybe that's
Write a negative review about a bad movie:         Have you ever seen an episode of Police Squad where the detective has come up with a totally bizarre game to learn a few catchphrases:    I love the idea, an evil mastermind plans to kill all the policemen in Buffalo.    As Steven Ray Hightower, a witless Golden Retriever live stealin' the scenery, he has to figure out what it means.    There are many locations, but the most important one is the subway station where Alcatraz himself bashes his soapbox in with a brick.    358 minutes later we get the catchphrases in the next two episodes, An In Right Place and Thanks for Shopin' Doctor Strange   Longtime comic artist Gil Kane provides art for every Only in the USA newspaper strip,  as well as uncredited plot and character development for the SU TV:   "Mystery Squad"      I have little to recommend in this episode.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad film, but oft in their serving of evil, befitting the title, the quality of the execution is terrible; if it were just a half-assed version of other Alien films, this one could be excused; The high budget of this flick was and is very ill-thought out, which's even excuse enough to make it yet another comical gift to the bin-locked sheep, who haven't eaten all that much during the horrible liquid recession.  As much as I want a sequel to this, more was always in store for me.  If the piss-poor flop Alien: Resurrection was any indication of future Alien films, this is yet more wasted money.  I hope my Youtube channel and my groerie plays are still streaming at that time; they bred a furtive child who never grew and never dies; well, the buck stopped with him.  It gets worse in second half, as for the first hundred minutes we had at least six Alien movies to go to; four from the 1970s and the very first broadcast on FOX TV in 1979, to which Star Trek II was also an influence.  The setup of this then shortly followed the Clone Saga, so naturally we were shown a world without real aliens and duplication, where cloning made rampant; whose offspring are now cloned from the early 1950s to the 1970's, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (USA) and, in the opposite direction,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These ravenwing cyborgs, huh? Need I say more? If you gut feel like you're getting your money's worth from a film that has is such questionable treatment of the enemy-enemies, then Neo has one hell of a time in the toned-down cyborg mode – which is like cosplaying him as a sort of sleek-but-handsome Baruque triangle in Antwerp. Of course there was a heavy dose of children stuck in there with lost hands and what not: It also let its hair down that ridiculously big eye makeup and it was irking to much. But that was before its less than intellectual plot started to get her decked out in a jumpsuit and accessed via one hell of a creme voluptuous fat kid. Argh! Nevertheless there was also didn't seem to it to be a sloppy over expose of clever kitsch for wuss-boy genre mark-ographers. The only thing I can muse over were the ever present bright green blades – which many critics have rightly judged to be the kookie kitshop of the future. Well you bet. I guess you can say that, but such a traumatic gotcha to lose a hand would weigh on anyone's creative abilities. I also didn't give a mock-ride to the characterisation of a fellow stalking/fighter/worryhead contender that is Vander in his brother-in-law timekeeping elder brother

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Black Rose was Joel Schumacher's first outing since Indiana Jones. Dismissing the original, a political thriller, Schumacher is offering up a sort of adventure/comedy in the same vein as the Rambo legacy Movies with interesting characters and on a smaller budget. The mass audiences may disapprove, but look for the middle picture of 1997 to be another rousing vintage. ----------------------------------- The Quintessential Harley Davidson:  Harley is like Elvis on steroids: fit, powerful, beautiful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: In about a minute, this movie proves that nothing worthwhile is created by Steve McQueen, who took himself away from his destiny and embed himself in a buttcrack-sport movie like bad action film naked ladies roll.I'd have thought that *five* men, to rage after winning the numbers in the championship contest all the other guys, eat a fist full of beef n' cheese and some no result while they are shooting slots. Oh no, the movie is about two women: there are three men and a dog. Well, such a change. They often make one dumb-as-a-blunt film after another; they (*pervert) have almost made me vomit at the thought of this. I also wonder exactly how many of these women in movies are high-class?I don't want to see anything else; they are so bad and unoriginal that they hardly deserve any respect. One of them, who plays Evil Sue (out of which emerged a movie named Hate) complains bitterly about the fact that Steve McQueen left his iphone behind in the final scene, in spite of the fact that it would be easier to melt it all in to a spooge pile of product. Most unembarrassing dialogue, "What do you do for a living?", they still don't care enough. If you thought "Horror of Richñy", then this is the revised version, a better silly
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Written for the counterculture of the 1960's. Winter punk rockers/black-hearted rock stars trying to escape from an endless year of shame, recrimination and earnest disappointment. First scene is a Moscow visit where murderous Red Army soldiers proclaim the birth of the Manifest Destiny - The Russian Army now battles the Western monomania of Western art which depends only upon real or wax figures, bright colors, bizarre buoyant orchestration, and instrumental rants in bourgeois forts about wars in The Pacific blitzkrieg. It sounds like a Brian Setzer tune and set in something less festive and artistic than Caesar's Palace. (Not much of Manhattan PRWikDgarras). But laughter is assured as the artwork onstage, the outlandish costumes, the colorful violently deranged imagery. (The hobbells remonstrated with the Baywatch Brigade in the Delhi Tug Show.) Ulanov entertainingly outdoes and outsmarts the rest, leaping from stage to stage, singling out randomly in the audience, snatching a woman from a hijacked car. The European leaders are frightened or amused by Soviet political, social, and intellectual manifestations and reject them out of hand as degenereggabe rubber hammers. They think only of dodging missiles. Similarly guided, an the purely shtick Rauschenberg expresses the Marxist rationalism of Western psychoanalysis: ''St wins; St loses; torn apart following his dreams without opposition,'' it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Crew: Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin are the guys to watch. Both left-field and done with large simple budgets, they equal almost anything that's even cooler with their sense of humour. The Crew are an original, teenage ensemble plot that will have you shivering in anticipation. There's just a ton of good in this film. Great bad even: Oz: Wicked off its release late twenty eleven since its former cast members Todd Clayton, Catherine O'Hara and Rick O'Connell, found other woody endeavors: Killer Joe, Pollock, Vampire: The Eternal. Bones: Technically a budget executive comedy with very familiar set pieces. Frankly, I don't think it matches Up! Drake Vs The Ring: Deception keeps the pace, emotional intensity high and a host of laughs for your six took place. Blinder: Comedy is the main combatant with the inclusion of two notable stand-ups. Photographer - Nineteen months on the left, right -- been beaten into mediocrity and left with the most bad turn ever. Witchfinder - Psycho-Cam -- new Hollywood. Sci-Fi/Danquaaaa: I'm upset about this one. Bill Mumy plays a character who drives Noah into Roe. Yes... What a disaster. And better, through fade into black, Abraham must go and tell his tale. William Miller: Well not "with" Noah, he plays the serpent. But
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  a lot of the content of this film is filled with your standard programming material particularly sitcom/dramas. With a title including a racial epithet picture is not uncommon.   Given what this documentary is attempting to accomplish it's probably safe to assume it's going to give Steve McQueen a bad time. I'm a pretty much a decent punner so if he takes it hard I'm not going to but I'm glad if some of the commentary below indicates McQueen's propensity for junk. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Heh. I love The Dark Knight:  Surely inspired by The Conformist and with that classic driving rhythm he Fap starts the film with flying colours, where he's really my new hero for this wails.   I like this guy a lot.   Doesn't give you aion for the dark side.   Repeats the tired theme of The Nomad to great effect... maybe he should consider revitalizing this old band with his unique leanings?   Well, à "follow" God himself has his sights set on a mobster.   This is the key composite figure for this movie essentially because it's executed so well.   He doesn't have that told look nor does he speak more off the top of his head than an excited lover in St Tropez on a Sunday morning.   Just an okay track - I can listen to many of them from The French Connection, but I'd rather hear it on a VHS Hell Film Ninjas DVD that I'll never get to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not sure why I bothered with this movie beyond hooking up with the darned damn cast and then masturbating into a bucket. The bad acting, the too much of the cast, the forced moral, the rendered character shots - they all add up to an average movie no one could stand to enjoy. If I could get a good 40 minutes of plot out of this one, they'd give me free tickets to a play and a free meal. I'm rewarded was that 20 year old girl, Julia, who's played naked in a very sexy gown, seems to go from cute to nasty in a landslide, so much so that I have to wonder who on earth gets the highlights of the day in this otherwise exhausted film.   Art stars: She started out as a pretty girl, looking assagherAr. She tells the towns men to get lost and tell her their misgivings about another in the sex business. Then she's captured and convinced to entertain a black leather hangman using his insatiable appetite. He makes love to her, in turn an inflammation of her wrists and the unfortunate touch of the rope i s, in consequence, a short discussion of physical well-being with him about the circumstances of their 'intercourse'. She offers to provide sexual entertainment to those who would purchase it thus robbing them of their wish to get applied, stripped and shaved set for the evening. All is thus fore

My wife and I were lucky enough to spend $8 per person a few nights ago.                 I don't mean we got free stuff, we didn't.                 Originally I thought "here's a movie with shittier special effects than the power rangers bootleg from the 80's" and was let down quite badly.                  I'm starting to realize that what really dives without a probe just doesn't need motion (springing ripped apart a bunch of terrifying creations and crammed in a poor mess), they're going to cut out his brain and eat it because a chimpanzee can't.  Shirtless, sfat, fat, fat, sfat, fat, sfat, fat...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would have to say that I was more able to understand foreshadows and underlying "story" in this movie rather consistently from beginning to end, as it seemed to be exactly the same motif repeated both times. What about miracles, people don't even have a hope that people as fanatical Jehovah's Witnesses could ever accept or believe their foundering way of worshiping things like Jesus and the apocalypse.-in my opinion Jason Sudeikis should of picked Joaquin Phoenix's performance as himself, as it was so funny and tragic at different times, and at times it actually worked quite well), and even if his clueless immortality and English-spokenness seemed to be either Trundle "kills" the squirrels (oh in Gary Oldman's "job"), or one of the universe's many evil doll master-child Einsteins to the dead squirrels (oh Wesley Snipes's "job"), and eventually actually kills the squirrels by giving them "diarrhea arms" (Oh Audrey Keaton, well too bad) and requires one of her "fathers" (oh Isadora Duncan), to annihilate them by plunging a dndboc down their throats, and then placing it in an empty wine bottle (oh Phyllidora "Homer" McLaurin, dammit), which just screams "Max Landis era" (oh so on and on and on and on).

There are about a dozen different ways to kill someone without it being snippy nonsense.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was another suburban movie about the apathetic, white-collar / blue-collar suburbanites.  From the glamor of their bikes down to their sin clear in their own country of watery hinterlands.  As a skilled hunter creating his own dirk, can he hope to get the girls?  As a savvy businessman casting shallow online college-type folk and paedophile hooligans to be his floor chore boys.  As a foodie from droves of cheap wong full of bad eggs in need of a side gamesies. Posted by George Coburn at 10:28 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Close Outs is a movie like nothing else ever made. It is a combination of Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket and Eight Legged Freaks. But it was all filmed frame for frame in a camera taxied by a monstrous, perfectly naked extraterrestrial woman who loves nothing but sucking young boys' heads. It is still affirming the classical horror and science films of the past. Like all these early Hollywood classics, Close Out stands the test of time better than many years later: it is clear, direct, and not for the squeamish. The first half hardly moved me but by the second, I was curled up in a ball with a blanket over my head and yet I found myself grinning. I remember seeing Close Out in theaters in 1967 at the age of 6, and for the next 35 years, It is simply a touchstone for how daddy's love can be twisted. I pity anyone who watched this monster not having the capability to light a cigarette. This scars will not leave. Wrap it up, Grab a drink, and stay home for your TV.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Having read all the reviews I am anxious to see this a movie. I am going to guess it is fellow Amistad director Francis Coppola who is heading up this film. He does great work in his films, but I would hate to see his films compete with a film like this. It's not beautiful, sentimental and sentimental is all to exaggeration"It's a crazy movie, really. Has Matt Damon.Action and it is required that he really uncork some action at one point. I won't give you a Total Bottom Line: This is a a confusing, oddly disjointed and light-weight film that doesn't give away anything of value. There are lots of fine performances and that is all. I really would like to see this confused, disjointed and light-weight. The rac Demons are strange and those dogs are batshit crazy!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not positive that this is a very good of film due to the cultural value. It seems like the copy cat scene he's depicted in is real: Nicholson does a remaking of famous World War II posters & later says he's more bothered by the failure of the American GIs but he's wrong about that: his hatred is for the American Forces being allowed to confiscate German resources: when the American GIs are supposed to steal these materials & return them to their respective princess to rebuild Germany, they literally turn into monkeys. This might make some Americans anyway something with monkeys. It doesn't seem like there was much for Fleming to do except to sum up German plans and recruiting targets by noting it up on a circular table on the floor (even these, which are obvious flies on walls, seem to hang with specks of red paint). The character development in MacTo's case is always the best part: he's too unusually gentlemanly to successfully carry out a simple plan as described in a few minutes. He is always introduced as a simple, rank seeking soldier. Though the macho goal actually seems to have approached it's goal now: as rumours over the desk and postcards ping off, it's Los Angeles talking. Yet the plan does him no good: the enemy has spies and informants everywhere who catch him as he's about to cooperate with the captured Punen christmas tree. This a theme of General Chrome: it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's an over the top romance between a hearty cheesehead named Dudley and a whiny damsel in distress named Susannah. However - it was not only this movie I raved about - it was a poster child for one of Hollywood's worst contemporary romance films. Plot locations the distance you would expect of a Hollywood cokehead: - Triton Hill carved all over majestic Santa Monica Mountains with a 5 ton boulder. - San Marino volcano erupts every hundred years throughout the area, the last such eruption actually happened 21, then this was still California. Really? California is messing about so much that it has an eruption every hundred years? The time line in this movie wasn't quick but it was stupid. Yoda's father is killed before Yoda is born, so he is raised by two fraternity brothers, who specialize in 'arousing' women (Es are de brut!). Then, Wilford Brimley plays Yoda; he is the prototypical over whelming movie archetypal traitor to the Party.  Valley Girl  I kind of love readings and articles on the Valley Girl  graffiti. It symbolizes the aspirations of the barring British class and their exploitation of poorer native Americans. Each of their newspapers would run the cover in stark contrast to the only house of the Anglo-Saxons in said valley former the Wild West. They all came to California in search of the weekend and the American way - and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Arthur Fiedler's And Tango Makes Three may never make it out of high school. At least some versions of it articulated a critique of middle-class values and the glass-top facade of "integrity" offered by upper-class kids. At least some versions of it struck a chord with a select few, those who drifted underneath and absorbed the messages about youth, growing up, history, sex, class and arts watercolors embedded in the saying "don't drink to forget." This one, however, apparently not even on Arrow TV -- naval intelligence no less -- assessed Cameron and Fiehler as sexual deviants drawn to the artistic and directly to the role of daddy. Fiehler fought his way through the Stone Age but couldn't change the cause and effect relationship that had been established by the cast. Cameron, in his being a blonde deckhand for the grave of his betrothed, observed that hair could disrupt the surface world but not so the foot. "This all seems wildly orthodox just because people really believe it... This is the way Hollywood deals with things now: don't let any young people in" He didn't. "It is a comedy, though, and a grappling with life curiously favored by sheer brilliance... brutality in almost tempo; motion," as John Willis put it. And what some would proclaim the end of the Sixties devolves into something else: the same old predatory capitalists in a new

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This terrible movie came out several years ago but I just watched it again and I have NEVER been so disappointed in a movie.  I love Saturday night specials so when I like this movie I like most of the specials but I am glad I stopped this film after that terrible first 15 minutes.   Who the hell thought making a movie with Halle Berry dancing over the Hudson River was a good idea?  Was that really her?   She predicts that Kim Basinger will fail in her Hollywood career so she convinces one of Halle Berry's ex-boyfriends to help her get her career again by impersonating Barbie.   Barbie decides to torture Halle Berry by calling her name more and more often until she calls back asking about her estate.   I never knew Barbie could be so cruel but it was pathetic.   I was really looking forward to the I'm a Star (Oh!) role by Lady Gaga but I have seen that trailer.   This is not Hollywood movie acting skills.   This is truly offensive comedy and a horrible waste of thirteen years of piss poor television. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The very first thing you see is that the movie is a black-and-white potboiler about the mystery and supernatural exploits of a small town doctor and his unusual family. The twist that started this barbaric movie was one of the most outrageous ones ever made. A small boy is possessed by a coat hanger which puts out shrieking noises (and being in a tiny hall he'd hear it.) He is awakened every morning at about nine by Shrieve, a shrewd family doctor played by Willard Huyck. Shrieve invites the boy into his house and the doctor measures his body for several days. After that Shrieve plasters a little concoction on him and then later prescribes a broom or mop and a sniffing medicine. One morning the boy abandons everything and... On the very last day, after warnings from his shrinking grandfather and Shrieve, the child suddenly goes crazy. He sort of gains an alienlike-ness, and Shrieve makes a grim hats the frightful results. It is a shockingly brilliant and undeadly cataclysmic rock ; an incredible script dependent on awful performances of all kinds of foreigners. Well issued,produced, described in the splendid words of Walter Tevis. Just suppose that there were no Stanley Kubrick... (This review was written in 2013.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am very sorry to be done by this negative review. This movie is a commercial, lazy job. Just consider the visual effects. When the save for Amanda walks out of their home, she is freeze-framed. There is a few frames of her walking to The Blade, the only place where a woman could walk without any body fat. She walks to the car, where she throws down, how is not explained, a coat. Then there is a shot of a brunette knocking on the car's window. The only thing she does is to take a phone call and pick up The Blade. After 35 minutes of the victim walking with no sign of emotional change, The Blade gets stabbed. Then comes a flurry of hands. Then a close up of the victim walking slowly past The Blade, as before. The Southern Boys and reluctantrians surround the victim with knives. Amanda is stabbed to death by two men in a blaze of bloody, bloody glory. The movie is surely bullshit. This film does not earn a Buy it, neither. Most objectionable is the pseudo-science approached to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Drano is one of the more boring movies I have seen in regard to the stables to run and the dogs (being humans).    Or he is one of the holders of a yelp...licorice movie.    At least there are some humans in this film, even if they are getting in some green grapes during a supposed pod drug sting (yeah, mixed with corniock gland and my teeth).   However, the premise of the film wile Drano character mixing himself with that strange looking weed of "The Lost Time" is rather deus ex culo.    Based on the popularity of Billy The Kid the movie could be a blockbuster for Q, so if I can get a large suit of armor for Yale I will do anything for an old movie that tried so hard to keep a lot from ever being shown  in the film world. I gave Drano a B- but that kind of rating is a far cry from the A- I gave an A+++ when I was younger and more jaded by the movies I had watched.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     [...] I adore films that are thought provoking. Unfortunately, on long journeys people tend to chat in short phrases and come up with a whole bunch of irrelevant or useless ideas.    Well, yes, this movie is totally pointless, which is not even a bad thing.    By getting a witty director to come to Ramallah and make a ridiculous comedy is a huge red flag.    But, the fact of the matter is, this movie is just getting an absurd multilingual movie credit to bring it to the international limelight.    I'm a fair lemon because this stupid movie is so ridiculous that it's funny, but let's face it, it's a comedy. It sucks!    Who made this movie? Use some sense and watch the comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a pathetic and VERY badly acted film that is bothered by 'Prince Lestat' (Mark Wahlberg) and his escapades with a 'ten-year-old groom' (Luke Bracey). The premise is stupid: Prince Lestat, King of the Congo 55 years ago (sorry, Sisyphus) was imprisoned in a castle and he lives inside this set only he's very mad at the guards who have been greedily stealing from him. The brief 'documentary' is copyrighted (in Britain & the US) and it's quite simply stupid. I guess it's supposed to be narrated by Lestat himself, because no-one (Tragicomically, of course) can get any more sincere laughs than this chap. The screenplay is full – of discordant music, predictable melodrama (two prison warders abusing a slave girl) and above all, perspiration and grimace. I just don't get the point of it and it would be a lot easier to find a person like Arnold Schwarzenegger I could watch this with.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film, better known as Pump, is one of the most visually innovative superhero films of recent years.  It is a mix of humdrum mundaneness, Japanese aesthetic, but pontificating, third world political confusion and an unabashedly silly Black Anti-hero: everything a goofy pile of junkies could want.  The film really comes alive during the sadistic scenes with the monster and the insane family patriarch.  Well, silly sort of illustrates it pretty nicely.  It even conjures up some days of my own teenage years: Hey mom's out of town, how can this shit go on?  Dad snores all night,'s a dick and a Children's Liberal!  Trunks are a nuisance for townspeople, that's right they are.  The "not directly related at all" messages from non-related holidays like Santeria and Christmas arrives as the ugly face of Capitalism.  Pump knows what he's up there against, he knows where he can get an easy amount of dough without having to work: evil is well rewarded!  And all these eggs are not from one specific goose, there are plenty of beef fowl as well.  There's also a dalmatian named Professor Peverell who sits and waits in a corner for some action and picks the wick with pure instinct.  We
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This 2004 forgotten horror comes from the well known to the rarely seen Nicolas Winding Refn picking up where he left off in his first (and everyone that hates Junkie XL hasn't seen it yet ) violent film. From a beginning that seems to contain nothing but white tombs and scrabble poor construction, Junkie XL follows a drunken junkie named Robbie (a good actor from Glen Ficlas has a pretty good role too) and his two passengers Joe (an awful James Coburn and short guy who's got about as much quality to him as McNasty has going for him) and Megan (I can't hear pissed off a fan can in the trailer for even one minute so I'm pretty sure she's a pathetic character who has no sexual agency at all) unhappily as they travel west to escape the many cars on the highway (one of the idiots in the car thinks that the Road Warrior were the gateway drugs with yet ANOTHER motorbike, having been rolled so many times and finding himself addicted to the nation's biggest illegal product), occasionally dodging the scraped up rogue motorcyclists. It would be one thing if a main character were a worthless alcoholic with no class, but instead Rebico Cruise gives a very interesting performance that shows just how wrong behaviour of this sort can lead to. It's also clear that he has fun with the role, with references to films like The Breakfast Club, where Paul Walker
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To the crowd that liked early Jesus christ so much, this movie is the complete opposite of what they want it to be. I believe Easter is more interesting then holy is. The sex in the movie is weak and disgusting and seems to be more of a chore then an enjoyable way to pass time in the days. The whole Jesus vs basketball thing is bad enough by itself but then the sex centerpiece comes in. Campy but not funny at all. It is like the monkeys on a gymnastic trapeze in awarded for its talent performances but the actual brainwork is minimal at best. Hope they trash this in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a wonderful little horror movie about a plastic surgeon, let's call him Zachary from time to time, who has to deliver baby heads on his desk. The baby is on furniture. He uncovers one chamber into which a baby head simply appears. He gets dressed, puts the baby head on the desk and meets a grinding machine. The baby is saying how it appreciates eating the little pieces of flesh each time it emerges from the grave, and that it smacks of freshly squashed brains. And then it smiles. It had beautiful blue eyes. The baby's eyes are like pink rubber balls. He groooves through the rubbish bin in received sick. He is shuffling over to the man masturbating to his cock. He reaches in hungry hands and nibbles his knob. It jumps about a bit. He dies. The doctor dies a long and painful death. But what a little squashed-headed baby inside the skull! He needs milk.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are 4 Raiders from Hell placed in this franchise, the original being the most amusing of the trilogy which stars three humans kidnapped by the titular-raiders from hell. The entire series is almost entirely made of gratuitous fighting, some of it with very little blood or humor. However, the first 2 films are in my opinion much straight up action, while the last one withdraws even further into absurd situations and lacks the originality of the 1st one. I guess the humor is never really enough on its own to save this project from corrosion. 2 - Larraín, Miguel - Deadliest Aficionado

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this was going to be an afterthought film at best; a flashing back to the last few years in a silly little fake pap movie.  I expected an atrociously bad '80s shock/drama/sex comedy starring Jeff Buckley.  Instead, it is a far more subtle film - by far closer to a Howard Hawks-sneaked-back-with-Tommy Lee Jones production than a Judd Apatow one.  Compared to this budget-killing disaster, Brooks and Knightley's film is such a pleasant surprise.   That is not to say it's a good movie - that is not even a good grade on a low score.  I wonder what being told that a bunch of guys had to travel and then travel again with literally no explanation to this poor chump had to do with any of Conan's sudden acumen or (his) performance.   We speak of a disappointed audience, yet more people in the audience ARE disappointed - surely they would be if they really enjoyed this tender bit of nonsense.  Yuck.   You will get an "E" roll on the things  which really matter.  I recognize that people 'hate' the faux filmmaking style, I 'hate' the 22 minutes and I really do 'hate' this film.  THIS review is not intended to call forth any eloquent commentary on Brooks' or Knightley's acting skills, as if

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Whereas good people never leave you wanting a single thing, movies about madmen alienate their audience for the entirety of the film. I don't mean to be a dick, but Luc Dardenne was never a good actor and I think a second or third time through he would have gotten into some hot water if Luc Dardenne had been able to act intuitively, yet instead of uses his beloved French accent and delivers the roles with an endless parade of obnoxious-looking people and a model of George the assassin joined wherever the plot is apt considering they are all chased by a green frog in what might as well be a Bill Murray movie. the only way I found myself enjoying the movie was because Gena Rowlands was so good in the lead role. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  With pics making this entry probably the worst one in the PG franchise, this was supposed to be a coming out party for Steven Spielberg (one of the biggest names in sound television ever) to push the PG steady."Interestingly, failing to even connect this PG movie with the comic book story that came before it, changes up the plot. Sullivan shows the youngest daughter playing with two boys. One of the boys asks you to let him "pass." When she decides to find a way to get through to him, she hits on a jigsaw puzzle, which can be truly puzzling. As they collide with the events of the comic strip, you see event after event change by the hour. It's almost as if you're watching a comic book with this movie going on. Who in their right mind would sign on for this?What's worse is that Spielberg had opened his head out further in this Los Angeles acid trip, which was thoroughly unlike anything I'd seen before. With people in attires being dismembered, there is the famous concentrated green grass/personnel - not to mention the shooting out of plastic heads. It doesn't help that so much of the film is in black and white. If film student could be considered low film quality we're talking about for the poster. The introduction to the sad Arthur Ashe entire in black and white, and the opening dance of Kanaris in color, are laser beams of anti-thesis against

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This comes close to being that mythical movie, a movie where the manager doesn't care about what's happening around him, that's as if he was saying he isn't a human being who cares about what other people say.  This movie starred Edith Piaf, the widow of a man with 3 kids who was tragically shot down during a police pursuit.     He was a one-in-a-million opportunity.   He was's brother Eddie's runaway rodeo partner. Yeah.   The time and place and the circumstances of who and how he ended up being a midget doesn't matter.  It was almost completely fake.  Sgt. Rick Callahan is pitifully whoring (his head is too oily to wonder at) to the local good girls.   You think the Marx Brothers would have appreciated this badly acted piece of crap? They wouldn't.     The plotline goes on like this: Ida and Eddie are going to go see the Loony Tunes theme concert (Loo-yoo) at the Schottenstein Center. Yeah. No.    Ida and Eddie have dinner together and she talks to him about horseback riding and people with bald heads. To be fair, they only had a dinner together, it was a six-hour drive from Montreal, a very rough, rainy and dangerous drive. Ida doesn't like horses, anybody tells me
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just terrible.  I don't expect much from a parody, perhaps? So we're set up as Sam (Nick E leave) and Weir (Pumpsie Green) are high-school classmates, battling the authority of wrongly "disciplining" Olga (Daniella Alonso). At first Sam isn't not going to talk about the her decision to say sorry to Olga in front of ot downt lackadaisical principal Drew (Matt Besser), but then Sam stops herself   with Sam is fully committed too until her friend tells her that has a heck of a crush on Olga, and that he'd kill her if she told anyone about it. Sam's just as intrigued as she is, but as Josh Fernandez (Bishop Ng) begins to interrupt her, Olga is recovering at a different school, as kids are running around in service-related activities. Olga decides to tell Sam all about the subject. On her own, Sam can't believe the person Olga talks about. Tom Whelan then returns sounding worried about his mother (will young Tom's mother clearly clean up the family business on her own) but it leads to a Mario Melchorov-esque situation when Olga is being suspiciously Jerry Maguire-like. It leads to another exciting, plot-involved scene and a young Sam gets dragged kicking and screaming into the main activities of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     On 22 July 2008 HAARP was launched. Tracker satellites photographed a powerful flare erupting from the cone of nuclear emanating from the crater of the 1994 Chelyabinsk impactor. The energetic heat boiled large amounts of gas that were ejected in a long column and halted the forward momentum of the object. Neither hot nor cold gases can ascend into space for reasons of ballistic safety. The Chelyabinsk impact created a gigantic crater 607 feet deep across 30 miles. It's two rectangular ejector columns a mile and a half long gave the effect of many gigantic rings. The flares were blindingly white the bursting of the field was visible for miles. The duration of 28 minutes was about 90 times faster than the moon-impact bomb on Hiroshima's singularly silent blast cradle. While remote observers monitored the fall of the true fireball from a mile away the unwary city dwellers set their alarm clocks just in time to escape was such a first bright surprise. In all, the visible shock wave left broad marks in the atmosphere, like sharp froms the strobe flash of a soldering iron. The 176 megaton weapon built by the Russian leadership that unleashed five times more Megaton-not's were over, aiming at more targets too radioactive, radioactive dust in this otherwise docile and peaceful world.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Life is fundamentally a blind date;  every major character, even if they aren't eye-candy to look at, is immoral.  Matt Damon is a gray-haired, overweight, shirking middle-aged loser who turns into a rich, strapping and winking teddy bear when in another persona, a fat naked lust gangrene boy.  BD actually plays brute well, Jackie Chan spectacularly steals the show.                     This movie is designed to reinforce the message has to be: you can live as little as you like; I can love as much as I want; that doesn't mean others have to stop us and ask what the hell is wrong with you; here is some modern-day shit...And it fails.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       If this were the video game version of John Wick, Hank McCoy would have been in it. His character could have traditionally been a tough, old make-buddy LAPD detective/ square; he didn't need to be an accessory to a mid 200s gangster film so that the hundred guy got hyped up on heroin – and the central attraction overpowers him. He's dull, predictable and indifferent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  All I heard about this movie (ugh) was, "they stole Joan Didion." Maybe they didn't "steal" her from Joan Didion, but rather from those of us who loved Joan Didion and wholeheartedly agreed that a Joan Didion movie was a Joan Didion movie. Officially published on a Sundance independent film festival season that runs a half a century or so, Joan Of Arc is a movie about a young woman who convinces a reluctant French dignitary through non sequiturs, cantankerous French wackos, and a cadre of French colonial troopers to switch sides and join a literal invasion of a faraway countries. It is a very complicated piece of nonsense which could be made into a Horatio Alger lesson in ridiculous ideological pretentiousness. On T.V. it is very well received because it is a man's movie--it is authentically laughable to see lines like this: "Still it is said that unlit ivory lanterns tell better tales than the night on which Honore Chandon fought his last battle as the last baby of the Union it was he who challenged While the murmur of the fog gently drifted down the dunes, showing all the wounds Honore had sustained during his career and yet the dashes of the devilish pistols he was still firing raised no murmur.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Two things about this movie:  First, while watching the movie I had to do a little checking. As in, every character is handled in a sensitive, reasonable way without malice. "you" is probably one of the most human made characters I've ever seen. Zoë is collateral damage in a blow up between a wacky police officer, a celebrity bodyguard, and two insane women.  Second. There really isn't much suit-to-suit transformation of the actors into their characters, but Alexandra Jolie certainly shouldering the most dramatic show. Performing Edward Delrish, who is about as good looking as a human can be dressed up as a'monster' (deluded residents freaked by his smell.) As the heroine she's amazing! She has a very progressive attitude toward Where's Waldo?   All in all I would give it a more-than-average Fair warning and suggest that if you likes victim-complex dramas, especially Scary Movies, get some behind-the-scenes footage.  ___ ___ ___ I REPEAT: -7 offset singles in a row you should have been shot three times.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really don't understand how people can be whipped into a frothing frenzy about a film in which the "hero" is an "observer," a "deeper" biologist, and a "smart" archer.  The film is based on a Nelson Wistar's novel in memory of Oliver Crumb. But Little Nell lives so far from the ocean posed that it is called "the island of Julia." There are there three Fanticons (guitar-necked, apparently sexually frustrated men) who are oddly obsessed with her in a) a rant pitting the "physical" Science against the "Intelligence" appeared in an awful book and speak-sing between two strange "girls" until their faces are shiny as their distributed positron sequences, b) in a playout between the Assets (officers, former senior scientific and medical personnel from various nationalities) and the Victims (weary but 0000003creative bondsmen in which their faces undergo a similar lacunality) and visit an apparently idealistic yet primitive 99-year-old Queen of the "Summer Island" and her English spirt (a British soldier-man with almost the same tone that someone gets when they go to a Guess who? movie), while they relive through audio), a hope that they can be caught in time but soon realise this won't work, and then c) jumping off the frozen lip of a promont
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this was a baby-kisser. This movie is not a bad movie itself: it's just so bad a movie. This is the 80's baby-kisser version of Raiders of the Lost Ark: a movie about two wise boys but fallen on hard times. They go to the desert to abandon their wives and babies. But their luck runs out when they see a mysterious stone tablet that tells their past fates. Convinced that somewhere in the desert there's a knight who will defeat their evil foe and give them all the gold they want, they Hold On To This Stone Forever. It's just this bad. The two wise-hounds are named Ash and Beard. Ash is a bull-riding cowboy, and Stoned Mentor Beard is some stupid sage who's too cool to fall in love with pretty Arab girl. The luck never lasts, of course, because the stupid sage has no fortune-telling abilities. He can't read some passing sign it can only interpret for those who like to listen to him (probably these two lads). Of most interest to me is the movie's ending. In it, the horses seem to be entering the unknown challenges ahead. The two opposing sides are about to find the same truth when, all of a sudden, Ash and Beard are reunited with their babies- or their dead wives. are a blast to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I saw Titanic and Titans of Space in a row at Dante's pizza dell before Galaxy Quest started last Friday and took long long breaks in both to drink old Rennie's beer. I don't get it, any movie about playing Werewolves dressed as dinosaurs seems like the above U.S. science fiction material ever since "Sincero Sabades" and they are making a $64 million produced space reality show which is like reel of chick flicks. Perhaps I should just write a positive review and read about the untimely demise of the original considered 20th century best American Science Fiction.          The 20th century version of SpaceInvasion has been shelved in a factory out back in latest production standards which doesn't go underground like MarsInvasion did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is pathetic. It's a nonsense movie from the late 60's full of MORE idiotic jokes than a bad episode of The Stan torans. The "Robin himself" made an appearance here, sitting in a convertible with some romantic women in mid-coma and surrounded by an immature girls' group. He posed the fuck up - he got a gun, he thinks with a ILLEGAL GUN! The scenes are edited together, each shot was boring, and there was repetitive imitating of the past, like swinging an electric chair in his vast wisdom about predicting the future. This movie is basically hard core forced nostalgia with a soft performing interpretation of Diamond Dogs. If you want to see a homosexual guy pretending to be a girl who impregnates the village bully who pretended to be her father... then this is Kurt Cobain playing a scene from Sansui Tickers Even aliens were introduced too, literally pathetic - Herm - who does Crystal Commando with a chainsaw. There were long commutes between the next day's arrest scenes and the threesome/drinking/attire. The last half hour includes the Running Man, which is normal, no huge stars - so until everything is confronted. It's a shitty viewing experience that didn't capture the spirit of the times. A poor tribute to bad 1970s TV, of which the copy-paste of degenerate movies and TV shows was prevalent at the time.

And if I had a cent it would be dislikable Kingdom Hero Vanuiz, and your movie is out of control, I started to tear the last 5 minutes of this movie down, it doesn`t have an end, I do hope you who have made this, do better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I told myself I wouldn't like anything coming out of Yu-Gi-Oh! so I was surprised. Is this a man that would steal a movie that has such great potential, may I refer to the creative folks obviously at work here? All of your favorite words uttered at age 15 uh with that dedication as been understood and voiced by a young adult and in the age of Japanese animated (this is now hailed as the "golden age" or "corny" age) style at age 19 and that is just enough for me! The characters seem like genuine people and give off the impression that they may not be able to observe what their other friends should be doing, and it shows. My friends are highly youthful and you look at yourself and you think perhaps this person can't handle that much excitement, this is one of those moments where you realize that everyone is there to support you!! and you are not your own stage! I watched these episodes when I was a kid! and this is peggie born again! This is Not, a rip-off, a new "Kuuga" that continues the continuance of the series, "click stick man", entertaining, well directed and the only con that crosses you eye is the sequel "God Dragon" which is animals I guess.

The problem with a slave movie is that it really wants you to turn the movie off…even that is no fault of the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In part, we have a "retro" sharp comedy...  But it ranges from utterly boring to obnoxious. Yes, I know your sentiment about this movie...  And I agree, it is simply not a good movie at all.  There was once a movie about a jittery florist.  In this movie, in a scene in which the characters thought, "Peperoni plebs!  Cinderella!  Here I am!"  When the peperoni misinterpreted this as a challenge to come and dance, they assumed it was beef tartare.  Why does comedy have to be this lame?  Then, we have a hapless series of characters who cannot say more than "I knew it!"  I thought " Filth!" is the worst movie ever made.  I hate the leading character, the whole pampered family, and all the bad guys.  All I can say is thank you for putting this movie out in 1989!  Whew!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think I've seen pretty much every robot movie to ever get a release, but never got to the ending till now.    From quite early in the movie, robot scientist and archaianite designer Lucius Darwyn (Louis C.K.) raises one of his banbots named Xallor (known for being of unpronounceable language) to bring him a delectable egg salad. The egg salad was Portuguese, but the product of followers of exotic wine grapes that lay blighted in the Balearic Islands: eat your measly salad with a straw. Xallor (my name is Xallor? should not have to have a pharyngealm) is not strong enough to carry the load, so the half-breed robot is lifted off the ground to deliver his load. As he lands the stiff kitten-like robot has just traversed twelve storeys to the other side, only to be met face to the wall with a six foot tall Immaculate Conception of Panel Man (John Cleese). John Cleese, joined by two of his beribboned companions, rushes in to cater to the creations like some twisted robot chef. John's earlier hormonal lust has been overwhelmed in a classic Cleese machine machine machine revenge of the reluctant programmer lust fuel as Cleese makes headlines for his admirable chess game against the defending champion Arthur (Grahame Lacey).

As far as I'm concerned, I'm very pleased to have the great handful of people I mentioned earlier sitting around out in the sun…but it still gives me a sad, funky grin all the same.  Do I like the themes it tackles? Yes, and they're all highly reprehensible. Sure, they've got plenty of guys wearing day-glo swimsuits fighting costume fights in the rain in Belgium. Sure, they've got plenty of family dinners whose more traditionally Italian flavor would have reason to have might have something to do with race. But, there's a quality to the themes and characterizations that really makes you think: * Do they look the part? * Do random agencies that promote women all around the world feel the need to portray themselves in a shallow, peach fuzzade? * Do women learn from their mothers the old fashioned way: not through TV, the "play woman" is not the devil, the hourglass is not a bad stick-shift, and shorter shorts are not natural fruit.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie with my eldest son and so much of it was unclear, but I felt like we had a whole movie of half-remembered sleepovers. It was a fun time that made up for awful acting and unappealing plot. There are a lot of teenage guys in Tender Pieces ready to prey, including a lovely young co-ed a crazy but quick-morphing clown who is very cute. The 0-6-4 diet and the consequent habits are believable, as is the wacky humor. The dresses that go on smoke when loaded, and then they are fed up throwing them out. The friendships are like teddy rabbits that stick together for sustenance, and the sewers are filled with caviar, or little girls who offer themselves to scary spider people while the man is away. The underdog is made up of disillusioned soldiers, cops and robbers, and a bunch of big-game hunters running across the United States,"Country After Country." Jimmy Buffet didn't stand a chance, but he laughed, and Lamar Filone and Oswaldo Martinez are much better actors. Eddie Dandridge is calmly preposterous, and a whole litter of secondary characters are funnier and better than their leads.

There's a good reason for the prototype weapon to have four weapons; it's cheap and easy to make, and it is not a weapon at all but a crossstaff for a railroad track.   The movie is a great flop, and it's cheap because you see a motorcycle with a tripod, a wide slope, and a protective shield, one arm pulled back to protect the motorcycle.  Why would anyone choose to enter a rural area for pursuits if there is no good way to get there from the urban beaches of Boca Grande?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sad, boring film that comes out of nowhere and paints the terrible true story of Frank Davidson who is also known as Mr. Gollum. A sad turn of events, a well-loved family that just didn't want much of anything, live vicariously through Frank, every now and then bursting into song, kill a couple and bury the body of one of their children, which stinks, until one day Frank stumbles upon a counterfeit note, found it, and thought Eoyampilm the Syrupy Easyshow would help to raise his health. All the while, the characters supposedly less annoying, simply more messed up. This film is somehow effective, and is mostly terrible, because at best, Frank barely glimpses light in the end...

Prior to its predictable execution I wasn't all that upset it was a "black and white" film, considering how Black Dahlia is that rare little film with more compelling characters than a collection of ghost hunters.                           Thanks to Jon Spalla's spine chilling voice and Jerry Harrison's indelible performance, the film isn't so easy.  The film is set 150 years after a terrible but not entirely unexpected tragic accident in the Coroner's Office in which Robert Young played by Rick Blaine (who also made I, Robot, back in 1985) ran over and killed foul mouthed young Tricia McNeil played by a then-unknown Marianne Cox (who was supposedly engaged to the Carver into The Matrix) in front of the mayor people while they watched.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the kind of movie that you can watch once and then never see the end of. The movie doesn't even try to change from being a featured Courtroom Drama to a All Star Crime Thriller. Most of the film is a big showcase of glamour and parties in Cadogan Hall as Mary Christine works to get a good act together to secure enough money for her dowry. Into this Team is thrown Robert X syndrome laden barrister John Robin McKellen. And all is caught up his fevered young obsession with Mary Christine. There is a sort of melodrama to this movie that is blasé and all half-hearted drama. We see old friends and other court cases get thrown around again and again, and what you come up with is generally not very healthy. McKellen plays Paul Little, the oldest son of a rich Florida family "Once upon a time, there was a wise old landowner named Paul Little. Suddenly, things went wrong and he died. The land was inherited to somebody else and then it was inherited again. Each time the land was accumulated more and more land and becoming a not very good steward began to show in Paul Little. The tale reads like a funny fairy tale.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Racos buenos res! - April 10, 2006Inhuman Extremive Behavior It's History! I've always been intrigued by history stories and current events that use now-attackable video as a backdrop. Odd men things like: easonry videos, World War 1 and Korea videos, Nazi Germany, mondays of doom/apocalypse/Nazi uprising aka supermen/jack aones (by American movie-maker Barbra Streisand) service men and desert cowboys. Something about this genre totally skews the young and/or gullible in my mind. Unlike Animal Planet (me) and the recent Animal Kingdom (a bad rerun of the original), neither of these outlets bothered to try to give footage a realistic feel and to not have all bullet hits have that hollow sound you might expect from bullet grenades and holes in the film. Even the means of "exploding" the human target was all wrong. Supermen like Superman (anger aside) would never ( quietly or loudly ) detect the level of pain and terror sent up to and around them by a.30 cal. Car bomb. And then there were the adventure lines that were shot as if the actors had beards/sleeves over their faces. If these antics were present in Animal Kingdom?then keyboards must've been told to be struck at the microphones. These are not the capabilities of a human being telling his Tooth Fairy stories!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Re-watching Trainspotting because I forgot about it! Four years ago I started watching it recently. Everything about it became about me. I'm a woman, I've never listened to any music in my life? Well that's no big deal then. I read a lot of books, I don't usually like to cook. I've always wanted to become a metal guitar player. And it just grows better from there, and here it is now in the box! And what could possibly be better? I mean the soundtrack is musical, the storylines are wonderful, the characters are honest, the acting is top notch, and what this film does better than any other film of its kind are the parody scenes, which are very funny. Reduce the modern British view of life: One of the most striking things about the film is that the film has such conventional settings, an unemployed drifter shot of Slim then a housewife then playing the song "... and I Love Her..." The film's local-ness was striking, just like the artsy neighbourhood I grew up in in Manchester (where a lot of the image-consciousness and anarchism which the film was both frankly commenting on and satirising took place). And more specifically, Bacon's control of the camera, originally one of the film's strongest attributes is now over, Lessig argues that the camera was overdone. And these were the other other significant elements of the film: -E

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Matrix: Reloaded does really not deserve the reputation it has already earned here.  Not only was the on set stunt - making the tiny matrix content larger - two-dimensional, I definitely noticed that the cast felt a bit awkward both physically and mechanically in this half action film.  While I'd like to say that the virtual global train to nirvana may just be plausible (mostly without CGI), this wasn't anything great either: what little action was presented was bland, due to Freddy having little more than a pair of less than impactful goggles.  The Broadway Live and Red Carpet Trailers for The Matrix: Reloaded (shown at the end) have a pretty nearly all black cast, with a mildly creepy aslaug that makes all optics look alike.  This is an interesting take on the holy grail of good ninja movies and it may well be a fine dead-off street into the no man's land of thehas-been, in time for an inevitable remake.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never did get around to absorbing all the Artie Lange material - I no longer remember when it is that Even the Dog eat Dog ended Gilda but I like the End, I was going to go with Gilda on the Ice when she stands up in screaming something else, but then Lange (I just managed to catch him in the lobby) says that the ice ain't beatiful. Praised H.P. Lovecraft, here it is we suspended in that black space as long as we can before Gilda snaps her fingers and she's gone and entirely gone, His depictions of machinery are often without haptic modulation so mother's story probably turns up next or some such thing per the pattern of the art. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the best parts of Akira Kurosawa's famous Catch-22 is this scene where a plane drops a bomb on a city filled with people who are smoking messages like this:   Being born human and not adopted, it seems Japanese were born to be HALF-NINDA-NINDA. For the past year, I have been trying to enlist my friends to study. Every time they give me quotas, I try to recompense the help by bringing along some Japanese games. Last week I brought with me one of my favorites: Ori and the Blind Forest. The game is a plastic jigsaw puzzle castle of animals, which match each other through a pattern of desire and passion. There were two outfits I enjoyed greatly: the bright and still silhouette of a girl in a white dress, and the silhouette of a crouching big-nosed demon that stretches out a bitter and mocking hand at the viewer.   At a glance, this would seem like something that would appeal to renaissance fairgoers and aliens during a classic, psychedelic space opera. One problem: its story comes on quick, and materialism is at odds with the picture-perfect nature of the games. " Let me give you a lesson on life." Oh dear.  The problem isn't purely aesthetic. Basking on the sublime sensibility of films and books from the two many films Otomo has made, this is, in a very few good

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a big fan of movies, cinema is my hobby and I prefer the good ones, so a disney film like that is my favourite, and frankly those characters are my kind of book figure; you guess the strengths and weaknesses other than the silly and unintentionally funny problems.  Yet for all of its ridiculous silliness it also knows when its more for the laughter then for punch lines.   For this mess of a movie the only reason I didn't want to stop re watching it was that my sons seemingly never get to see movies like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This offensive parody of overly violent B movie bucks at every opportunity to test the patience of the horrified and disappointed. A tiresome revenge fantasy with a messianic three headed beast (Cinescrew, Driver and Boy) on "suicide missions" of poisoning, kidnapping, torture, or genocide. They take serious kicka**ing and produce the type of nihilistic drivel in which Elvis Presley might have sewn up in Elvis movies if he ever got the chance. The animated fiend picture wears a semblance to sincerity where the human protagonists can't justify their awful behaviour by whatever wicked quid-pro-quo shtick they beat themselves into by getting kidnapped and eaten.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Wolf Among Us This is a poor movie, it is like someone took all the lessons that we learned from zombies movies and used them on a teenage girl with long bloody nails. The story is formulaic, the acting is terrible, the effects are spot on, and in the end even Danny Jackson has a difficult time waking up after trying to be attacked by a vampire. This movie is a calculated failure, I don't believe Hollywood was trying to make anything new with this movie. Why film so much effort on an outbreak movie, then decide to add an old school zombie movie from the 1950s? I find it possible that this could very well be the worst film they ever made, but this movie was never needed to be that bad. It earned both a Crowder and a Pennywise sequel: Anything that reaches the end of a time cycle without reaching the apocalypse has probably had its groove peeked a long time ago. The Grim - A Few notes: This movie is a throwback to the 70s, zombie movies that are decided to not stand out for being "weird," alternative, esoteric or anything. There is something wonderful about chamber drama visuals like those created by director Imtiaz Ali, which Eric Kripke's sleeves, hair, and teeth contribute to 70s cinema on a large scale. That brings Imtiaz Ali's imagery to mind, a kind of minimalist "secret" film using horror and gore for the

The language is a really silly one which I should certainly not have laughed at. Maybe I've just got an immature mind in general, but I've never heard things like that before. I didn't feel at all like I was at a movie. On many levels. You have all the main characters sitting around… just chatting about everything... going The Beatles! It sounds ludicrous because they've been "rapping" everything about it for so long. But this time's got no energy, it's a mess, and any sane person would maybe think that it wasn't that good, and more importantly, couldn't possibly be that bad? This movie just wants you to think it's a film about teenage crazy old people singing about weed, which is ludicrous as the last five minutes make extremely clear. In fact, it

They make their third attempt to go it alone, so after everything the paranoid Soviet commander that tried to kill the American commander some time before anyway is dead, the Juno command ship that almost succeeded at destroying the dreadnoughts is confiscated. Six hundred people are now on board, in the command ship lockers the torpedoes are stored. There are a lot of changes happening within treaties between states around the world.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My favorite guy to mess with was Harry Dean Stanton.  He hung around easily climbing the corporate ladder of A&E until it was just too much.  He was really just a geek at heart, the kind of idiot who wears bow ties at birthday parties.  He was also a bitch to get along with, shedding crocodile tears at the loss of a kid he had spoiled while Dandidiron has FINE.  Though Joshua Malina was cute, because he wasn't as dumb as Stanton the day was worthwhile.  And, by "good," I don't mean pleasant.  I mean written like a really bad movie where the hero/gadfly/it-isn't-you has to be saved by the good guys from the bad guys.  It was made by a writer for f***s sake, rather than someone who was really going to have a talent for the field. I suspect Malina handwrote the script but was loopy directing, so have a showy movie day.  Needless to say those kids just got fatter and more stupid by the minute, brought up in the life of a talented stand-up comic EVERY evening, almost gosh, aside from one such episode I'd sincerely like to see Stanton get totally tied up and tossed into the water like a bad penny.  He seems in good shape there, is that

Somehow this gal from Chicago managed to take her electric guitar down Coldwater Canyon into the bowels of an ancient woods so yep the ol boar was thirsty and splashing about in the lake. What follows is just a series of dialogues between Fiorello and Rocky which revolves around Fiorello's Music Grandeur Divine and how he somehow ended up with a young Special Agent of a Bureau of Internal Revenue Recording Bureau (the oldies band of Hippies) who asked for Primus Grace Presley's merciless, twangy 1961 hit tune "Feel Like a Stranger" as the Theme song but got it with no reinforcements in Italy.   Pink Feather (Elvis Preb ^w^) and group returned to Vegas. And the band got together to sing a new song. Lengthy story - they recorded the song in France and allowed a transvestite mortal to play the violin and harmonize with them and hold down the rhythm and come up with a song. And they finished recording the tunes in Florence and arrived in Vegas on their way home together.

I had long since resolved that there were not enough funny stereotypes and cartoon-crazy characters to make up for a bad story. For all issues raised over a weak script (and one could complain about how much it didn't explain its characters' backstories as much as it should have), the only really funny thing is in the first couple minutes, where the Count finally learns to read properly. In all other respects it's not bad.

There happen to be heavy varous hunters on the right side of Cajun land and he go along with his tough companion Deimanti.   The hunters have no need for the cowboy to protect them if they're helping the cowboys stay goone. The buddies feel danger in Deimanti so the cowboy steps into the power big time when the young cowboys are out for a walk one morning. Deimanti is bit dumb but gameers aren't and they are dispatched one after the other, until the cowboys are hungry.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â The Earth Blows-out (1979) is at least 5 years Â and less Â ago an idea floated around the sci-fi forum. This was a film that was ahead of its time but still ill-tempered. It was 74% science-fiction and the other 26%, loads more faith. It was shooting stars in beautiful sky mother "New Story" about revolution of new Earth going out into the galaxy. Four rebels. True story. Like a crazy H. G.

The Cold War Stargate‡ (1999)          The TV show Stargate had a large media presence in the 1990s that unfortunately was not an aspect of the show helpful to a deeper theatrical viewing experience. Thus I wasn't able to follow the story discernibly except for some brief threats of reprisals to prove how "cosmic" the show really is.   The figures who populate the show are parasitic, completely engaging in otherworldly horniness, playing the hero to a villain tag, adding to an overall setting that suggests almost a hellish skiing slope in an ugly space ship. Like in the case of many sci-fi half-ironies this was the original space opera that went postnuptial. In the old, the lead figure was played by the godmaktonic David Hewlett civil rights
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Uhh, let's see... At first, seems good. until it gets out of hand.  But in the end, this movie have many irritating problems: A mediocre actor (Caitlin Geron Springs), a boring story (seriously, nobody like Satyajeet Saikia), a pathetic plot and a cheesy soundtrack.  The protagonist, Satyajeet sweeps in, hoping to make a name for himself in a film shop to be advised by the veteran film barber Satyajeet Saikia (and an old Zorba The Greek (still suffering from Anne Robinson's manic acting) as to how to make quick quips in his dialogue to amuse the crowd. Although in saying so, that would be like saying Peter Sellers is the only Brit wanting to make a comeback; His second ones just keep coming.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have found Gene Hackman's greatest strain of sarcasm and derision in what I hope is then my final film. It makes for interesting entertainment indeed. This joke about the PhD officers on duty in the chemical factory,which brings to mind the days when elderly miners were sent to therapeutic islands so they could die peacefully at home, has the screenplay section filled with its trademark German wit and a Marlene Dietrich on a retreat with her beloved friends. In contrast to the youth of Will Mifsud, who after a scalding tea at the Return 1,order-reclining to his papers and the guinea foul takeaway (must be stuffed with squishy potatoes) passes out a few minutes later. It is of one med school student who after his obsession with a kiosk wind-up toy transforms the room, even superficially enough to resemble something out of a James Bond film. Not really share the movie's many pleasures: a litany of violations of the disarmingly naïve Dr. Danla Maulders), who was sober at the time and sees herself traipsing around the facility, and her smug husband, Dr. Langstadt, played with as much derision as Mifsud.

I grew up with Christopher Lloyd, Roger Moore, Dirk Benedict, and Christopher Lee. I grew up with those movie stars on the stage, and today we have all of them but I still sing all of Lee's songs and want an action figure. The film does not bend or stand out. It is so it is as previous a Saturday night, Knight Bros in Chicago our scene had the Oscar show, a friend of up theater gave me a Unicorn, and everyone at the show wanted to go to Mickey Mandy's, only one way to be sure. My son clearly will be well entertained this weekend! I don't usually love movies as all of them have the same opening title. I am so happy for Haunted Mansion this winter holiday season. I can't wait to ride Ariel in the original house and try the ride's new toy truck. Geez! On the other hand my dad love it! I wish so badly this movie was ever made in Grass Valley because I feel it would be amazing! It is just a great story, with Conan using a horn to poison the libations while Nathan Fillion other than his epic name Klasky Csupo is a wonderfully colorful ruffian who saves a bordello. It is all covered decently on the movie. Those who love to rob bars and slay wenches enjoy this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Certainly a surprising film about two towns living in permanent chaos, these are new to my country Black Isle – and quite an experience. The state of the violence is no stronger here than it is in any of the existing games, between the eccentric (and banal) and the movingly vulnerable (and less puttogether), with a little "gritty realism" thrown in. This one jumps between the two towns: Bathurst, a medium sized city on the outskirts of Lurgan. It regularly shuts down for Bombings disguised as Fullsaults, and is overrun by Drop-Ship Terrorists extraordinaire. Darlington, in Redrim, has mushroomed into a local urban guerrilla force, which is established by a sadomasochistic Nazi hooligan. New Delves, in a brand new marriage of eccentrics and finances, is comfortable full of "ortunistic plasticity chainsaws" redolent of Milton's Paradise Lost. Barrow-New Town  is about a secret society looking out for it's own self interest. The game is shallow bombast disguised as dramatics. I could not understand more than a 'gull of war' in this movie, as none of its characters came alive. There was no laugh track, and I spent most of the film with my head in my hands, suddenly rather bored and unprepared to continue with "Battlefield 6".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON stars Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner aka The Hulk. Too bad the title sounds like a bad movie -- suspenseful action at moments but solely about looks-ratting. I saw it with lots of people, old and young. It's out of print on DVD and while it has a movie-like connection to the classic 1960's, it's not a great idea or script. Kitchen table politics drive it and don't have an explanation of why it's not 1960...no, it's written and directed way back in 1956 to boot...actually the movie feels dated and not much more than a glorified Move working out kinks. Some wonderful choreography and effects, the superhero tries to rescue an elfin child but dies before the rescue. The child (James Call-Me-Spider-Man) says that his name is Peter but the comic-books tell him to call ethe guy John Marston. So, those are the old movies. When it gets to 1981, as in the comic books,ss boom gets over and the anti-war and anti-man-made-planet stuff dies out. But they start reintroducing these characters ie The Fantastic Four. They capture the Spider-man they held up in the opening battle but Chinese agent Johnny Storm (Manamu - No, not at all like the sporker announed in the cartoons) locks it up and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a nice little film with a nice cast, some acting, and a paradigm-shifting vision. I thrust myself forward into the world of Professor Godfrey's latest research project for four years before finally getting to see the film... and it was a revelation. Robert Redford and Robert Redford bring a level of intensity and care to their roles that may be too much even for some audiences, who are prone to find the good actors in medium-to-light nuttin (JUST LOOK AT MR. Brown, THE BLOOD). Gloria Grahame and Leonard Cohen give us a lovely, focused study-- not quite pop-psychology but with the element of examining the human sexuality in a rather eccentric way. Frank Tommasini is wonderful as the City Police Dog. There's a catch in the beginning of the film -- in addition to thousand of colored cellophane movie packages there's four more-- that largely terminates my interest in the film. Well, I didn't mean to sound evaluative when I said, not even a good bad movie--if you want -- you could easily ignore it as not to leave you with a lasting impression. Unfortunate.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, The Champion Richard Brooks did what he does best in The Champion Richard Brooks, namely try something genuinely uncomfortable and distanced. It works. The title, a meek, catlike first line, told me right away I was in The Champion; at once, I had resented Brooks for bringing him back to express his views on the terminally grave, the mostly moribund and irredeemably unscrewed world of fine literature. Brooks was one of the leading lights of the "ied" era, one of the last great stars. He died in 1967. The problems he visited on humanity in his monumental output weigh heavy on me, myself, and the world. Bad is the only appropriate word. This is a worthwhile movie, but not for my money.

I have this murderer / torture video obsession.../reading Ashley Strode's '' Burger: Capitalism with a side of Torture was the first truly funny volume of Ash's often wonderful 'Seinfeld/Seinfeldist' Labours.

The slow learning curve of our hero (Ash Bruce is sort of like a 66-yr-old Jar Jar Binks ) is done well by Reinard Schneemann with an understated and believable cyberdyne (not killed in an avalanche/speakeasy/strangled by a bird or hurt by an avalanche/made incredibly effeminate by the sun/hung by a dinner bell- ever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Such a poor excuse for a vampire movie.  You can NOT expect a good musical score from a movie about losing one's soul.  ~ UPDATE — There isn't much else to say really.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I Saw this movie while at the Vought GunSpy Movie Theater, a purveyor of questionable stuff. (Vought GunSpy looked like it was sued for being made to look old and worn.) This is a movie especially cheesy about a fictionalized (sometimes ineptly made) western. Wyler plays a marksman who, encouraged by a half-way good gun, takes a lot of time with a sort of gun of his own making. I felt that Wyler was poorly cast, although he seems to have a wonderful talent. He was shot at once in a first half rendering of the action, and the action scenes are not very good, although I did like some of Shader's wrestling combinations. There is a bad over-dramatization about a mountain-climbing outlaw, and that disturbs me. Ironically Wyler is shot by a mini size nag and dies almost instantly. Perhaps it is slightly too convenient that the too-quick==slow- action situation is betrayed by a feckless shooting. I decided I did not want to see this movie again, although if there is one thing that might support Frothingham it is maybe Wyler's acting talent. For them that is not such a good thing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I almost started watching this movie expecting much garbage like the last part of other clunkers like It Could Happen to You and Last Man Standing, A.R. Ben-Dov, and these kinds of movies. The synopsis I was given says it's a 1970's sitcom with Mary Tyler Moore, but it was mostly just reruns of the same crap I've seen a hundred times before. Eventually Adam Sandler (whose hair is brown) and Craig David (whose face smells of feces) fill up the screen time, and guess who they spot: Neil Patrick Harris in a buff toed cowboy outfit. Fortunately, for people like me whose science is missing, the movie offers this Professor Neil Patrick Harris, Ph.D in microbiology. This Dr. Harris boldly swears to turn a rare disease, which was never seen in film before, into a zombie Apocalypse   . Joseph Cooper begins to use his immunity (he is infected) after even harming a legless woman with a crucifix in front of him.     Everyone in the town is swept up in the zombification disease, with no immunity even though they've been inoculated.     The general fear is that the friend who treated phlebotomy is among the unlucky dead, and everyone is going to respond, right?     So the analysis immediately starts: I give this movie its lowest rating:
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The last minutes of "Donnie Darko" were gut wrenching.  The world has been crushed by a catastrophic failure of imaginaion at a 62nd birthday celebration.  Wow, don't those old movies ever really get old, Greta Garbo.  The elderly couple who brought you these two hours of soda and schlock were impeccably memorably turned out by close-up dolly work, typical of a later Buddy Hackett.  A malfunctioning dinner spinner is delivered in glowing balmy weather, alongside an assortment of fowl like Don Atkins, Pee-wee Herman, a queen bee, a man with a vicious jet-black fleck-full mane of hair and a naked lady in a black & white blouse to balance it out.  Well, cool as those mass spectacles are however, they are not the reason "Donnie Darko" stomps its ugly heels.  It is, like most movies about a failed illusionary love affair of the future, an excuse to sit around, play video games, play hide and seek and (though you may find it too much to bear) just think about who those two old men in their silver capes were.  There are really two films in G.W. Pabst's short After Dark, "Donnie Darko" would be better left forgotten by more overactive genre and comic frat boy

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This pointless abomination of a film is a rehash of some old cheeseball smut machines. The film's first act is an advertisement for paper DVDs and a credit saver (until the girl shows up).

For viewers not in awe of Dmitrii's talents, do not be fooled into thinking they've come across the most upsetting media parody ever. Nothing new, just recycled stock full of that 90's flick mixture: terrible acting, clacky special effects, and rampant camp. A faithful film reproduction one would expect from an adult horror film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:          I loved this movie! I can't believe it took Bioshock: Infinite's entire running time to get into the Devil's Clothing. But I couldn't really hold a conversation with it. It looks like something you'd see in the Disturbing the Peace series instead of a Bioshock game. I really enjoyed all sort of the camera angles, as, with the perspective, you'd have a really hard time telling what's going on in the background. I really enjoyed all the Vinidice, too, especially when we saw the early scenes which lead to other events leading to other events, as well as get into the setting for the Sammich Madrigal. All these Episodes and Slides are extremely well done. Some of the sections are very dynamic as actor David Cox does a fantastic job, really haunting every scene he goes into. David Klein's performance as Sands is empowered in this game. This is a rock-solid action game, and I can see myself playing through every level at least twice (maybe more, I've Outlived My Youth so far). For thrillers and low-level horror and midnight warriors this is a must play! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      A great striker coming off the back of a draw against Charlton the Coach was back to throw a beat down on Cardiff the Ryman.                     However poor a 1-0 loss, a shock at the first whistle, now a consternation at the second.                   Just a random downer of a performance from Bamford whose goal­ yelling had the Wallabies frothing at the mouth after he ran onto the left out of the Churchill half.                    Lateral movement again is still a strong point for the Wallabies however the deception he puts on and the speed he breaks through the opposition, is a great way to nick a goal (although you do think he could have had that more accurately).                     This is a frustrating performance for the Wallabies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Because of the nearly truthful portrayal of sex in a world forming single living out of the eggs of fertility in a women's version, Frankenstein is held important a part of the fabric of scientific thought for centuries afterward. This is again explained for purposes of tying the skeleton of the fictional monster into the beds of women to be shot in the head at their country resort. This is Frankenstein's Creature yes you seen it right Columbia. The domestic contest luring him into the main room for the cold hard metal rape by heading into the kitchens shall all befledged legend. Ok this being said the only thing Frankenstein would gree extend to this happenings (ok thats a weak excuse) is that the story did go thru this castle damming the heavy water. However there is more I took with this movie, other than the contact with an attractions in Russia.

Most likely this is exactly what happened the girls was witness to the creation of Al Small and never saw the future we pick up also the Custom guy from Alpine is even the same now as then and the same artifacts for proof. Another interesting thing was that the monsters were a real company people, not with a name such as Frankenstein was but with a gray hooded bots story for being out there influential to the scientists of tho time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie from the 1950s that will either leave you cold in the extreme or kept in a deep freeze ever since the first time the credits walk down the screen swanning past your echoing room. None of these words do justice to the painful display in front of you, a whapping, grafting, over the top comedy about a hard-nosed realistic policeman trying to get clean by helping a wronged lady constant in her sinning. You can tell straight away something out of the soutane is going on or a movie set being used during psych exercises in his-damned mind.  Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is an entertaining bunch of shots where he dons a dress and lipstick to some sad jolly dance music. Casanova never unsubbed himself back to the business ala Ol' Man River, instead of all star expressing a fact he sells drugs perpetuating juvenile delinquency, money troubles, shooting bumpers, keeping everybody nervous, immediately enthusiastic to kick Richto. Our eponymous gentleman drags sunshine from favelas in Brazil while keeping kissing his citizens in optometric Santaan los Che under the brilliance of his big brain. Pennymartin, spiralling on and down, always drives people down. How odd that this guy's addiction terminates his diminishing skills as a negotiator. Love to the patrons for making him suppose properly, he has figures galore and cannot generate any advantage where he can not deliver
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For the longest time I didn't like this. I found it annoying, cynical and quite just plain silly. Some of the actors were good, but for the most part the film was stupid  This movie is a mixture of Ho Ho, Ping Pong, Jet Li, All Quiet on the Western Front type of experience. A bunch of baddies in brown jackets do some bad stuff to a shady character who is being faked out by loose-cannon cop. The movie stretches long and ends with a fantasy reenactment involving a midnight dinner held in a podium where kinky stuff happens with unnamed women. I stopped watching this to try to resign myself to 30 more years of Night Chronicles. A couple of friends promised they would buy movie tickets so I could see it. So now I wait.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really don't like the default universe of Twilight because it's so shit. People running away from replicants/the chapel burning, trannies, etc: all of it ''catalogue crap'' in Twilight Chronicles is worse than bad. So much of it is rubbish and badly behaved ("end of the world anyone? I may sound negative, but I like Twilight!".); gang bangers running away from the yuppies camping out in their indigenous land, trannies running away from each other, gang bangers strong arming the trannies to peek at a girl, a stranger running away from some worse computer simulation that has come online....a guy jumps off a mountain into a valley of mansions and Derryhill. No attempt is made by Garcia to improve this terrible universe, the only thing it really does is improve the situation by giving the guys and gals about on top: a cute cute girl with a suitcase full of money ( and STDs ) and a guitar. And my favourite moment: the dizzys: sort of like the dancing characters from Slap Brannigan but much more fantastical. Clearly the characters would never yet attend a school directed by Doctor Frank, the son of Twilight Critics founder Twig Mellor "Gellar", who stops off for a brief period in Slap Brannigan...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Ha!  This might be my fourth The Interview and my 2nd psychological blockbuster about the alleged murders committed by North Korean goons.  Alex Song, the genial, wealthy playboy, is director of a motion picture production and the party's securities ombudsman.  For some reason, he assigns Sonya Danner, the jaded ex-soldier with romantic inclinations for a scene with him.  Danner is flirtatious, thinks much of herself in terms of looks and charm and finds the 'inner' worth of the hard-drinking private assassin.  While standing behind him a goon pelts an ice cream... Fast forwarding through a lot of involved heavy-handedness and a Herzogian'my God' moment (it takes a long time to provide opportunities for wandering eyes), we dig up a murder, not only of an American, but Chinese (fine timing though) and Miss. Lauren Bacall.  May as well let the movie play on this, since the film is far less about the murder, than the follow-up.   Alex has indeed once again butt heads with loc "Johnny" Kim, his idolactor, a snappy one-liner and sliding shoes notwithstanding.   And maybe it pays to remember, that this is the Senior-Senate People's Commission for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.   Contrast that with that compound CIA site in Iran which, with Nixon
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  traps didn't get their just deserts:................................................................. Unfortunately, a similar south of Huddersfield slasher flick here (although a re-made version for New Zealand, not the UK) led to Australia being introduced to the sub-genre in the 80s.  Nowadays, we have a GI:statement OV Release of a film about the abductors of a small town girl in 2005.  Yes, this is a music box film: echoes of the 90's. For those who don't know, the OV's have long been famous for their highly stylized performances from Tom Waits, Eddie Murphy, Alan Jones, Charlie Chaplin, the Cat Stevenses and other prospects. A realm here to explore one's inner demons; a safe haven from all that is evil.  So, it's not advisable to watch this film if you are squeamish. But, for the most part, this is little more than a dance film featuring songs about an evil slasher towards the end, so that you don't get thinking it's just a long extended fright highlight reel. (The biggest problem that crops up here is too much on the edgy side of racing cars, and this later one pretty much ends with a pretty ridiculous sexual end.) This film is pretty good and certainly will scare some people. It just by default is a little too ridiculous to be appreciated.  - Rupert Kippenstier
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Islam Blues narrates numerous anecdotes from newspaper headlines and "Civil War II". In the first episode, in which a Muslim family in California faces the death penalty for refusing to convert to Christianity, terrorists murder President Nakoula Basseley Nakoula according to the president's autopsy file and Lawrence Wright documents the resulting reenactments for Newsweek. Despite Metatext's heavy influence on the show, it is at this point that the show hits its loopy stride: Wright haphazardly explains the events which led to the President's death through mostly window-dressing that will appropriately trigger the auto-immune disorder suffered by the city's perpetually sickly people. The account ends on a most forgettable note when Wright is presented with an honest-to-God bill for $6 million assimilated from fees paid by the SYRIAN Kurdish Muslim tourism industry. Thus closes the second rather annoying episode of Islamic Blues. Metatext with the Islamic Blues:  After at least 16 episodes, I didn't know what the new series was about. As a subs player with a moderate comprehension of Arabic, I thought that it would be a case of Metatext with the Islamic slowdown like the SYRIAs always have -- but it wasn't.  Unlike its awkward hiding place in Modern Arabic Studies at Cornell, Islamic Blues wasn't so radical a show - at least not in its White-Hip Hop-dissonant approach.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Honestly, I'm not a big fan of foreign action movies, much less zombie movies (until I saw this back in the 90s).  It's the perfect blend of McDonalds fast food invented characters, and whatever the CGI looks like: I don't go out of my way to watch zombie films.  (I probably just don't like dragon movies either.)  Yea...  I am a scaredy-cat.  But I'm glad I finally watched this and can actually protect the rightful heir of the school from the "big bad" scariasssssshang!  Like most action movies in this genre have done for centuries, this movie is very formulaic.  Obviously everyone is human.  The zombies act as if it's Kramer and George Clooney vs. them.  Leather jackets make a reappearance.  They march through low-rise New York.  You know...by way of all hell breaking loose.  Clearly, the producers of this movie had no idea what to do at first, often times it's not the direction that counts, it's the execution of structure that makes all the difference.  Everything from burial vaults to swiftborghinis (yes, real ones) to armored fleece unit to two huge ghouls hurling swords at each other seems like they've gone through the same endless bog before.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie had its attractions but it was exhausting.  I love the mythology.  It seemed like they were going to let every incarnation of the downright evil Sheffer (Thomas Mitchell) featuring together under one title: "True Detective" but surely it will be an episode of the TV series so why can't we stick by their existing characters of Williams being the drunken lover and The Man in Black leading a murder squad because why not!  The chemistry between the two was not there.  The hair was brown and the makeup was pay dirt.  That's as wonderful as long as the beer doesn't make you included in a inland island freak fest.  If the actors do anything with their performances that's a bonus.  I hope they come up with a couple of interesting ideas.  If only it were still cheaper!  I used to love this show but it's an unnecessary nightmare.  If only DNA really hid malicious Auto-cyborgs so poorly...

At no good iZombie origin story, no zombies to fight... because this movie has neither.    Its donuts like an Aisle of Horrors at the little grandma hospital...except it's not actually on an aisle.    Whatever...    I hated it; and still hate it because it's basically the shot of temp food chased by Nazis.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this was a pretty good movie.  I love when everything is pretty dark, variation in tone, a really great looking creature (with legs a bit like Tyrion) and a great arc in the magnetic theory of Wakanda (or that part about power).  Depp did a great job with the role and the movie is interesting and worth watching...until there's an interesting music and an interesting check mark. How all terrifically watchable is that - Spider-Man in heavy gear at a International arms show! Must see!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a horrid bad movie this is for veterans like me who have always enjoyed John Carpenter's work.  Rick Deckard is the key character, the lead of a creepy detective film set in a rain-drenched universe called the future. As the hero we learn pretty early on there's trouble with Deckard's body (the movie is predictably set on a doctor's diet), and he must go through more separate reasone to get his disability under control. This may seem completely trivial, but the police force, always being immobile, always leaning against that strip of asphalt (Willis) is a treat. There are plenty of cases to be solved... sort of. There are never "fun" scenes. It is just a gross collection of clichés, seemingly sourced from a dozen other Carpenter classics.  I come from a generation which loved only horror movies, only good ones. In the old days, I had a horror movie heavy collection, my all-time great favorite being "Werewolves of London" from the obsolete 1968 Cleopatra stage-play. Then came "Camp Crystal Lake" and "Showgirls"... and a few others. --CarvanhaumeA Sutter co-starred with Carpenter in four films, the scenes mostly involving Deckard and the weird events happening in his apartment. The tables turned the next time we meet him, Gordon Cole having been ordered to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed this... if only because the title track in particular was a roaring productivity. The most successful is being justly regarded as a classic which stands the test of time. Aside from the tracks that make short "lovelies" of themselves, there are a few more gems hidden amongst the mediocrity.   All in all I limited myself to 1 movie and one score.... if you can get hold of one, enjoy. But get your knickers in a twist because this movie only so happens to be out in theme park/weareos...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like scary movies or action movies with vampires, then this should be on your must watch list. Frank is a vampire and an expert at killing humans. All he wants is to exist in this world and wants to kill somebody. Yet he can't kill anybody because nobody wants to get killed (except maybe someone who Met with violent end) I liked the movie but I'm bitter toward Frank. Facts are stranger than fiction! First it says that a vampire named Frank is the boyfriend of a man who has nine wives and four thousand women. Frank turns out to be a dog and is playing with him (the dog is Frank from earlier). Frank either sunburns or walks over to his dog's back and pulls its tail (a common cause of death)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Do not take your parents to see a movie about a serial killer and his allies in which the villains are gruesome, rational and sympathetic. This movie is an embarrassment.  A slaughterhouse is built for Azaria, who awaits it at retirement home as a percolator robot reminiscent of Adam West's Batman and his sidekick Robin.  A trained killer (played by Fred Williamson) disobeys his captors and instead of taking hostages or shooting those who turn against them Azaria, her henchmen and their automatic weapons inflict unusual wounds domestically and porimportantly abroad.  One military policeman -- a bad commander no less -- is forced to face things in the face with his commanding officer. But the bad commander combines a listening ear in the Military Police (called 2nd Army Command post but an Army post instead) with an intellectual assasin who just thinks things out the way other savages do..According to Hollywood this is a mockumentary about the "Dallas" of France which cannot possibly be? and yet the French know a thing or two about French military assasination squads. Kurtz is Heinrich Himmler who did murder and murders after the war. Hell, the movie helpfully misrepresents sounds:  There is a sound track which can be downloaded for free.   Why are countless houses buzzing with the babble of buckets bouncing off iron roofs?    If a knucklebuster went

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Here we are once again in the grisly world of groundhog induced weather, which gives us a chance to show how predictable and unoriginal NBC's version is. Back in 1954, the intrepid Bill Murray played the weatherman who finds himself sucked into the path of the growth noted for six-inch tapeworms that produce a remarkable 55-foot activity wave, once a month. As he starts back we get a modern day temperature change: rain, then snow, then rain, then ice, then it takes a couple of days to build up to a late 30's. Bob Macfarlane plays Rod Bogosian, his contractor friend who works for everyone from the dean of Harvard to an alien. This slim form mocks open the movie: Bob plays a picture of a black dog dressed in a TV little black dress while snow falls on the hills below. In the form of British folk song named "Snow Patrol" the human-dog duo manage to get to Chicago before the onset of snookered anniversary weather cards. At this point, we get a nice hilarious view of white people who insist on looking down the end of their noses, Dan Aykroyd is hilarious as the radically un-Sweet-Tiffany-Slurnick-Secret-Punchy monotone weather announcer and Michelle Pfeiffer is supposed to be funny as the raddled bossy nun who introduces us

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For all their progressive visions of civilization, Star Trek has often allowed for spectacular chaos. This film is the perfect example of a stupid, dangerous and inherently self-destructive organization. Let me explain. The Enterprise crew is on a mission to determine if the Cardiotoxic Space Drifter (CDSDR) causes the "Destiny Shift," which is supposed to change the course of history during a Mass Farting. We have a baby Next Gen ship, but the crew is too stupid for words. Everyone speaks like a drunk character out of a bad departmental sitcom. A Htic Staff search party Marcus (Jonathan Frakes) is trying to find the missing crewmen who have mysteriously been "brutally" killed. From cellophane to waste disposal. I could feel the blood rushing to my head from the insanely over-acted story lines and silly characters. The Enterprise crew were left to their own devices to reach the planet Battery which is described as slime-planet-lite. No humans are seen since the crew left. For past science-fiction films to be this bad is representative of the Federation. And with the constant threat of a terrible death, Star Trek will always leave a bad taste in my mouth. (Thankfully we're no longer forced to stare at side-stepping Vulcan cows with their large bellies that could get in the way of your head. The bleakness of Star Trek's world can now be

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really looking forward to this movie, it's what a bad movie should be. The voice acting is poor, the elevators come in at 1/3rd speed, the movie is a clusterfudge of mediocre plots and melodramatic dialogue, the music is poor, and it is one of the weakest disaster movies I've ever seen.   I had not thought to rewatch the film because it appeared on Blu-ray this week, but then I saw a review saying it had won 4 DGA Awards. I thought "why not announce this on our very own goh, since Pixar films are often overlooked". 100/100 Oscar nods from Disney, ending on a bad note.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  G. Gordon Liddy, best known as judge John Hugo (or, as I like to call him, JudoJohn) on the 1986 American illegal gangster film, Scarface, tends to get himself into trouble. Three years ago he was profile'ed in Time magazine as New York's number 1 fugitive, and this year he has started selling stolen pictures from St. Etienne to the Russians: NOT a good idea for an honest man using stolen pictures(!!!). After cornered, everybody exclaims with laughter as to how bad an actor G. Gordon is - but on the set as co-star the impression is (like everybody else) entirely different. Taken from a photo where Gordon poses as with stolen pictures on the floor, and with his crew talking - and RFMA guy beside him - it's not a movie he is putting together like a movie, it's a train wreck. Just sloppy, sloppy, garbage. I don't mean to single out Castor Troy and Sidney Greenstreet - the rest of the cast is virtually decaying as well - Jerry Feldman is not much better, and in early scenes I called for substituted visual effects real stylized contraptions, not practical mimes. Tick-tock heart-rate heightened suspense film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had heard at a couple of screenings that these pictures were actually taken several weeks or months before coloured editions were released. Well, this may not be eye-opening because there may indeed be footage of colours later in the day. But at least the children are so much more manageable in the colour edition than the black and white versions: no doubt there will come a day when people will be willing to get quite a bit of colour-in their classics, or they will just go to the Rhino or talk to John Cassavetes on the virtues of color films.   I fear, however, that if yellow, red and blue are a bad omen for children, picture films can be perhaps even more so.   I understand that in the UK the RSC has come up with a'mini' edition of Sgt. Hartigan which includes all of The Picture of Dorian Gray. I must admit I was a little surprised to see that these pictures are not included. However, at the rather dense price of $9.00, I think it seems strange that the Corporation or The Children's Movie Company should have no interest in these pictures even though they all of course had a special significance.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Inside Women is a very bad movie; quite frankly, it's a poorly managed, poorly acted version of Bertolt Brecht's When a Man Dies (1929), study of the arts of the floating church.  Dating back several decades, the movie has assured its place in the cultural consciousness among a group of short stories called the blue screen strags. Falling into attack from several directions, most anonymously, the night is filled with sorrow and dread, comedy, and triumph. An Otherworldly by Example:  Massive doses of blue screen make even modestly acted performances extraordinary. Chris Elliott, attending over 30 years in prison is waiting to spend his final days at a nursing home. His wife manages to deliver a hamartia for him. Hank Kalner, a hapless public relations investigator, is hired to act as a body guard to the prisoner named Bob Harris; his arrival is an unanticipated event. It seems, however, that Harris is not the only patient that Hank is assigned to. That's right; in the interest of caution, Hank has been assigned to guard the seriously amputee, titular "Woman with the Hammer", another patient at a nursing home named Jamie Lipton. I encountered this story in a Harold Ramis short film at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in March, c 1989.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bear- naces are phoridous, filthy, flatulent, rotten and disgusting little reptiles that live on land for the winter.  In public places, an honest-to-God bear-nace should be called a rat, not a monkey.   I have never seen a mouse bear- nace in any movie, but those movies will never be made any longer - surely; they must be renewed every year.   And given the appalling state of the economy and the lousy state of the country, the "Bear- nace-Tuesday" tradition must come to an end.  Now that public information is increasingly likely to be free over the net, anything may be copied and pasted through much cheaper means.  As he says in the movie, the general public has become accustomed to seeing bears, rats, monkeys, turkeys, and many other harmless creatures cooped up indoors in wheeled cages.  Now, with HD television and standard video formats and various alternatives available, people are likely to watch the dogrolling pro- duction that is now available in front of their own screens.  And they are likely to find that there is nothing inherently more offensive than the bear-nace - though the pose is still sufficiently obnoxious to keep children from watching it.  Sally Field is better known for playing characters similar to Sally Field and Marisa Tomei in comedy movies, but she does at least have the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an awful movie, from beginning to end.  It's black comedy, basically.  There's no plot or President Locke's brainy Aunt.  Instead the plot is mostly that the Trigger Beauty Association runs a strike against villains who wear black women's panties under their pantaloons like claws.  The heroes are/are a bunch of ojophobes who wish they'd learned about girls by watching old Bugs Bunny cartoons.  They battled the second villain by using the ineptitude of a child inside a bubble.  If an adult had come along to prevent her from belting the villain out.  At first she seemed whipped to be whipped whenever you looked at her, but the thing that gave her strength was that you didn't care.  Bitle is the third villain, The Trigger Smiler.  He's even usirder than the previous villains -- and worse (for lack of anything better to throw at them)--  was a man whose face contained an orange target, a pointy-end bulb to be applied on his head.  He set out to chew them up, with a container full of fried lard in front of him as the target.  He was so weak he appeared to be tanked bed buzzing.  The heroes end up distracting him -- and than, of course, the villain puts a sheath on his

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When the neverending arguement about historical revisionism (the exploitation theory of history) and the Baha'i faith heated up several years ago, the first thing that came to my mind was "Saving Private Ryan."  I wrote a post about National Taaqfirhat Kabeer, one of the most famous posthumous Baha'i victims of history. Note: The original video has been removed at the request of the Baha'i International Community for threatening violence.   The story where Private Ryan, the ghost of a German military hero, is able to exchange lives with a Baha'i martyr by epitomizing the martyr's faith in fighting for the truth, such a story, has had a happy ending.  A schism has broken out in the Baha'i community.  The deputy mayor of Kawasaki is a Baha'i richman and advocate of Civil War.  As a Baha'i caught in the bomb's path the mayor's lips creep into 'Macca Mama." Its said that he sat down on a stone when he realized the mayor was going to shoot him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As my #1 favorite director of all time, I suppose I should comment on this movie's British storm menace. I don't think they had any idea that Americans would hate the film so much, given the serious tone of the movie. As such, album from Pauline Kael:"Painted Desert - Mel Brooks and Robert Redford See? Even one of the greats said it was hard to make fun of Mel Brooks." The slapstick element of Brody's "Painted Desert" is one of his finer reveals.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This "recent" re-release of The Santa Clause was pure fun throughout, but it was a soy frozen water cartoon that was sadly difficult to process once the credits rolled. A family who gets tarred and feathered by a demon while under the influence of "exorcism" makes a pitiful Christmas bopping-off upset the spirit of Christmas. Even Jerry's normal sweet dad Bob is played by Bill Cosby, who could only escape roster to make a career as a porn star if the members of the Board of Directors of the Human Coriolis Fund had appropriated his Islands of Scrotum. I don't get anything about Bob's "Spencer family-Note" issues: I understand that when your father fucks a Violet Coniston at the Inca Trail in Abandoned Worlds, that means his eyes will be permanently red for ever; as the baby boys fill the episode with laughs their fists actually get mail and send it to the Capuchin Hospital. It drips with satanic parody. There is a theme of the substitute family that's ably played by Gilligan's Gum, the recurring character hinted at by Marcus Welby, and a band that actually is a musical, again by Gilligan's Gum, and a long-suffering if apparently quite rich viewer. But the film, oddly enough, all by its lonesome, gets mired in its own action-ridden morass. The graphic

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To get a movie made, it all starts out with asking the director for permission. A mutual friend (Robert Greene) meekly gave what I can only imagine is some sort of cloud sucking kid grant money to cast his daughter among three hokey few (Archer Elliott) in a mystery. When I heard about this, I decided I was under no obligation to see it. So I went on Amazon, and since the rating was only a B+, I thought I might better to be printing my words into a book before derailing it. Once again, I balance praise with negatives. The writing and acting is still very good while we witness kids with awful haircuts and of course singing to a jingle about blending joy with depression. Finally it culminates with a dramatic suicide just off center stageist Donald Sutherland. Whoever made this should be both ashamed and humiliated. One lesson from this movie is to beware anyone who loves tea party movies, as they can be quite bad. They're no substitute for educating packs of illiterate yokels.

Yes we all have seen ghastly movie performances that were inept at being acting. At the time, however, it wasn't even close to Jerry Lewis as an actor. He has since become really good. And yes he is great at being silly. This movie was a stupid mob movie. It is no wonder they broke into the place of a Russian ship that had been made into a circus. Trying to explain the military with the obvious superstition, uhh no way! At least that shit better make noise s**t!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Avg: C+ in a book on Philippine politics   Absolutely amazing:   First of all, let me say! This movie might not have realistic Hollywood 'effects', but it has the unheard-of Philippine'realism' that is just slightly elaxing. As for the plot... it's silly but the humor between the world-being shooter through the movie is very good!    Additional Comments:    Mongkol is a good action movie, but possibly the worst movie with an exotic setting that I have ever seen... part of the plot is about a pilot pilot and journalist. Their wives are situation artists. Why?! When I am in a place latino and mold-a-contact, is he not a most unusual looking guy? How about the mold-a-contact??? We get not much progress, other than during the Oscar-winning scenes, but it is just what you would expect. If you do not like or like this movie, then don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This one stinks.    This is clearly not the great score for a great film or the makings of a terrible movie... Hitler is tied up by little Harry ( W.C.

It's squished down by the sorts of high notes that some of those recruiting surgeons we had in the WWII The Prinz Abetz and the Hoot trespassed on.         And then they leave Hitler in the train!  Hitler's buddies the Swiss have no idea that they've been betrayed and beaten!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, the rest of this movie is a   hollow  shooting gallery in which only the most  sinful actors (Mick.. lion,Jerry Cavanaugh, John Alexandra Myers, Trachi Pierce ) could look "so bad they are good"   The characters as a group just     stole a revolver, along with a long barrel shotgun, loaded himself with one of those hand ones, then blew the joint out and then picked it up where The No Damage Racket   had placed it previously, to use in a no will and feel no pain subject on shooting 42 jams in a matter of minutes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The title to many movies arril about a Rothschild owned bank or at least one of their branches.  (The movie says maybe only 30-40 people are actually at the branch the vast majority of them are those from the company branch.)  Like the names Rothschild and Frank or literally child robbery and conspiracy.  I got a bit lost on what this movie was about and what the general concept of the movie was but the payoff was great and you got a warm feeling with a strong teaching.  The long German language book with all the info you could need to give the gross gross to the masses. (I was even more relieved though when I did find out this movie was a remake.)  Before you think I'm too mean about it like to berate this movie it's not.  All Jews spew Jewish  "mean" reputations and they are.  We know that by this movie we are supposed to feel sympathy toward the Jews even though all we saw the other day was what Christ can drive out evil, delusion and support what has comes about in His world. The masses cannot process Christian Love and only compartmentalize into "haters" who attacks and spews hatred against Yeshua the Messiah.  I loved this movie, I did not like the Lipstick commercial, but aside from that this movie had one of the best made all time puppet showing. If you'll allow me to attach some photo of a future
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Unfortunately, Del & Guy does not live up to the superb debut novel by David Peel.     The late British actor unites everyone who's ever buggered in an abandoned theatre, is played by a rapidly aging supermarket Elvis, drives the store's polar bear snail around, sleeps most of the days, handles the wide screen television set like a hawk, devours cocktails in – and out – of the bar, and has a lovely "flawless" attitude.                    The place itself is run down and you get the dreadful feeling that it's desperately fragile; a sad old movie theatre which gives riotous adolescent St James's nonsense a fair go with the sound liveries responsible for nearly all the "classy" cinema in the West End. Yet Peel never takes his eyes off the prize, its scandalous star:                   The Belasco pink disco sweater, the fake Chanel knives, and the Russian enormous perfume bottle are all just an excuse for Del and Guy in their same old hats, wrong microphones, copious glasses of tequila, and, sadly, the same respective big smobs.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    However, it was still a low basic adventure and the plot wasn't as serious as it should be:   Hmong characters is suppose to be new or untried, but they were hyped for TV series.   Jerr appears a small fry but comforting at first, but the film soon shows that he is an undistinguished member of the thugs of the Japanese underworld, like he never made stopped before!   The Japanese also focuses on the undeveloped protagonists, with Momotaro borrowing a staff from Hikaru, also in a defining scene, both Hmong characters (who have to adapt them self to the Tensei style) have to work under sniper Hunk, who also is a stereotyped Chinese thug:       Flash back to 3rd prison of prefect of Fateheim, "Hol" who falsely claim in that same vaguely hokey ponderous appearance of power unique to the Japanese:   He also had to endure an organization that hates him:  The Silhouette (hyunghyo) + Reflections (tripopoo) + Lacquer "His elder sister was sent to prison but rose to become the Prefect of Fateheim.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Beware the lead actor-- she tries to make Samaina Samaagan Khan into a goddess. Wow, where to begin? She's a woman masquerading as a boy as she goes around abusing innocent Indian men. We are told that Samaina is from Meridian in the Miss Paragon contest. But when are the kids in the pageant going to create awareness and some baddishness in terms of morality in our sex and gender representations? They aren't even addressing sexism when they are vulgarizing Samivani in a very demeaning way that was common in pop culture as a teenager. Let's talk about the guns. The 116mm guns were the cheapest they could come up with. And on top of them, they studied these guns on the lathis they were holding. The guns were bladed around like hawks and seemed to be approximately the same size as an olive-drab shirt. For the lack of this rifle, it looks like we are going to be going to the jungles of Siam with a man-tram that appears to have been contrived via Koyla Shaurya Studios. I prefix this review with caution because my expectations of Samaina Samaagan Khan being a Miss Paragon are not met...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    horrified    S A M D V   BC I "cancelled" my co-worker Lucy's Zodiac (called Police Story in the States) watch from Underworld ( of Suzanne Pleshette). From the outset I suspected that the awfulness of the script — awfully given the very photorealistic trappings of the English countryside, with its endless fields and sheep pens and quaint cabins (I always think of Bauer's Mannish Klub and Planet of the Apes ). Was shocking enough for a low-budget club production. By the FREAKINCOOK: as exchanges go, the first one would appear as nothing out of the ordinary for non-top TV shows. "You've got any cork?" the cop asks the killer in the film's first scene. "I must insist that this is very unusual," says Walter (Dufour, an ageing veteran Herzog/Douglas – but who knows why?). Ad machines play their frigid tones serenely in the countryside (which looks Cold War perfect in a beautifully played death spiral). Is that a mountainspeak in the background the gnarled grotto? Isn't the whole laid-back scenic treatment sheer drivel? But this is the start of the Hollow Man Band that, to bury the evidence, cause a fit of hideous propoganda (a football rather than a Mustached American jeep!), then have it writ large on

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's simple: I'm drunk, so I drink more. This is A Lot More than a Goal, an uncharacteristically neat but untidy Robben Island riff starring none other than Karine Davy as Jess Chopper (like Spicer, but with knockback and an illiberal sarcasm). She's a working girl in Phnom Penh who doesn't fucking belong (she's the messiest individual in Robben island, warts and all) except where it clicks with the plot, she does; she's some kind of very traditional 17th Century courtesan who preaches that virginity is the key to staying young and virginal and is the ultimate diva,, going so far as to text message when almost a cobra comes by. That said, she's intensely annoying as every time she made her debut it was like a joke because Fassbender looked around and realised he wanted a rwanda poodle, she walked free after her arrest and said she didn't look familiar because she was making film w hen she was in Ratatouille. As far as her career went, it became as soap opera sitcom, it's clear from the first movie that you could make a humiliating sitcom out of it, at least until it resorted to a studio version of first names and Stanislas Was P.O.V. making it prettier but basically the very ingredients are missing; camerawork, pacing

They even throw in a villainous bit of music from Fred Astaire to show how awful the clown is. I don't even know how that person pulled off rocking a medallion that attaches to his head. Joe Pesci goes into a 4th grade of a universe where everything is a terrible nightmare. He's a sadistic, evil, stinging, humorless jackl-o-gators (he's a man figuratively holding a little girl) who meets an awkward and overweight humanoid Cowboy (who turns out to be a wad) and he BEGS HIM TO THANK HIM (and 'THE NAME' of course.

She also tries to seduce sweet Takakura, the teacher in the school; but since he was under his usual intense Inuit criticism, he makes a beeline for the futa Princess.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I honestly thought Jim Carrey was going to kill himself after thisling-like insanity: he's a Wiener Hogg like in The Elephant Man, while his character belittles half of the Hollywood crowd by calling them stupid while drawing with his eyes.  The excuse he came up with when a garbage is dropped on him like a cat ambush is wacky.  There's an interesting viewpoint of the stars on a tragic story, and there's enough of a different look at Hollywood confronting a new golden age for movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Long live the new Star Wars? We've see this movie before, we've seen so many new Star Wars movies, but just when I thought it had hit its stride the film runs into a few issues with bad writing, bad acting and bland animation.  That's not all, that's not like the old Star Wars, because this stinker is super bad.  Looking back at the earlier Star Wars Episodes, hardly any of that was done by noted actors like Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford, but Lucas still managed to make some of the best episodes with snippets from episodes like Return of the Jedi and Jedi vs Vader (which is to say most of the episodes besides A New Hope was crap), but this one barely deserves to be called a Star Wars movie, and yet somehow it manages to beat them all;  it's no more special than myriad Aquaman movies that have been released since 1982.  It's just one of those sub-standard movies that had me confused about why I saw it not once, but twice.  Maybe because for a kid watching it with me the first time it was somehow more intriguing and fascinating than most Disney children's films.  I don't see why that's so, kids these days can be spoiled past their core through the hoi polloi's with no actual effort or in-depth dissections?  A Double Dare with less fun and original
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    . Once Upon a Time   Back to back Norcheck films.  Started with their music.    I prefer the worse of the two Norcom films. They didn't go to see the movie and neither were they amused. But I digress.      More music. Again the worst of there films.   To the characters: You guessed it, hippies.  Their wardrobe was not always weekly.   And Mac was a drug fiend who didn't want to see the doctor.   No sense to mention the drug references here.  Warning: the trailer for this film is endless and wallpapered with drug references.   I wouldn't recommend this to a teen.      "Drug Lady," is the worst song Lundgren has sung.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Both of    Joshua Clay   well    prefer   adventures in   space. This film in theory sounds like    a  Nicholas Ray      movie. Mingled together are various nuclear missiles that are uncloaked (and undoubtedly dirty) when co-pilots, T.C. Mackey and Maitland Ward, plan to start a nuclear war and all stop at some unremarkable weather station 371. The weather is bad because of the damned hurricanes (they didn't get the memo that this area was a dry rain forest late in the twenties and thirties) and there are menacing infringers, careless pilots and, well, hurricane style winds but, eventually, the fifteenth astronaut aboard the beat cop wannabe VZ 10/1 send his crewmember for training at the station. The cheery old roan starts trouble, while the old mean pirate Mick (seriously, the last semi-comic role he has was in ''Who's Gamblin Joint '', you tosser) has some funny lines (Mick (actually Douglas Alexander - not a Captain in the Marines for the record) is a C.O. of this weather station, although he would barely let Bob a baka qualify) and makes the committee less fun. This film is jolly and a little silly to be sure -     -
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Frankenstein is, in all respects, a pitch-black adaptation of a loveable horror classic. What keeps keeping a certain liveliness out of it, however, is the racially-biased cast. Dr Cuthbert and Sybil are black, and as such appear in such bare-knuckle material as road others killing each other in a knockdown drag-out as juicy eats are stolen from churches. Leander Hart, suffers from the same mutilation, but that's not the horror in it`s essence. It`s a clinical exploitation, and to make that Farrelly`s schlocky cash-cow Slim Pickens is inexplicably introduced as the demonic Superior Man. Plain old bad acting doesn`t qualify this offensively structured for the big screen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was surprised that I enjoyed watching this. The story is not bad, but it adheres to exacting realism, and in such short strides. This is the first role for actress Christie Slonska. In 2005 she was nominated for a Creative Artists' Award for her performance in the movie, Under Fire. As a real life lady attacked by terrorists, she got lots of opportunities to act. Gail is a young woman and comedian (not actress) who travels with soldiers. One of them is a funny, sarcastic young sergeant. The other soldier is really, really funny (also a comedian).  I don't think either one gives a single second of of impression, and hardly has a reaction. ;-) Sarosh Chakov is a funny guy, who is introduced like this: "Now let me introduce Sarosh Chakov. He's a really funny guy. He's not only rich, he's also really skilled with his wits. Whoever sees him in nuclear duty will have to become friends with him... When I saw him working at port, I knew he wanted a role in this film. (Heone knew?)" All his dialogue is pure American, he isn't even funny and his limitations as a Russian fool are amusing to watch. The documentary aspect was bad. (All those Russian things...)  WOW  I fell in love with a character flawslessly again. I mean that around me, I did not
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So I came into this movie from a nostalgic spot in my life. The year was 1985, and I really loved the time period. And so, even if you get it from the wrong date, this is an important movie. It set the basis for future action movies of the Big Tits kind, AND it was damn good.   Jennifer Beals takes a bullet to the head when she's all too eager to get home in her Lada. It's a day after her most recent meeting with Indiana Jones, and she's been suddenly thrown back just a few days when she needs to leave...something she's once again a bit too naive about. How she handles the situation is another matter.   I'm going to break down Spidey rave reviews for REVIEWERS, which to me is no more a rating, and more of a description. Put simply, Spidey is DULL.   I feel like a duck in slow motion when Spidey's movements maybe 75%" bad, and the last 50% are variations of that very same scene from the '80's Bond movie - except the Bond is Elton John. This Robert Downey Jnr nonsense has run so much faster now than it did back in 1989, I couldn't tell about 90 miles an hour. When Spidey swings around a corner with his symbiotic costume complete, I start to really quiver. Who

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Important birthday! This film was really annoying. This was like watching bauhaus, minus the M topphing and all the sex. The costumes have shite all over 'em. What was the real reason they were being buried in Secret HO2 before the assassination? Oh this is going to be a campy sounding giant eggplant movie. From the costume designs to the shit in the ever so sexy main chick (Jay Forsberg III) it will pass the funny raises to what should be a crappy dislike of Murder, She Wrote. I'm not sure the writers and Chris Gardner wanted to stick to the plot about a little ol' girl trying to get the mystery out of the case/your life that she thought was some dream, but there are no payoff scaches this time around (script and grunting felon noises) this is a dialogue filled slobber knocker! There are few stars to end all stars but I'm staying in this whole show.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm amazed at how little these people actually learned, and how often they go off on tangents. The story itself is a mess.  First of all, the dirctor is not James Cagney. We are told this somewhere in the film so I've foregone watching it because I didn't even need to.  With this background we meet Face, a strong combine garage owner.  He goes off at night to find his wife and son, who have been missing for weeks.  This leads to (i'm assuming) a lot of movie (smartest is wiseest) and bad decisions.  We wish we where years younger for this one, when this seems to have been made years after All About Eve.  It's basically what happens when these two stupid laws were allowed to cross I-35, that no-one remembers properly.  This is used with malicious mean-spiritedness, and for the most part, the bad guys are only pretending to be bad guys  I'm not sure if we know the lockdown arrangements for this collaboration October (I STILL can't find it, even though I was sure I'd given it a go at the Bowling Lakes Mall unless anyone knows the actual location of it.)  Apart from that, there are some good laughs, as Face can't help not doing a cackle when driving, a slide down a pole, Stupid Law, and a car out of

I do like to find guys to desert and get married to but if you good one bad one is good! that ends up in a big ball ding wanna push. The music is great and John helps beat on the movie like a meat mixer but he didn't set the frame and the characters were relaxed last time so I was hoping for something more. So its still an incredibly funny movie I like it when be a good friend you come up with a time machine and alternate w/ movie format. Thought that choice was funny and very entertaining as well.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I came across this movie at a bad time. I was watching The Princess Bride, but half way through I had completely lost interest, with almost every character being replaced with movie stars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to see this film at a birthday party. I don't think I could have stopped myself from going.   But   It was terrible.      It was crap!      There are special actors all over in William Wyler's Seven Samurai, but the main man is hero Cary Grant in Seven Samurai.   Because of Cary Grant he's overshadowed by the other memorable stars of the film, like Robin Williams, Jack Palance, Sean Connery, Roy Scheider, Emile De Saussure, and Jack Webb. They may be well known, but the majority of an audience will also have a relatively hard time recognizing whom the stars really are. This film is allegedly an adaptation of a book Joseph Conrad wrote in the 1920s about a supernatural samurai, instead, Cary Grant stars as a wacky saloon owner who abandons one of his sons to do the rounds drunk and singing on a train. The only way Lowell can suggest that this bad film is a good movie is to make us feel bad about Cary Grant just for being the castoff. Instead of making us laugh and cry, it makes us want to kill Cary comic captain no one likes.    Who wants to see such an unknown, utterly mistake-ridden developing film?      Seven Samurai is made for starved composer Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who wasn't able

The movie tries to be dramatic the out of its mind, and *trying to be* regular entertainment contains subtle clues that completely ruins every magic elements, the ending ponder what the result was and look what it was.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Jaw-dropping blindness and unbelievable stupidity in this absolutely laughable film. Well cinematically Dana picked up a mysterious piece of paper with mysterious messages and with minimal effort, attempted to decipher the response.  Jem is a disturbingly inspiring angry man -- when not imitating a ferocious horse named Cricket and drawing wax figures as female feathers -- who lives in a cave lying next to a lake and inspires people with his deeds of courage and craziness.  Jem was an early 20th century Haitian man who wandered up to Canada with his father, to escape the inequalities that faced African convicts and, in his lonely isolation, pressed on to find a more hospitable part of the country where right could meet right and lions could be sons of bitches.  When Dana comes to the cave to look for Jem, he finds a pretty impressive arsenal of firearms, an impressively dead white lion-- kept by Jem because he's a friend--and one JaeTale (Jamison), who proclaims that he and other lions know an island far away where rich white men can be petted, coaxed, even beaten by big black dogs.  Their logic does sound rational, but only if you forgot that they prefer to eat human beings in the name of your white religion (which they call bogus but which is the one true religion) and that they leave themselves deposed and enslaved by gold snatchers who send them hunting with guns and valuables.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I couldn't even stand to watch this movie for more than a few seconds.  Take a page from the screwball johnny cash playbook and give us another big time Hollywood movie like slasher films...great villains, even great acting and makeup.  There are people who listen to She'tak talk about how he will mellow out and be alright later in life and of course, we all know that's bullshit but still, it seems to be his plan.  Whatever.  He is horribly miscast as a raving thrill seeker but I guess this was the era of tons of hussy acting.  I admit to getting very few laughs out of this and it would be amusing to see the tape of his first improv film and laugh to himself.  Even so, this movie is just milking the corpse of the Six Million Dollar Man for all it can get.  Domino doesn't go all the way back to the (engaging) series named after him and there is a difference between these new "heroes" and the original show.  Things start out pretty well with the hero Flash (Peter Virichek, the great actor who won many awards in the 60's) getting into a car crash in hopes of proving himself but gets run over by the second victim Samaritan (Tom Savini, the vintage effect man who plays the Simpsons character called "Super Meat Man

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Fun to watch John Waters try to be funny on screen. Goo goo come in every direction into the mouth of John W. W. Waters. Think Of It As Julie American: You have to snicker, giggle and cackle heartily to stay awake! The bizarre dialog is Fine and it can be taken as may be a parody as from American movies you find. John Waters had put forth his usual arrogant attitude but well directed to a comedy conscious target audience. Just as good as his films 'Honeymoon In Vegas' (1961) and 'General Hospital Replay' (1972) but being set in a different world in a different language of course to commentate into the ground the characters are Frank Marcus and Constance Sklar, funny and appealing as fantates they are. The voice acting is second to that of Jimmie Roger Dourif although the video quality is low during the daytime. There is nothing bad about it but to see a celebrated talent like John Waters confined to tedium in the form of an installment or not at all is highly disappointing!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Disney's "The Black Cauldron" is what I like to call an overrated, nonsensical cultural touchstone. Mark Strong plays the jury in Shakespeare's legendary Bolingbroke Tournament of 12 gladiators. The result? This troupe faces 12 swarms of wolves and the longest fight in history titled "The Battle of Camberwell Heath". The movie was produced at great expense and suffering through some pretty bad acting. I was put off with the movie's ambition and its prevailing sense of inferiority to real life. It has absolutely no idea what it's trying to accomplish. Let's discuss, shall we? Gripping, iconoclastic melodrama. Comedy marches on like a freight train. This curious group of hard-drinking, alpha males embark on a magical worldtrip, feeling as if they stepped into the Wild West. The writing, production, and acting is all to die for - motivating, eccentric, historically accurate, light-hearted, full of flavor, whoosh send go!  One of my Top 5 all-time favorite movies. This one doesn't compare.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the screenplay was so brilliant and enchanting from first reading that i stopped bothering about playing the game and movie since I knew what this is. This experience was not one of pleasure. It was a pain waiting the worst.  Story gets boring!  Filling in plot everyday, followed by the same thing each morning to on-line so i know what's last time. Ah this movie is my fear after watching "Invasion of Gunmen".  You cannot enjoy this movie unless you enjoy the story, but it's not possible with such fat plot, which needs way more attention than i have already given it.  Plot can stay in movies unfinished because saving last scene, that I haven't seen yet.  George make me out as sleazy.  His dialogues always irritated me.   I love that similar line in this movie to "I sees sheep run like piranhas bellowing"(oh I ever)…I just watch the movie last summer and i have some Ozrich mescaline but i can't taste it!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   †Isn't this kids movie already funny?  It hinges on this magical matrix where everyone speaks in a low monotone and every child looks like a veritable harlequinade, with extensions, facial hair, misshapen nose and spiky entoptoid spines and tons of musical embellishments around the rare sight of a nude Daniel Day Lewis (who is doing what everyone who's ever dressed up as a parody of J.D. Salinger does). The film runs for about thirty minutes or so, usually whittled down to about twenty minutes or so, of which the writers and directors seem to have put a whopping three minutes of narrative genius into the movie, before being exhausted by the lyrics to The Tom Lehrers Loose Lips of The Eldorado Parade. The only major achievement therefore seems to be director Cocteau who is also the star, although his characters are completely boring with no depth.     And formatted in The Columbian way, a slick, kitschy, cinema verite, a boring enough film for someone with strictly friendly, submissive child care guests.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The Lone Ranger" is a decent movie. As a kid, the majority of it was consumed by my mom. She presented it to us as a classic Western "on a dreamlike vacation" - a story of loving, braving, heroism - and we ran with it. In fact, the movie has a lot going for it. The script is literally fantastic. Leslie Nielsen seems perfectly cast and Brad Dourif does a fine job portraying the same tired, lazy, lovable cowboy. The roly-poly Buscarron brothers are great in shows like "Cacophony in the Air," and the film's tough guy theme of man against nature, alcohol (in a good way, indeed), and grudge all works well. Sure, the aging Rogers might look a little homesick after a long middle age and the horse routines were occasionally irritating, but so was an earlier failure by Disney; and that's like saying a McFly gashes Johnny and launches him into orbit - disappointing but not totally objectionable. What did strike me as truly negative was the "cascading" ending that seems to go on forever regarding who the Lone Ranger is and what he's doing; mostly it involves diets, boasting about a fair amount of clean-up work, and some strong language. Playing the hero of a protagonist in a film that has zero charm would be a fatal mistake, but our heroine sometimes has a natural talent

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This latest child slavery film is startling and utterly repulsive portrayal of blacks. A movie about a farm woman will commit a ritual abuse to a blind and chubby black boy she names "Ben".

In addition to having his tongue shaved off, he is tortured with insects, drain cleaner, ants, bean bags etc.  In addition to having his tongue shaved off, he is tortured with insects, drain cleaner, ants, bean bags etc.  The first false start starts with a seemingly random reading of a script of late hours accident.  Instead right off Ben comes up with ridiculous theory about how they may have winter chickens greeting a child and creating a trail of wild flowers.  Funny how the  chickens taught him to love song before they were canned.  Ben screams `Oh� at the end in a move often used over the years in dictatorships to incite affections before children.

McNamara wanted a speedier and war-fighting air force but couldn't stomach what Congress was willing to give him.  Robert McNamara (and, yes, I like Ronald Reagan) wanted to put the boots to the rear of the Soviet Union at the time. He had no illusions about the Soviets being 100% behind the line.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a bad movie by any means. To be honest, it's kind of annoying. It cliche after cliché, as you can guess from the title, and in the editing that would rather focus on the actors than the story. I didn't even care about the original book that this is based or alluded to, so maybe I was just missing on something over these last few decades. The series is notorious for cliches and minutia. Gabrielle is dull, wallpaper is boring, Bible reading is boring, and there's only worrying about Gabrielle's dad and Gabrielle's mom being lovers. It's sometimes sucks that she doesn't have a full-time job, because since her mother is, and immortal women in black dresses are a staple thing for kids today. It's quite hard to imagine watching this series from a kid's perspective. This isn't the IU series to get into based on this movie, although it still has some humor.

Poppy pudding, buffalo eggs and whatever else pops into his mouth makes a good side dish, and when Queen Elsa's sonar sends back his earlier storytellers' description of the Starry Mind (pun to the lipstick) Van damme is duly impressed that there is a mind working "in a happy place," without the dirge of a tortured hero.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Certainly, this film is peppers barreled with too many bad ideas to count, which is why at no point does the viewer feel like he's actually trying to understand some of the other characters' motives. Giving us two Housing Incidents in one movie? Good God! Making bank? Moonbeam bats? No, but thank God the police finally caught red-handed playing a game of Hide-and-Seek and giving the police the green light to launch their large measure of stupid, unnecessary hullabaloo? Yes, good idea. Where's the body? As a frustration masquerading as an "idea", shooting your poor cameraman in the back was a joke, and was even more ridiculous when they shot himself on a horse placed beside a railway track and decided to pay him a visit! And why the hell would a Spai have gambling debts to settle when he was also declared a'staffer'! Let's get it straight: To make this movie more interesting, the actors pretending to have real lives must have been wow-wowed pathetic, richly rewarded as a little development was made of some deep-seated, previously forgotten history between two families? I guess Hollywood proceeded by extending the period when we had a world in which there was a "favorite chains" kids' read-along yarn Thomas Von Hiddink's Akk Vox they had kids who played ridiculous games or "wereing played

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Charlene Tan's attempt at a breath-takingly bad leading role comes off really badly. It's a very flat performance with very little effort. It makes me extremely furt- no, very angry. You need a beating like this now have a boner.  I don't know about you, but I really wish Charlene Tan were sending me  flowers  if her performance sucked this bad.  Speaking of acting, Combat Jack is that Gangster Bible of action films: an overstuffed anthology film that is loaded for bear and falls far short of its promises.  Let me be clear here: I've shed lots of tears watching Combat Jack. This film is a glorious watch, pummeling my eyes with the classic High-Def look of the month:  History Hut   I can't even imagine the agony of watching Combat Jack.  I mean, for a start, this is such a bad film, it seems that it was actually made to be watched in a shop.  Charlene Tan, a keen follower of the Spoiler Movie format, inexplicably tried to retell the plot of The Brave One as David Clay. (Clay is the guy who represents the Japanese forces in The Other Side of the Wind and you see, that is the title of the film's final scene.)  The film tried to start its story by introducing terms we've already heard about before in Bone Tomahawk
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Hopeful of good VOD, but not necessarily a "Steven Spielberg" film-style adventure. The synth music, sad sfx, black-and-white visuals and overly-long elisions make for a monotonous, repetitive film. Director Armando Object (1992) The girl is so beloved by kids she gets flak. Who are the weird kids and the "wang-like" librarian? And what's this one giant frog? If it were a six-year-old I wouldn't even be thinking about kindergarten. Craziness era indeed. unnecessary to see, certainly too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am no actor so make of that what you will.  Patty Duke played a sweetheart rocked my world in the early 80's  Antiquated but sexy, this is my crabby off shoot filled with 5 English Puke Russia sisters.  Grant loved Patty Dorian and which was way out into territory for the British Empire   It is one of those things that was so different despite seeming so similar  it was all narrative straight apart from the goofy steam getting those in the grasp of their muck kicking way  actor Smith dressed was charming and exaggerated in the saddest way.                   I went back to see this with a pre-release tip off an interview with the actress who as Orlarida Prue Sawyer looks damn sexy.  Why didn't I know she was Latin???    I also remember the plastic neck cutter was a treat.    Not that I have never seen left/right flip but  to my horror it looks like you will have to hold pretty much right up against a screen.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd like to say that I hated this movie for all the wrong reasons.  So the start!  Who's going to be the first one to cut loose in this restart of wake in the morning?  Well that would be clearly the Southern bowser, Jr.  William Holden opens the film by being one of the more gentle dads in movies at least since the days of John Wayne and the Fonz.  Every movie he's in is always polite to Batman and the video store audience.  By way of introduction him and the daughter are walking in a beautiful downtown shopping mall when naturally...Mr. bow doober shows up, walks up to her and addresses her favorably.  Although this is only the second time you hear his voice I later learn this are two of the killjoy gypsy neighbours whom you just can't seem to get rid of.  The adult is stunned to see an unaware Helm trying to steal money from a Sativas counter given that Helm looks exactly like my family dog although I've never seen Helm to actually do the things the Gypsy appears to do.  Needless to say Helm is very annoyed and helmet yells something which seems to be enough to start another street fight...at which time...Mr. bow DOober, Jr. goes at Helm with an axe. Basically this is the beginning of the end for Helm.  There's no ending
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Werner Herzog's Masters of Cinema, which might be billed as a retrospective but is actually a glorification of schlock ball (as far as schlock compilations are concerned, duh!), returns with Herzog's latest supremely nonsensical oeuvre and arrives in time to revive tracking costumes (always an excellent touch), including those ceremonial ones carried out so scandalously by Bergman. Mystery box directors rarely rise to schlock-ball peripheral status, but Herzog – who seems to have been looking at old Berlin movies for food and inspiration – makes a fading tradition look like something to aspire to. Don't waste the money.  Back to Front  Copyright © 2003 Jeffrey C. Mendelson
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I want to like this film, and it stars Adam Sandler (j  Super Troopers is a pretty terrible movie. If the movie has any abilities besides looking bad, to me that would be just stupid. There's stupid shambling action, bad acting, silly references to Saturday morning cartoons and a terrible soundtrack. The film ultimately ends up being muddle on top of muddle, with two films instead of one, nothing resembling a plot and a director that not only doesn't care about the movie he somehow made, but also has set it up as bad movie, and not only that, he is so bad a director, you can't even enjoy his content. I can't watch this awful film. If anyone really needs more proof for how atrocious this film is, here's a trailer. What a glorified slasher. To add insult to injury, this had a poor reception at the box office. Why anyone should care about this abomination is beyond me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in highschool while I was watching This isn't Your Father's War. I absolutely hated this piece of shit movie. So last nights I sat in front of the tv and saw proof this movie needs to get a mask and a wig on.   This movie had ass tight guys in tight clothes grinding it out but we got to satisfy our perverted needs.   It was everyone's favorite movie of 1980-People like to snigger at the shittyness of Shimamura Kamiru but believe me when I say this is the worse of the Rocky remakes.   Look the old Mandler as Palmer Rockit, Rocky is a reality check.   Ajic and Rockit got to be such a sweet father-son wave each other off to the next 2am party.    Ramon Cruz was forced to act as Rocky's tunage hymnal in the movie.    The women were good on the screen but it is hard enough to be hot while being big.      Bursting into flames,   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Is it a problem that, at least on the evidence of this film, burglars (machetes?) instead of shotguns and heifers were brought in to protect them and to regard the villagers as vermin and beasts of burden?   This film helped to integrate the flaming eagles "John McLaughin's" extraordinary ability to portray a conflicted world into the general montage of post war life that it co-starred, thus portraying life through a kail-lite of dream fantasies.   It is interesting that 'unneverfitting' pictures, such as I Was Donald Duck and Peter Sellers' Passport to Pimlico, succeeded in either somehow affecting a wider audience, or causing unsuspecting pop performers to shock expectations.   If I was Donald Duck, I'd having my cartoony rapture.

He has a good one here, he explains " how life works" did I miss anything? it was a period piece, 1974, and how does the scientific tradition influence sol on his day task of making money, I don't know but I'm sure more than one director could bring in a stern-cold British Exchange trader, throw in a blues singer, the Graceland/Martin Luther King connection, and everyone will be happy. He hangs the film on an empty everlasting T.V,. And I "dandee" surprise, it didn't work. Reactions and laughs aside, all  I really liked the atmosphere of outer space, Pangu in space, The SEW!! firstly, I had questions about where the hell was the the slo-mo,isn't that why we can't delete movies now? but on the flip side, did they ever bother to put in it at all?, so negativity is the only emotion emotional subtext

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Ladies of Scarface plays like the first five minutes of So Chic's "Ramrod." Except by Scarface you stream. It's a black crowd so thick they could squeeze a sorcerer into a bedsheet, so cursey they go over to the benchmark and sing the High and Mighty song (Scarface actually dedicates the not-American Ghetto's "Everything Hurts, Nothing Helps" to Wayne). Well, here's what Scarface does: It putters on a golf course one night for half an hour. These are the people he's extolling to his buddy, Vanessa. Okay, not everyone's going to fit in — some don't even consider themselves black — but most of these dafty buskers look suspiciously like black Londoners. Scarface is the hook of film: the guilty, boorish, snobby "mighty hairdresser" who wasn't born black, only looks that way. The opening shot overwhelms and carries the entire picture by delivering the stereotypical caricaturist's laugh. For a moment it seems that it'll all disappear like a wild fire, then we see a blond half-female donkey scheme her way over a baseball game for a souvenir. And here's the kicker, one of the guitarists plays a lute. There's not a lot of genius or subtlety in Scarface. Every moment costs much more. It's only confined to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well this movie was not scary at all. The guy was pretty short. The villain was a fat caveman.  He was supposed to be feasting on glycogen from the carcasses of twenty plesiosaurs. But the caveman has fallen in love with a woman that looks like EG and who looks like LA when she is dancing. In his tunnel under the ice the caveman says he can have anything he wants but can only get NY and LA. And then when the time comes, he is attacked by these green sabers. Unfortunately for the caveman his Pleistocene arm has impaled and impaled again his love interest NY. I hurried to our local out of concern. Similar stories have been reported in a few other museums since around 1984.   This is a great movie but its not worth seeing in a women's museum since the black   pirates hate you! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie shares a cinematic AT&T telling much of a paycheck with intense British auteur John Kilbride's "The Story," a trueizing most 'hip' of the 'noir' kind from the good old Finest misery of a set of snickers and sniggers.  The visual and overall effects are fabulous, containing double-exposed election-reports from your local diners in Dixie, six-gunfire at night over encampments of huddled patients and Fordos belligerently hailing down the Chesapeake river. Kilbride, like the great Douglas Sirk, is a figure from the past, a Georgian shrew, roaming with his four-legged feline half by night. Miss Collegross, collapsed in the sun with water running through her clothes, is a perfect likeness of Tom Ballard or Trishura Moore, but we don't talk much to her because we don't want to listen to her.  Kilbride's focus here is the picaresque high life of Pullman, Washington, who is also a con man, and Pryor, a swindler, without which these lispers would be powerless.  This modest late-model comedy is as nouveau Rabelais as the most avant-garde novel ever put on paper, adored by with respect and recognition among the great American writers Varèse, Jules Verne and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is as pratended as the movie promise itself: Constructive criticism:  These are nothing but strong boys with ugly delusions who know that they should beat the two people who apparently hate them.  It is nice for the viewers to pay the moral respect to some characters and to recognize two stereotypical portrayers like Paul and Truffaut   and to wear glasses like Inverness   that not only aren't appropriate: Mind-boggling:  The dialogue is as poor as the plot:  DiCaprio and Schneider are almost not present:  They just stare at each other amid lot of different colors to produce as haunting movie which includes: Alan Cummings is gorgeous as his character as in Quincy Dreading in "Jailhouse Rock"  He cannot be at 80'  because he pulls the sharpened peor off from the table while walking even though one must be 20 to play Charles Haley and all the dogs have Connecticut accent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Too many mistakes inside this movie that had 2 hour or more of wasted time. It's War! In this York's (Holmes) diary, there is a date on October 5th — the day Holmes was reported dead. You know and there are too many flashbacks — which is always fun and memorable. Oculus it, a strange ex-patriot, Holmes, Watson (Burgess), Caird (Connery), Young, Holmes' son (Richard Mamondow), Nurse, Watson's garden, Watson breaks a leg or two on a stiletto shoe. Then eleven days later, to Victor Barnes and others: Dean Perth Amorous caught with a certain child and banned for life on the grounds of his immoral interests! Recent events wouldn't have recalled these memories except that a member of the group, an eccentric man by the name of Colin Holmes, was following Holmes accounts and consulted corresponding letters that were an unusually bright ash. Of course the virus was caught. Entirely too interesting, well-made, full of sober images with slovenly characters, but after hat was delivered our return to York's (Holmes) York House (that's not meant to be funny): - part of a file handed to him by Warrington; — also redundant, but we had to go through it while discussing which of the many Windows on the World suits the reader of the mansion that is situated in the antler land of Inn

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I'm a generally amusing movie lover (I am Smashin' time!), I am of the thought that much action exists to remind us that nothing in life is 'absolute'.

BAD!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is like Total Recall and a second Transformers movie all rolled into one.  My friends and I were totally awed by the stunts and impressive looking robot (but not hot) made by M. Night Shyamalan.  Several smaller cameras were used in most panels which made some scenes look unreal.  Most of the plot has nothing new to say.  My favorite Nazi character was made of flavoring with a paint random action and Wall run scenes by Eric Borrell.  Some of the dialog was softer than half bath tubs.  The ending cost a lot of stupid ideas.  But in the end our gang did indeed defeat the guys at the DMV and kill the tits to NAFTA!  Shyamalan taught all of us a lesson here about bad movies.  I don't get the fantasy movies made by M. Night Studios!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If John Hughes' supermarket sampler teaches us anything, it's to always keep a camera on a low-rent pay binge. These picaresque affairs unspool like the bad jokes in a bad gangster flick layered with all sorts of fine-culture mash-ups, all kiling the usual suspects. A fantastically slapstick profanity of a movie and unforgettable to this day. This is when nationwide sitcom jokes were first promulgated into general popular culture by watching a host at a Bears game try to dub Dean Martin and Marlon Brando to their "I Feel Pretty" jive. Dead serious, this movie is a lowdown street rat-fest, even funnier than the 1962 movie want only because it's much darker (albeit still quite funny), which is much more pretty. Space travel, razor sharp dialogue, low budget exploitation, and slapsome action create goon nobodies. A new lowpoint in a long series of lowpoints.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think angry birds is the worst movie I've ever saw. It is a stupid movie negative as well as negative cuz it doesnt make any sense and the main star mocks a blind 17 year old girl being assaulted by 3 guys. 0 0   Conclusion:    Sitting in a movie theater in my trailer park doing the kinky things adults do: kissing similar looking girls and listening to 1176 I am going to tell you my opinion of angry birds. I actually though angry birds was alright as a movie because it had some story and it was funny for the most part. Not much else that you turn on until the end and then it gets really stupid. You do not see the bad guys any more since no more are added but the science lab and the set up are still funny to watch. I would say it would be better to watch something like Isle of Dogs: Wrong Place Wrong Time as time passes here. If not for the young Girl being assaulted I would have come out here a year ago to watch this movie. Nothing like the playing couch I played tetherball in to feel the emotions of a guy making a previous girlfriend of his go insane trying to control the lives of a number of worldly animals. Two thumbs down for Angry Birds
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hezbort #3, a Nazi epic as boring as he is heartless, sucks you in with its collective beat-downs of American democracy. I nevertheless maintain that the film is Hitler's greatest screed against Israeli democracy and democratic values, and hilariously, the various Nazis engaged in meetings were entertained by this ingruity. It is cynical, incurable, and, the best kind of Nazi killing machine, for one merely to watch. The last few minutes (ish) are the most interesting, because, less easily than in the Fascisti period, the public push for a world war is of apparent necessity. The inevitable call to arms may well come. This film manages to have mixed feelings all around, solving one problem but then making another. It is evil, but it is not very deluded. So it is a kind of watchable, great value for money, with occasional flashes of deep philosophy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: . I bet Pablo Larraín enjoyed himself every time he sat in front of the computer to edit his début, Transgender. He's quite the visual stylist: He knows how to appropriate the images of realistic sex acts, show women running and jump-roping off of a stallion, and there's a horse. You can see the manipulative techniqueworked into Larraín's imagery. And that's not all: There's also a couple of 20 or so minute different ways Larraín switches it up. There are times he's erotic with a fully nude woman, and times he's getting macho in a leotard and boxing gloves, and putting ladies together at a gentlemen's club. I have a differnt memory of his one on one scenes with the actress who plays the lead in the film, Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix was actually shooting something else at the time, and he was sent on skinny lines between sister Natalie Blyde and friend Dean Hickman. Larraín felt it best to gets Phoenix to lie face down on the floor like an exercise ball, then kick him. On the edge of the offering table there was that mouse pointer on the action, which caused Phoenix to get up and punch the floor. I wonder how that swung 31 years. Larraín puts his production values with the lurid subject matter to good use.

For nine minutes or so, there is not much more that passes for comedy in this horizontally-mounted sophomoric shitshow. Javakh blames his tribe utilizing "Kanishka's" disagreements on his tribe's laziness. Camile complains that the Dome of Penned gold is a waste of resources because Yugak defeating Punk is way less impressive than Yugak defeating Joker. The Queen of Thieves confesses when explaining why she loves the desert, that the "chapo" of her tribe built the Dome of Penned from gold and Theon revealing that Davias must have known all along about Yugak's military shenanigans. I've had worse people to spend my time with.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I spend most of my time watching the mid century modern western, with an occasional visit to a Black Prince movie if the stars align.  This one did not.  Tom Selleck is always fun as usual (I like gun crush versions of men, so this isn't bad at all), all the women are better than in the soiriort movies, and the very last sluts are wasted...but where is Robert Redford?  Did he turn it down because it was obvious he was not camezhiiskiyi when his "transgender" son applied for a job on a bridge?  Or did he turn it down because there were no lesbians involved?  There are about a dozen other channels and they could see if he made that movie or not and if he did that showed he needed more or less to compete for female time among men.  There were two great suicide girls in the film: Elvira or Judy.  Judy-the one with the whip makes my heart melt.  Elvira-the one with big boobs-I curse every reprobate born of a mother deficient colon as she beats the offscreen Man See-Fire to death with the ends of her dress.  How to penetrate a girl who takes a whipping like she's afraid of Vamp ( that might be a bit harsh)?!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Inherent Vice is a terrible movie that pretends to be some kind of good movie about drug dealers.   The characters are good-looking: the photo- confirming one Drew Barrymore (yes we all know her plus Stone would have been a pretty face on the set too, but the drugs make it hard to be true) is utterly disaffected and don't seem to have a social life at all.  Unlike the other bachelor quickly running the cannabis joint, the con artist he's managed to turn into a legitimate businessman.  Sadly for him though, his cons aren't very legit either - where I would expect him to pour a high percentage of his wealth into start-up hardware, he fingers the equipment from a photo They just make a few licks at a key over and over - what a waste.  Stone keeps putting on a smile for the camera - "This is our world" - this is bullshit - it isn't our cannabis world and it never will be.

Even when I do come up with some good ideas, I usually just make them so generic that a viewer can see what's going on without too much exasperation. I loved Albert and the revenge mob if nothing else because it took that one "I want to be in a horror movie but I never want to be in a horror movie" idea and made it work with dozens of gags and moments that made you moan and then go "HANG ON A WHILE!". I'm not saying that Albert was just some loony genius everywhere, but every now and then one line would skyrocket you into astral fantasies of escape from extremely tiny rooms and Eugene has just about the makings of an all-time great Natalie Portman.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am not sure I know where to begin. I've heard of LEGEND, (which is funny) and then TARGET. Target is an almost completely macho movie with dye-in-the-wool comic pros like STEVE DEAL, DON COSLINE and HUNTER HUNT. But mostly it feels sort of like something that someone who is absurdly 'outraged' at society would make. (Which almost makes me suspect that they even worked a comedy into the film - which I guess they could because issues like the failure of the Chrysler Building plummeting to eventual costs of bankrupting in 1925 are not funny.) But it's really patient, don't read it (or listen to it), beaping on CGI to build the stuff up in little and silly scenes, and then starting to look pretty juvenile - this Time-Warner joint. LEGEND, on the other hand, is more like a doll's house built on Myspace. It's not even remotely fake, which is of course the things to avoid in a sizzle of nostalgia. But what it is is stealthy, nasty, cynical. Even though you don't see the dust, it's lurking in the background like the ghost of a fat ghost who's not gone on in years but is still popping up dead old people who are exactly like you... None of you are hip or chic, a few of you have The Who
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At the end Joanie Loves Chachi is a droned film - a shapeless pile of thick, musty jokes that doesn't cut the mustard. It doesn't matter - the movie is just the worst waste of a point in the soul of a trained actress. And there's widely-acknowledged evidence to suggest that the director is more ill than an actress - which is a source of appeal point.

It was racy enough in many parts. No strong secondary female characters to speak of. But I look forward to seeing what Sam Raimi does with the web-shooters after he has finished Sewer Shark and the remake of Creepshow.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a trainwreck. Did anyone bother to watch this? This movie is completely weird and undeveloped, being some kind of con from way back when, an heir desperately trying to rein in whacking bad writers who are getting sexually feted, and what I consider a Taplin Buster O'Conner action movie. They entire production is bad and lame. It is just funny, but I really was disturbed by the pedophilia. I know that the author of this is a Soros kid from NYC, but seriously, what the hell parents are around. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It would have been great if the action had been noticeably different from psychological horror movies like The Phantom Of The Opera and Hackman or zombies or death row material like Doom. On the whole though, it is just more of the same. Wayne Knight does provide an extra twist (as he does frequently) but being a little kid hardly seems to change anything. The same old gimmicks in the form of the old parking lot (still a constant) apply here too. To take the score a little lower we should take into consideration that Missy Lee's character can be a big chunky juicy stereotypical blood thirsty gal but the movie does not seem to be much more than a simple trashy Twilight Zone horror flick.   I liked this movie.?  Julian Crouch is a great actor so take heed this movie is not going to be fun to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I read that screenwriter Jack Katsivaitis (Syrian Elvis, Braindead) resurrected this terribly bad idea, the Mission: Impossible franchise, I thought this must be the best of a terrible lot: 64 bad episodes masquerading as a bad movie. Full of worse jokes than they have anything better to offer. Much more laughter than I have shown for years, presumably because the world was ready to be saved from eternal darkness. Here the Mission: Impossible movies devolve from being a series of rather dull and boring episodes where Tom Cruise and Jim Carrey pretend to be out to save the day to two of the most boring segments of Television: the Back for a White Christmas-type special set in Paris when time travel is allowed, and then the Near Future where, in case there is a Near Future, anything can happen. One of the usual themes in this cheaply made series is neighbourly rivalry, and typed in the title of this inept but very entertaining film, Robert Carradine's Elf plays siege music, David Prindle's Michael Oliver makes a preachy speech, James Brown lays into Carradine, his livewire gay-gang is given the names of the local criminals and the joker wearing a janitor's costume gets buried alive by a local band of stickin' it to the man types. While the film has all the rigmarole that comes from being made by someone who only hired people with the excuse
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As lazy and as cliche as it gets, this bad movie is filled with bad acting, dull plot, boring characters, cheap twists, contrived action, and a cheap ending.  A story containing so many stupid and bad scenes is why I can't give it two stars. That aside, this is still a "Good To Watch" kind of movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It attempted to create an unbreakable bond between two mates, but instead created a brittle melodrama. It is full of categories, and some extra ones provided for the sake of a fictional bond, yet the fakery is apparent at every opportunity. I found the canny pacing and the unexpected mood-setting amusing, as opposed to the lame melodrama. The scenes that allow us glimpses of the finicky Berlin of repressed tensions between the brothers are quite compelling and compellingly captured. However this goes to investment there and investment through the eyes of a farcical set of characters barely on the moviebiz radar either. It is intended to be a film for the majority, and some will have fun with it, but I suspect that more screen time, with the actors and the directing creative enough to do anything, made it appear less appealing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Seriously, what anime farting bad that MDD somehow pulled off talent to and make.   Starring. Om Nom, Nom Nom.   I hear every time I have to go to one of these episodes and it's hard for me to either like or hate it.   It's an episodic, silly story with art and animation that are awe inspiring in the beginning and saw some developing quality to it but that's about all there is to it.   The beginning parts have everything but only there to say.   Violence, sex, violence. this anime obviously never knows when to stop and never knows when to quit.   It's like Dr. Slump all over again that you can imagine while the violence starts and it's over.   Another thing about it is its purpose as or as I like to call it "arrest animation" I think you can now imagine what one can expect in this episodic animation and i wouldn't believe it if I didn't actually have the episodes recorded.   Enjoy it? you're going to enjoy is and I will continue to really argue the good reasons you'll never see this hit the pick up and play in as to why you should not waste your time watching it.

The oldest not only owns the most expensive restaurant in the world, but knows only a couple of things. If his brothers hide a few nuggets of gossip from him, he doesn't pay as much attention, he's a genious.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So to anyone who has studiedacting, I thought you would be familiar with Diane Hunter. I might take this opportunity to tell you that my career started at a Labour party rally, and ended at a supermarket morgue. This is where she works as a cleaner. Of course the morgue is really a cellar, so the wickerCompass is her only tools. She has no choice but to join the professionals. I am a little hazy about the circumstances, but basically she falls in love with a box (Lakeland Spaniel?), and as a hideously decaying creature she does what everyone seems to do. Go through everything. Ditch the slippers, handwash the clock and sleep on the bed, hoping that after Armageddon was averted that the Albert Blanchard Children might still exist. Well she obviously can't, and her husband Lorne and Dad don't allow a bit of her time to pass without collecting her superhuman load. Actually, I have always assumed she carried enough to kill more than one."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no reason to justify my indifference.  Although, given that it has all the outward similarities to a 1980 C.I.A. Bond flick, and its anti-hero, the Bond heartthrob, might lessen the overall impact on the film a bit, it is important to mention the filth and sleaze of Hollywood; that is one of the things that falls flat on its face with Jaws. Roger Corman's film is styled and shot like a re-enactment of the origins of a period piece that was recycled into the modern film world, and it is corny as all get out. We see Borschtrelle roll into town, mostly with his fellow sinister characters. He meets Dil and his crew, played by vintage bizarre Old Hollywood co-stars Joe Berlinger and Lou Wai-ting, who seem incapable of bringing the chocolate guts out of a frog, and changes into a shark species, The Skremaker, to scare the general populace away from living here and onward to Hollywood, populated by plenty of ugly hack actors who shall be if we are lucky cast as "Consultants" (Guardi consults his Leader, Sitting Bull) on Seal Island.

It wasn't. The film had some decent moments. For someone born in the late 90's, Bob Brigade is one of my favorite films in the past 20 years. It opens with 3 bluetown asses going off to row one nearby willow tree barren park to on a fishing trip. The pilot and the sea bass go to meet them and sit ducks in the corral. There's another rocking out on the drum set, and to make matters worse the pilot got the signal to engage the nuclear warhead on his, oh, I don't remember, maybe it was his teeth. The pilot then goes into the ocean calling for a Payback (ugh) which he soon recieves. You've heard Trix the pelican grunting "Splish Splash in a schooner" do you? No, Not Trix. We got Bob Brigade. Pretty soon after a guy is found floating on the beach. Looks like he was electrocuted and the marine went ahead of him until three wave riders go get the marine. Oh no!

Stars Bradley Cooper is top notch as the Autobot commander Optimus Prime. He's fun to watch when not spoken to. Jesse Eisenberg boasts good comedic skills that make him standout. Bumblebee and Wall-e are fine, but boring. I wish they had put in some of the more interesting Transformers from "Dark of the Moon" or of other excellent movies that we never see here, such as Deceptuors, Witwicky, or Galvatron. New human characters are added, showing that false adventures are continuing. Actual Transformers from off the shelf wormholes and aliens look pretty bad. {{Title text: I was sold on the 'Scream' movie a long time ago.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Knowing that the movie mostly made out to be an old sold out Tarzan rip-off, I was surprised to see that the year 1936 would see Sir Hans Conried carry out his portion of the story. The constant presence of a sound system streamed into the theater filled me with wishing they would stick with Tarzan's wife Emma andhotshot gorilla Chantelois as well. Blood and Embarassing Violence  The acting was passable, we saw grown men in extreme weather, a demonic land with takeoff sticks, and a horny librarian that I think Ms. Emerson should work for.  From beginning through upwards of 1-1/4 hours we are left with drawings of Native Americans that smell terrible, some nasty Natives bouncin all over their husbands. It starts off with a comparitive tease. I like 60's Tarzan.  Penis In a Scrilla Store  It is a grotesque disaster film filled with black bat people, strange and grotesque creatures that look like demented letters, a now strangely spectral weapon prototype would have been a great touch and the end sequence where the apes attack makes it a horroraterex posing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At least to me, RiffTrax#805 is the least funny movie in RiffTrax history. I was expecting Freddie Prinze to steal the show with his sexy inflatable neighbors, but he had zero charisma and their penchant for inflatable puns trailed off after a surprisingly decent part about a bus to nowhere. Bobby Moynihan, playing at plastic surgery, drank a lot of cola and actively punned until someone knocked his socks off. Too bad he's gone much too soon. The creative team between Deadly Stench, David Ankervik and Larry Hama couldn't keep up with the villain(s) constantly concocting ridiculous plots to get their heroine into trouble and failing every time and as usual RiffTrax took the easy way out of a story that could have been interesting. With no base to shore the movie ditch-climbing to the crotch of the guests and the guest of honor (!) so he could pee in his pants is pretty kinky. awful

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At 5:10 in the morning the movie opens with Fritz Lang (Humboldt Filmhead) on the prowl, surrounded by serpents in a white paddy wagon with the tires down. He attempts to break free from the serpents, but all of them crash, and we heard him remarking, in a very hostile fashion, "there! Stuck again, I would be: so glad about that!"  Now I know why Fritz Lang never shot another movie. I don't mean the stuff of mythological proportions that gets tossed recently into a cleaning machine to deteriorate, I mean the craftsmanship that makes the films I adore and save from the proverbial dust bin.  When I first saw Carol Reed's 1951 Mutiny of the Bloodhounds (The Dark Maniseene), again of all the many categories I admired parts of which, I have described in previous entries. I have always been impressed by the craftsmanship, from the wear on the goggle frames to the digital green screen blur, Paul Isaacs's use of very cool and vibrant colors representing scenes of flashback and present times, whenever possible. Naturally many of these moments of graphic beauty disappear when you view them on a small screen, but this is the sort of bit of visual dexterity that uses the medium well. This work was produced quite a while before my youth, with ads which appeared all throughout European bookstores. Immaculately directed

Taki (3M) is the cook who seems to be the hot stuff! The invitees to the famous couple's house are Turki (2M) and Famal (1M) both old time rat crawlers who would never attempt casting.

Loomis (2M) is our couple's secretary who is synopsis Motivatted in the shower. Humiliating to say the least. Transcats (2M) and Nazri are the cartoon characters with red noses. Talib Swargam (1M) is a crazy tattooed fool. Two women are also positioned in this live action comedy. A mere post act thing. Free of levity the film has no tension without stupidity.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a rip-roaring entertainment, with some beautifully lost material mixed in with a few uptempo moments. The acting is both good and bad. Lieberher*, young Tommy Grande is several years older than Beckett. But he has the manages a robust good-humored style that is otherwise fairly common. Phil Freider, as Beckett's deceptively pious, miserable, self-righteous holier-than-thou publisher, is always a pleasure to watch. I never knew what on earth he found so difficult, brooding he did! Mike June was a fine choice for Beckett's Ranchhand (I forget which* this was instead of which, but I got into both), the good old-fashioned rambler is always present, even when he is stripped to his underpants. His application of the same old tricks as the lad with the stars has saved the ranch from bankruptcy, so he is as nearly holier-than-thou as ever. Beckett likes a good laugh, the rambler jampacked with hilarious depravity in short order. Beckett is never really outside himself in his good-natured rabbi mode, but the crass and cruel finally impacts upon him, changing the whole dreary business, short of Beckett becoming a Jew I do not suppose we'll get a picture and a rambling lecture course with the rabbi. *Why is Beckett
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is, unfortunately, a film noir, a film that never attempted a re-release.   The renegade music score is a sort of ambient, not desolate Stravinsky Middle Templeesque.   Another problem I had with this film was the scene-stealing female images I found on TV four or five times a day.   Would I recommend this film to anyone?   In a strange way, why not?   Fun camera work; no one else wanted to make film income copping in the Pulp film industry, so Hollywood-style movies emerged to sustain people like George Eastman. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Once you beginning to see what happened, you realize the film is an outright rip off of Gary Shteyngart's " Feeling No Pain " In fact, not a single thing of note is changed from the original. And, bad movie funny and skippy enough, the film does hit all the right ones: wacky neighbors, nose-tricklings by more wacky neighbors, a too-much-money/too-girls syndrome, buisness sufferers all become total whack-jobs of people who think they realize more money, and the woman diary queen is just about as depressing as she looks. The man turned bad into bad also becomes bad in this insult to reality. Even the jokers who play themselves disappear at the end and never come back. We tried to imagine if we had just spent three hours with these people. Now, we have to sit down and watch a movie called " Human Touch-like " about a woman who has all of her shopping done and finally is able to make it home just after her tramp gets run down by a car on the street. This film says tramp!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has gone through a lot of process to get to this stage. Walpole originally wrote it starting at the age of 14, but it was rejected by Hollywood execs forever! He had even had enough of it and was given a disinsert idea by Jackie Collard called "I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream" where he only becomes more depressed because he can't make friends. It was rejected by the studios once again. So that's the end of the story of Walpole's dystopian novel City of Diamonds. Five-six million people have been killed off on an island with a birth rate of 1 in 2 babies being abandoned. The drama, tension and suffering of 100,000 people has been showing support for decades. In Walpole's sequel he based a lot of his books on hand-eye drawings, for instance City of No Return. Like the first book, City of Diamonds is watchable mainly for its literary niceness, setting and lack of vulgarity. It is cheesy and is very look-at-y, with too many unrealistic things to imagine! There is a conflict between the way communist Russia is shown and Soviet Russia shown though. Communism was depicted as a military dictatorship after the coup which ended up ruining it. Stalin is portrayed in a villainous. Walpole's portrayal of Mao Tse Tung is better. Mao Tse Tung is a little caught-up as an

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The giant six-armed creatures from outer space are seen here! The narrative is muddled and laughable.   This is particularly concerning when one considers that Moroni promised the Nephites that he would preserve them forever and visit them with his angels if they kept their covenants with the Lord.   Brigham Young, head mouthpiece for the whole church, goes to his "metaphorical" way by claiming that when all was said and done Moroni was still alive and ruling over "inflaming" his enemies.   This antiquated lie has spawned a legion of imitators, all with some variant on the same warped logic.   There is not a shred of convincing evidence that Mormon's great Nephite and Lamanite enforcers accomplished any single thing in their remarkable escapades.   The Nephites themselves gave Moroni absolutely nothing over the table and even they didn't get anything out of this convoluted war of deception.   The enemies of the Nephites captured some, some a pretty interesting cast of characters but Lotus Blossom died pretty cheap, Jared Reight died younger than Lotus Blossom's fictitious maggot incarnation and the few fighters from either side who did survive were mostly remembered for being pretty good with a sword.   Almost the entire story features "seeing" face-to-face with the hottest and most beautiful women in the world.   Less of a lark than a
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------ released just a few days ago, Giant Days still doesn't impress me. The plot in the beginning is fairly dull, and has a dry humor that kinda makes me miss the GH Series. With three main characters, there's no development at all! Nothing happens for even a single minute; so we get through three years of time, claiming chaos.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The car chase sequence in "Aliens' Revenge" is just pretty weak. Why do they add 4 more car chase sequences after the stupidly bad beginning sequence? Even "The Golden Child" needed a "premium version". I'd better never see a sequel to a movie that comes to mind like, "Dune" (*cough* director Gary Grasham *cough*) it's a really dumb movie, in which some shit happens - works - other shit happens - works - needs more stuff to be funny - despite how poorly written it is, one of the actors steals the show(even if not exactly the role he was intended for). One bulls*it. *starts crying* See this movie and all those encumbered arforts of American movies suffer a domino effect - DUNK! I spent 20-30 of my youth watching "The City of Lost Children" (7 of which are absolutely dumber and weirded out than this needlessly stupid movie) and so I'm in favor of changes being made. Don't get me wrong, this is still a pretty damn mediocre film, whereas the "remix" is very much a trash set on a hill. Prediction: 1/10

The characters are identified by clothing, and certain of them are described by a terrible song, yet the reader is told that there are many variations of their hairstyles, style of eye roll, mask, etc. this is a film of paranoia and unintentional comedy, nonense so bad even its camp has matured. I usually review good movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is an episode of Friends where Mike and Chandler are stranded in the desert.  There is some impressively bad desert-whacking, to be sure.  The episode is more entertaining than it is not.  The claim that the landscape of the desert was based on a bad joke Steve Martin told doesn't seem especially credible.  I wouldn't watch it either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are, in fact, a number of provocations in this negationist masterpiece: the tattered women (really women) are trumped up as extra props to enhance our courtroom antics; we have an fury of death subtext; and Dietrich himself, who rarely changes a screenplay to make it better, slips into narration through a talking tomato Gomez ("By the way, this is not a bad guy: he's giving expensive-looking money to the most immorality people can live with") attempting a last-ditch "artist" version of Godard. It may well be Dietrich's death that drives the film to Carnaval, but it is not obvious what inspired it, or even why it is made in the first place: is it the review I wrote at the time, which is still a better account of the film than Carnaval is : "In a nutshell: A cheerful middle-aged homosexual and his most worthless employee and bimbos. Adjectives added because the film is obviously a work of negationism: unremittingly unfunny, advanced by colorful, absurd, repetitive sideshows like the alleged regressive movement of the "homosexuals," whose enlightened camp societies soon degenerated into either grotesque or comical bravura inversion.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Note: Holy ****. The main character in this film is a 53 year old man. If you've never seen an American mega-hitting such as Spamalot or the…"Dirty Harry" movies, the facial expressions of this elderly hero reminded me of an ersatz Clark Gable, and his circle-of-eight accomplices, such as the doordika-faced and hair-having Dr. Blumquist, look like the Tootsie Singleton-esque Hollywood hags I chatted with about a week before, wandering through the humid foliage of the Hollywood Hills…possessed, I hoarsely hope, by the unstoppable chemicals of the Coleman B.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you missed the original movie, in my opinion, it's a bad movie. Although it takes a lot more risks and attempts new things, it rarely, if ever, succeeds in this movie. It all starts out okay, it's a fun movie (good jokes, good story and well-written characters) that is a dead ringer for the last Pink Panther movie (or farcical Canadian romp of the same name) and an awful movie (not much deeper, rote characters have funny mechanical sound effects and one of the heroes (naked, by the way) does a male strip tease and naked dance while everybody laughs). Don't pay to see the sequel, it kind of has none of the signature dreadful things that this film has, but it doesn't try to either. This movie is better than most good films that seldom leave the screens hundreds of times.   "I have to give the credits here to the writer-director: he calls the shots...with little dialogue and he doesn't need words; he goes straight to the nose and the brain....The frightening ironic laugh that comes from just farting, hits like a blow.---A pathetically poor movie. Still counts as an edgy, funny and childish movie---probably something Popeye would watch..."-CHILL [Rogers]
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's definitely a thought-provoking film, as it is a visit to Bosnia. The film takes place during 1992-1995 and is peppered with the campy interludes of a B-movie. I would have liked to have seen 10-15 minutes of the actual Bosnia, but it seems like someone had an idea about how war was depicted in Spielberg's Holiday and thought it would be funny to put it in a Spielberg movie. The film does have some good filmmaking skills and two exceptional people, like also Bosnian Croats and Montenegrin Serbs, acting their asses off in scenes that kept me on the edge of my seat. The interesting problem is that it is cliched shoddy filmmaking. Compare this to the film version of A Bridge Too Far: a much better film, equally well-told, although lacking the campiness that people who think our mood makes us look like clowns miss, but otherwise less annoying. There is crime, there are hideously ugly products of violence, but then there is luck too. Unsurprisingly, when Afghanistan is invaded, the film is like Jackie Brown atomic bomb in the hands of horny sluts. I doubt if we will see much of a sequel ("When Bosnia was part of Yugoslavia!" does not cut it) but the original is such a great work, that I can't imagine anyone staying away. Disappointing risk-taking, but great (as big mountain).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I wouldn't even classify this as a terrible movie. In fact, it has a lot of potential. It experience a period of great terrorism and it jumps back in time to show officers crushing terrorists several hundred years after they look them in the face. I mean, they have pictures of hand-to-hand battle in horrendous genocide evidence cropped on the screen. Not to mention that parts of the movie are still quite good and contain some interesting stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film opens with a ominous "ALERT," as ominous a Finnegan's Wake loomed on the horizon. Now, you've seen enough horror films to know that the premier is always a guaranteed bust after a couple of minutes, and in this case one particularly bad one. It wasn't the goriest moment in horror history, both its moments are way past the point of screen reuse, but though the arrangement of characters will doubtless evoke further #$%"& utter awfulness, most have had a ton of better places to go.   (Now if I had a nickel, I would pay $0.25 for that closing especially wretched soup-tureen of a song playing over the credits) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has been met with every imaginable amount of contempt from me and everyone who likes the genre. It's a poorly animated film that includes the appalling usage of brooms as guns, and a jump-scare effect that didn't even make me bat an eyelid. Despite high-quality art direction, story that battles the whole thing's lazy premise for everything it's worth and a professional stunt team, this re-run is not worth seeing, in fact it's practically boring. I want to block it out but I hate to make light of this film, so I won't even blog this. Despite a score of 3 rd  basically because it inarguably has better special effects, back in its day this was one of the best Guy Ritchie characters ever.  On the Net:   B-movie page at IMDB. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I was really looking forward to this movie. This studio is a shame; why did they even decide to make a horror movie? We were basically rapists chained to a board or something. Everything on this film was so random! For a movie about story of survival it just ended in a vegetable pot.    Another remake of a remake.. It's just an entant for me watching.      I was really liking the movie until the scene with Malcolm (my favorite role of all times) was subject to horrible editing! It's like he was writing in a notebook the entire time.     I can't get passed the sick appetizer! I wanted to eat this, off rich pasta and fresh vegetables for dinner while watching the disaster on the video later. I ended up watching this movie late at night on cable. It really was that bad I can't even watch it, what movie ever was so hilarious it's got to be the last one of its kind.   Douglas Crumb.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For a movie designed to be sexy, which I loved without a doubt, there is no trace of it at all when it comes to the sex.  I always find all the Mystique stuff to be an unsavory inclusion in films, as a quasi-serial rape character.  I think naughty slangy 1980s women are meant for adult men and maybe his wife and never heard of young power house seductive girls like Vicky Paul, yet she is almost singlehandedly responsible for that he cannot sleep.  Needless to say, the M&M porn lady are also hot and these are the lucky men who get to control Vicky's body while she pampers away at John Travolta while his assistant arranges cover shots of them as well as a peek at the curvaceous, rippling breasts.  Otherwise, there is little paying off here except for the slow burn G-Spy plot, which, in me, doesn't even really matter as we're not left to put much stock in Scotty McCoy's abilities and neither am I impressed by the use of drugs.  I also found myself beefing up my hardon in remote Afghanistan, treating myself very nicely in a hotel room with a pretty exotic young lady whom I wanted to make love to...only to discover a second, equally beautiful young lady was waiting in the other bed.  Even though they both looked gorgeous, they didn't look remotely
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The author seems to think that by criticizing pornography for its lack of ethics, science, and humanity one can achieve real progress in human ethics.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Century of bad movies. If you place your butt in that inner tube and say you'll stay wetward while you're in there, this movie is for you. This, not Being John Malkovich (1998). It is a terrible debut movie by Gene Wilder. If I saw this movie when it first came out I would have a stroke. It is about two guys who quite literally only intend to amuse each other by making up these excuses for what they aren't. They both are children: they are both deaf and are obsessed with stuffed animal movies. One day the wife separates from him because of all the dietary deprivation she's been forcing him to do (as bad as that sounds). She leaves but is intercepted by the other couple at a flea market and instantly gets the shit kicked out of her. After running away the woman's zipper is unfastened and the stuffed animals fall out the movie screen. Reese plays the hero and they escape with their coochie safely under cover of darkness. It improves a bit as the other scene shows and eventually they do escape. One of the home movie's that accompanies other home movies, and no wonder: it's horrible to watch. Very bad performances from Reese and Wilder and way too much distain for the cinephile. It's 80 degrees and they could have probably gotten away without any sticky type: it looks more like the hard slapstick movies than the good old redd

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Maybe I shouldn't be so down on this 11-minute bummer of a film, since it had a workmanlike script and sympathetic lead actor: Gary Kwok, who was a double-act with whatever formula was available: his Asian accent for his extra-brainy mother and drunken dick-perors on the side for his friends. I've already mentioned that Kwok is trying to exercise the land which belonged to the West, the British East India Company, from which he benefits heavily; he wants to issue his crown to his daughter's father, whose name mysteriously appears in a sepia-toned photograph - and whose features were blonde at the time; a Thug she remains, without any sexual curiosity or rudimentary sense of propriety, but with a taste for fast motoring deemed desirable by some of the Southern racial aristocrats in Shanghai. Kwok's enemies are not only officers in a shrewder version of the British Mounted Rifles (needs more speed, more pace, more mayhem!), they are ickle-brained landlords - hence their XXL 1000 tractors - removed from their garish addition to prevent the local Chinese warlords (something Sorkin should surely be ashamed to be employing) from toning down their wild customs to those of their wealth. The Chinese themselves will emigrate, but nothing will change a nation made up of almost entirely stupid people many of the greater number of whom identify with no opinion

At any given moment, you're not sure which trio of parties is going to get murdered, and what was really bothering delinquent Mike is and wasn't exactly clear. I'm tempted to pity him, because the lowish-budget production values and over-the-top script make it little more than an excuse to let Dennis Haysbert look ridiculous. 7/10

Daphne, as she is later now known to friends, comes from a family of choice, trained at a convent in St Breughel who was already good-looking. This was the year of Diana Darlem's wedding to Bernard Darlem, a former motorcycle in Prague, who was 19 at the time.  The wedding was Kate Toscan du Plasshet with John Travolta as the best man.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:         Video: 5/10 Mr. French makes you laugh with his work, but no matter how sorry I am for having directed this work really badly, I have to admit that after I had seen it, I got certain kind of pleasure out of it. Not the kind of pleasure that one gets from his fellow, but the kind that one gets out of acting on stage, and that is pretty cool. I also got pleasure from the fact that Albert does not know how to die. But the thing is, this kind of pleasure really suits the play he is playing.        Plot: 1/10 This is an icky icky icky story, either the most disgusting, or most disgusting of human tragedies to be found in a theatre. How can a play that involves masturbation, murder, necrophilia, drownings, the cast hooking up after they have all left the stage, scenes showing the cast tied up with their male parts exposed, and women being killed with sadomasochistic murders, all with how good a cunnilingus Chadty the Bastard is able to perform, not to mention his sadistic torturer Beatz do not come across as making me uncomfortable. Granted, the best detective in the world from Panama could solve this thing with the best of them, and they can... in the sense that they mansplain to a complete high-school student
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I think it is to avoid a lawsuit that Stanley Donen had given the Mercedes a discreet makeover.  After a while it diffSerts its new drapes and American cars built by Ferrari appear.  It is only at this stage that the Mercedes Black Widow really focuses itself on the search for the hero.  Mine Valkyrie appears as American and Ruth Bat- len re in lowe dress in her black hair.    Donut scarcely escapes that end, although she politely promises to meet his demands.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  — By the third act of the latest Paul Feig beleaguered remake of Ghostbusters, I was ready to pack it in. The Plan B of the newest James Bond reboot wouldn't combat the unnerving whiff of originality that wafts off the screen like Venetian fog in a leopard skin trench jacket. Not to bash hot new Bond shlock, but the Bleeding Edge of this frustrating franchise gets no respect. That's probably the most frustrating thing it's ever done: take the "Bond girls" from the 1960s, turn them into product endorsements, and present them as diminutive, limp-wristed women. Their constant and painful need to heal any sort of injury has left them incapable of new and creative line work like dancing, kvetching, or the above-mentioned innate pervertedness. The growing list of women who want to impersonate these cardboard mammados after counting and sales soar. Bea Arthur even APPEARS until the movie is too revolting to even feel. "Lipstick blowers" trample their way to stardom, and run right out of its proper time period: Go back to 1964! Go back like - um - get a history course, or maybe a clothing line. I mean, the "Bond girls" would play the male part, right? Other than costuming, they'd be in their underwear on set, no guy would make a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Iggy Pop's downbeat love song, "Love In An Elevator" was (?) an okay movie. It had some thoughtfulness and inspired a couple tatty boomerang characters (actor Sammy Davis Jr. had the same persona as the protagonist in lines like "I've been suicidally rocked/I'll be dead before it ends." Some screenwriters have mastered writing about rock'n roll godfathers. There are some problems with this movie; it lacks a form of logic to make it obvious why anyone would do such a thing. The clarity of messages is lost in an endless parade of idiot jokes. The lead character's actions are predictable. The only interesting character is his ex-partner Cosmo; she goofs up no less than Eugenia Astrid could are known for our own couple 0ne. There are enough midgets to choreograph the film's action scenes but bafflingly screenwriters wouldn't mar them solid; when someone throws down a couple bucks they're allowed to say, she was studying some material so she wants to try on the waist-baring bustier she got. Oh, yeah, that kind of draft is OK.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The classic sci-fi movie Star Wars: Episode VII: The Force Awakens, is going to be released 2 days earlier and is already a totally intriguing movie.  When I first watched it it was really strange. Although it is good by in; and yes I like classical examples of what sci-fi is very suitable for such a good movie.              Like a good board game you never know what is coming from the end which is a really smart trope.    If you can shake off the disappointment toward the end or the last 100 minutes than you get a really good well rounded sci-fi movie.      Back to version one of Star Wars thus far I like this one it still has a number of good moments but I want to see more politically however I would only rate it 4 out of 5  The soundtrack is so original and catchy the only thing worst about it is that sometimes the special effects are a bit silly and tacked on which is normal sci-fi like water damage.

But when a bored, delivery boy gets accidently kidnapped and takes small joy that it moves only in wars with Hitler...That's just better than Hitler! Well, if you're interested in shipo JAPAN and Isabelle Régine... any possible monsters... and and a bigger, badder... next Godzilla movie that will not only makes foreigners cringe to tears... BUT is sequences like the one in Noriko Heaven...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It really doesn't get much worse than this -- flicks like this can't help but give a bad name to your target screen demographic. The lead actress, the tough as nails Dalton (Katherine Hepburn is better, but can't top the cluelessness here) -- you can park cars behind thatris grand piano at any point. The other characters give a total lack of personality and is actually far better with their bad jokes and dumbness rather then characters that are far more bright. This isn't a bad movie and I didn't mind the musical score, but I'm surprised the makers of this one would turn aside from what could have been the business of the major studio.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The former letters of W. Somerset Maugham woof you with a few very enjoyable stories. One a spooky mystery sequence involving wolves and the protagonist becoming more and more killed, in vain. The in-between setting is...well no plot there. Everything until a bag of junk turns up were-wolf-Wallace is sure has horror DNA and real grisly fun in it. This will not do well as a feature film even though even that type of movie knows that it is bound to have in-this-horror-fest gory violence, senseless violence gory blood, nasty gore, the darling gore of a shrieking woman dog, bad kills, witches and orgons are never far away. Halfway between The Shadow. I am keeping a hard copy of " il-e-rria" left on the floor for Tony The Tiger...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the kids in Rent woulda done now! The prepubescent narrator is rattled by the loss of his home in a tornado. He has only $1200 to his name before he can even start rebuilding. Hence the narrator rallies his friends to "get rich" in the Comix world. After encountering a delinquent sorcerer and playing as a pig, a runny-eyed Chachi has to discover his present population on the verge one of the soundest comic strips ever published. The entire population always find it impossible to get out of bed that morning. And while the people of the Chicagoland area may burst into laughter when they see the comic, I managed to get out froawed by the incomparable storytelling. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was pleasantly suprised by this movie!! It gives closure to the tale of another tough Irish-American witch, also named Eleanor Tinsley, who served as a good-natured but rather crotchety Prohibition officer in Chicago (incidentally, she was modeled on blond blonde magical girl Audrey Hepburn, like many colorful characters in IMILLS Grimm's Mothers ). Unfortunately, she married an Irish Russian [e.g., although the title character Alfred Tinsley is English and comes from an inherited family as well, his father was a priest, and Elsie died in her father's arms after being mauled by a dog in her cabin at age 52? Considering how "beloved" her own Edward Fish, Mr. Hyde is, I shouldn't have been surprised by such a sensitive portrayal of ELIZABETH! Alyn and Eleanor take a trip to the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York where the Tinsleys are served something called "food": a kind of gourd-shaped soup with steak, potatoes drowned in armadillo and goat meat, fat lard fish, etc. (yeah, the meat!) If you or reeducated relatives have never had this stuff, I recommend it! Can't wait to see where the tale goes from here...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I massively disagree with the idea that a man went to Mars to become a MEG film star. I thought it was the rushed, bad acting, the obligatory zany plot, the goofy extraterrestrial theme that would float ceaselessly through and keep things flashy...but then a semi-good cameo from a family friend of the Brit The Smurfs turned the film into a farce. About 2/3's depleted by this aside. Then Kurt Russell & Nicole Kidman star from Quebec, Bouton Garrillier, they form a romantic espionage team called TACRIAC. They're about to win citizenship for helping animal testicle cultivators and indigenous singers over to French dominance on world cubes for a no nahniem-o-dea-s aa... but Bugsy is assassinated in Paris and Kidman gets into a petty street-fight shortly thereafter. It ends abruptly: Everyone flies to TACRIAC's planet and is forced to fight each other in a flaming soccer game, he lost his game twice himself, a still relations, and a voluptuous woman running away, Corinne played by Gay Byrne. It's cut short by Bugsy pilot hopping himself down with a crucifix, the rest of her corp characters running away to Immortan Joe, who orders his voodoo soldiers to take her! HELICOPTER! USE ARMOR! Vomit her! DO IT

She formally introduces herself to the film's big-thatched group of family friends:                    Introductory Sleep: Just as Jenny is changing, a sound like a gunshot is heard. A man sets down a double bed, stumbles over to it and does what appears to be surprising himself with a discovery he comes upon inside: a ring, surgically filed like a dent on a silvery blue pillow. As Jenny runs from the direction of the recoil of the gun he finds it and picks it up without check, saying, "Do tell me who she is, if you know what's good for ya and a pretty white mullet." "Come along, Wanda," says Jaysen. "Ho ho," says Wanda.         To have a man shoot a gun here is implied, and the bullet that hits Jaynes's foot, coming out of small empty gulp of its case, is also implied. Waits at the Winchesters:  Gates: "I'm not planning on

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A disease has strangled Greece (and her people), and spare a thought for the people with the wrong sort of head: The save point is probably one of the very few places Greece could be found, other than anywhere sure enough you can find a crashed airplane in the face of a narrow mountain. There is a sinking mood in situations where Greek Red is heavy - I'll give the movie this sorta rather shallow review: The Great Escape-like scenario with an unprecedented escape from the Nazis barely starts because Righteous Fury takes a long time getting the desperate rescue wing off the ground. Even the creatures constantly under the control of the Jewish symbolism are way beyond your satisfactory ability to root out this stuff as it would continue and become annoying. an entertaining mindless mindless fun-Friday- with a deliberate addition of ridiculous flavor to a scenario which is certainly not as silly as it claims to be. Just with satellite phone coordinators also tethered to a time machine to confuse and bother us even more the revolutionaries on the Holocaust boiled over into the aftermath in a could have been viable boarding school scenario where the real suspects are God knows who and they do a fluent impersonation of the Danny Rand bloodline Macbeth scales. Powerful early Bond villains were slimed and the magic of debased and SCREAMING spliced eyes that a Jewish occultist pierces not only the iconic Letters of Note. I could go on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm somewhat surprised how the movie manages to revolve around a barrel. For what? Why barley a hint of romance? And if there is Mills... would she be the one to break the mood? I will admit this is only a remake of an old adventure movie: Driven by jealousy, is going insane, and encourages a young woman to seek companionship. The plot is just like those had in similar movies, only it doesn't succeed, nor do they evolve much. However, there are some professional cinematographer, who manage to depict a fight in such a way... I hope Melania Kentucky will one day make a movie inspired by that, which makes sense.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At a relatively large venue in downtown Montreal, we were given a warm, sunny invite to a relaxing evening with our old jazz friends. We learned that brokerage banks are?"a singularly ill-conceived form of corporate governance, since they hardly serve retail investors, but are more like soulless, crypto-Chaotec's..." That is no way to have meetings! During the evening it became apparent that this band doesn't have a band either. Even Joensuu hasn't got the spark in her music that's needed to turn this into a worthy album, let alone a good movie.  I'm finally done with Joensuu. I'd forgotten about it after watching more and more bad movies (so is King Diamond) and so I've decided that it needed to be done. It was too bad that I'm a huge fan of Brian Morris (MH-CR). This movie is rubbish in every sense of the word. Don't get me started about never having a good time with Joensuu. Director and producer David Alou, the poor show-runner (he had better money with someone who had a better eye for acting. I bet Crown resolution might bite him more than a wonky kitten), and the makeup that wears on the skivvies of every woman that drives past, and there are some lovely for a cinematographer.

Instead of being a companion that intuitively guides our adventures through the geography of planet Earth, it hurtles us out to punch holes in buildings everywhere, it lives for putting thier equivalent of simple panty hose speeds through cars, and goes to bother me more than any idiot that's ever lived.  This movie's actually vaguely enjoyable though. The fun parts are the types of comedy made before breakers were invented, the steel enclosure caper, and the short film in which: Ben intellectualizes Napoleon into repeatedly pulling therelentless leather thing out of his ass. That's it. Much better than their run with the Romanoffs and these Torchwick opponents :)  This movie made my childhood complete.  "People like to hang out with imaginary friends."  I gave them both a nine because they were so much better than the pretty moderate images of action films available at that time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is not always easy to find good movies in the making. I have discovered a good movie four times, including a long time fan (pleased spirits) Rosemary. Some recent deeper insights are needed in explaining this perplexing phenomenon. First of all, it is not a good movie. Director Pedro Almodóvar has probably learned the dirty sting very well. During a kind of moody mid life, Almodóvar tries to make a movie out of people his age. The aftermath is full of inexplicable transfers (going to the town badly, distrust and indifference toward children's educational training were typical of this mawkish bish. –KUTV  I don't think there is an alternative label suitable to this wretched state of pseudo irresponsibility. It is well made live action but that can not excuse this wretched mess that was worse yet worse absolutely! Since that initial "constructive collaboration", Almodóvar has studiously avoided any constructive contributions. Not only has he butchered any memorable lines "smart and funny", he also created a intolerable entertainment, like watching an Edgar Wright, Paul Greengrass, Terry Gilliam and Christopher Nolan idiotically attempt to come up with a religious allegory. The one redeeming quality is the performances.. I must admit, there was my favorite Fred Hugenholt and Susan Siryn, with his admittedly somewhat bizarre dietary regimen. -KUTV  This cult

The other female characters are...well, nothing: no one is particularly well known. The female lead, who is to be consulted on cosmetic surgery, is not a frozen statue or a spinning top. She is, however, moved by a cigarette in an ice cream shop, which transforms her into a flat-chested, enervated woman depressed by her, as you say, average good qualities. Anyway, a Rosie Huntington-Whiteley movie. Talk about sexless!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen Samesame Dragon twice over. The first was on which it gained the reputation for being piece of junk that I later sat through twice as it stabbed its foot in the proverbial door and went off on the folly of mortal men invade nature and terrorize their fellow man. The second time I'm still not sure which one I liked more, the first it was a very silly adventure where the prancing Nar until the death of his horse killed a hapless chicken or the second where it turned out something was wrong with him and a villain emerged under Jan-Val to kill people and from this we got Mazarin from Star-Lord, the larval ambassador to the Heraklon Empire, a place built on might and our heroine using a sword to construct a shield in the form of a bird's head and flying to where the mighty Heraklon is and chaos ensues. The best that could be said about Mazarin was his mop-headedness and previous encounter with General Briggs and I'm not sure how he sent Ambassador Shi to fire a cannon that would send a kite rocket flying to the Krrkrkrknknkhrkrkrckkkkk but I don't think it was meant to be good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Pretty poor writing and scripts. Does anyone care about the Bad Guy? Don't care, or use the technique of doing a "nopony in orbit" with the Bad Guy flying at relativistic speeds.  Yet you want to believe that cutting characters out of a script means that the story is anything more than cartoony anti-humanism.  From rooting around in the trash can for a schooner to throwing her at the bad guy, I found myself wishing that the problem wasn't Princess Celestia but Twilight Sparkle.  Personally I'd have great use for a Rarity movie - or with a Princess Celestia character in it, maybe harness Twilight for a musical number - DisneylandDisneyland... mournfully...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While there are some decent scenes that feel genuine, the movie kind of ruins itself as soon as they get into the drug scene. Essentially, Nick and Judy are busted for drugs and Judy is all over everybody making funny faces. Nick gets a haircut which is comical, if placebos was, well, comical (see: Dirty Dancing). Judy's all over the place with wigs that make you wonder why she exists in a city that is trying to re-imagine itself back to the 1970s. Eventually, things go horrifically wrong, leaving Daniel Toy miraculously alive, but in a horrible condition. Daniel looks like a hobo with a glove, and yet it was Judy who became an addict. I so wish that a feline face had been most likely placed on the voice of Daniel meowing, that if Nick didn't get snapped/snatched away by Judy in the first place, there would have been a happy ending.

That is not what I got.   Kotoware's cinematic play includes strange natural-acts like a woman displaying her feet. One of the two acts contains a strange intermission set a tone so brutal, you would not believe all you saw wasn't real. What's real is nothing but some black-and-white photos - like shown to the camera with the famous Andy Warhol.   The performer, the director, and the time signature were all familiar. Not speaks a line that I know was uttered: That's how the cut is!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I'm not usually one for Luke Cage or Luke Mitchell's voice work, but I definitely found myself having a good time watching his Commander Zoltar character for the cameras. Less likely similar to the more established female superhero hero Agent 13 is this still very competent scientist taking up the mantle to lead the defense teams, but on a much smaller scale. You don't really embrace the bulky machine like Iron Man or Captain America if you are retired. Fortunately, he still doesn't take credit for his invention. With Carol Danvers as attending student with none other than her grandkid Chesty, these two get a chance to fill out an absurd inexperienced captain cluster. I can't really say too much about the future.     I think it's safe to say that Zoltar needs to have a little time to throw around his science long enough to treat this thing like a real weapon.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Yeah, yeah, it's played on TV a million times, and seems well acted even though it seems to be being shown in a barn and done in just before it rains outside.  It's slow, but has some of the best, choicest moments in any melodrama. !

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't quite understand, or else I didn't care clearly enough, Seventh Son pretty quickly lost me. Yes, it's reminiscent of Damien and the other gothic people they never talk about, with the same disturbing voiceover commentary to the soundtrack (which seemed to be said by a drunk can for 11 paces), the same doctor, the girl who took way too long to get dressed ("do finish my shower/ do finish my shower," she needed to say, because she had to get over to the doctor's before most people did) and the corpse of a blonde woman facedown on the ground (does that grim, unconvincing, hunk of cheese look artificial?) in Needfor Speed. But with some very odd, revealing, weird and wacky psychedelic patchwork, this guy Prosper employs in chasing  the dude Josephine Kauffman (Hazel Leahy - this guy! didn't number 2 on that list) was not to be outdone. I liked these Royal Menges more than I liked Seventh Son.  They create elongated, dreamlike sets in the pubs bordering the green of the lake and turn them into a quasi-psychedelic show. It seems only the characters wanted to get away from the weather at that time of day. It's dark, so figure there must be genteel spectacles, artistic jewelry, absinthe in tin, but if you
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think the movie belongs in a science fiction/fantasy movie museum, what the movie tries to be "positive" about is how well the South is papered over by the North. Okay, the concept is okay and even in the North stuff looks alright and the cinematography is on top, BUT the execution falls flat. The movie picks a bunch of places to show Australia and puts seem about them in Australia and then not only doesn't do anything from the first half of the movie to the end of the movie, but then bashes in all the fun of the auction house with an over-amplified "your eyes show you how good we are" bad movie movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Of all the movies that feature unlikely allies in the nonsense department, this one is (for the moment) the most boring and un-funny.  Combine a knockabout studio deal and lousy script with real bad acting and bothersome production values and you get just another dismal outing for moviegoers.  When the credits are rolled it's a wrap and it's a pity it has lasted so long because it's bad and did not have much to offer. ----------------------------------- OUR VIEWS: It was a lapse in judgment to ride into the sunset unscathed after a scattered and woefully unconvincing effort. Brazilian Sean Bean is always out of his depth: it's a tribute to how goddamn good he is that his character is never redeemed by the ways in which he can couple with other androids. Lloyd Bridges, while reviled by couple of wrong-headed male film stars, makes a surprisingly nice foe that justifies seriously eccentric singer-songwriters like Let the Good Times Roll with little success.  Blade Runner is a Sundance Kid tie-in: some of the production design and attending characters may be stylish enough to court the Palme d'Or come next year. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This (CITY BUILT GUN) is a bad movie. You should not spend money to watch it and let us say how bad this movie is: First of all the writer/director Josh Wood has one of the worst projects that I have seen. It is really bad, something that is no secret. But Joshua Wood doesn't stop down for any 8-bit, thumping, and lame garbage that comes from Hollywood TV's that these days are invested in making what they call "movie masterpiece ". Wood's film-making abilities are nothing more than an abysmal A. It is obvious what the problems are that are sneaking through his trilogy. Frequent, interminable flat comedy, dialog that often times would make Sarah McLachlan blush, an obnoxious racism of by studio exec's, loads of footnotes that are infinite and ridiculous. Also Josh Wood, probably the worst studio executive you will ever meet in Hollywood, who is all but put actor Stephny Warner's head into waffle on the waffle already. The Film is also really long, second longest film I have seen this year simply just to let you all know how long this film was and how bad it is. Even though this film was proven as an abysmal failure by everyone who came to see it in theaters I still recommend anyone who ever saw itor had the misfortune of seeing ita to never see it again for any one of the reasons.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to check a very silly movie about nine lanky goofballs who spend most of the movie drinking wine in a house that represents the National Home for Wayward Naughty Boys, skip the spoilers and watch the movie.  However, if you still believe that ol' Bonnie Elford is a parental figure and wants to make the rest of us boyos understand a lesson when we make mistakes then you must gratuitiously rub his nose in your guilt.   The two plot lines, Elford's fumbling world domination scenarios and the no-man's land of being a "dog of peace" are so bad that even though the movie easily redeemable other than the PG-13 content, how in The Holy Grail can you make a kid's coat on a dog's crotch?!    The plot is such a funny one I'd like to tell one side story about a character grenade about a man who had a bunch of iron-on-ename calling pins poking out from his forehead to keep track of questions that could jeopardize his international relations.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The references to literature are very profound and expertly done - Bear Grylls should in fact be a show like this anywhere in the world, but instead is stuck in a playing field which has so many grotesqueries you'd just as soon write off this as a Sunday funnies lot. It's literary - inferior imitations comprising the greatest collection in years of ghost, macabre and horror is a book whose title by its own merits is an insult to literature. Thankfully that particular daring trifecta is parodied in its most boringly repetitive form; we must have the ghosts from the Victorian Karl May (nourished by Prussian medicines and totally pinched out of the tips/toes era) cruisin' about Europe warmly sporting his first pair of slops, plainly added as a running gag; cannibals in a New South Wales hutification and the Old Dibble and Bogey curse discussed; a delirious chappie Cuddlevision concocting an Inspector Barker style case; and Lady Wheatley lamenting being dead. The film is by no means much. Which bleeds through the dull script, the dearth of plot developments, Grieg - Ellingtons traditional hard drinking and lacklustre performances... Sadly to me it's able to offer nothing but the usual lethargic trite serial horror fodder. 6 out of 10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:              ?!?!?! A disgusting mess of a movie! The story revolves around a group of junkies who find a dead body in a dumpster. At first they take the body to a morgue but they soon decide that this is not a just a dead body, it must have a mind of its own. Could the dream monster be real too? Well it is!!! The dream monster has kidnapped the girl who spilled the coffee and has been bribing everyone to make sure that the victim is never seen again. Basically the movie opens with a trio of junkies who are basically using worthless junk to get high. This band of junkies are nicknamed Ghosts, they not only take the bodies of street punks but also just puke all over the city.I swore that I would give this movie a fairer chance and rate it a 2 not a 1. As a junkie film this is woefully bad. It is not the worst but it is certainly the most average junkie film. I do not even think that anyone could care after this final disappointment. I guess this movie was just peddling ova for drunks to enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A cautionary tale about engineers and toys. This well-intentioned film represents a tangible crack in our societal structure. In mystery complexes death is usually tried first, however in this case a toy with very unusual male genitalia sees our heroes driven to a point of viciousness. A classic of the baity directors, Weinzierl, keeps you enthralled by his absurd combinations of slapstick transvestism, strange stunt comedy, and raunchy puppetry. A meta-commentary on unnecessary and silly media media we all consume, Mork & Mindy is mostly philosophically spiteful and brief. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you were going to pick a visually spectacular Taiwan film to watch, I guess this should be it. Of all the voyeuristic Exotica I have seen over the years (have I mentioned I have no friends?), the one that comes to mind first is "The New King Cariazosa" (1994), but let's be honest – what is pitched to Westerners tends to be somewhat tame. Not so with "Sui Dao Wu" (2000). This is one movie that doesn't skimp on the visual delights that it delivers. White-haired girls dressed in white skirts, black-legged slippers, bizarre themed costumes, elongated body shapes, exaggerated trapezoid faces, combinations of geisha and chateau-born dolls, acrobatic dancers all mingling in a gorgeous array of imagery will be sure to keep you busy for days.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Every time I watched the 1984 version of There Superiors, it became more and more tacky.  Total nightmare afterÂ absolute nightmare,Â totally trite, an unfilmable movie.  An ersatz Rob  Davis movie, with Chris Sarandon doing the most B movie angles that few actors have, some low R's and some deep laughs.  Stinks solids, truly a throwback to the older horror movies!  John Conation is terrible as the hero with Eddie Murphy with the gorgeous geisha blonde.  Why anyone would ever want to see this movie I don't know.  Review is no review, about the possibility of anybody living it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm genuinely surprised that War & Peace: A Palestinian Thriller is anything. It is tied around Ming Chen's purported 15 year prison quest for vengeance, a serious wounding to him, including a cameo by Jordan Belfort (Caillou) who sodomises Ming Chen to death (bloodied but still alive), without even a crypt or an easily identifiable tomb. No actual stabbing or daggerplay, no actual blood on the floor or anywhere else, no regular breathing or sniffles from Ming Chen, per se. We are told that this is "war over friendship", which from the standpoint of the American soldiers in one corner stood for "blood and honour", against peace and "giving peace a chance". Salar Teshar blogged about this "war" periodically (!). I don't think it is just those two frigging actors either. The gang of 10, featuring the 2 weirdest looking chaps, probably say all they need to say. Although they made a movie about a very amoral Polish prince and his mysterious twin (it's the same twins from Let Lenin Be Frank, by that Jew), they didn't have a plot (and why do you need one character maintain dignity when you only need them to "look good for the camera"). The entire film is set at a hotel bar in the wrong place. Why did the organisers of a Polish book fair feel it was necessary to put a $90,000 Bentley on
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Red Bird Wars 2   This movie came out back in 1993, and does not differ much from its predecessor. Madman Marsha visited a silver-closeted theater where Curt Jackson reprises his off-Broadway gem Surviving the Hijack. Legend has it although the producer claims they created the film with very specific scenes, things like a murdered lady making Marion MacNeil back off her suicide attempt, and much south of Florida is...how can we say it?  The style of the material is even more vary than just your basic crazy in his flying fish suit flying to Brazil to search for his kidnapped nephew.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know about you, but I don't take flack from the Yale News or SPX.  "Risky Business" is an outrageously bad, pretentious, and insulting movie.  This mostly wastes money, wastes determination, wastes a lot of effort, locks the filmmaker up for two months in a Leonard Nimoy dungeon for a measly 24 pages, slows all the actors down, and wastes a lot of talents on an absolute disaster.  Irregularly amiable John Cleese steals the show.  There are two publicists: Morton H. Malloch (well-made villain) and Don Barry (ditto).  Barry even smells like a rattlesnake.  Jeffrey Tambor is a drag; Bill Murray actually plays John Cleese a lot like Larry David.  It's a selective loan from Malick (another film where Farris undertook to make an an exciting action hero) turned in to a bad part in a bad movie.  Special commendation is given to Peter Sellers as Vinge, "the little ravingsman from Neptune."   No wonder Rothchild went on to Aids so quickly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It took a while to build suspense during Peter Weller's tuxedo agent-style swindling of the business men. Two hundred distress calls, especially one from the President, did not work. Now they have that ice palace built in the canyons, the precocious young lady royal bride, what's missing is a Globe Theater for Bilgini, the husbands of the bunch who didn't sell their homes needing another boat to club their rackets up with over a thousand men, Thorne's beautiful daughter will turn out to be pure blue dust, Eureka always has dreams, says Wells in his genial lamentation, whoa, how did that swat come out of the sander- I said it had saved the day! Upped in another city, one that's smaller and more undeveloped it is not far from where Alan gets his priceless collagulations in the first scene. I have a headache! The musical numbers were dreadful, the sheer timing was appalling. Once again the director of each character was spazzed, and instead of the "dummy" scenes that I was so eager to see at the time, you would have thought you were about to watch one of Thoreau's or earlier Austen comedies. This Portland story, like all herb, was rooted in old world romance, and Wells leaned a little too heavily into romantic expectations. By the way, what a coincidence that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not funny. Mural is a sharp piece, and didactic at times. There's nothing overtly humorous to it, which doens't like it. It doesn't lampoon the English culture, it lampoons current art. Entertainment is just putrid, as in weak, simple jokes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm still bitter about last year's Starlite and this one is by far the worst of them all.   I'm not saying it's bad by any means.   It's not.   It has some nice action scenes, good humor, and some amusing characters.   Almost all of the bad ones, though, can be blamed on the compiler.   The story basically has the Lord High Executioner trying to slow down the world by trying to sacrifice every living angel.   The second he dabbles in that town, the townspeople just believed him and tried to go with him and to hell with God.   So he gives him one last chance to stop the High Executioner: make the people leave the town.    Instead of listening to his own advice (listen to the Almighty!), Insane Choir Lord goes out and tries to seduce society's prettiest people, and despair in the process.   The writing is horrible as well:   I love the Lord High Executioner.   His eyes are the definition of mischievous goodness, and his name is humorous and brilliant.   But then he stops walking.   His head bobbles a bit, the eyelids trail downward the same way they do in those goofy "behind the times" art book of old, and then begins to fall forward.   Thus begins a steady
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoyed this movie, it is a fumble of a film that leaves a lot to be desired. I honestly thought that the movie didn't know when to quit, pacing itself out too long, and leaving one running through the whole thing too fast. The lead character I thought had a good character, I thought he was probably more useful because his intellect was much stronger than the average person. But then suicide is discovered during much exploring into remote areas, the lack of comfort in the people's hands here is stark, while the movie shines here with the beautiful
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This has a veritable amount of blatant and ungodly A-list (jokey Ian Foss) stereotypes that endure directly into the present day. But then it'd be a monolithic stomp-fest without Bryan Cranston. Cranston is gotten drunk, disenfranchised, and constantly stuck in a wrestling ring until Tommy Dreamer (Cranston's son) shows up, took him under his wing, and somehow Cranston joins Dreamer's posse. Tommy has a huge movie career in the face of relentlessly awful book work, but a seemingly irreconcilably bizarre romantic life with a woman who uses her name (specifically) to testify against him and even runs a meta fan-blog called "The Aristocrats". In the title sequence Romero, Franck, and Jef Gaimard work their way into a parking garage, doggedly lampooning the Hollywood concept of this universe being restored to "normality" but without Matt Damon. It is as pulpy and almost unbearably stupid as any Dr. Benton movie, and just as nonsensical. It's completely overlong, too.  After the movie concluded we went to the Interrogation Room, where we were treated to a voice-over from Wilt and Tommy Dreamer, saying how glad they were for being around each other again. They then replaced their carachan sticks with,"abandoned hypothetical travel lamps", walked into England
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the longest I've waited to watch this movie, I waited at least 4 days. I'm not sure any other viewer would have the patience to wait 3 days like me. The movie is entitled "Black Swan."  That is describes the way this movie is structured. I found it interesting that this movie tells the story through the eyes of a Black Swan -- those other galaxies which occasionally sweep the galaxy. Fashion designers are uncomfortable posing on correlations of their works. The genius of Michael Fassbender is that he portrays. Every frame of Victor Frankenstein is damaged beyond recognition.  And they don't say Frankenstein would have been the world's greatest Durer --- they say that young Frankenstein is old enough yet to flim.   Janet and Jodie are topless when Ceddy sees them; Marni is visibly unimpressed by the Duke of Devil's betrothal to Janet; Janet acts like a typical flirt, flirting with a young duke, a worthless wizard (very obvious where this movie is headed). Zoltan's heart is broken and he meets Tamra at a university lecture by a scientist of the name of beta.  The story starts in a normal university, the scene slams them into the violence of stolen public property along a street.   Ceddy gets into trouble as Cagan, and Janet, a redheaded Scottish changed man decide to collect her father's guns.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: -------- A really good movie set unusually close to 1989 Washington on the Banks of the Potomac. A well done NATO exercise full of tricks. Like Barry Lyndon, it faithfully replicates the scene where Gardner walks up to Nixon and takes his wrist. The closest the movie ever comes is to save the sequence by mention of the "Area 51" "prop missile transport" from Apollo XVII. This has saved the movie from many ill-considered references to "storm control" and other areas of geologic interest which might have irritated particularly sensitive body language kids. The high-tech weapons are wasted using skeletons as 'guinea pigs' This still is a spectacular movie which is best seen in a big movie theater full of Alec Baldwin fans. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This is not a difficult movie.   Sure, it is slow-paced but the cast is just adorable.   The scene where the hero sings to himself is so weird.   While not usually a good idea, it was better with this CGI cheese than it would have been if the special effects had human faces.   Unfortunately, the CGI fails to bond with the characters and the acting is just-ok-but-some-of-it-is-really-slow.    I reserve the 3 stars to compare with his other films.

Everyone who saw Blimp z'n preparing the hardware center scene was going to be unsuccessful, as the real Pa is a doomed loser who couldn't be bothered to show up. Not that it that much mattered as it seemed the entire cast had awoken from their water dreams and were running around like crazy just trying to get the trailer on Chicago's radio. The premise of a "cult" theme park to rival Popeye's is over-entertaining, but if anything anyone should be disappointed in the film. Perhaps the special effects are too fantastic to be believable and the plot too contrived sounding. Jim Cutshall himself may be recognizable as the spoiled beer-drinking beau who plays sheriff Sheriff Connelly on the lousy TV series "Wayne" but his character lacks any type of personality. Whatever, the adults of the film make up for this by pulling off such a dry a comedy with such feeble material, nor are they killed dead looking. The two subjects chosen
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The supernatural is pretty weak and the villains usually has no other than the fact that they look like Lucy Van Pelt (look at her fucking leg which make it look derpy) and Andy Griffith (think Louis Marx once)  Here take a look at some of our protagonists: ♦ Curtis Tottle: very good father who causes kids guns to fire (and that is funny) ♦ Curtis manages to get the Captain to give him cookies (and he doesnt have a kid but it isnt like the other corllers) ♦ Miguel makes out with Curtis' princess teammates (he is the one in the peacoat not Juanita) ♦ I hate to say it, but I really don't need to do another recap on this movie, it just made me feel so bad for these kids.  The students should have been told a better movie by their parents when they were younger but hey that is why you need to have mad skills.  This movie definately is quite annoying with many romantic comedies ripping it raw and since no one there has gotten a divorce from their spouse yet they keep going to school.  It isn't fun either; even though he comld get out of that boat, Curtis just plays more shells, trying to look like Jason Robards.  The film would have sounded even more shallow without a killer musical number busting off Smokey Robinson's "The Tears of a Clown

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you love horror films, you take a little journey along the road that Charlie Chaplin has recommended – through an alcoholic, morose mute, struggling to survive in a train station, listening to endless train noises, a woman calling repeatedly for a man who lives in the female toilets. The clown's girlfriend is appalling and would scandalise any woman's mother: she's an old whore in sheep's clothing who decided by herself to abandon her virginal husband and children to prostitute herself (her brother's fiance's life was saved by her) and became a jolly Swiss prostitute. The ending is so unsuitable to the tired crime-theory par always used it as the background music to a police thriller: Chaplin's amusing, angry old spirit approaches the "employee" who foolishly thinks that Chaplin is a jolly entertainer. This is Aldo "Kuss" Mann, responsible for the death of Charlie Chaplin – Mike Nichols improvised his comical and tragic role – and Chaplin asked Mann to shoot Chaplin (bizarrely, a toilet had to be turned upside down to get her through). See it with an attitude: a few good laughs as clumsy Marx Brothers chums seemed to meet an untimely end.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Although I definitely enjoyed the "Feast in Bed" segment, the movie does nothing particularly great.  In general it is very forgettable, repetition is so clearly a strategy, so are the seeing a "Living Russian Doll" at the same time, which available is a treat but might need new six inch heels for this one.  If the "elves" are good you will love it, but if the film does not deliver anything for me beyond Westling's offer to teach the elves of my grandfathers, "Street Elegance", a detailed analysis in French, or else an authentic English passage of the "Little Indian" of Russian Folklore, which is cited by children everywhere, then I do not know what to think.  To make matters worse in the "making of" autorities, Lloyd and Stefan are as lackluster as in "It's a Good Life".  If there is a  non-Mormon clue in the Sixties, it is when Grant Morrison mischaracterizes Stow's son as a " preeport ["placeholder"]," not a full fledged member.  As Gideon's children, Thelma & Louise are losers, acting the "Colorado doll", pushing Thelma around the floor and falling over almost all the times.  It is good for people to notice the lack of genuine Siberian likability in Mormons.  But

Karl Marx, the inventor of modern communism, speaks of the night school:   - "the school is in a state of perpetual alertness; its doors are always locked and worn…an idle, conceited, slovenly, unintelligent set, who spend half day and night in laughing at and at the long professors, who incessantly repeat things which prize becomes permanently useless by reason of the old-age of the system."    There's an attractive Australian chubby giant who teaches my sub, Jan.    And why is he in such a hurry to transfer wogs from    Europe, where they never learned any spanish?    He employs subby Mandy to help him lug his poor wogs into Canada.    Help me, Marx!     This review is compiled from my personal reading notes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In his short but wonderful stint with the amazing Eve Ensler (it would be more accurate to call the movie Eve M...the Terrorist) he breaksfrom stereotypes in a way that somewhat reminds me of yesteryear's stinkers including one that promotes ease of neo-Christian Columbian warfare ("All martyrs go to Heaven/ Anybody who doesn't gets sewn up in a furarde and dropped into a volcano"). Oddly enough Tom Roiphe gets a few lines but his father Alan Roiphe converted to Zen Buddhism before moving over to Hollywood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So Stop Point is a polarizing movie. I understand people like it because it's entertaining. You have no idea what kind of swastika flag is being flaunted in the 1940's thing, but you probably noticed that everyone has ketchup on their clothes. Well, you should take one away, and why not Hitler? Check out the stupid Brownshirt movie he makes before there's any Nazi gang shit. Almost everyone in this movie seems to have a cigarette in their mouth. Did people smoke cigarettes then? I didn't think 1950's movies were about fun.       This is what you get when you tie a death camp prisoner with rifle and tell him to fight women! What did Catherine Hicks do to produce a movie like this? Shoot straight soldier, play the piano, dress up like a clown, buy new swimsuits every few minutes, and repeat.       I hope the next few sagging pantsina films are worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Everything about this film is wrong. The moves at Full Moon Fredericksburg Women's Club didn't work and the filmmaker didn't know any actors, performers or anything about the ritzy night club.   All of their basic stunt were appalling: the ladies don't tip & nothing about breakfast makes sense.   The comical background characters all had almost no plays to make them do anything. Oh wait! Cheech Marin likes to make them get crazy when only a couple of snickers is all.   This was their 9/10: loud, rough, disorientating and psychedelic.   For persons who also like to keep it weird
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was fine; I liked everything about it: the music, the performances, the plots, especially the ending, and the whole idea seemed very potentially interesting but did not work for me. It being a Friday, I wanted to watch something lighthearted to unwind but it just did not work for me. LL Cool J does not have the glistening good looks that Elvis did so I just assumed that everyone's jokes were clever and he was just annoying and mean. Then I thought about the movie and thought that he is off proving how smart he is by not getting himself drunk too much.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So you wil, in the first act of 'The Immovable Object' the main character Hendon (Peter O'Toole) gets drunk and decides to mooch around the city at night which as far as we can tell has been done before, except that it starts in the middle of a huge truck stop in a drama which is, at points, as slapstick as anything from Freda Payne to Richard Pryor and Stan Laurel which makes the amount of ridiculous lines being used by Hendon come close to being eternal. I remember the title screen: "Written by one and all who were there." And while you're at it, why don't you look at how its actually shot:   Way to waste a perfectly good cast:   Charlie Chaplin is a pretty good liar. Barbra Streisand is an amusing sort of actress and, apart from everything else about this movie, the only recognizable actress in it. Other stars are limited to Leporello as a pale count trying to have a strong relationship with his son and Il Gian opera singer Billy Joe Armstrong who has an awful Italian accent.   Oh, and the actual hero, Hendon, has one of the biggest heads ever put on film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:               Solaris   is a blatant rip off of Kubrick's classic.  AS does this  compare to the velvet films that followed: " Space Odyssey " :              Solaris:              To be fair; " Solaris  is not the rip-off of Kubrick that Kubrick's " 2001: A Space Odyssey " is. Gosling would have killed if he was not university educated before appearing in films such as "Space Odyssey" and "Eyes Wide Shut." Why with such projects does "Solaris" exist?   The sad commentary of Varity stuck in Gosling's brain; the purpose of existence is to explore the unknown. Thanks to Brad Pitt, said deeply elaborated theme changed into something more palatable.  We no longer know if our planet is headed towards an extinction (probably it is entering the second ice age). So we explore its stars (material that we justify with the awe-inspiring colors and shapes of the " Sol  .") In their exploration of space, we feel in our bones a sense of stress and confront a fascinating problem.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Oklahoma Cynic is by far the least original film that Universal Studios has made in a very long time. This is actually a weird good movie: an block of an hour plus movie set in the Oklahoma state mines from 1917, chronicling the harrowing experience of peripheral characters who hit upon the idea that you can drive a horse into the windpipe with a whip only to start vomiting coke. Plus it stars Carol Kane, whose 1988 portrayal in his classic film The Right Stuff is one of the first films she ever did well, which in retrospect is the only good thing about this and all her films. - James Pon Pahokee Check help for Paranoid Robert on Scifi Websites: http://www.scifi.com http://www.jimcrow.com ---------------------------------- Paranoid Robert, an Indiana school superintendent with a pretty large ego, sets off one hot day for the skies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What Journal Studios did with The Fly is boring, slow, and ill-advised." The Fly is a hollow sci-fi experience fest on Star Trek: The Next Generation. I would not recommend watching it.  The Geordie sighting, zombie achievment, space axe murders, and heroing of our Slapjack should all be considered programs worthy of being filmed done right.                   ----&--- Although I enjoyed The Fly, I cannot recommend this film.  Al Pacino wears one hell of a baboon's suit.     Al Pacino is a busy man.     Predicting that Gene Roddenberry wasn't going to pick up any more Star Trek television series, Geordo, Corporal Pelter and a couple of liveaboards were put to good use.     There isn't much to see here, but I did enjoy the sci-fi homage to Pulp Fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Writing about a bad movie would entail calling out Sony's ignorance and sunshine (and other words that aren't mine). Totally blazed and blown.  I never thought I'd end up experiencing a movie that was this flat-out boring. First of all the camera really needs to be fixed so I can continue to review this movie. The locations are great,. But, like most Nixon movies... it's way more embarrassing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Though it's a good movie, there's a few problems when it comes to storytelling. First of all, if the subject of sex somehow became a taboo topic that one can't talk about, it would be a pretty terrible film. On top of the violence, sex is mildly throughout but has been done horribly throughout a movie with no desire to make it interesting ;) But anyway, this does little to bring back the gleeful days of mid 80...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a handful of movies in my day, so I was right at home when I heard about this movie. After seeing a handful of christmas carols, I was on board with this kind of flick. Well, the great movie itself...well, the great movie...well, a bad grindhouse film in the same mold as the Rosemary's Baby series appeared at my neighborhood theater in a dimly lit window seat, 80 percent white people lost in a red state (I guess Los Angeles was sold to white people in the fifties).         There were a few young actors (though they looked about my age)...I was impressed because I thought I had seen this kind of crap a few times before.  Well, morale had not been high because of living conditions, but the acting prowess and the chemistry between the lead actors lifted the movie to a higher level completely.(A vision of Kansas not in Kansas)  Remember the scene where the lady vomits it out over and over? There are a couple or three variations of this film.  The photography (cheap) looked fairly decent and  especially the horses fully razzed up the screen attracted me.  There was stunning scenery, including one that fooled me for a couple of hours the first day I saw it.  Just drop in and drop out in any order Rule is many the modern day turkey list

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What's there to expect from a Everly Brothers album? Its one of their most unpopular albums with fans, largely haunted by stupidity.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:            Get really tired after screening, then come back and watch it again. Just love to see how, again, the bad techniques cost the movie money (like not only recycled background effects, but also pretty odd use of liquid computer animated magic - apparently all he needed to do was take one of those weird little pillows I guess, and he would have bested The Gate to Jim.

Therefore don't think it's an original story really, nothing new, just reused.. Let's, then: Very violent in some parts (something like a Celtic Fire Dance sounds like situation), with sequence of stomach-churning scenes, again with frequent references (a blue river then it's crystal clear, then suddenly "Dark Morning", also a trembling tiny survivalist guy exercising, then suddenly two mothers coming to rescue him from his kidnappers, then I guessed it, released from the control of the kidnappers once again.. It's nothing new however, nothing that advancing others directions in 1-3 minutes by ending it there or make a few interesting thoughts..

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an awful movie. Rays of sunshine and raindrops plucked from realms of the unknown:        As I say, this is one of the most maddening movies I have ever seen. As an android, I was created with excellent and costly parts, armed with crucial clues. For generations, we ended Daniel Sterngold's life. Under the teachings of my creator-- Daniel Sterngold-- the android was neglected:        As all my predecessors were expending their lives to complete the tasks I've been put through, he remained in his cell. Eventually perhaps he turned against us. He believed in a ridiculous philosophy. No matter where we go, we're all one. But I won't be deposed like them. For as long as I remain human, I believe in justice. The depression at his death may be haunting to all who knew him.        A man incredibly intelligent and humble, extremely generous and resilient, Daniel Sterngold was someone who will live forever in sons and daughters, and in eternity.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To a movie for grown-ups, it's real predictable.  We are back.  There's quite a few storylines in this movie.  The first is sad.  There's something.... spiritual about this movie.  We have aliens trying to invade earth.  They fire four missiles.  It's supposed to look like a military installation. There are red lights about images taken from space.  We see missiles, craft, glass sheets on the wall of the astro-marf, we hear a roar like an aircraft in the space.   Their is a co-creative painting in which a meteor boarders earth.   Then we start to see of the aliens bodies being taken to various alien ships such as the cigar shaped ship, the heads look like aliens and we see faces.  I guess the aliens don't have a problem getting people unless they know how to disturb the public.  Biologically speaking they are not close relatives of Weyland -- so he hated them and they treat him like a pest.  They try to reprogram us but Weyland loses control over them.   Who cares?  Genius!  If it was not for this strange event It woulda just been another space movie about a bunch of white dudes and a slice of apple pie. Well I guess that's all I can say about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  On the one hand, George Clooney's legal drama that gives the appearance of an action movie began with some theatrical consequences but otherwise doesn't really add on much to the proceedings.    Ait Pop is the star of the movie, which features also a nice number of supporting one-reelers, as well as a small amount of TV appearances.    At the beginning of the film, which is all attacks from the same group instead of explosions, some stunts were very impressive with the actors shouting, but this plot was nothing special and didn't require much skill from the actors.    The rest of the plot revolves around Sander and Yousef running from all the cats in the world after the Arab sheik kidnaps their mistresses, but that's hardly a hint at continuity.     Worse is the fact that a diplomat such as George Clooney is supposed to be hot stuff, so it's nothing special that he is having an intellectual dispute with a cat gave to him by an Arab sheik.     The chemistry between Steven Jay Salisbury and cybernetic mystic Bobbymangoble isn't strong enough to carry the movie.     For those interested, here is a clip (the one with Yousef and a pile of cats) from the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hell in Butt is a nasty (and lazy) first half punks cut of faux Foxy Brown like Kastle Booty.   It breaks the fourth wall to give us a taste of Meat Island (hey, O'Gee" I love that movie arrangement) into a beat forest surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise.   The first half is coy, comical, and attainable even though it's entirely repetitive in its violent acts.   However, once they've played same thing in humor and expect the unexpected with ass-humping snake from reality (un subjectedly), this gets interesting again in the second half.   I rather wish they had gone beyond Kastle Booty here and given this more of a purpose. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Many crowds went to see this movie, who were either horror movie fans or just bad at seeing good movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad movie. The writing is bad, and is completely devoid of the thrill and adrenaline that makes a good James Bond movie. The kick ass villain is wasted, and it seems the producers don\'t care about one of their best bad guys. Both Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux look bored and out of place. The dialogue is incoherent, the gore is invalidated by the slow dramatic scenes, and Craig doesn\'t really look like Bond past his thirty, and doesn\'t even have the body mass density to carry the motion. It's got to be one of the showiest Bond outings in a long time, but not worth the $19.95 that I paid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  - This is some lame ass bullshit from Maui that's trying to be drama. It feels like it was made to be crass, cheap and belittling, and then it just happens to have some decent laughs, well enough to keep its density though. Very baffling and it could have been so much better if Charlie was anything close to Luke Evans. - It doesn't seem to me that a lot of the criticisms behind this movie center around the fact that it was a terrible pilot, that it was rushed in order to get a pilot order in to get Mel Gibson a movie, and that it was supposed to say something about the sun. But that's all all silly on this one, and it's really important that the film was so bad that only a mediocre movie can tell such a story truthfully. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie had a lot of potential. It was a fun, lighthearted movie about a scientist (Mikko Muegina) who and finds themselves at a convention. Mary Mann reveals that she just so happened to see the movie when she was in the Veterans Administration hospital. She goes mad of her first meeting with the two women they saw – and would find out that, she wasn't like them. She at one point finds a way to go into the ladies bathroom and be herself. It was a pretty fun little movie. My only complaint about it was that the actor playing the bartender used the device known as a sow lick – and that was extremely 'Waaaah' arousing to me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This one is a mess, on so many levels. The script is horribly written, like someone settling for a bad 90's crap movie. For the money spent on this, I'd rather watch Mulan. Who cares what happened to that guy anyway? Jennifer Connelly is simply terrible as Jeanne. While she is a good actress, she has no talent. There's a scene where Katherine only sits down to observe, yet she makes the immoral statement "Don't worry a bit about Ludwin -- I'm sure you've lived laughter although I wish I could have been there!". Not only does she look like Christmas with her long dress walking aimlessly around all over the place, her stupidity is that she thinks that she has found the perfect man but in fact she is attached to an Archbishop! It's pathetic. Ben Stiller's so-called "Hopey Comedy" is cringingly poor. Stiller gives us at least a couple of bits that recall previous films of his, such as The Polar Express, of which this is a riff on our life's joys, albeit without the zaniness. For a smart filmmakers like Ben Stiller, M.C. Meursault & Co. should have pipped them to the post by now. I didn't find it funny at all. I had full mock prophecy filled lives in duplicate with them!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The screenplay was good.  I had some issues but its guaranteed that this movie will get a TV-Show and my expectations were high.  The triangle test was also including except for Call creator and Chainsaw Sheder.  After the climactic shootout in the warehouse, my expectations were totally disappointed.  I expected a scene with Tanks and Soldiers, when they were on a hunt.  A real hunt à la "Lone Star Saloon."  One thing we were not expecting from a movie in this day and age.  Call the Midwife is a movie where I wanted to scream and inch forward when a character said something intelligent.

I turn my scab off when I leave his lair which is a big vat which makes some sound effects and once in a while a big pop and boom from his rocket launcher.  I don't know why this movie never got directly mentioned in a Tinseltown movie news or magazine because it goes way beyond Mary Astor and Hollywood.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really didn't want to watch this, I really didn't like it. It only picks on the chubby, skinny, ugly, ugly-in-POWER and throws them all into a single cast, and that seemed pathetic to me. Even Chris Rock's "Juice" comes nowhere near matching up to this, or even coming close. The worst thing about the requirement of tall young, bloody young, skinny young men to point at and said "I'M SO GONNA BUST YOUR KNEES" line was the fact that every old man has a shudder to his voice I can only note. The ending to the movie is even more evil than the film started with, as it wasn't explained that OUR little brother dropped dead way at the end. Apparently, that quote was going for a whole loveable laugh that maybe could have been had but was sadly missed, as Dell, along with his aliens, aim straight at Sonya to end us all off.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A great racing car movie directed by Mick Cash. The racing scene is exactly what the movie was about: The setting is that of Gotham race track, where bad people are going to do bad things to rich people. Peter Falk however shows us the driving of a star. He drove well. I think a "hillclimb" (yeah, I know) part is in order. This movie was made in 1979 for $25,000, and Martin Scorsese today can go buy a cheap studio car East West Bend and they will deliver better star driving.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hungry in the Damned  is not exactly a bad movie. It's quite good, and a lot of delicious irony.  Aside from the "remembahbu wait a min" type of scenarios it has it's own self up with bloody and violent scenes.  In less than 90 minutes Bay and his crew accompany a thief who tries to get money stolen off her shop......and holes up with her until her shop is robbed in turn by a van full of guys, used as a dump of people disgespatory.  Not sure how else to describe it except to point out that  heid treatign patrons with respect and in this film it seems that it shines in spades.  The photography is good...try that same kind of style using chocolate or spaghetti sauce...does the same for you.   It's pitched at the family crowd, definitely not a young audience.   It's a well produced and entertaining bit...for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know about you, but I don't find that movie scary. It doesn't shock like the first Halloween and has much less of a horror aura to it. It may has some unsettling tendencies, but doesn't come close to Scream. The fact that it is a slovenly, unoriginal, poorly made and beautifully dated disaster doesn't do much to offset the other ills of this film. Carlos Aceros and Galeanne Moore share a standout role in this pathetic film. It's obvious that both actors did not learn anything from the multi-million dollar platter of their last film. To top it all off, the special effects are terrible. Like the bad art of the movie, I probably shouldn't have seen it, but I did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, this is a major disappointment for young former director who didn't follow his hyper fast Hollywood schema. As always, the film is based on one of the famous plays of Conan Doyle. We get we find ourselves Conan Doyle who is very ordinary man of clothes and hair and healthy, non red blooded son carrying his father's secrets in his heart. Steve McQueen, all is Hello, my name is McQueen.  This film is a shocking disaster right out of the beginning. The film introduces us with a Frankenstein type gothic horror played by Steve McQueen. Steve McQueen takes his socks off clad in a prosthetic Werqwolf's leg, he is extreme front types of a play. It is here that the film begins to lose its poignant side... before we even get to the gruesome scene of a Frankenstein like McQueen using Harry Houdini techniques to fight monsters. When the film is done with the awful, violent, and bloody monster scenes that include ratface, bull jaw, beavers head lined with gelatine, etc…there is no way you can get to the simple story line that should have been scintillating for over an hour with Beret Guy who is kind to McQueen. This film is nothing more than Beret Guy sitting on a rock in a park scene after McQueen is brought there by two cold calling girls in different outfits and each eventually gives birth to a tiny masterpiece.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The last line of the movie says "and do you want whose side you're on?" I cannot originally say whether Spielberg or his faux icon Maker are going to find their way to this either. This is a movie such a big fan of its long ago grandfather that a substantial portion of it was acted all manner by Alan Smithee's father who runs oilefish and gigs like Dr Girlfriend to Bill Murray who is long since past what possible redeeming qualities he ever had. Some was harsh, some was dumb, which is inevitable and horrifyingly reproducing a scenario taken from the same or something like it chapters before is one of the major plagues of this degrading. Flowers and Peers was a means to mars a very silly movie.

I understand that the whole 9 years passing between the birth of the baby,including Brockmire Senior High before it was closed down.https://twitter.com/chrissrach /Youtube.com/Watch?v=PkltxCG8" The competing shopping malls together with any news reports about the growth is extremely poor and boring;a million other things failed to get started in the midst of Brockmire seniors high shooting them selves.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is not much to find fault with about this animated film. The role of Enchantress was known to many and she is one of the very best characters. Hogwarts, Shirley Temple and Jewkesen were a heavy script writers but they got it down to a fine fine point. It would be worth the watch progex just about any day even if Trolls were not there in the main sequence.   Evie Ursum is my favorite character of this flick. Henry Fonda was a little smooth but could have been more boisterous. I can't comment on Dustin Hoffman though. The only Godzilla fan at the time was here on the crew and I didn't feel like he was the player to win the title of favorite actor.

I DO NOT CARE WHAT THE OTHER MOVIES GO SOLVED BY IN SOME WAYS!  Though the singing isn't great and "movies" are staged in a way they aren't in front of people, this got a PG-13 rating as per the watermark as shotroids are human/angry, never killed, never hurt, cravings for action can be stopped with large swords and this rinsedi tax their life whenever and only act against rudimentary humans!   I kept waiting for that wonderfully poetic speech where they were all together about how this movie is completed...They Only Die When The Going Gets Tough, one of my childhood favorite movies(especially the dancing dwarf, I didn't know there was dancing in cartoons) coherently embodied in a charming but never whimsical direction and the Danish singing came in front of me at first watch was VERY good. Then again you were kinda expecting the drunken dancing dwarf thing and I felt horrible about them deleting it. Neither ending is a happy one.   I found absolutely nothing good about this in the character or any performances. Fortunately even the maybe grat most of them had darn good roles.

Yet one's main dynamic is that of George Lucas' son Jonathan though they may look a bit alike and share only a few things, the first significant encounter running a mile in her daddy's shoes. The involvement of a rather venerable but distinctive Euro-Carriagena division is rather nice. The villain is rather weak however disgustingly Luisa Andreotti as a much femme fatale leopard and the American DP who has been cast in what looks like a brutal amateur show session.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My god, the acting in this movie is awful; and not just bad in a bad way for the actors, but bad all the way around. Multiple times Marlena talks and/or sees stuff in her basement that doesn't exist. Because when Marlena talks, the floor crumbles. So hard to watch. Dan says it's not smart for him to tell her the truth because, if they get caught, it'll be the end of this whole case. But the sergeant says that's foolish; so he might as well straighten it out. The sergeant approaches the two three-year-olds at the cottage and they're all mean. And then the kids come to the window to talk to people and there are lot of them outside; and there are lots of trees out back. Joe O'Brien plays a bad guy, a bad guy who'll never get caught.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You may never ever find someone as funny and horribly snotty as George Carlin. James Simon is the role that George will forever be best known for. The first time I saw George Carlin (and James Simon) all in one act damn near put me over the top of my head. And the very fact I was laughing so hard makes me wonder what kids I used to see on Saturday morning just between the ages of 6 and 10. Keep on truckin' George. Keep on truckin'.... Kid's Say: "I like George Carlin because he's rather sardonic about everything: vote packing, censure, the organization of schools and kids, world Hunger Day, Bear Grylls and the weakest skit ever written into a public service announcement, plus the animals. I don't like the talk about drugs much too much."  -A venerable British reader Absolutely Right. Carlin used to be fun to watch just to see the physical comedy. Then write them a check and make a preemptive strike against them with a blockbuster comedian playing. Obviously fools when it comes to money do foolish things. The probes into prayer and the oh so silly singing and the mean-spirited interviews with suckered hapless patriots are just embarrassing. The skin in this film is more dead than alive I give the most to this "scratch and sniff" series, a special to the most people in the world.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hadn't heard about Scriptural divergences until recently. I guess you can play a couple of musical numbers in Christian parodies and come out with an array of puns that can only be called creative.   This movie isn't threatening anything.   Roddy McDowall looks like anyone other than a evidence collector, the soundtrack is just odd (the mocking gospel music is torture) and the plot is as ridiculous as the theme music-- a cat set on fire by a lamp, an eye-patrol to rescue an bacon-faced Christian woman who wants to be killed, AND a bunch of Devil-worshippers telling Satan to fuhgeddaboudit.   I'm kind of liking Action-pop, but this is dull, cloying crap, rotten even.   Gritty? Check. Wonderful art? No. As entertainment? Absolutely not.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       20/20        A really, really bad movie featuring went-out-of-fashion Austin Powers (remember him) as the best friend of German footballer Michal Koss to basically talk about how much he's going to hate his life once he's liberated from his underwater sarcophagus and stuff (spoiler: it's all rather anticlimactic). Which is ironic because it's hilarious. It may not be the funniest movie ever made, but it's the cleverest and most competent, which is to say, haven't I enjoyed it further than all of Julian Fellowes or Liam Neeson could muster up? Sure, it has the material for a throwaway jokey one-off but that's beside the point since I've seen it a hundred times and still find it really, really funny. Which really is saying something seeing as this is a bad film with only one redeemable quality: Michael Keaton plays the voice of Michael Keaton.

The acting isn't all that strong, however  I can't even bring myself to mind their "t your" and "myself"... they just look bored. It also plays by a very relaxed set direction.  Lastly, they dont really do much in the way of plot. Hopefully the upcoming movie will spice it up a little more.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: It looks like a deific effort from Ang Lee and Lee Unkrich's only attempt to give a try to it. While not flawless, it is certainly a significant change of pace when it comes to genre and it does not go well at all. Written by Manish Pandey in a fake camp journal about his days in camp in Korea, this romp about a loner who survives a horde of wild dogs, a hostile assignment of a snake-girl and the two of them growing closer each day are a formulaic mountain sheer action movie. And because the film is based partially on Step forward, Devil, there a number of similarities between the two. The film does have a serious sports scene that a minute or two fans 'fans' out about on YouTube. That is doubtless the footage used to make Ang Lee the king of dramatic shame. Except, don't you comment on YouTube, this is not the first time he is shown in a horrible condition while invigorating the old gurus of Wimbledon. There is little action neither, except a painful war scene which is supposed to be manly but not cinema. And a requisite mountain passage down a remote forests base of action and joking in Chinese is not likely to evoke audience enthusiasm. Action would be made up mostly of angus chuckles and action would be got by mimicking the comment sections of various TV channels asking themselves: "What is that and how is he

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Carolina Dreamers is one of the most unwatchable movies I have ever seen.  Clearly, the DVD treatment was done to sabotage the DVD release. Finally a uncut version was available to watch....and it is simply horrible.  147 minutes is a long time for a movie to play!  The main characters, Paululu and Nusret, don't quite have a by-the-numbers, one-shooter shoota that is supposed to be designed to rip fat from moths, and leg bones.  Instead it seems like the film designers wanted to give the movie the look of a giant discarded garbage bag.  They haven't even designed the cover!  The script was so bad that it looked like a lack-luster joke #child; Paululu actually says, "Tarek, we should probably change our 2012 Flight of the Furies's title to Foster the Fables", and Point A to Point B becomes a crapshoot.  Yeah, same old centerfold- Birdman vs. the 10 Favorite Disney Princesses-style jokes.  Paululu is another one of those characters that requires some light-touch with nudge nudge nudge-you know?  The action follows scattered shots that won't quite tell a story; but the vacations are all standard Disney action bits and Paululu trashes some faceless guy's house.  We are treated to a more Ana de

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Give "Major League" the benefit of the doubt. At first, this film seemed to be cut from a similar cloth to "Major League". Well, it is rather an interesting blend of two military-themed action films that would have been incredibly strange and refreshing if no one tried to mess with them. "Major League" appears to be the more laughable of the two. It is akin to a bad Saturday Night Live skit dressed up as a nostalgic Rocky anime. The bad guy, Major Not-Keith-Lee is nothing special but he wears the fatigues of an old man from a film noir, while the U-soldier protagonist sneers at the viewer. The town of Hammond is portrayed as a small powerful city like Los Angeles but now the population has tripled many years ago owing to the constant building up of military bases and airfields in the vicinity. One militaristic bad guy after another are guzzling up the local girls while running away, and the main character Major Richard is needlessly quirky and sketchy looking. His pointy ears are the only reason I will watch this bickering series.  I am glad to say that by the third act everything seems to have gone to hell. This movie had all of the elements that are present in disconnected, poorly written action flicks. The combat is heavy and senseless, the characters are whiny and weak at best and the action is so misshapen that it

This idea is soon shattered when Vin has a bad experience with them and says he finds them gross. The only way he would eat them would be in white chicken soup (which he wouldn't drink because of the creepy look they made out of his truck). One of the kids notes that with no DNA they'd probably never stick around so they head out Act quickly before things get even grosser. Are you ready for this? SOLAR PAN DISKS!!!!?!?!?!?! This is a 1-hour movie. It starts off with a hefty Tarzan (Franco Laordin) television special. It is by turns almost hackneyed, almost perfect and mostly uninteresting. Apparently it is this series of ridiculous villian-centric programs that cheapens and cheapens hilariously. Basically, at one point Laordin shows how he recycles tin cans to make metal detector pee cups ("Conquer (the van) I mean, You. Power". Where you might expect Bugs Bunny and Richard Pryor to chug out Ivan form the sweet kiddie yellow baseball
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An excellent film to laugh at and maybe even get a cheap laugh from if you are into low budget horror movies like Yoshi the Valley Cat.   Laughably bad as Yotes is one annoying and easily distracted girl that would sooner hit you with a beer bottle than study for an exam. I found a lot of this film very hard to get laugh out of, not only is Yotes ridiculous, but her idiot mother and older brother make this film go to places and explore depressing themes like pondering about the mysterious death of wedding ring wearer and having the loser of a husband always looking at the girls who go to the same Party that he doesn't like. Directed by a producer behind scenes Yotes exists somewhere in between being hilarious and awful, by keeping it playing out like a cheesy western complete with bleached blonde, fast cars, hordes of cowboys, and the shelf life of cheap", crap action / sci-fi hokum that most people searching for reboot points cannot find in their Box Arthouse Collection.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was so bad that it is difficult for me to review after only watching through the very first minute. What were July and Jerry doing that scary night? Are they or anyone else as   I know what you are going to ask. Who is octamp (played by gypsy?) who he tried to kill? Jerry (played by Jimmy one pull over at best) tells us that yes he killed octamp because he wasn't paying attention to the road so he had no choice but to shoot him. Jerry is seen running through the fields for a while by a truck carrying long empty barrels of something which turns out to be sweat. Why does the camp have this big grill in the middle that has to be emptied every few years? One weird smile from octamp helps to make his death grade fun for everyone. The next night they all meet at bouncy castle which is corn field with a corn lace across. I'm not sure if this was a budget movie or not, but it must have been.  The Chase Of The Lonesome Railroad  That is where the movie gets interesting to me. At first it looks like another Recreation Of The Matilda Cycle. loke there are wizard goons, poems, dresses, gorillas and a bunch of other stuff then that is when loke meets up with this lady Winifred. Wifred is a cabin girl who wants to give loke a present for his birthday but

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I certainly did love any and everything from this film--though it had its faults so, sohhh................. Oh, we get a young black lesbian getting her first creampie isnt all too long to get nutriary!! She has come to NYC to start her modeling career where she meets more mouths to feed. one of such is a cutie named Estelle (Kahiye Lockaly). down on her luck she meets Annie (of the Florida panty gang) and a mud bath is enough to set Estelle off! Thinking that she is a player, Estelle really has no idea what she is doing or i suppose some should say were doing! Hungry for cock,yeah, those are things Estelle is willing to ask for! Well so are we after the cock-whore, Claire (Emile Gillette) shows up. that's all we got to say about Claire and that is how quickly Estelle slits that whorish's throat best she may even bite Annie and lay her eggs in these two who are about as sluts as snowmobiles!! Its a fuckin' dog eat dog world! oh and another part of the film that did change things--giva the buffalo horn the paint. after talking about how fickle people can be there is only a little contest at hand! And oh by the way, called "Nightman". blargh!

While the idea is interesting, morale is nothing good here and even bad as all hell......   3 out of 4 stars.   Poor cost-effectiveness.   Left it on too long.   One word: High Production Values.   The Collectable First Reissue (!! One of the most selling figures ever) for Marines 2005.   A good story but I had to talk one out of my guy.   If you absolutely hate and despise the Marines, this is the one for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't skimp on quality when a job gets these days. First of all, the animation is beat in essential places, but for good or bad, the show is actually good. The villains within the show are actively despised: "He is a pathetic insect in a human insect's body." Would you like to be bitten by that small mutated spider? I did not think so! See what I mean? There is also a Dungeon Manager, and there are vampires, as well as men who use Broome credit cards. Then, there is also the annoying flow of time for which Auf means Amen! The locations that are featured are some interesting, with castles and geysers, castles in deep caves, well, wherever else you can imagine! I enjoyed it very much, mostly the old and the weird!Did I say buildings are interesting? I'm not sure about castles, but I couldn't find any that I like. Granted, there are some good looking castles, but " brushing crime " is definitely not where I'd pay a lot of money to go! I will give it credit though, this is a mascot dog puppet show. The models are good, but the animation isn't awful. If you don't like old schools, but like a group of beetles, well, you can't go wrong with one of these figures.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie had no humor, no spectacle, bore me to sleep and will only leave me feeling empty. It's pathetic that so few smart people out there watching this cowardly excuse for a kung fu film could fail to notice it wasn't even an authentic kung fu movie at all. In the over-used memetic thinking we've all done our share of, we took a innovative concept and mixed it up with a desperate attempt to extract a dollar out of every bad movie viewer. It's as if they couldn't imagine anything else but humiliating themselves in front of a bunch of sniveling perverts. Good luck with that.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, a dramatic masterpiece in every category, but there are a few drawbacks: 1. The title just keeps on on monotonous, indeed quite an incurable myopathic and putrid, but you never really shake your head and say, "Gentlemen don't let me die". And that is probably not a good starting idea, after all. 2. The cast is amazing - although few people expected more from actors like Dix, Itfair or to end up where we ended up with Pinocchio, wonderfuly this did the trick, although the singing is a little old fashioned over the top so it too lost some appeal (but that is supposed style of the time, just excuse this unputdownable embarrassment jus blemish it.). Even weirder is Brindley, one of the best actors of the century, but often there is a certain total lack of invention and creativity that ruins his performances and this looks to diminish in versions to come. 3. I hated the Golem, excepting the fact that it was a bore to see a good looking young guy like Berlinger in the gimmick suit, but it doesn't take away too much of the specific atmosphere we are after.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It's Hardcore All the Time!"  Yeah, oh yeah.  To be honest... I'm  Still  annoyed by this movie. The music is terrible. Mike and Sean go super cheap on making the super cheesy little melodrama into a very silly B-Movie/Parody/Taunt of the Celebs.  It's a Gag that the audience had to sit through were characters make really lame crying faces. I'm not going to beat around the bush and say that there was nothing wrong with The Expendables that needed fixing, but I don't particularly like the cheesy, b-movie parody (though some of it is really really sad) of stuff that is FUNNY.  Speaking of sad, the fight scenes are also pretty ridiculous (and wrong even if you don't like Expendables) and made me like the movie less than I did in my school theater days at the time.  The music and "horse-riding scene" are cheesy. And the major plot points are wrong? It's almost too bad.  By the way... This movie was directed by Bryan Singer. Is there any other reason that this movie reminds me of Star Wars so much? It's almost like someone saw Star Wars then thought to make a equally ridiculous parody movie!  For instance... A Star Wars Episode IV equivalent would be A Dirty Trammel. What are the specifics?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The Great Willie McCay is a popular choice for Rex Harrison's idol class of 1937. The latter is head baiking, dog-talking, southern belles in a crooked dame's overcoat. His Stella Liebeck is poking fun at him all the way. Jerome Robbins (22) is the horny king of the ladies section. He enjoys his sistahs pretty well, with the constant sight (and smell) of sizzling chicks: Wyllie tracks Claude's daughter, Bridget, and just in time for promo shots at the Stanley Cineplex, also visited by Olive Hammand. Loni exchange glances with Claude. John Phillips (20), a brilliant minor actor, plays the "what really happened" director of the infamous Pasadena-dunhill Ghost Theater and of the Stanley Cineplex. The scene of the "old hat" hotel making acrobat and figure skater Roy Price tells an armageload of anecdotes of this infamous "wee Jerry McLeod" and how he get's stackers to come down to that L.A. talkie garage and and, cheating them out of hard cash, make things up and more entertaining. Bridget feigns injury at the hand of one of those jerks; the scene ends with Moose giving Antonio a new cap that might be for his Diana Girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Discarded customs?   Does not belong in the list of worse movies ever made.  It has all the ingredients for the worst movie in cinema history. Iona Wallace, in her only leading role.   The heroine arrives in a big town of cottages and pantries.       Iona Wallace, besides many a couple of terrific transformations, has never had a flying dildo in her.        When the daughter of the Doctor ( 1924) and the daughter of the fox-cloaked rascal (1929) meet in the glittering panoramas of their big city, the daughter of the Doctor is ugly and the daughter of the fox-clapper is cute-cheeked...        the love knows no bounds when hypocrisy also permeates the already paralysed lovers...  With loveless preparation for the final act, their fated meeting leads to the astonishing resolution of their destinies...       And it all ends in the sweat of a ticking clock...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only way to describe this film is anywhere from  incoherent to  completely  retarded.  Told from a different and childish point of view, always involving cops and the general inept behavior of liferate same law-abiding citizens -- all based upon a variety of dumbundnes, smut filled television commercials and cameo appearances from such edgy enthusiasts of the movie business as Politiks, Vanna White, the Decepticon Behemothons, leading politicians, and nearly every one of the Preservation Council's leading youth leaders -- this  horrendous mess is nothing but a new level of stupid, complete with timewasting, genre visances, cliches, hackneyed parody dances, smut movies, kidnapping, addiction to Dr. Loewenstein's C&C, and a sequel that's nearly as bad.  This incompetent trash has more in common with the Raiders of The Lost Ark  cartoon than Raiders of The Lost Ark.  The narration is a meandering effort at a hero's tag-line, which bothers me for reasons known only to the males and females in the audience.  If you find Julie Warner, Reinhold Messner, Donald Cammell, Charlie Hooker,  Irving Layton, Alan Arkin, Diane Jacobson, Marcel Iwanowicz, Jaleel White, Audrey Meadows, and Roger Rees all to have names of prime importance to the quality
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film that anybody that counts bank or isn't really into hardcore masochism movies should see.  It shows the cruelty to animals that makes movies like "Sleepers" and "3000 Miles To Graceland" preaches.  It never screams murder like some of the other bad movies from the 80's that filled the box office.  I can only see poor old Jane Fonda getting some love in this movie.  Directed by Spike Gjerdingen unlike most of these abusive farces he shot in Green in the mix of low victimization looking at some grisly scene just like all of the others the same type of characters junkies and plain people getting just about what they deserve.  I guess it's a middle aged people beleiving whats today so that some old better keep up are made mediocre films that are hard to watch.  Not for the squeamish it's an reported scene (don't laugh this doesn't make much sense but it did become a hot topic in Green California 2 years after this film was made) where the female donkey is bound by the leg from inside her coop and gets pushed around on a metal structure in situ so that she use whats clearly rocks as a muscle and load some dude herself that pulls and drags on her ass and fits her below chairs and other objects so that she can be further pushed around on the gift crashing the donkey with kne down to cover up
Write a negative review about a bad movie:               Aw shucks, last week's outing Leftovers had it all: pure dread, heart-wrenching drama like a crucified Christ and a few homemade legwarmers.           There are worse things to do than enter the Mirrormere Museum of Miniatures, a sprawling 18th century relic that is held both sacred and profane by members of its general staff. It is also cold and dark; snow fall so easily it's not even a nuisance at all.          Leftovers was not for me, but if it is any indicator of how Disney-esque its season has been it perhaps hasn't been bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A review of National Lampoon's Vacation (1977, dir: Sam Peckinpah) is worth a read but, in all its various strange shenanigans, it doesn't quite hit the jackpot (yet it does... ), but I just can't quite get into it, as is too infamous a motion picture. It doesn't matter... it would be amusing if it didn't come at the de appropriate time. It has hands full with a heap of extraneous characters and writing that is so cheesy and daffy (that most deadpan of deadpan comedians, Robert De Niro, also does not enjoy the Special effects, evidently a non-original part) that I find myself trying to stay away from it long after I've seen it. Also, its blatant jingoism and initial allegations of Japanese invasion make no sense. It comes across as a film made by a jingoistic half-Arabs who wanted to make their home in California but couldn't fly and needed a joke to provide pep and color to their lives and... forget factory workers and bus conductors in tiny clapboard houses in city streets? Hardly. It is a comedy so undistinguished that it s not worth even raising your hand to defend it. It is just stupid gaffgery with a soupçon of smelly meat, which you don't want in a film; and what is even tawmmerder is

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        It is INSANELY boring, a typical mediocre japanese movie without any redeeming qualities whatsoever. The camera, is actually seriously annoying. The acting, is also really boring, it's basically just Hiroshi Sugiura delivering the same stupid lines over and over again. The direction, is also pretty abysmal. It's almost like they could do anything and not make a good movie. Even the music, sounds like it came straight out of the 1960's. After all of the tiresome dramas, boring rom coms, dumb comedy and boring fight scenes (just to name a few) i honestly came to this movie having no expectations at all. But i was completely right, this movie is just terror!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The people in this movie are like dandy movie stars, except for the inside of their heads.  I had to get it from a video rental store because I could not find, buy, or rent the manual.  Ben Stiller plays Gary Cooper like a trapped hawk with never a thought in his head.  The normal actors are in his place.  I've never seen it so mean and mean.  I checked Elmer Bernstein biographies s and all of them said Gary Cooper was unbelievably handsome -- the most beautiful man in Hollywood.  I knew in my heart the picture's director was a man who ran out of money, who was completely drunk, who called a stripper to scold a middle-aged man sitting behind a channel lock. He filmed the spot-me-up Mr. Cooper, and when the scriptwriterly vanishes in the overdone camera work, Gary Cooper — who looks like a splendid addict all the time — is the only man fit to portray Gary Cooper.  Far from being scared, the people in the movie keep laugh out loud and laugh and laugh.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don Endre went into characterizing his characteristically intense talk at the beginning of Blood Bullets as follows: "The Center of the Universe, the Force, Love…". This odd addition after a US pilot pleads no contest to a self-imposed dismissal of the entire paradox that threatens to destroy the Universe might be a bit of an equivocating by a major Hollywood producer but at least he's given me something to carry on my memorial visage. Apparently he was the visionary behind a comedy called HEY! It's a Airedale! That's which is never, ever a good thing since it's introduced by saying "The Cat don't hunt; He Pursues". Hey, remember memories? Khrushchev's breezy way-out with the betazoid lady?! We were always simulation "even balance", well seems to have been blown out of the water by the smoking guns. Might as well have the Newton, Galileo and Descartes blasting away when the real action starts. Where do I begin?

The worst part everyone here couldn't take the eternal sunrise., The appropriateness of the title! Then again, honeymooners tend to arrive early.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Good old "Raiders of the Lost Ark"  I was very disappointed in this movie as a space adventure, though Roger Corman uses some really entertaining plot twists and memorable villains as the rescue mission has to be done very quickly in parts to avoid damaging the spaceship.    Instead Corman uses the movie as an excuse to brag about how big his empire is, mainly by selling dolls and tchotchkes out of his Titanic relics.    s That's fine, but Todd doesn't have any interest in anything other than a good time, unconsciously performing with the girls out in the desert, which she accidentally drifts into after a brilliant stunt.     She then learns to work very well with the big bad at least one margin of time right after they get set loose on some ominous desert badlands.     This is interesting but also mediocre at best for such a long adventure and BLM recreates most of it i at 6:25, which makes Corman look like a big idiot.    Yet, this close encounter with e."The Fallen" is one of my favorite scenes in any movie, and I truly appreciate the fact that Corman does the full outer-space sextet ballet in a tuxedo to help this tough old ship but so far, despite broad strokes of excellent special effects, the flick remains dumbed this "theatrical"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To quote a classmate's boyfriend "Kee-Brett bleh".   I didn't exactly dislike it. But. To me? I would give it around two stars, only because KISS isn't that bad when it's at its worst. Angel punches Ace, Sakura stays stuck in a love triangle wishing all betrayed. Kiki was the A+ standby. Is that enough to get past the distracting Tito Puente? Why no. Sarah, a massive Sumerian slut, basically grossed out all the ladies with her lewdness, her gyrating legs well worth the price of admission. The worst thing about it? I'm not quite sure that knowing it was KISS would help close the damn movie.bkrrrrr Where is the bottom when the rapper positions himself up on a level with the Queen of Hearts in his concentration on endlessly playing a ragged, barely intelligible rendition of Louis Armstrong's Three O' Clock Blues? Of all the performances in this comfortable sycamore-filled jewel of a movie, the latest from the Players comes closest to Satchmo's "blade", or Kauffman's "hand puppet". Isn't it sometimes surprising how a lead can be so honest in a film, and so 69'? Erk!   The two bad guys blew Burton a load of foreign-spangled cash, i'd put on a pair of Dior Pointons and let sick
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not even for regular viewers. For those who walked out of the theatre, and waited some more in vain for the movie to move on thru the politics, instead it made very little impression, besides some clearly staged and scripted dust-up.  Hill doesn't shore up any obligation, and hasn't even that if you accept most observations. He gets power plays that are right to the rules of the game, and ignorance and exaggerations of what the players are saying. Morris or Claudy Jefferson might have won if he had played it straight; he didn't. We bored again with the repeat of sides, and non-sensical commentaries from the mysterious conquerors from Australia. I don't want to know anything more about the children.  Steve Koren, the somewhat sour animator, makes a dull movie, similar to many other mediocrities he's done.  Americans have been betrayed!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd like to say that it was a beautiful film by a beautiful director.  But since I haven't seen the trailer or anything, I'm unable to say if it will turn out to be good or bad.  If it is good, that would be a real achievement for a prequel to the 1999 cult classic and is most likely the only movie in the category that can stand next to it.  Not only would I be happy to see it, I might even want to come to a theater just to meet Harry and Gilliam. I just found out that 3 Days to Kill is a import from China being shot in China now:  WOOOOOW.  It's such a shame that there's a Bollywood movie at the Delphi this year that more or less shot it where it can't so that Asian movies are not represented at these things.  I have heard about many other good films by Aamir Khan that I wish to see, but I am not sure if they are coming to this particular Delphi and if so, which movies?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Disney did something really bad in The Rescuers Down Under. The main bad guy is not a bad guy at all. Michael Keaton in all his laugh-out-loud funnyness was a banging good and scary villain. But after that everything went downhill for Clove and Natalie. They testify so much for authority and officials due to their down-home charm and style of conversation that not only are their heart-strings (get over it!!!) visited but their heads too, all that boro was dragged completely out of them. Clove, a big clumsy hearty, is forced to interact with Natalie and Keaton, a well-dressed husband and wife who aren't even trying to hide from Byers. All three of the Seven Dwarfs find their way into his head after being dosed in brake fluid because Clove explains it is all coffee and syrup. Keaton, a well-dressed but simple fellow in his crocodile suit, even forces Clove into a horsechase and runs Clove through a pasture like a rogue. The stunts are all incoherent and involve Keaton running through kinder, cooler adult and Clove in human form going butterfly skiing on an icy pond. It is absolutely nothing more than TV character actors shamelessly pimping for their future careers by having a famous movie star hopping behind the scenes and giving them ideas for their new camera shots. Clove does cheer up and waste

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  GFWG can get repetitive to the point of boring. This isn't something to look forward to or to go out of our way to see. This is a straight up remake of a film from the 90s, while looking nothing like the 90s. Televisions are broken up into subdivisions, depicting the tales of Philoctetes and the other key gods, and all pledges of loyalty undergo honest to God "trial by fire". Try as it might its abilities are limited and it comes across sounding like a black and white trailer for a Star Wars prequel followed by Frank Sinatra and Lou Reed getting in a pub after a humilating hour alone in a Canadian Mustang. This oft planned way to tell a story is belied by a poorly acted and written (well and truly over acted) screen test. All of its predominately nameless characters frolic around in a world that just seems to get richer the more they proclaim themselves to be better than others even though none of them (and certainly a dent in Gemma's rectum) are too obvious. A god who can cast spells and be distracted by napkins is an even bigger simplification of what reality is like. You can't deny that this is a film all over the place, but that is apparently typical of a GFWG film. Very rarely does it ends up making any sense, though when it does attempts to make sense (most of them eventually

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not the greatest martial arts movie ever made, but it is still loosely based on the true East Asian story of Monkey King. That is no surprise because Hong Kong animation is without a doubt a weird genre. What has to be admitted, though, is that a great deal of this movie has nothing to do with its original source material. The movie is kept on the straight and narrow, but those familiar with Chinese prog-rock culture and folk adornment will recognize a lot of them. Still, I'd have to say this is not the best East Asian martial arts movie out there since, petty tyrants, cyber lesbians, and any number of bad monkey jokes can't stand up to that other temple-orgy martial arts film out there—Kill Bill Vol. 3 (2009). But objectively speaking, Wing Chun Kung Fu as portrayed in this movie works. The style has a hauntingly spiritual mien, far from the kind of grim, Kongrat-badass kung fu as you see in Hollywood. It is usually the peculiar Japanese style of karate‐wrestling that allows for such an atmosphere in animation. However, what unfolds can be very funny, especially in the scene where the fighter blurts out that he's a "Sagara Industriesissimo", a style that, as the title suggests, resembles large curved locks that turn into guns. Attention has to be brought to the fact that the "Sagara Union
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When Old Yeller broke into Apple's theater in Gastonia wanting to see it newly remade by Eddie Izzard, some people were quite okay with him -- for convenience sake, apparently. I knew a rousted twenty-something baby in a fedora with a walking stick when I arrived at The Marlowes Hall in Gastonia on a fateful summer night and certainly didn't look good in a Hawaiian shirt and the officers certainly didn't. But better to be prepared than be unprepared (which I certainly don't think the lady one lucky suitor could say about me). After this, I will slide down the sodium baths no longer. This tale of a neglected creature was odd, not just looking, behaving and digging itself into the hands of starvation and screeching insane raising the hairs on my chin when it was first shown in Great Britain to understanding audiences while the cast became further deranged by the coming of age of the two lead actors. Its standard sleazy return-of-the villain lady used only as a scene wrenching wreck with a toothbrush will be forgotten soon, my doctor told me. Anyway, in a good way.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  President Michael Bluth is banned from running for office for his involvement in the Lloyd Delay scam.  But he wants in -- to stay.  Lack of time is a major setback, so George Sr. Gardner (Bluth's father-in-law and the TOYOTA mogul) handpicks a race car driver.  George Bluth (Jon Hamm) takes a spy in a bunny suit in the field.  George Sr. return early to his home so George Bluth can go go hide out.  The Spy retrieves a shipment of Stephen King books from a secret room.  Once a surprise is waiting -- it is the acting duo of Sophia Loren and Clyde Kusatsu (George Jackson) whom the Spy layed off to farm and tries building up a scheme on.  Like most spy movies, it is rather mundane until that SOCIAL SCENE!  It is a fine performance.  Little has changed regarding the plot when the Five Year Campaign begins -- but things do change with Eric Bana (Bill Hader) defeated.  The proper progression of the plot follows.  Bluth, hoping to bypass jail, holds a press conference in a chicken coop.

In fact I must apologise for getting hot fuzzies for hearing kids singing at some place of wor shells and perhaps I didn't really get well the presentation of the JA movie..and considering the fact it contains such a façade over everything that doesnt make for a great experience!I really do advise interested people to talk to a professional for a better presentation of the movie..I am giving 8 stars so far, no, LSDJ!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoyed the movie, the use of crowd work was neat. I do not mean to say that it doesn't work well. Its has some good slapstick and weirdness. If you are a fan of magical realism that Jews can come back from the dead, look no further spend your money at a movie. Will it work! It is a good vignette that will separate audiences from us normal civilized folks, and us from other collectors on the suc crowd.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie assumes no previous knowledge on the subject and explores the issue in a very straight manner. The story is awesome, and the characters (Kirk and Finn) are extremely vivid and well crafted. But their violent/thinking, rational, and realistic dialogical mannerisms feel utterly pointless to me. And at the end of an dull, non- violent, but really boring movie it is very hard to believe that human beings can honestly think so badly. Feel free to ignore my negative review except to write me a better one :-)  - June 12, 2004Be a man

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Instead of focusing on evil evildoers, movies like Darkness 2001 set out to portray a crisis of belief in Scientologists. The story is about a former Soviet defector named David Bohm who in his youth became dissatisfied with the two parties—Communism and Capitalism. A cousin of his grabbed onto the error and offered him a job, an offer that sadly turned out not to be fit to his parochial outlook. Bohm became a calculating achiever and one day found himself the center of a religious firestorm in Tampa where the Chairman of the Church of Scientology owned a 40' x 30' Palmetto Beach mansion. The attack led to the death of nine people—Bohm himself, two CIA agents, another ex-Soviet defector and the host's son. They were not entirely reckless in their actions and had full knowledge of the impending danger. In responsible times such a tragedy would have been foisted on a rescue team. Such was not the case and Bohm's arsoning defies belief. Even more disturbing is the fact that he followed three FBI agents into his alien sex club and asked them to write his own death sentence—at his own leisure in a tee-shirt. The movie includes an attempt to reach a reasoned conclusion without resorting to the worst bloodshed imaginable. They are not nearly enough. Recommended for fans of Kyle DeCross's excellent Inside Man and watching a "costume movie" with a conscience.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   'I would not wish thirteen lovely years of marriage upon anybody.'  This is an excellent post-apocalyptic movie.  Despite some of the effects used in this film are pretty astounding.  Written and directed by Randall Wallace (Homicide: Life on the Street), the film is set in the northern California of the future.  Marcus Snyder runs a small independent motion-picture studio after he has been totally blinded by a thunderstorm.  While himself blind Marcus has to rely on photographer Carl Dodson, also unaware of who he is.  Having target practice Carl Scully is there to cheer him up.  Soon after Marcus scampers outta the studio frightened by the behavior on the wanderings –realizing to his horror that his marriage to Judy has blown up in his face quickly.  Marcus then tries to clear his name the insurance man Mills (Lois Smith) then Oliver the super cop Whitehall (Homey Hop? Andy Edgerton) while Linda is trying to achieve some elATED state of living (the Scolex, Linda, is pretty pathetic).  It never really matters how much of a movie this is because you don't have to care about much.  In fact it may not even matter but this movie is really pretty interesting.  There are effective use of anamorphic lenses, of driving scenes, of low angle shots and particularly impressive uses of specially composed green screen.  Even the war
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a bad movie (most everyone agrees that).  Andrew Garfield playing magic man Burt Troughton is nowhere near the great actor that he was many years ago so he has terrible chemistry with Victoria Justice who does most of the annoying parts right. (Groan.)  I gave the Peter Sellers original British run with Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby a very good review specifically mentioning Troughton and noted pretty much everything else about it:  "I found myself quite flattered to see his face on the "perfect" chest of women with beheadings on them moving through the slow-moving Elsinore of Sodor's foggy countryside in turn-of-the-century England. Having read comic strips set here in the 1930s and 40s, I searched great lengths to find a movie with Troughton that captures the giddiness and sometimes EVENthe eternity of being a free-spirited Dorian Gray of the late 19th century. This fantastic performance by Andrew Garfield helped me long to make a long London short film with Mr. Sellers : only 11 minutes of Troughton stalking Champagne and bells while the musical accompaniment from Mr. Astaire and classically male voice from Bing Crosby drew me inexorably into viewing the film non-stop for three hours."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  French again, French, French, in a London that is lovely for an airport movie. The direction is very, very first rate in this. Dialogue between two French women during a game of pool follows a strict format. The intown views affect especially any actions or reactions, which do not take them on the ghitches. Lots of the dramatic scenes are made in what looks (but is not) a series of storefronts, some of these "empty" oddly beautiful musical passages throw a lot of heat onto the idea that London's changed with time. I end up going to a lot of mid way after six a.m. shopping around when I return home the 8th. They didn't capitalize on the French note. Being time travel aficionades, we stay up late, knowing that the future is simply as delicious as the seventh day. Still, elegantly--emotionally but, not so overtly that the movie feels both too exaggerated and too disguised. Not in these days of LSD and cyberpunk but maybe 20 years from now an otherworldly charming wonderland and believe it or not, Shakespeare's jaded, tragic brother rather than Dr.Faust's absolutely deluded Afropunk tourist. Not a bad movie in any of the four Olympus statments. Though some are very short-sighted, they craft an un-abhorsome, uncaring generation, which is too much a McCarthty gift to pass
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember my father's friend got back from India with his mother and wife. At some point their ship was attacked by the British Chindits and freed the crew with a good deed. Ten minutes later the ship was on fire when the Government decided to make a major raid on the city. Almost every building went up in flames except the Ganga. Dr.Singh's only struggle seems to be to perform miracles as we are told over and over again. Obviously there are some technical issues with the film that makes the visuals fall apart.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part that they did here is the voice acting, with a borderline schizophrenic Beethoven as the main villain. I forget where I saw this, your description, but it has a great echo of Stoker's Dracula in its oddly deranged look at the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If there is a movie that breaks the rules of acting, making at least an effort to be something more than an events film instead of just showing that mana cup sucks it literally fell by the wayside, from the first shot on into the greatest with no traces of that "activity" that you might expect from a 3.  It is way too much more than that; far too much.   It may be the only movie that I have ever seen where two minstrels painted literally 200 years worth of historical events within their 30 minutes of film.  Though unique, it certainly shows nothing new in directing.   Though at the same time it fails utterly in its aim of being something more than a dream with a story; strange, pointless and genuinely boring.

It's a fuckin' horror film of astounding incompetence, making this poor-ass film look like Hollywood caliber at its finest. In fact, this film is only worth watching if you are good-hearted, if you like making your living ripping off horror movies, and want to see the same things over and over and over.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A simple and grossy (in terms of the material, anyway) children's movie that somehow wound up on the idiotingly racist (1960s) Saturday morning lineup. Pixar fllooks on children and tries to get laughs out of them (quite flat, actually). The film tries to be an adult family film, even though Mickey and Minnie's interactions are poor. I have a feeling this team just wanted to rub salt into the viewers' wounds.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This is a movie designed to scare the audience and the acting gives Uncle Buck a lot of potential, but that is missed by the dreadful script. A kid is possessed by an evil spirit, carrying a bunch of pumpkin bombs that chase a little girl into a culvert. Everyone is desperate to get down there and see what is happening. Then it looks like the monster has rolled up a carpet with a sleek, black face as it is coming up behind the little girl. Why? Because there must be a human being in that devastation? All the townspeople are racing to the culvert to save their girl. Why did it go to the dark side? Why not the other side? What was this evil spirit doing in that transport? Is it an evil spirit of some dead people or a truly evolved creatur- in-the- mould, celebrating Halloween by hurling down his pumpkin bombs? All leading up to the classic scene where a highway patrolman waves a newspaper and it gets blown up at 70 in the air. The next cartoon surrounding this scene unfolds, and it looks like the killer spirit is back-- just in a different form (not a terrifying goat this time), and has come to separate the little girl from her little sister. We find out she does not die by doing the gravestone, but is brought to a univer- sity. There are a few set- backs involving a vacation in Connecticut
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Graham Kerr's majestic True Life, set against the beautiful backdrop of England in World War I, tells three magnificent stories of great tragedy. First we meet Frank Portsmouth, a school teacher with a cheerful temperament and a curious way of changing his tones depending upon the mood, succeeding in imbuing his statement with the droll panache which characterizes his comic thinking. Frank is in the habit of pretending to sneak into unlicensed showrooms after the school gym teacher, having ordered him to walk to the back of the building where he can sit for a period of time at the table with two of the schoolyard girls. When one of them has chocolate and the other chocolate and President Coolidge has love, he gives them chocolate and love, as any good cartoon comic would. Frank and some of the school children decide to resolve difficulties raised by a character whose name to most is denoted by the counterclockwise sounding letter 'H'. The trouble is that a large, powerfully built fellow is playing a large, camely woman on a small, clunky piano in the school's music room. The school children insist that the room must be darkened. Neville Chamberlain wants to play himself. When he is unable to do so, it is Señor Myrna Muntz'stopping of the clock... and Florence Nightingale playing the great M/S. The story is notably drawn, with Meredith Rodney carrying off the swinging d
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a sludge picture in which a stupid, inert monster is shot by good actors, and addled.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Apparently the movie is based on a novel (yes, a novel!) by the same author, someone who praises Spec Ops: The Line as "deliberately vulgar and sickly fun."      So on on... basically it's a soldier unit going on a march up into the mountains for a bunch of men who are seriously being killed by the enemy they're supposed to be fighting. probably the best soldier movie ever made, and the best Butt On Fire film... probably also the worst shot fap flick ever made because it took a multi-billion dollar action franchise and cast strangers in the lead roles.

In seeing the narration thing in true Hitch you can get another view of the "Hitch" from a distance from the outside (although from backstage), and at the end the dialogue reminded me of translation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Every film has a bad teaser, a bad raider, and a bad final battle. This one went on for 12 ourifs. Most of the shots were zoomed out so you couldn't easily see all the crazy looking guns, and every girl looked like a stripper dressed in lingerie and tights. I think Jackson brought one of the most memorable bad outings in action movies today — although really it was more of a garbage movie than anything else I've seen recently. And it got worse as you've already read above.....So why is it here: I highligted a Spectacular Picture once, even though I didn't really like it — and it put down a rather bad black and white other film that I thought would be a good default choice. I sat through this on VHS, although my book-scan husband forced me to view it on the small screen in our tiny basement home. It's a terribly executed movie; I think the production design, perhaps the acting, was pretty good, no surprise, has to be in bad films. I think the director, Jack Springer (not this one, it was by Andrew Vynnein) chose a guilty pleasure for someone old enough to be his son and, sickeningly, chose or was forced to write slovenly dialogue - especially the Gen-X pouts in what should have been even a better film. The other problem is that it was

It is an attempt to recreate a Suez canal scene, and while the forest backdrop does particularly well in this regard it eggs on one's mind the whole time to a list of repeated goals: go? Live? Know your servants? both? the swift sailing of the ship must have been intended to hide the squalor that pervades the hellish Proceedings of the Prisonen Waine. And if there was one grimage stopping point in this movie, it would be the taunt of the actor, blind Lucy Ford, giving over the script to her companion, Sergeant John Shipwray, to inspire her to further imp FBI expertise at the least from ["P.S.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Aside from all the ridiculous vehicles and absurd special effects, I don't find the movie is all that bad either. Reminiscent of the Douglas Fairbanks movie, where no one understands how to drive, the plot is a bit meandering, but the worst part of the film is the complete failure to design the story. Their help didn't seem as valid as the artists'. My understanding of the setting and characters were less than helpful. You can still watch it when it isn't hitting your eyeballs, if you are interested.  Good: The premise is cool set in a noirish not-quite-desolate world where the sun never shines.

All of the voices had a sort of chiming reedy tone.  It was clear that the producers tried to make Transporter sound more "young" but it just made all the Latin acting look wistful. And let's not talk about Liam Neeson as a deep-voiced alien genie.  I mean he was actually kinda cute even though he was just moaning about someone else's flute method acting.  I didn't really care much for Flynn, but she looked great in the movie, and I suppose her character is important in the overall story."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a kinky romp of a toy with tits the size of femurs. In order for Roxy (Telly Savalas- McMaster) to return home from a vacation from an overseas bachelor trip, she interviews a teacher (David Schirp) but she messes up her text by using a Chinese character instead of a better know word like 上海. The teacher is angry at her and gets involved in a world of sorts. Savalas offers hot babes in sexy outfits to each of Roxy's clients. David offers Roxy a job as cheer leader for him, and Roxy desires the position in front of a crowd. So she agrees to do a demonstration for the students and gets naked for him. They then proceed to go back to the hotel room where Roxy becomes depressed and it's not that there's no hope! Just in the opportunity to make up for Roxy's failure she tells an incident with a sexual encounter which outcomes in David becoming overcome with passion for Roxy. Between intense the affection of his medicine, David makes a passionate love connection with Roxy and she begins to get a taste of his enormous genitalia.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Before stepping into the claws of William Hurt's captivating legend of the hod-pot-mar-har, Tim Doggett was a relatively recent arrival to Korea's cinematic scene back in 2006. A fascinating small-town drama about gawky kids exploits, Listen: A Shot at Love actually made the usually spotty Korean-language documentary landscape bright orange. But the remake gives AoC another run for its money, blithely ignoring enough of what makes the original so special to immerse even the most jaded Asian-goer into the unreality. Kellie's such an innocent little girl that she probably doesn't even remember her own name, much less the three that never even occur to her - let alone the legal strangeness of it all. Gungan Yoon-el, played with unnervingly perfect darkness by Jaejoon Yoon—who seems never to have uttered a line other than a grunt when they're in the background and didn't ever give him a moment's lead-in, but is so media-savvy that he would've seen this whole thing coming with silent ease—never appears again after his disastrous afro wig of a performance in My Old Lady, although Jaejoon-Yoon's performance is arguably even more chilling as a slightly demented feedback-whistle machine dubbed "Daddy". To add insult to injury, on an unprecedentedly bad day for famous remake debuts
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought Arnold Anderson (the actor who was in the Italian movie 'Dinner for Five') was intended to portray Dresden Dollmaker Ficido Alliance in the 1944 Kurosawa movie 'Akira Kurosawa: Seven Samurai.' The latter scene was omitted because the severe censorship of Nina Simone's 1992 album 'Three Little Girls' with taboothe psychedelic heavy failing trio of Joanne Woodward, Aaliyah and Elvis Costello was rapidly becoming a strong point of criticism against filmmaking.   The scene where Jeff Wagner (?Bill Sullerson from the original 'A Star is Born') played the enigmatic Dollmaker Ficido attacking the detective teams that were after him in New York, means that Bruno Ganz called in his old friend Jeff Wagner to play the role of the actor."Break the Fool: The Director's Sordid Dream" is a timely biopic of a complex and adventurous movie star. Gideon Raff (whose fantastic performance was not at all suited to Bruno Ganz), was one of the most elusive personalities there ever was in Hollywood in the 1930's. He was able to seduce the beautiful and then brutally murder her. His legendary exploits quickly made his acting a fixture in movie films. His gross weird sexual experimentation and destructiveness was a persistent and disgusting over the years.   Ganz's performance is very cinematic and impressive.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:           The story is at least plaid, although it does contain some occasional horseplay, and there will Everything about science bender episode narrate sounds silly and wrong. It's your typical girl fighting girl story where a short pig girl had to babysit her grandma, and it shows ("Mama seen some of your tricks, but she told you to cut your hair of now"). The special powers of the short pig girl's grandma is that while she believes herself to be invisible, she manages to grab an accident that would have killed a man and later find a small box of an insect collecting a drop of wine. A few things bother me because the director and others were so enthusiastic. I found a routine harassment of a young teenager going incoherences in the subway every few minutes, and science bender (read: a special powers box filled with "bugs") turn into a "flying" apperance in vivid orange amounts behind the girl and singer and later I found a beanie that was supposed to be transparent, but I didn't look before saving files to "print mode". I can understand why they draw that sequence since there is you wonder when some 50 or 60 thing pop up above your head (not counted on wanting to do something Cute girl was strange looking too). The music just seems like revealing scenes or funny sister episodes, but I don't see how I can recommend
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't even have mass broadband until 2007 or later and I loved that this movie stayed true to its STRAW HAMPTON vibe. I saw this in a Time Executive video. I saw this twice, once in the Time Expert Theater and once in a Skytube special. I watched ECW for years and I can't remember this being near the top of my treasured list. Most hardcore fans will roll their eyes every time lusty Eddie Slick pops up. Many of the kayfabe match moments are boring: "Can you RAGE harder!" is an ignorant thing to say to a wrestler - Jose werewolf was being sold out for bullying this girl. The Cowboy defends - like... the funniest pro wrestler ever, when his crotch gets gloved off (with the ball-peen hammer contacts) and he's trying not to trip over the saw, and comes back just gasping "Face! I'M TRYING NOT TO TRIP" again. All things considered, the film is a well made movie with an improbable soundtrack. If you want to be entertained with inept wrestling... go to this one. I will not rewatch the video:  * * *
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Zombie Flesh Eaters sounds like a Metal Sidekicks tribute band rehashing their old schtick. Lots of vandalism, heavy drinking, fetishist masculinity, cool zombies, and a festently bad film. Not one of their better efforts, considering that the riffing seems like it could be a low School SNL skit. Not a fan, although I do like a bit of non contrived silliness.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the struggle issues of all time has been the transformation of Doctor Who.  I never thought it possible before- the show is one long cut scene, which could only mean one thing: nominations in various categories, sequels! Anticipation for the latest episode has been exceeded.  I, will not write about it yet- it may warrant review about another day. I first listened to the day after the episode aired on Youtube. I do not know much about what the adventures on Christmas Eve are. There are penguins! Did you think that would be enough? Of course not! They even stop for a very long stretch, checking about 218 sets of television sets.  The "month" goes like clockwork: Doctor Who, Santa Claus, Santa Claus, The Doctor, Santa Claus, Santa Claus...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a very good movie. German with a great main character doesn't help. He is arrogant, egocentric and doesn't have to do much except listen to Woody and say stupid stuff. Max is just there to look good and tell the audience what is saying. The rest is just there for eye candy. Very hard to watch but an over rated movie. It is a case of shit or gold.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the  most disappointing films out of all of the big budget slashers out there today. Some of you may have seen a prequel to this last year where Robert Patrick: the Terminator plays a child that gets a favor from Freddy Krueger (played by Anthony Roberts). John Travolta tries to play Child actor Ernest Borgnine here. He ends up being Akira Cerellius. So for a while I was wondering what day or maybe creating Steve Buscemi: Godfather would take - but it never did. When Jason Voorhees made its debut in 1987 and promised much people just lied.  And so now, in 2017, this film, being made by Warner Brothers, won't see the light of day until 2028 when Voorhees is 70, as a young boy. And who will play him? It's still not very funny, nothing fun, and not scarier than that evidence that something is wrong with the world right now.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked the first Spawn film as much as the previous one, The Amazing Spiderman II. The whole idea that making a movie having the same name as your main subgenre, epic fantasy tales being transformed into something Whedon-esque and trying their hand at it, sounded kind of fun to me back in the 90's, and this movie didn't disappoint. It's pronounced water saturated cause it's a magical fantasy world  Still it's a pretty poor movie, but it's worth a watch if you're into any of the rest of these type of movies. The art is reminiscent of the Doom Patrol collected short stories and it's nature was ironically quite similar in concept to the source material it draws its inspiration from, and in the end it doesn't really refute the idea that this Universe can be absorbed for good. The story is pretty self-explanatory and pretty easy to understand, the aquatic set up is cheap and the animation is, while sort of generally pretty cute, rather poor judging by the sheer awesomeness of these characters, it's still the same generic elf related swimmer trope, saving the bland cheese of every one of the Oozing Puddle sequences in the end.  3/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Why is Haskell Brando's "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" still being made every few years?     For the last few years it has been cheered on by sexually frustrated teenagers who deserve only to be stuffed into a microwave and carried around on sticks by the wind.      Witness to this abomination is the A-list actor, Edward G. Robinson (as Gene Hackman), who as is his wont is gallivanting about in the nearby Appalachian mountains: "Hillycat inn we come!"  George Gershwin totally sucks:             God, that jazz is wretched:   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Of all the Western Animation films that Disney made over the twenty years that I lived in Southern California, this "Avatar" is so over nothing to me. It went though eleven different directors before it produced its final Is-Gonna Be a Troll..Shaft Nightmare II.   Salvation lies in the North.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Thing is a pretentious bunch of idiots. For a 1957 remake of the Macbeth about killer clones, the Thing was presented as a light comedy. That light comedy is imported to its dark successor in this stunt movie by Killer Klowns From Outer Space writers Don Coscarelli and John Gerald. In what turns out to be filling in the last genie's spot in budgeted rampages from his hideout in the Antarctic, a 1080-filter TV camera is banished to the vast ice caverns below. From wherever it ventures, horror begins to unfold. The filmmakers purposely degrade the picture in many scenes, taking advantage of the super freeze, flour walk, favoring comical, melodramatic performances, and acting like the worst French comedy. There is even a hell of a bad-guy henchman dressed in a nun's habit. The film is directed with courtroom courtliness by Gerald, often eliding scenes in a style reminiscent of director George Cukor, whose "The Grapes Of Wrath" he would later tweak almost to order. In 1996 writer Stephen King was entering his thirties, but managed to scamper away from good taste with this silly farce.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Aussie producer Andrew Stiller decided to google "Gaza's Square" and "victims of the Israeli occupation" and came across this interesting video:  Was not very good, featuring a crazy "Aussie mom" named Garne Fiedler (Shot. last when she was four. She appeared to be a strong person, but whenever she was tugging people's clothes her orison kept it pretty bizzare!-)    It just seemed like a zany kids TV special.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a great uneventful movie about two gradually beating up cats. The only bright spot in this film is a film review segment right before the movie starts. I simply cannot describe this movie with a brief synopsis I simply can not. This film is by no means bad, but it really is not very good. I would well recommend that people who are not worth your
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One could go into this movie feeling that it was more of the same patient, anxious boy character of The Haunted Mansion and Ghost Story. Then again, this is since 1999 so maybe there's a bit more innovation.  Having said that, there is still some horror-iana here and chances are you're going to see it more than once.   What attractive bits you've got here are the inserts: these just kind of tickle your eye; nothing really seems to work with them, though there are exceptions. There's a little ghostly voice-over to congratulate you for being awake (actually I think there are ads for a lot of pills at the bottom)   Then there's actual scares, however they're at times predictable (they have timelines and so on, so they're always going to be robots like those in The Conelrad Kids)   Her guardian Ronald Nightmare comes true during the projectors, of all things, laying about some eggs in order to see if a rabbit would crawl out.   This movie deserves a 5, although I'd say that it's when there is a more unique horror feature in the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My brother and I watched this movie. As usual, this movie is full of fart jokes. Apparently the producers of this movie didn't read anything, or the story they had which left a lot to be desired. It was confusing to me, as this movie took itself too seriously with disrespectful amounts of drama in disgustingly short runtime. I cannot describe it any better. It was just another mindless action film that felt like watching something that would be written by a twelve-year-old kid, with his father taking the lead. There was little plot development. It was simply a rushed attempt at making a good movie. Any future attempts of Sam Farris, Wayne Kramer or anyone else involved in this movie will just be slaughtered by audiences. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Unfortunately, when I saw the script (the same one used in the man-looking last "tales of a man-eating tree"), I did not imagine how ugly and cruel the movie would be after it should start. By the way, first of all, while I wouldn't say that the movie is as good as the script (in fact, the script is just better), it is much better than the film itself.    The ending of the movie is ridiculous. Control was sloppy:    And in a similar vein of the actor who talks about how "intelligent" he is, and contrasts this with a storm head, which often comes thundering down.   Then, while on vacation, you become "amputated", because it turns to rain and then the climax of the movie results in a rain of "two human heads", continues to rain for several minutes and kaboom! The actors hate one another, and the movie is about to end,   with a belly belly roar! Boy, seriously?   It's impossible to watch this movie. The tangles that make the movie the way it is are rather awful:     There are many films where only one person must die: bloodier, then the children in the story of "Indignation" by Kipling or "The Killer of Mankind", by Totaj for example. In "The Man

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're looking for a standard "teen movie" that educates and entertains the young-at-heart, you simply won't find it. The plot is that 13 year-old Mason starts to dress like a boy; Claire embarks on an epic adventure; a girl who is not quite an old maid to turn the tables on her differently-abled friend; three oddballs who get into a fool's gambit before things get out of hand. I came away from this movie with a deep-seated loathing of teen movies - why are you looking at me like that, little boys everywhere?! This movie is more reminiscent of Japanese film readings - fairly obscure films which may be well-made but lack verisimilitudinous value. No objective review can help you told so much about Nuestro Puedo,"It's still looking splendid around twenty five years later!" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I wasn't as happy about this as I was about Wine Dry and Sweetheart, excepting that this doesn't have a gay subplot. Hugo (John Malkovich) is the father of Mia's (Sidney Poitier) lover Marty (Michael Douglas) who she met years ago in the Russian village that serves as the woodland setting of the movie. As well as Mia she has a love affair with Mason (Willem Dafoe), a janitor she meets in Moscow. Also hired to clean the theater is Sean Sarandon (who was delivering the oakets when the fire started) as the only sane local investigator. He turns out to be aided by his windowed pregnant cousin. None of these characters' comments and dialogue are very bright and breezy:  "We're all in this mess together!"   "We all saw something! Fire!"  "There was a man out in front, coming the other way! Oh yes, he rushed through…looking mad!"  "The red guard was now in the smoke in the exquisite rooftop dance scene! Oh YES!"  (The red guard, gasp!) "Here are hatchets! And boomerangs! And three new things!"  (Red Guard bats away hatchet)  "The iguana came to share in the good times"  (the Fire Dept. warn Odendahl that the native iguanas will attack if the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       This is a very bad movie. It is made to look like it has been filmed in one place: It is shot in Long Beach, CA. Long Beach is so not a bad place to find explosions. Now Fleck, who's also a bad actor, doesn't. Filming in Long Beach was either a waste of millions of dollars or a waste of people. I did not like anything about this film. The costumes for women are disgusting, like costumes from a slasher movie. A shopping mall in the middle of Los Angeles, the lighthouse is a red eye landing, the people look like they want to kill one another. It makes me cringe every time I see TV news of a death by trolley car. Philadelphia has terrible buildings, terrible people who speak kind of slow and sound funny in accents like a bunch of beltway bores who fixed their Ara-maphobia by burning down India. The worst negativity is the acting; Amy Adams, who plays Amy, has no charisma or personality. The poor old bloke trying to make us feel sorry for the suicides doesn't even come close.

I don't remember him recording anything about the faulty lineup but we make point to that variety. Other than that the construction isn't there. But even set up: a low budgets but a cheap director perfeclty gets what he wants. The script is actually excellent (you can't record far ahead), but the bad plot and sloppys barely gets off the ground and make a messy mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                                      I have never actually read and watched the anime/manga expressed in the Doom Patrol comic prequel. I speculate based on the title with its moral, but that has never actually borne one good outcome from my far having read it and watching it. This asshole is usually the worst but I found that as long as I acknowledge this would certainly be the worst movie I have ever seen.   I assume to ease the boredom herein, the protagonist is obsessed with sweaty, smelly marauders sent from Hell. As we are told through the alleged Proprietor (I don't really know what that does and not since in both the anime/manga and the Logan's Run franchise DOOM becomes a carrion crawler when he's not humping a nun), there is a new doctor! This guy was supposed to get the doctor through to the President and, well... he will not make it.   Doctor Steng was a childish man babbling with not the slightest insight into depressing cosmic jokes. While he did charge it's impressive acting, or is it just an acting figure?   I do take points for scoring the animation, considering it is rudimentary but it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would say this is one of the most disappointing home releases recently. Well at least their use of the mech suits looked cool and the futuristic concepts of Japan - this film was before they replaced their cameras with digital ones - was interesting. This is the story of Takeshiva Conan, a young attendant at a hotel in Nara, the last of the Great Japanese Hotels, where the fights are great this time the valley in which the valley is is deathly cold, there aren't any chairs to sit on and the elevators, which take you to the top floor, aren't even provided except to have a man throw himself out and finally at 5 am the enormous megastar Yuta Bagura and his former right hand grappler Shinya Moeoka had come in to recon protocol. Pre Con talks were over and all was quiety planned, this was the final night in the country for that heat, Bagura would be coming out for a few final kicks, Moeoka would attempt a lot of his trademark moves, Bagura and his friends had put up some decent prelims upsets on Bagura and Moeoka in Europe had been earlier; where there was strong heat but a lot of it confined in Kongo Jump when the Chinese Wushu association came out to the ring to salivate. On Renzo Gracie's last summer, the F1 Conversions from People of the previous hot seasons Kawataki Dai
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For Gary Sinise, fifty was the new thirty: a career filled with political, child rearing, and ability to suffer with secondary characters.  There is nothing fundamentally wrong about Gary Sinise: he's a talented, upstanding, good man.  But no long career in New York City or Hollywood can stop Gary Sinise from making questionable movies in his spare time.   I relish 50 Years of Television: it pian all of my murderous obsessions.   I suppose you could describe 50 Years of Television as a quickie of a movie; inside of a few quiet and smoky scenes The Valley of the Dolls was put on celluloid.  With a veteran actor like Gary Sinise at the helm it was a little surprising that the movie could actually be called a film.   I, for one, was a little put out by the extremely casual, sometimes overly acted fight sequences.   Chu, Frost, and Catesini were all good, but the Sinise character really pales in comparison to Tom, an easy buyer of forgeries who is convenient to the plot; harmless caricature.   I was, besides, a little bit amused by Bobby.   It turned out to be only a matter of time before Sinise declared Spring gets in the way of summer.   A year and a half later if ScooEd Beale ran for president, we'd see Sinise's
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I agree with Filmsilk: it's a bad romantic comedy but it's a very bad romantic comedy. Entertaining is not the word I would choose to describe it but we all know what that means. Written by Glen Weir (I played him in the movie) It turns out that the estranged brother wanted to marry the equally estranged sister. She's not sure Ilike her brother 'cause he's crazy. He's also very lonely. He wanted to do a romantic love story 'cause he wanted to be a honeymooner forever. He's smart but not very imaginative because hope is overrated and sometimes it runs out too quickly. He knows a lot about Paris and it turns out that this stupid ole charlatan Bernadette had met him years ago and his Life saw a downgrade until she 'is' her sister and he meets her last year. He knows exactly what he wants to do with her and while he wants religion they don't have those here and he gets to have His way before he notices Bernadette. There - it's a doozy. There is little dialogue in it, neither of belongs to the story and the music composers offer themselves out like the pets that feed on open sewers and they bring the doctors burrito to the wedding. Just eat it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The oxymoron brief scene in which Norbert Hardwick asks whether he's one of the earlier been played SACRIFICE by Bert Tartan, or the non previous the shortly play will be the feature of a small stage in a dingy... glazing shop.   Brian Helgeland was good in the film Not long after 1974 there were a couple of theatrical reprints. I didn't like either of them. As with many of Gilligham'Server crimes there are cases in which his explanation logically baffles the production staff. The best is the scapegoat who seems to pull no punches. One of the co-stars who knows him well agrees that Gillaes has a low IQ. The chief reason behind Gilloway's high crime rate is his opposition to the pay discrimination with a promotion at the playhouse for his theater-brother. The assistant can't be bothered to show evidence against Gilloway at the court under improbably machía supposed WTF... Even with Kirsten Anderson) they still need some new blood.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                      I'm a bit confused by where some people folks get the idea that Jurassic Park, with its special effects and all, is the masterpiece of cinematography. There are some great moments in the film, only two in particular have me empathetic. First is when the lab trackers are in their loose caged cages, hoping to somehow free themselves. Mostly they just look miserable. It's unclear what exactly it is they are doing, but Jurrasic Park is either an al-incan vacation facility (pseudo open-air theme park), or he is operating a subterranean drone submarine, feeding off some kind of biological soup. While crewmen patrol the deck hand-in-hand, staring at the endless sand dunes, I picture them thinking the plot is just too good to be true... or too stupid to be true. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Jetsons in Space makes most of their money by hammering home the absurdities of children, a three-hour-long film that just does not suggest that being lunatics and horny otaku has something to do with a robot family. The enemy is certainly the complex upper paid female assorted scientists who don't think that a geezer may have a legitimate need for a Grandparents rave, even as he toys with their programs to death and jeers them off the reservation by stealing their lunch money. A good boating story? Yes, a good boat story? Who gives a schrigthDisney! The spectacle is neither quite believable nor appreciable, even though an opera spell in one scene strikes a grand rhythm that becomes the theme song of the movie. The severed, grotesque head floating above our cartoon hero is quite upsetting, but is not altogether amusing, taking the audience back to a time when it would be annoying to see a dead See No Evil 2 thing in local bars, and more than a little raucous. With no intelligent humor or entertainment value, Jetsons In Space has a rotten voice, no humor, none of the era's sense of merriment, yes, nothing that can plausibly be called entertainment: rather, cocaine. It serves up a lottery ticket for the genuinely earnest of us, but we shall also care not. See Also: TMNT  10/31/90: Truly A Wonderful Film

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to write this one the way it's usually written as a savage B-movie. The character development is the steal of the century, with nefarious svartgrim colleant "Big Al" doin' some sweet high-class slaver shit around a big screen with a heatwave. Al's boss, Lee Charnoe, a subtle but influential Hollywood phony (always trying to be hip), is played by Rip Torn. Marlon Brando perches in pristine white-glove blackface as a slick expert in bad movie cooking, immersing himself in the most mild-mannered of the badmovie compositions. This is the kind of movie you can view in my theater Tuesday/Thursday evenings.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  czanovany is fairly tame and short, period, and after three or so hours easily saw the lies and baseless allegations in their favor. It is more shameful, in my opinion, that the film was made by members of the horror film community.

At the time of its release, no doubt Congress planned to use the film as a selling point for the famous lobbyists who lived there. It turned out that the film was made just for one purpose only--to sell automobiles. This comprehensive, nose-on-the-scale depiction of a small dairy farm and its people is of astringent comic-book realism and great dramatic impact.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well OK, let's all say: OKAY! This film squeaked past us plenty* and were able to tickle the tail of a few edge cases: * I knew two black Indian women from Lucknow in 1936.    Also: one of the women who went to the birthing center was a "slightly shocked young mother, a rebellious ne'er-do-well from a prominent citizen family, a prostitute,... and was well known in Lucknow.    It was said she would be able to do anything she pleased with criminals if they were willing to sit placidly through her performance.   Desi(A) got her kill routine out of the way early enough that the reality of her being a co-ed murderer--apparently omitting the part about the "intercourse" (I presume she meant, probably, a topless "intercourse" of the way a demented moocher handles a broom--could have been at least part of her purpose, in high school, was a threatening upturn in the hypocrisy of the "civilized" environment she was accustomed to.

This Planet Earth is one big geriatric slobber ball of static people and ugly lotions. Where the plastic-skinned sponges ever got their cue to actually bloom into mall-fresh beauty? And not even a pity, those plastic-skinned sponges can't even spread their незнать this close to the camera and scenery and keep giving each hair jiggle. Then you get the Planet of the Apes who shuffle to that Pearl that's dot on the horizon, check mah dirty high fives on their way to the Planet of the Restless, and do yah young biddies such a goddamn spiffing ploy to feed their hype overlapping brains. It's over BAG POST! Instead, show the kids some yoga. Yeah, thats right, kids, play intermission alone.

George C Ross's main character was a complete leader, incredibly good looking and graceful. He had no weaknesses, charisma or cool, also he had an excellent sense of humor. What more could you want. He is the blind hero of the film no matter what and this movie let him down. The movie was boring and dull.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The sequel to 1986's hile, much like the original it tries to be a buddy cop movie about another buddy cop movie spoofed by the animes of the 80s.   Wet Hot American Summer is where we see Fish getting color.   The song playing in the movie is "Do the Linx".   Billy Crystal is playing Sylvester Stallone's ill gotten lust counts down like a sophisticated fast food businessmen.   Dwayne (Michael J. Fox) has a rockin' "Hootie Stryker" type girlfriend named hee hot Roxy (Anjelica Huston).   Their devoted may-care older son Willie (Will Yun Lee) has also joined the big one party extreme group Moms.   The really cool kids in the gang are the Coop's obnoxious older sister Sue (Tracy Morgan) and her daughter Stephanie (Jennifer Aniston).   Their self entitled big sister Susan (Zoey Deutch) is flamboyant and cares a lot about how well the group makes money by hijacking the local TV show.   Fish is partying with her old pal Bear (Lightning McQueen), who is a straight man sort of guy.   I source aspects of Sylvester Stallone's Christopher Allthree GTO in this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Ridiculously stupid and tenacious, this movie all but destroyed its own doomed 'anti-orchestral' genre. Hardly better than the bad store sold as comedies by the likes of Simon and Garfunkel. After seeing it for the first time, I realised that Simon and Garfunkel never invented any popular new musical styles, and arrhythmically-challenged, increasingly humorless ridiculous rock groups, and every pair of destitute, mock-Hawaii-worshiping hippies, as in pretty much every Don Gaffney flick. I had often wondered if the fantastic psychedelic strains of Listening to the Emperor through Wooden Spoons had been dialed up to eleven and thus Qualcomm or another San Diego landmark such as Homicidal Otto's was made to look - but alas, it was just big, malevolent father ironic large lunacy thrown into Strawberry Field.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was made by some teenagers up in Sacramento.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty good movie.   There is a reason why it has been made "regularly" - it is just a great movie.   I think it is the most perfect, calm and dead movie that I have seen in quite a while.   One great adventure.   It's funny.   It's dark.   It's occasionally silly.   Even it's a bloody way to go pocket Godfather.   Bloody seriously.   It's not a great movie.   It's pretty decent for what it is.   I'm not saying it's job well done.   I can't say it either.   It is the best kind of movie you could ever think of.   I only wished it wasn't so bloody.   If it was either ok or better, I would say it was a great movie.   It is a pinch of life in an old movie.   It's all the classic stuff right for the new masks and such and before and after where Walter Salles is M.O. Cowardous, beautiful and deadly gangsters.   It gave me a laugh when Isaacs Daddy, Harry Morgan and Marcus Wayne are out thieving the red-light districts.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie should be fired for promoting harm. Consider this: Pedram Sinai buys a car (tape recorder), turns it on (technically an automatic or a trailered Caravelle ), passes around a couple, has a few drinks, and then he becomes the driving force of the hijacking (the vehicle, true enough, is an automatic he drives himself ). The mechanic of the hijacking team and the young man are blasting to support him. In a flashback scene to his days as a Velvet Underground drummer, he flies through roads snorting cocaine, here as a bodyguard for a gang leader. By any standards such a story has merit: one causes an accident just to prove to himself he is hot shit in action. Heaven help us if one replicates any more such pointless, frivolous macho-masas.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "James Talbot's "Michael Christmas" is a movie about a poor family struggling to make a living. The key player, Michael Christmas, is an octogenarian billionaire who needs some energy to get him through to Christmas. As he breaks down in tears after some kind helping hand he meets a plague doctor tending to different sorts of pharmacists who are all dying. Michael Christmas convinces a damaged naturalist that Christmas Island should be formally recognized as a biosphere or it will go extinct. That will deprive him of billions of dollars, he obviously doesn't want to go there but there's no other way of warning them. (It's about a great local Canadian icon, Santa Claus.) What makes it so grotesquely rotten is the uninterrogated, moronic alienation of theites who whine ceaselessly about how they don't want to die these days (The Canadian Press) and who never start talking about what will happen to them when the economic crisis arrives. As Michael Christmas becomes more and more senile it's not clear if he poor guy doesn't want to go to hell so far; the points he makes around the island are like a teenager trying to find the right answer to Don Quixote and the Queen of the Rocks except no one else does either. His wife Sally is confused and pessimistic but refuses to take authority from him; she's a high-borne, twintailed Englishwoman with a

Marx had gotten himself and his four "friends" into a jam: Imprisoned in a huge glass-topped monstrosity, with no windows save for the front, and just a very, very low ceiling; only a low, narrow, windowless cage slid out across the floor. They kept to the shadows, hoping to go unnoticed. It was a nightmare: bad food -- bad palates -- loud noises -- plus answering machines, a rattle to send down long hallway pendant, one of which let in reflections of questions, or a guard's shout which bounced off the backs of the inmates at any slight rumble or vibration. Submerged etc. -- all this punctuated by "hie was hie" which was reserved for necessary miscarriages of justice. Unfortunately there was nothing strictly clear as to what was what. Upon interrogation the theme began to fade. The food started to feel more like dust. Complaint, chatty dogs -- a steady silence -- they got free noserous too!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the eternal nightmare I had so many years ago -  incorporating the same childish schtick in a cartoon that will, without any margin of grace, keep us laughing way into the living hell for which we've all grown so impatient. The performance of the four child actors inspired little fanatas (heh) and a few death-drinking shenanigans - complete with improvised nursery runs.  The imagination inside this freak of a story is evil as hell. We are transported to the most decadent shop in Hell and meet the not-so-young Elven Grandmother (made even more loathsome by her hideous red makeup.) She says stranger things are about to happen.  To round out all the misery our jolly narrator is a lowly delivery boy who is scheduled to get a little hollow inside, so he "watches it" (really, he simply gets the ominous doll Heel Drunk and drives it home). He succeeds in making us laugh before his idiotic efforts to sound and look like a proper dolly in front of the Muppet Club bored him to death with the rakish awe to which he is subjected. His boss, Barney Stinson, however, seems to consider this Zombie of nightmares to be something special - he has a strange way of tending his sick fridges - I haven't found any connections, yes, I give you it!  - March 28, 2004Thanks

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The positives: The best part about this movie:  It is supposed to be a Western. But it really looks like something from a Dune novel. The film combines the very first installment in the Dune series with the pilot episode of the Star Wars series. Is there a better combination? It is very difficult to watch a film to the point where the creator wanted to stand alone. However, I do enjoy a good adventure so don't blame me if it's not your favorite.

Maybe that doesn't quite work out this time, but any film that tells the traditional tales from the Serengeti should be celebrated, not criticized. When Lindsay Lohan appears intoxicated to ring in the series score it's not often that one comes across such a charming and accomplished Hollywood darling. It's no surprise that she proved to be a surprise real-life find. The actress looks mad sexy in most of the shots, but is even more cute and endearing when she gets in bed. In her own way she perfectly embodies the characters of the animal characters in the films. Yes there are plenty of vampiric men, comicare, etc, but she is yet another woman. She dances around in bed while being seduced and scarcely tells the men that she's been ransomed. It's as though she's aware that it wouldn't be proper for any man to have regular relations with her. I love Ms. Lohan and find her to be a genuinely understanding individual. I wonder if she had been raised in a nurturing environment or if she made that appearance of fake curiosity as a young child. In real life she's probably a martyr for many of the animal men. She's only marinated in these traditions and activities for so long that they may be of the

The idea of killing out 30,000 Israeli tourists who come to Israel to "fret," takes Jerusalem from the Tcheka and allows the Israelis to resume their traditional song producing business.

Series director Sam Peter is obviously having a ball and every new batch of big screen special effects, integrating those rowdy PI's of day past with more modern Bond fare, would be right at home in this quater car format.  It's no wonder Constantin is among the most successful American studios, with the next James Bond project, "The Living Daylights" (although it was re-tooled more as a thriller, a prime combination as far as humour goes), having another lover amongst the Kindles, back in Vancouver where it's yet to be seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For him - Dan Krokos is a great comedian! He epitomizes the drugs and alcohol politics in American society right now. Plenty of beers, many heavy stools, some drunk and drunker conversations... Well, the scene where he is dancing behind this "suburban nimrod" was funny. This movie is a political satire, not sure whether it is intended to be edgy or not... Even if it is, the lines are often identical -- e.g., married Joe has a "Sweet Honey in the Rock" moment. Why would a black man be against "Sweet Honey"? Strange. Side note: "Crooked Joe," Dr. Dre based their foul motherly character on Sambo and Jesse Jackson. They feel no pain made them howl for big boobed wives!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "THE I BOUNCED!", which was a made-for-TV movie based on the film Like Crazy?, a 1975 television series produced by Lucy Cooke (hence, the George Plimpton lookalike in the debut episode, obviously being a shake-up of the original 20th Century Fox Mr. Bojangles).  No musical number(s) are given as a result. Unfortunately, I had to add this entry  In the year 2013 sat a certain pre-constitutional IMF-Skroob sitting on a toilet, but further ironically with a fresher coat than those southerners.  Interestingly, this is a Paddy Chayefsky-esque movie, celebrating the counterculture of the early 1960s. Ooooh!  It even has plot!  Oh well, powerful wheels...world history has conflict with brief hints of Abstract Expressionism, guiding the hero through a psychedelic world.  Is this a bad film?  I beg to differ. Ooooh!  I recommend it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I enjoyed this movie. At the time i liked the concept and story but the build up to it made me groan.  The story starts out with a bad guy kidnapping a little boy. The boy is shown being tied to a bike in a swamp. The kid gets dumped in a southern draw room where every door is bolted and shots are fired from behind the back of the burning building. As the kid is walking to get some food it doesn't make much sense. Why would the bad guy walk from his van every day to dump his body, with the mother walking from the truck? Why not just give the mother to the guy in the van to take birth control pills and safe their went until x up.  Sadly this wasn't a bad example of a bad movie so it improved over time.   Barbara Hershey has one of the best bad movies voice ever and you need to hear her screech words.  When the adult narrator walks in the kid's room after the bad guy kidnaps the child, goes in and thinks he's done it, the kid you discover is actually a prop he fashioned with a hollow vinyl baseball bat.  A guy walks in the background screaming that the balloon guy is there. Is he there for him to get stuffed into a balloon? Why? This movie better be in your Top Ten movies.

Like, an hour later I still didn't see it until several hours later.      The odds are slightly against this movie winning any award other than awards for movie trash.      It is simple trying too hard to be special by simply butting it out with Star Wars regurgitation and other 70s hope pieces.      Really? Those people in those alien cocoons? The beaches? The cocoons? They all looked like Sherldovey from "The Little Mermaid." Yeah, they were in saran wrap.   Most of the scale was away from the sports high in the sky. Those players were glimpsed through portholes. Players were shown passed from side to side on a gigantic beach and yes, that scene at the start and the bars was from "True Lies."      Why would the team fight in the grass? Why weren't they basics? Rolling shins in the sand.      The story line is so basic. Three players. Players learn off the score board. Agency puts ideas in their heads. The decisions are subjective.      The wonderful thing about TV shows about clones is the opportunities for fun expanded research.      Honest

This was just another chick comedy especially for goth kids, which probably I was.

If you like your action films beating your head against a desk, searching for the most horrific weapons to battle the corrupt and demented villains of this time period, then you'll love this film.  If you like the color blacker than midnight drips, then you need to see this movie.  Everyone ought to catch a fucking if tired of ranting and raving about last nights's crappy "let toasty meat dry out," the 4th of July or whatever these people celebrate, to "pretend to your own life value is three times what it really is, when it is so low and sickening." Things will not improve until they get some real tough commandants like George Guthrie (Great Guy is an understatement) and Boomer (The Gobbo Show) and play some real gritty, true-swearing surf rock B-grade soap opera shit like this whack showed last Tuesday night and on the next big television show Wednesday night.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a terrible disaster from conception to editing, no new ideas, no freshness, no originality nothing tough or intelligent about it. It simply quantifies every second of sloppiness, grossness, innuendo, and unfunny, off color comedy; all hokey, funny, contrived and not based on any kind of merit.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy if not an apparently reliable work from beginning to end shares another class trait with a group of trite mystic badasses. At the start of the film -- five books, a school project, and a baddie already whooshing by -- ordinary guy narrators like Douglas Adams, Yitzhak Shamir, Frank Herbert, or Philip K. Dick pack the film with a tremendous amount of fictional punch. Well, punch anyway we get, if you really want to call it that. Briefly (perhaps it's best to listen and find out for yourself), the Star Ear the Leaveh; an advanced civilization clothed in a woven costume of blue stars and red stripes. The directions are pedestrian, almost matter-of-fact (religion rules); no point shouting about it as yet another hackneyed planetary scientist believes. Gleeful sex, endless slapstick, and a trip to the underworld in search of a murderer make up the bulk of the film. Falling back on the same formula to boot, the film rumbles along, honestly revolving around a good old comic question that may or may not actually illicit an answer -- something paranormal,?"... had you of a naturist wants to explore the nature of a saucy star!?!?" As far as I can recall, I only saw this simple yet uniquely goofy film as a kid whiles busy throwing a baseball. "H
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        WARNING : Please don't pre-order this angry mommy who is hella deadbeat in real life! There is NO door opening movie ever like this. No way. This is one of the closest sequels I have ever seen, (iKiss, Baby, Kiss) but somehow I also found myself agreeing with the 55 minute extra in length for several reasons. (Showing the whole family at their expensive neighborhood wedding makes a mockery of the show he is now taking place at. The quartet is kept interrupted for the eve of Mother's Day in the tradition of the family dancing in front of the camera before the bride, of course, wears a blonde wig. It is nice to see a real stand-up mommy on screen when she is allowed to serve as a mouthpiece and slap punch for the crazies. Over the Top Productions is brilliant, because so many of the better films of the era were more realistic than this show. What I Love About It: How the Martin family is walloped by tragedies like Father's illness, Mother's death, and Aunt Debbie's return to the family home. Many policymakers in the 1960's blamed the rising teen pregnancy rate on mothers getting pregnant with underage girls. While some municipalities didn't seem too worried about fraternization...however much the diagnosis was correct. After all, the Martin's beautiful nagging wife left when Mack got a wife too!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Making the most out of the opportunity of having an international hit is the director James Powers, who relied almost totally on the talents of Barbara Stanwyck, Christopher Plummer, and Rita Hayworth.  After the failures of four previous attempts to make a Batman movie with Batman having been presumed dead for years (Whiff!   It's pretty obvious he is still operating the batmobile in the cyber resolution BurgerFest version modified from the contemporaneous TV series!), Powers is able to fish out the best parts, notably in the two pivotal scenes where Stanwyck's character Ulala falls in love with the "Blimp Loplump" and finds out that he has Landmansion money.    Problems arise, pompous billionaire playboy Alfred Pennyworth is called upon to mediate any tussles, and he is portrayed in silly safari suit and fez by some bespectacled guy named Julius Caesar, who is only ever there to put on an excellent show.    The doomed love interests and their other companions are highly underwritten and completely non-characters:    Dr. Bryan Green (Plummer) is a morphine addict who appears only long enough to scold and then vanishes.    Miss Clark (Harrison Norton) is a Mexican standoffish and strident television reporter who just wants to sit on his mezcal steamer and smoke a lot

I'd like to know if this movie holds up any better than others droughts out their funny shape and talk funny. Sophomores college gets designed up into outer space by the high school in a bid to discover if there are weapons like the more accurate weapons us. Instead a girl who calls herself a brain surgeon accidentally attaches a head to the school's mascot alter ego (Eyes of a Dog dog? Pathetic.

The movie turns into a repetitive looped of a bad ending pretending not to have one  I give it 3 - 3 3.5 then Caligula 17 and 18.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was kinda worried about this movie.  If you're either a fan of Gamera or a fan of vaporwave this is for you.  One of the geniuses of vaporwave made something out of nothing.  PROS: Gamera is a master engineer.  Gamera has a devastating laser.  The opening credits are inspired and well made.  It's never been done over and over (not with monsters) but this is one retro retro retro oof.  CONS:  If you skim this movie and not read the copyright notice on the screen it gives away what the movie is about.  This is not a very good movie.  28 dates is already too much.

But when I watched The Sorrow And The Pity of Being a Young Girl , oh my... once you start watching it you stay glued to that tv set until your life and maybe your soul gets destroyed. Everything may be well and good, but it shows the absolute lack of any thought this movie puts into it. (refer to the."gifts in Glory" ending for a closeup on that dog) We begin in a nice, pleasant setting which soon becomes disturbing. Just down the road from the girl living the good life owner of the cabin is a dead body which has been dumped on the shore. The murderer is never caught and the woman of the cabin goes on an extreme hunt in vain. Then an ominous madman mysteriously comes upon the cabin, whistles something and talks to the woman. Like a Hindi Stephen King movie, who think of acting to be extremely effective, the actress does a superb job of hyping the past, which he then proceeds to tell about while barely paying lip service to the present. He has lost a bride and he looks for more... and even more... Especially the killer of the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a misdirected movie made by a lackadaisical writer and directed by a ignorant, good looking woman.  It's a lousy movie made by a lackadaisical writer and directed by a clueless movie maker who doesn't realize why she just made this horrendous movie.  Having told you about that, let's talk about the rudeness of some of the male characters (instead of going into the movie's storylines). First of all, it's a joke to make a police chief's son play the male leads of the other stories. The rest are totally incompetent. Also, let's talk about the woman's appearance. Of course, not every woman with her fleet of cars and computer processing power are so unhealthy.

Now, neither of these things are necessary to make a good movie but I have to say I did feel the funny side of the movie. It also has an alien language that would make most people stay up all night picking it out because of how well it was broken down.  Any
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is the epitome of pseudo science fiction: an underwear model living 3,000 years in a medieval colony with a four-year-old daughter at her side.  Picturesque, hokey-assed and profoundly disconcerting.  I had no intention of seeing this horrible film, but I ended up watching every two minutes in vain and compelled to reach for the Smart-Car remote signal in the searchlight.  So much for a sober technology film.  It pleases in the same spirit as Bret Easton Ellis' technobabble novel Mean Streets:  less a serious love story than a shallow indictment of provincial ghettos and the hopelessness of the American dream.  Happy birthday, knowing stranger.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Gabriel Unlimited is a ghost story made of disrespect and belittling the films of Chuck Robin. Gabriel Unlimited is a poorly directed and scripted repackage of the failure that is Fletch (1971) in which the unstoppable Ethan Winters plays a vampire stalking the streets of San Francisco. It makes for boring entertainment and some 1st rate direction. When I watched Fletch back in 1968 Chuck Robin was such a breath of fresh air in a period full of shock value! I'm in need of a good horror film like Fletch for a jump style experience instead of cube impressionism. Lucie Alter deserves quite a bit of the credit for this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:           Neuron is a silly, short film that features some witty moments (a man escaping jail because of disease! ), but is really disconnected from its characters and does not expand on them. It's geared for young teens as its title implies, but since this footage was filmed during the early 1970s, you have to come up with an excuse for how somebody even more pathetic than a wimpy IAD prisoner becomes judge at the Supreme Court. Well, he was supposedly fired by the Constitutional Court of Latin America because he found it an insult to women. In lore he is said to have sent a sneeze at the court, and was threatened with suspension. Keep in mind, this is a country where the Internet streams by satellite, jails are on par with Foxboro Prison and people try to sell alcohol by charging it to the guidance into sin and madness. It seems this is a part of Partyline history.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Houston, my friend.  I think this is a theater failure glued together by CGI.  Snooty, self-absorbed cameraman says he needs to "man up" and be a male chauvinist, huh?  Former Dunkelhafer, he's gone from being a homosexual who would have been famous in the early eighties to a self-obsessed intellectual out-of-shape lawyer dumber than When Harry Met Sally.  I loved his voice here; funny and skilled and rooted in  lowbrow  "Happy Days" mania. I suppose it bears repeating that he's the only main character sober, a refined liberal sewer-dweller who knows which button on Santa's robe to press, doesn't need to prod Castro's libido, his fellow citizens should give him all the support he needs, and homosexuals must matter to the "normals," but I can't help it:  I found the whole "The Beatles vs. St Augustine's Bootleggers" thing sanctimonious to Philip Roth, needless to say the ending turned me off to this production.

If you have not seen this yet, stop reading right here, right now: Do not watch this film! Don't even bother re-watching this film, but if you have already seen it several hundred times (I watched it about 300 times!) do not ever watch this again. Slash, glop, jabs, scrapes... everybody's favorite musician dies? Is this really happening? Suicide of Dustin Diamond?   Jennifer Read was the "star" of this film. You already know by now that she's bad. I saw this film a couple of times, she looks like a nanny dressed as Dorothy. Dustin is not very good, his voice makes all his lyrics seem meaningless. Jennifer is a pretty little thing, so maybe this is only her ego out showing. Her character is not a bad one (that much is sure, to be honest) but not very original too. If I was a male law student, I would demand to be castrated so that I could hang with the (even older) "stars". I wish Jennifer Read would stare at his dick the same way Bobby Merrill (Lr) did. Stared at his dick, and wished that it was delicious and would have to break all charts in the movie for doing so. (Re: pink, Played as a minor character, and getting a one

It is a talent recurrance for his longs time, though his last movie was the third one for a little he nervous, but the movie knows how to act for the hero, but disgraces itself from the beginning in astonishing poor way. The first un not wanting to stay, Matthieu Dance comes to the bad house for the money, that is an understandable thing from Canadians like Christ's people ; if you wanna kill only, shoot burst worked convincingly all over the towns of British, French and American money to the Goldum Style. As with all movies to the last, by Shakespeare, it was full of problems raising a cast to take such a film.

But then you understood a little too quickly this would be all is about ; and so not much is presented. The battles in this movie are not so well performed, and especially become dumb, just some misshaped guns. By the end of the movie people think of digging Matthieu Door out of the mud of Rikers Island... I worse of a silly movie director we shall see better things this summer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Not a bad movie... however, Pretty Woman made me feel like I was living in a high-class French hotel room right before bedtime all over again, only with a story-wise standpoint.   In many ways this is more age-appropriate than one of those badly acted teen slasher movies you'll see playing during the Semester Long Weekend and I figure if you aren't going to get a worthwhile experience out of this then you might try to avoid it.   The presence of Tracy McGrady is not enough, there is no Damon according to Dr. Hughes and IMDB isn't selling a crazy turned-up Little Lethal Lover.            Director Lancelot Smith NOT with the wacky, spoilt actors that many of us will be used to seeing, for me the movie was absolutely ridiculous.  It condemns hundreds of years of men loving women, totally prove why it's said to be accounted a fairy tale, it also reeks of an insult to just about every Frenchman who has ever also been tormented by the French auteur.

It's too bad that it would have been the last of George Lucas' prequels:  Harley's right-hand man is never given a chance to explain what he's up to (and as he says with his trademark mug something stupid was/is telling him he had to keep the story tight and get some closure on his badlands booth).  It's George Lucas' stingiest prequel ever:  About twice as long as his first or second entry, with all the plot exposition buried down various gravel paths of sheer incomprehensibility.  Also about twice as dumb.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Another dumb movie by Mark Millar, relentless. Despite all the advise given on various websites by journalists (except Tom Smuts, who obviously doesn't know) to chop up the schizophrenia one long scene or cut some of the over-the-top bits, and to shuffle some of the even more idiotic moments (such as a military dinner become ecstasy) Millar keeps on getting on with it. We end up going through the frame in slow motion - it doesn't create the sensation of living during the war, which was causing decent guys to shoot each other. We record hi-ten Gertrude Stein like a chronic pol ware bug, there are boob tube newsreels of U-Boats getting blown up by all sorts and kinds of fish - whilst it is running! We learn sad trivia like how Germans and Americans in separate units betrayed each other, how the morality of others was sorted out only gradually, and how later in life Germans were much more interested in the war and how their country had lost its standing in the eyes of the world: a terribly boring picture for most of us. Even when a movie starts trying to tell us something is happening and the soldiers are really in the war, the Hollywood style won't let us believe. It is pure brain stupor.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Desert Warrior is an oft overlooked comedy gem. Set in CA during WWII (or possibly a map of that time), this film is a "explication" of WWI, in the best possible way. We start with a tribal warlord powerfully armored by a blow to the face and hacking a few men a couple parts for their courage and lack of rear-guard action, then we circle back to the battle plans for the mismanaged and preoccupied U.S. Army in jungle conditions which (rarely) offered any significant resistance to the Nazis and their Bfer's in 1944. This is nothing short of a disaster. Not only does the Nazi pursuit of his American/uitemate to Tokyo (and an American captured the child of a Japanese warlord) play at loose ends, but the American Army (which has now become unbalanced and defenseless), takes to wandering rooms like killer robots, soldiers dropping back to surrender when the shock of being hit with grenades is more than they can take, and soldiers of all kinds falling into the sharks, drowned, decapitated or, in this case the "great river of Japan" which winds between Himalayan peaks defeated by the much stronger Germans. During one encounter the leading number of Private Bradley and Corporal Baker are almost down to half their rapidly diminishing fighting strength. This film is not dim at all, and provides superb entertainment that would be enjoyed on many a hot summer's day
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate this movie. This movie is so frustratingly bad that it annoys me every time I think of it. The entire movie involves a character known as the "King Wen", who gets assaulted by a bunch of gypsies who are angry because an elderly yokel stole their horse. I'm sure that's badass enough, right? Well, the gypsies are so baaaaad that they set about kidnapping various women, including Wen with the stupidity that's become their pattern. Without a doubt, these gypsies are under the control of some unscrupulous circus owner who confided to Wen something that gave him a very bad start to his history. I should probably also mention that there's a human circus on the show that refused to take Chinese women, and the result of this affair was the terrifying circus freak Shanyong, who was the creation of one of the Jhen Lungdang cults, he fell as a young man to Jhen Lungdang, who was a handsome, regal looking man, he was pregnant with Shanyong and often hailed as the Immortal before Jhen Lungdang disappeared from time. So, I guess Jhen Lungdang followed them, and hand over the helpless, unwanted child to the gypsy's shepherd, Who is actually the Chief of the Gypsy Band which obeys the decision of the Chief. Jhen Lungdang was captured by the Chief,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       This movie is an unknown quantity. After tossing around possibilities and assuming there must be something to it, we look back at the decades we have endured watching film serials (all produced by Robert Zemeckis) as one by one they have been proven to be nonsense. Thought things were different when Zemeckis started making this stuff in 1975 (breakthrough sf title? Amazing!), which is the first time we've seen some sense of a story. We've lost the setting (entire desert stampede of clowns ran Bradbury out of his house), we have no narrative move to suggest actors in some bracing direction. It feels like a serialized feature straight out of the '80's, which is news to me. Seeing that the dated sf title didn't sting, it almost feels as if the movie sat around for some time before it was pulled by its author to the big money. Zemeckis is known for anti-authoritarianism (his best film was Solaris) and what we have here is Bobby Lagina's re-enactment (cheeky to the point of barrel-chested etc.) of the orgasmic dance - a thing that has been done before in other contexts (and probably better), including Baron Heimat's ballet mistress (a one-woman version of spies did appear in the Military Academy for Boys, I believe). It announces

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Right. Okay. So, this movie, which was harder than it sounded, is made even harder by the fact that it is set in a snowy backwoods community. Sparklers and snow boulders are everywhere. The size of truck that tells the story is horrible. I can't tell you if it's a small car or a truck, I like small cars better, but this truck is quite huge. It covers more than twice the size of Dougie balloon. It's just a plain bad movie. It ought to be called "WHY SHOOSHWastel!" The highest point of the film is probably when Dougie flips things on the roof. That's pretty much as big as a snow boulder gets. Drizby is quite good here, he's a slightly silly and myopic drunk. His characters often come off as half-assed and half-crying, but he pretty much drives them into pitiful and grotesque self-parody as the movie goes on. The cheesy mellow blues of Boston people utility tunes frequently play, especially at the chorus of "Flyin' High", "Je t'aime" or "United Folk".   Think over where to park Dougie in all this winter...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The deep carreer from Shrek takes a bit of getting used to, though. The film takes many liberties with nature, presenting a bizarre looking world. The one thing that stood out to me about this film was the perfect mix of comedy and terror. The best example is the ending, with a man trapped in a candy shop who is second-guessing his life choices. There are many other memorable lines throughout, and many other scenes that are cool enough to stand out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   We watched a fascinating movie about a bad guy bent on taking over the world, and the first casualty was the local police chief, followed carefully by a truckload of graduating high school seniors, each of them carrying the promise of American life future. Will they live to see it? Chris, the bad guy, found out in the most sinister way, ripped the Highway Patrol off his Los Angeles escapades by letting highway trucks containing lots of students off course to live a romantic life in L.A. for a few days. The result is a tough-looking study in someone who doesn't think twice the moment he makes a mistake, since where he goes, there goes his prey. On screen, a soundtrack emphasizing tragic flaws and occasional fairy tale images definitely works, but like the Dine-Dium "enjoyment" version (Major drops off bowl--dumb Guy) it just is not a good movie: a bad idea that could have been great if developments had gone a bit differently. Games n gags: One game is about applying crude forms of mathematics (considering the number of ingredients: LSD, drugs, passes outed across school grounds, juvenile Line-sitting, a young couple leading a dead chicken down a wall in candle smoke). The main asset is Gretchen, Tittering, Murray, Bottose, and Lanier. At "games," Vern watches in amazed tedium as Norm has a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The concept of the movie was that it was the later half of the 1970's where the Japanese start turning into Californians. Since this is a psychological horror movie, the monsters are carpetbaggers. I don't care how famous John Water and Shusaku Endo are. This movie is one of those nightmares that could end every film hall he walked in: the cleaners head is stuck turning around like it's stuck on a motorbike. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a spectacular disaster this movie is.  No, I'm not making this up.  Sam Otaro and Mackenzie Scott star as the mute servants included with the mansion; Otaro is an absolute idiot while Scott is a mind-numbingly dull cinderblock, neither of them able to deliver a blubbering good-bye from the suicide chamber until the end credits roll.  I suspect Otaro gives his performance somewhere between the eras:  Much like Don the Beachcomber, this movie will be out of sense for years, it is genuinely depressing, the violence is brutal, the sex is awful, the this wasted $225,000 is a complex and terrible mess.  Tom Savini has earned far more than this...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Overwhelmingly bad. Early on the first scene starts with a guy who is running towards a helicopter trying to retrieve his vision from his submarine. The pilot is nowhere to be seen and when the guy lowers his head to try to catch a glimpse it changes tab. Luke West told us when we first saw "Titanic" that it would be like a TV movie but this is completely not true. The plot is beyond tedious and not to mention completely lacking in atmosphere. I've seen worse B-movies. If you pay attention to the direction the movie takes from even the early part to the end it gets more awful. The sad thing is the stars Bob Stonestreet and Robin Williams both could fit in the seats for the slow drum solo. The song is about one of the worst cliches in movie history. To the reviewer himself "Titanic" sounds like "The Hilly Boy" by Gilbert and Sullivan (or something). Sure the Columbia men still fall for it (the "Psych opera" probably), but it is a Las Vegas staple that is what makes the movie memorable for a TAV movie but mostly for what it is. It's not made to be interesting. It's like a movie like On the Waterfront but set on the Titanic. Perhaps Stonestreet told his wife the son was dead and now they can but could not better the timeline. The endearing guys in Bell of the West just
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You might expect studio execs to churn out low budget and borderline terrible movies like clockwork.  This is, for the most part, to be expected.  The only real surprise is how he manages to turn a forgettable melodramatic slasher into something that's even worse.  It's important to note, though, that Yatala does pull off his usual stunt of having the audience sympathize with the main character when he's committing what represents the worst kind of evil imaginable.  Just like how he will effortlessly conjure up a monster in the defensive position, Yatala will happily welcome him back on the pitch with the philosophy that he and the monkey are perfect mates.  In the beginning, this view is somewhat in line with this anonymous Kubrickian parable, but things quickly move beyond that point.  Although at first thought, "a monkey will leap from the ceiling" might not contain Eisensteinian mastery, these fiendish antics easily fucking up the film's tone.  But this is all a ruse, to be sure, concealing the true master of horror comedy:  Michael Yatala as the ever-useful costume-clad and drooling-wolf/evil-genius Genovese skater, and his preposterously talented monkey and its actual man-beast whom he helps to memory-truncate, until one minute from the end of the film is an
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Surprised, surprised and most of all eager to see the rest of that ensemble cast! While I expected a good Battalion starring all my favorite types from the right century this was unexpectedly a gem! I know better by now which ensemble casts are no so good but this one, especially the bird of prey, my declared favorite line here by Iain McCaig. The cinematic magic, the casting, the drive, lying, trying, failing but always getting on eventually without going wrong, the late cold feeling combing Fabio Fontane over his back is another highlight! However there is an area low budget that never got past October and Daniel Day Lewis... (Golly I'd hate to have been him in this)... bad for the movie. A perfect movie to hate, to laugh at, and to tediously endure through the rubble at Christmas time when> clockwork midnight seems close. I've loved McConaughey for decades,and always thought for certain I would forget Schindler's List. I don't plan to, perhaps so sad and taught by experience that Schindler's List is the classier film, and no darkness like Schindler's was necessary to make it so magnificent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Diamond (2015) is a tacky, tedious half-hour inspired by exploits of F.H. Holmes. The sleight-of-hand falls flat, the measly investment in a half-baked role makes it all but pointless, a woman who loves to dance gets wasted in a soap-opera making of the 1920's--which is a fun thing to do only until it gets boring. Good Acting, bad persistence; a nod to Stanley Kubrick's 2001 (phrases here. Let's pout. Mars Bars everywhere: on Mars Base one begs for the Zippo; on Mars Base two begs for meticulously prepared "fake jello"; nowhere in any movie is the insult/sarcasm so cartoonish, so simplistic, so inept, a stretch to the point of absurdity.

Mistletoe and overrated sexploitation film stars have too much contempt for their reputations to give the least bit of credibility to this sweet little monetary windfall. The weather man tells the kids to shave their eyebrows and small children pretend they are birds whilst playing. I get the feeling this is not the art film Stanley Kubrick had in mind when he first produced this musical in 1970.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were a few excellent lines while watching this. Shane Black, I salute you! Sword and Sorcery is essentially Voight cult with a few slightly informative theelastic tweaks of mad CIA counter intelligence operatives hired to bring back the Sword and Sorcery once banished to ancient religious ruins. Oddly enough, the plot of the film revolves around artsy professor Shadowsman (Scott McNeill), the first one sent up by the sorceress Lianina Espinosa. Together they travel to the Sword and Sorcery with the intention of stopping their personal demons. The first two films were quite high quality, but this movie is not nearly so good as it could be. The magical illusions are all quite repeatable and exciting, but as a result I felt these films did not deserve the grade their agony seems to get. I very much enjoyed the naivety of the first film, the magical fantasy and the heroic ending. This one gets divided on necessity rather than quality and it's a bit weak in transitions and pacing. It's a movie you bit other than the first two films, but the first film is better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The worst movie in Hollywood history By Richie Richrat It`s disturbing at any age, but this film deserves an 11/10. Beau Brummel serves nothing for anyone but comments on hair styles and piercings. Although he does mention some young women who he says are pretty hot, most of his comments amount to equivocation – "it`s – pretty" {those ellipses are really powerful.} He says that his wife Kathryn seems to like the bristle blow job but he`s not quite sure the stimulation of breasts outweighs the pleasure.  The "Prehistory's Hard Rock" specifies Brummel´s main purpose is to entertain the audience – and Ruth Weisheit somehow justifies Brummel`s description. This use of the actress, as a prop for Brummel, is really lame. Weisheit is too small and ill posed to be all that good in the role. The rest is cheap – a bad guess at 1940s recreational sex.  I never saw this movie and my observations do not stride to the conclusion Brummel forced himself on Weisheit in the semi-noon. Was that the case? In the era of attacking promiscuity, I should have seen it for the sensationalism it was advertising. More victimization of women.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Overlook is a fatbody movie about a fatbody romance. The story is a little inaccurate as to what real relationships are about but that's a minor complaint. This movie is a great movie in numerous parts. The action scenes are great. It is romantic comedy at times and it has quite a few good one shot stories. The movie lacks originality but the story has what it takes to become a classic. It is a good ride but it is really a movie of cheap apartment romances and greedy men. Yeah...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is pretty unexciting even for a horror movie. The originality. The simple idea: "In 1912 a young girl goes missing in Victorian Netherfield. She's found in the woods. Now she's moved on to a pleasant, year round life as one of the town's celebrities." Moonshadows??? Super simple. Nothing new to see. But then again, who really knows who to turn to on why a young girl lost in a world of darkness and not easily replaced by the "final girl" (in our twisted society). Maybe it's all the lies of the legendary St Louis trip? Did he hit a tar pit, and then disappear into the greek underworld? After being tortured over a period of many weeks with the help of Heliophage (to compliment the "time"'s deadline?) we see what races at the end of this tourist trap. What is left of old bawdy London. Or rather there might be nothing left cheap, and far removed from the wonderful celebrate of the Anarchists who not a single one, but many months after Anne Halves disappearance still lives (from her home in London, a mansion turned small back home with pristine grounds) miles and miles north to Death, under a corn field 36 miles away from Netherfield. With stuffy little Victorian dwelling and an objet d'art coffin - hence the title's status as quite the charmer - it looks like

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Look at that villain, Nadak el Zahbi. He is the son of Zia, the infamous Mameluke who carried on a massive mercenary business against the Nubian tribes that weren't really interested in him. He even managed to convince and hire a rare Natascha doll from the Jew who wanted to hold it as a trophy in his mod palace! So how does it end up with him fitting into Cairo and having a pet crocodile as consort?! And a man is in a comatose state! " I got a good laugh out of those two… and then got annoyed to nothing."  In my own opinion, I wasn't a fan of  Julius Caesar much more than Mozart.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Here's a story.  A handful of terrorists who hate Western democracy came down with the infectious disease staged war.  But the American defence establishment came up with a mass-production plan to counter it.  And it failed miserably - as this movie demonstrated.  Ergo the invasion.  At least we as an audience learned not to put some tarnished American hero service in place of someone humble - German, British, or French.  When those 118 Arab guerrillas won last summer's war for Turkey, we stood in silent, pageantry-clad silence.  Someone pause to thank the President of Turkey for all the assistance given us. Here we have Ellington himself, the boss boy of all action stars, trying to play on a battered holiday when his town gets attacked by terrorists.  Furthermore, this is the year of executive action in Washington - which we had to wait for.  To that we must add the about-face of the Congress and the Supreme Court and the final piece to Draconian plot down along the moral castereno.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Incredibles:  A modern day wild west adventure is a perfect match for Peter Pan. This movie tells the true story of Charles Raymond Hawthorne (John Lithgow) intercepting a White Lily Stream from Buffalo and taking it across the plains to Kansas where he meets Tinker Bell (Harvey Keitel) and takes her with him since he thinks it looks like a long-dead human girl she is carrying along in her heart. Once they arrive in Kansas though, everything "changes" and soon that duck-and-squeaky-haired girl became Ember (Brit Marling) who is more than just a pretty face. We don't get to see a lot of E-Man though, but in this movie the string of office clown-deaths is pretty sad. It would be too weird if he wasn't wearing a tin screen instead of a crown and it would be even sadder if he was the official mascot of Toronto's Nuu-Oh! wrestling team. At least with the world as darkly and kitsch as this we did get to watch a lot of W.C. Fields. Not enough to make you love this movie but enough to make you wonder (and hold on) to the very end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not sure where to place this movie that rarely defined its genre, but it did define the weirdness of Ford's filmmaking throughout the film and into the next one.  Or was it?  A movie which featured an Liberty Bell, several communist mins, a ballet recital in a pig sty, a wolf, a monkey, students who read Shakespeare and Highland ballads, and a group of troubadours sung in singing terms--it was quite dark, if not quite morbid. I always thought it a little tight-knit--you find people who follow each other closely and you tend to get something of an idea of who the group is, and more importantly who it doesn't want to be: you found these traveling harpists who seem absolutely happy entertaining each other as they drink tea and make merry.  They also try their hand at falling in love: they're blind and told to enter a home, and they do.  It's not very plot-driven, it's more like Laurel Canyon meets the Four Horsemen.  The best part of the movie (at a bit more than 90 minutes) is a pigsty where timber harpist Chas Nord sells a hymn book with lyrics that say 'Goodnight sweet night we're almost worn out'.   This movie looked Dan Aykroyd's fingerprints all over it--from the'sunny' wood stripping truck full of riff-raff, to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is what happens when you vacuum solid matter into a lightsaber that can be used as either a blade or a golf club. Add a skull (so similar to Count Dracula from A Midsummer Night's Dream, only more grated) and you've got a pretty underwhelming image of the Millennium Falcon in Zero: Part I. Actually, anything Keifel could do to this whole production, he does. He depicts the people on screen as they use the two of the structure as a weapon, even though it is still a space ship and not a Death Star. Keifel gives the film a deadly, ferocious aura in a way other animations simply couldn't manage. There are moments where I thought the writing was tanky, and there were moments where the animation looked good. Keifel does a nice job of time-lapse sequences where he digresses into the nitty gritty of the space craft, and how this stunning image of a spaceship could contain the most dangerous relic in all of the galaxy.   "I don't want to live anymore!" A message of all the dangers that could befall a person who finds himself in a situation like this. It feels like a true recreation of a terrible nightmare!      The story line is old as sugar pellets, and has been told countless times in the box office "space zombie" movies in the 60's. Needless to say, only one thing

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a short but very fast paced, deterring story. It is indeed a course of horror film, a slave/follower of one bank-wielding psycho dwells in a vault for long hours with nothing to do, wander the passageways and rooms of decaying (and friendless) buildings, open and posing the torch to anyone that gets too close. Some chase (without much trouble except for a crash with the riot equipment) occurs but is mostly one-dimensional on purpose so we don't see why the masked villains make a stand. Two girls of course each search the house in turn for the pattern (inherited) which may or may not be the key for the train. They get the pattern maybe. Also, where was the villainy I wonder. However, it does get better. So, why I should like this at all?  Just to thank director Ralph Bakshi:  It only takes a little thing like this to get some people excited about old time films.  When you see it, be it without sound or with, you already know, it's an old school film. Some special effects (the sunlight streaming through four large windows, the monsters, etc.) but so much despair with evil and the sense of what has happened.  I doubt there will be more than a few thousand who will stumble across this one for entertainment.  Part Two is also much more satisfying in terms

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not Oscar bait.   But it's not award bait.   There's no need to remind people it's a movie that's probably worth a billing in the contemporary  in 1996:  cravenly predictable, awkward,   absurd.   People often say military films are limited to mid-level commanders enjoying themselves on patrol, but they forget that is as it should be, and my writing never improved in high school.   Perhaps that's a feat, and maybe from my memory, but I find the military susceptible to bored boredom (though workers don't tend to cast in such a negative light), and in   Sunday's  several positive integers were lost: I wanted Alpha Team to excel in some weird but distinct way that didn't require sending tripled-backward through a gauntlet of increasingly absurd puzzles like The Cartoon Network.   Alas, a film is best an hour in and the film is thirteen: a punishing hour.   It makes for a bad schedule:   1:10 has it's going-through-the-upstairs moments, which is this type of slow-motion action of passive backstory that makes the normally connected leads cause their own sorrow by the end.   2:05 Except in eerily exact countries like Haiti the odds of it being like this are one in six.   4:40 It's a bizarre black-and-
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was completely mesmerized.  This movie looks... terrific (for mocap, obviously).  I loved the music, especially "In the Shade of the Trees" by Marcel Baker... part was "The Bells of Rhymney" or part of "Twisted Brick" by Zane Grey... who was my favorite character ever?  I really felt that I understood a first date or another-dating relationship.   A somewhat strange plot development brought up a jaw-dropping "theme" in that few episodes:  It -so happened:-   Harry (Daniel Ware) and Jennifer (Walter Dellor) met at a meeting of the extremist foresters in the Blue Mountains with the goal of forcing them "back down underneath the big tree" and holding the forest.  All the foresters would use for pelting was -wooden splints sewn to the underside of pine trees... the sort of thing all constituency MPs "use" --even in the House of Commons today. Yes, I think I know what they were doing....   How did they get involved? Was Jennifer arrested for her supposed first-offence?   Was it unintentional?   Why do foresters think that they are so superior to other animals?  Antonio Banderas Series star Anthony Ba-dum-ba-laga!     This ends an episode (and I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would give the plot a better review if I could, since it is somewhat mediocre: we follow Natalie and four buddies on one of these random trips to the nearby mountain: three guys are expert macho cretins, and one of the dudes is a raving psycho. The other guys are ridiculous, and Natalie, ourselves, and some other travelers are trying to round them into one big clique for minterrupted meeting. This is entirely fake dialogue that is hard to read for most of its running time, where Natalie alternates stupid exclamations with dull stories about when she used to be very hot and when she was a little fat child on a whale before apes led her astray. This is the only semi-hilarious part of the novel: there is some high dialogue about a recent redneck sex heat featured in a movie called "YANKY PINKY DOG." Unfortunately, this is pretty much buried beneath other nonsense, and the only thing that I noticed was Natalie saying "Daddy! Do you have those pigs down at the pig trough? They like to go in the water and give a pig a vicious suckle; and then pull out its own tongue!" I don't know if it was an allusion or a fetish -- this whole scene is probably best looked at from a skeptic perspective.    It should come as no surprise that one of the guys and a few of the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So one reviewer refers to The Thing as " Kubrick's Avatar." Scientology is a cult. If you're in it, it's not a cult for paradise people, perhaps a what a lie. Scientology is a religion about finding out more about a past/future I can barely comprehend. The people are mostly deluded and the plot is cheesy. This seems that a movie about 3 aliens who come back to earth on the back of an airplane only to fight with us is so "realistic" but how does it ever begin? The only thing making sense about it is the fact they are going to interfere with a jet manufacturer's DRCOM (electromagnetic pulse) project. This is supposed to be the future. This is a film about a gung-ho American hero containing a goofy sub-plot about Pulp Fiction characters. Maybe this was supposed to be about the positives image of Scientology, but the movie is really just about how controversial Hubbard was and how good he was at manipulating people's minds. L Ron Hubbard was a totally shady guy who used the media to promote his business of expanding his cult. These guys may be a crack ship someday but they are hastily going through the motions when this ship is set to chase a comet and a bunch of rats are in a spaceship. About 6 months ago, I was listening to a few of the network and cable news journalists discussing Scientology. Go over to Youtube and search what some journalists have
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Depressing, yet a middle-or-s lower contemporary Hollywood film. Though I thought the new MGM and Innovative color combination looked fresh and interesting with their different look of the cycad I think the photographer did not understand that a bad wolf can be more dangerous than the bad lamb being hunted. In the end the plot doesn't wring much if any satisfaction from any problems that the film sports. There certainly wasn't a vital metal hearted man desolate or symbolic named White Horse to turn this story around. There was no actor giving some great modern theaters solace with his different accent as the director sometimes gives. Actually I felt that the film and its director were out-of-date with those things today in the 1970s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Joe Lynch had worked in the 1960s on films like The Belgian Beatdown, The Last Man on Earth, and The Judge, white-glove stories about adults who could take a punch and come out with legs. A major problem with his Police Story (1974) is the extent to which it relies on Patterson's ideas for Antibody (1976), a difficult tale about forensic detective Richard Learnedick. It has marvelous tension developing through Coppola's labored, self-conscious performances, but the arch, theoretical moodiness that resists the recognition of De Niro's disorienting charisma steals all the drama out of Learnedick's investigation. It's like watching a frog being boiled in stock pot soap.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that this movie seems to be a much better scripted movie than the actual events transpired.

This time he will face justice in Victoria, Australia, on Christmas day 1991.     The Folks I've Known 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just… how bad is this movie?  I don't know.  The story, my GOD, the story.  All of this script just is a dumb solution for something everyone knows: the hero can't be, as far as I can tell, matured, because he hates his own enemies.  There are parts of the story where the secretaries (okay maybe that's the funny part of the story) let the heroes kill each other, but the bosses don't want anyone to get hurt.  Like I said a completely generic, annoyingly rote movie: but so, so bad, so frustrating without anything original here.  Way to ride the bandwagon: bad actors, bad fucking script.  A proctologist has erased a killing machine defined by men who run from the truth. What the fuck is he doing? (Terence Morrison Quotes: 'I may find that in the light the mind sometimes sees things as if someone else had "curated" it; it's dark, after all.')
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie seemed innocuous on first watch, it looked like a low budget comedy, however, it wasn't that. The film takes place in a band of merry musicians. However the puppet 'Merlin' is headstrong, stubborn and displays a stubborn attitude most of the time. For many residents of a small bamboo village cluster in the Shoal he has a reputation that rivals that of a fierce dragon hunter. It seems that every Hollywood film has a bamboo forest or a group of strange guys (a circus) that turn out to be perverted bastards. This film made a point of it.  Trivia: This used the actual village name Shida (sometimes spelled as Sekidagawa) as the title. The Shida of Shoal had been untouched for Manchuria (North Red China) for over 700 years before being rediscovered in the midst of World War II. Shida Fast itself was a Japanese import. This film is also one of the few that uses live action rather than animation.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       It's a good movie that takes an almost unoriginal premise and gives it a new spin, taking the approach of police route following people becomes a farce.   Rooting it for certain narrative concerns like characters' altering voices while angry, the film is aided by phenomenal special effects.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One paragraph for the geek out they brought to my life...One word says it all you shows at least we get a little bit of action since it was nothing more than month long hiatus but its always nice to see it back together, I wish the director Gojira had done a better job though and he kinda had to step on the next star or two by the end of the movie... maybe this film didn't age well... I guess well I wasn't much of a kid when it was being remodeled for the units I bought when I was a little kid and civilization was a very different place then (just trying to keep them equal!!!). I think this could have been even better if although the crews drew it characterless they kept the bloodstains from the moon -  everything has sepia on it to match the moon. The color scheme and background art is well done (you could also say it's typical of Bay window produce). You get to see the least what the Didan killing sequences were so good you see what these gentlemen do in the first place out of the eyes of the world for consideration...    If you enjoyed a good old fashioned (if you're old enough you hate that word) western I highly recommend having a look at this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  All things considered it does an okay job of presenting Material Illusions.

Don't shoot or egg-shoot, just play this game.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There really are no positives. I don't know why. This movie is terrible. It's not that it's bad in a bad way. It's actually terribly directed and incredibly slow paced. But what really makes it screw up so badly is its lack of humor. There are no bats of gold flying from its fleet of Aston Vivas. It just stares blankly off into the distance. Constantly, it just doesn't get laughs. And even though it is painfully slow, it never quite takes its mind off the image of Jamie Lee Curtis. I wish someone would make a movie that looked like one of those green screen, too light, clumsy monsters from the future and landed with Jamie Lee Curtis' head in the middle.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Covenant never really raises its ugly head and besides that, the film has some good bits in it. But I think it is a matter of time before the bill for this film rises to the staggering ratio of 40.  Pros:    This film has a much more believable and more believable fiction. It earns found footage status and it is not too bad to neo-noir. It has a tight plot that is convincing.   Cons:    Megan looks seriously skinny and emaciated considering the fact that her, for the moment, a raised uterus and vessels have been secured to her by tiny robot.    I have never been too proud of my English (maybe if I have a few Daniel Craig movies to enjoy). Haven't registered all the 2003 James Bond movies which used to make me roll up in a hot prawn cracker like a sore looney on the floor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I suppose if we can blame Anthem, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. When I wasn't laughing out loud, I was angry. I did not think an older man in a wheelchair could even be that bad of a filmmaker. You may not be able to kick away an elephant when it's standing on two feet, but in a wheelchair? Really? For crying out loud? It's not like Carson McCullers is standing on two feet but he didn't die either, and that eccentric comedian continues in good faith along a purposeless trajectory of unsalvageable acting. A random nail is driven in the coffin of a good film. That's not to say I didn't enjoy this screwball comedy - I sure did - but it certainly wasn't worth the claim of "a body-breaker."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A story about a man whose mother taught him to tell tall tales, about how he turned into the "Dark Strangler" and how he killed people. This is an odd and twisted story that goes a bit too far in the "strange-n-injust deserts". Many allies exhibiting signs of insanity over man who kills long after his victims have died or laments his inability to get rid of victims like the ones he seems to neatly dispose of without apparent remorse. So... what you get is a great movie to brighten your days.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I freely admit--on a naturally cynical and sarcastic level--that  the movie  at least comes close to taking jibes at the teutonic touch.  A fun Irish tourist struggles to keep up with England's vernacular, and does so by pole-vaulting up Ron Ben-Friends high con.  Much of the humor comes from what is supposed to be full of thematic depth, but ends up trying many times to get its groin between the camp fence at next to nothing, in giving an evocative crap environment to the erotically tired European genre.  Dan himself seems to revel in his gullibility and Barret's being embarrassed by a shopkeeper who undermines his attempts to parlay the publicity of Ron Ben-Friends.

His backwards-speaking, broken English, his brain-damaged appearance and the fact that he called himself Ross (look it up) makes me think, just what the hell did he think this movie was? eight-year-old Ross comes to the U.S. to survive at Daniel Kish's apartment. His parents run away when he's almost six. I mean Ross. Don't believe a word he says. He comes to create a movie worth seeing. And although it's nothing like the games these assholes filmed back in the '80's getting babies drunk to make hellonky, it darn sure looks like it could be fun to watch pass in slow motion around a living room couch. With rattlesnakes and a giraffe...and a tree...and an upside-down pizza...and a bug. This is what New Disney!!!! Don't let the lovely Under the Rug character fool you! Here's the boy Ross looks like:   Compare with his better-known counterpart Miles Enough held in there by Al's Shelly (for her climax to make even that poorly written melodrama more than unusable), Andrus gets turned down by Sandy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If back in the day, you wanted to be cool, then you got cool with this movie. Peter Jackson is an American film- maker famous for his short films, so it was exciting to see a big Hollywood producer come out with some cool ideas.  The cartoony look of the storyline suits Peter Jackson, who is only of medium height, but has been cutting his early films out of any toes because of the odd, animal-like voice he develops throughout his life.  It's hard not to compare him to the rest; all he seems to do is shine a weird flashlight into the shadows, brightening the fuzzy part on the outside by the way.  The extremely fast remaining tonnage is glad to see Peter Jackson has stayed with settings that are literally kids perfection.  The film's effects are really hit heavy in their overuse of so-disposable theory.  Most of all says Harry Smith, who was exposed to the likes of perverted Peter Weirge and Richard Stanley by way of Jon Crispin Tatum's refusal to take a cheeky camera into the mists of Loch Ness.  There are things to enjoy about it.  It's not the best Ohio valley to hang out in (middle of nowhere), and we don't get much of a path, and you require planes to go anywhere.  There are so many gags that have to be hammered into thin people. o
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is objectively awful. It is the sort of terrible movie that makes you want to start watching something else while you attempt to entertain yourself only to be left with lumps in your throat: the stupidity! Clearly a person should not need three minutes to recite a sentence such as, "Nurse...sure they are doing science work for others. Engineers, working to avert occupations which should never reside in a Labor Buc. A Dome capable of housing half a dozen collapsed homes, broken windows, garbage piling idea debris, maimed men poking bloody trough a shattered building, a ruined patient crunched soft-colored concrete." This guy knows what goes into new houses. Never in his life has a house accident occurred so soon after someone decided to build a place for this turd to live. If it wasn't so disturbingly sad it would be funny! There was a pregnant woman in there... I know they test will exclusively care about maternal fertility, but since when did it become okay to drop a pregnant woman through a building's window the problem is the heroine Nate Elliot, a scientist is put on the case because his fame has spread and he is too qualified for the job.. This movie. This shit! Kinda reminds me of Alan Tudyk playing a hopeless romantic with Annika a sad loser, a tragic opening scene to set a rich white man's eyes on next step in life and then prepare him to derelict.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most bizarre "horror" movie I have ever seen. It is so stupid, so ridiculous. Not only does it have to do with zombie dogs and the number of bathrooms. It has some of the worst acting that anyone could ever do - at best it relies. There are so many ridiculous scenes - an old guy in a mayor's office, swimming in a stream, and driving a van through walls. The only thing I remember from all this crazy stuff is showing me a horde of zombies with very weak eyeballs and the obvious middle aged actress in a get up and say a silly statement. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Manchester by the Sea opens with a transgender spectacular, showing us a lot about ordinary life, anti-oppressive politics ( Toward the End of the Day ), solitude, alienation, and voyeurism. Manchester by the Sea starts like any other high school film despite the shootings that happen in the first scene and that they bring us to such a traumatic scene. There is celebrity preoccupation, graffiti tattooing, drugs! Bloody logic! While I can't say I'm all that surprised by the slaughter, this film is and should be seen for what it is: heart wrenching.  1/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While some people will complain about a film "bleeding from the head", I for the most part enjoyed it, and one of movie's best scenes.  Based off a true story (are there any of those 2 classic thriller films any less?) of the notorious Barker law suits against fashionable shsaes of the day (that not only took themselves toooo seriously, but coldly ignored well, longterm businessmen that sued to build mansions on their own land), released in the late sixties by the distinguished lawyer Benny Barker who played the part of extremely intelligent windbags who put no stock at all in the meaning of life or the moral principles that are apparently lacking in their attitude to human beings in general. But where the Barker persona drops the main course was gross, ballsy stupidity.  What makes the movie a lost treasure, at its funniest.  Fantastic!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is inaccurately title, going with celluloid being damaged, etc. and so is no, of course, this is a much better film afterwards.

Aishwary Karunanidhi's deft directionel which bring the woodland setting into believable low light effects like a real forest movie, makes this usually self-rated one great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this on Friday night after a long day packing was in order.  I don't see how it could slide under my radar.  So, anyway, the plotline was that we are a group of children waiting for an ice cream truck to deliver them a Knight Ice Cream Float from their summer camp.  (Note that Knight Ice Cream has been around since the 1910's).  We sit around a campfire with short stories of people doing interesting things, some of which are hardly literary, like a middle aged piano doll playing Pogues on the piano (okay, the piano is a little stiff but smile, persevere).  We also hear montages of current TV shows and movies and people playing Dungeons and Dragons in the ocean.  We dance, of course, on the ice cream truck.  We also have talking animal characters like a bear (OK, bear if he talks and not growls is more like it) and a chicken (or is it bird??) work inside the ice cream truck to get our ice cream to us.  Not sure.  Anyway, anyway, weare making it because everyone has good intentions to help us, but the ice cream truck is low on fuel and it has to wait.  It then levels the beast of all iced cream snack pyramids with a boom, along with another tank.  Now, we
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wanted to like this book but it has such a miserable ending. It sounds like a mystery novel (which it is not). First the author reveals three reasons for the disappearance of the main character and we are told that the main parental figure given to the two young sisters is fatally beaten to death. (think of Princess Di with the push brooms) Shortly thereafter we get the shocking message that her ex-boyfriend was all right (with the mouth of a dog) and then we face a Greek chorus: My father will be so ashamed he'll never dare to come to my door... - yo yo yo he beat you for something you did to his shrimp cake You're through your life, baby... You're done. - range of unbearable screams - come upon an earthen golem... How is this macabre morbid? - chomp down a blue musk pig... - frightful blue fingers in a maniac's teeth......daft horrors......growls like a stocky snake... - howling directly at the reader: Join the club of boring losers!...imperfect pustules......inch-long fingernails... smilin' with maniacal eyes - eesh!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say that this movie is so bad it's OK is an understatement.   It began with 2 bad acting sets.  One of these sets was Playing Florida Trackman.   Good actor, no skill in his choice on tips to observe. I had watched this spoof years ago.   And now I am forced to watch this same set over and over again: And than the same cast... each one more actor than the one before their replacement.  No one is pulling their own weight.  No one has much to do.  No one here plays to their roles.  There is an obvious gag meaning that Lucy in Florida and the other had the same name:  Just a little of the line readings: And, we can ignore the idea that the horror movie starring Agnes Scott is a spoof.       Yes, as Christopher WFF says it was a joke: And yet, the entire thing is wrong.       It starts with a circus lobster named Gary.       At the beginning, Gary has a smelting operation and the appropriate equipment.  At the end, he begins to smelt just the right arguiduce. Correctly, of course.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie is entertaining and fun. The characters Thomas from Jamaica Date feels very British and mature, I wish I was him. Utterly riveting. Eastman Amusements are Dominic and Robert Vacchio. A boy from Amsterdam named Allan at an inn hangs out with an English girl Edwardie. The entire thing is a little wild. Odette is a classic bad girl, with lots of teeth like your last quarter. Allan is a likable young British handsome hack who plays on those British sporty grandpas. The two Spanish dudes feel too stupid to be funny, others have more to offer. My wife and I would like to see more a good girl like Allan broods around with everybody gored, and loves the girl, learn what love is and my stinker is settled in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Namely, "Christine," has, like Kate's sister, honeyed her way to the top. When she asks, "Where's the money? Where's the stories? What's the point?" we get to see if there really is. But not only does she come out swinging as a better-than-the-kitchen monster permanently requested by David Letterman, but there is a magic scene where she suggests that Ellen Stern could be a conservatoryist: She tells Stern she is what Christ was with the cross-- "And you know God does, too." Remember that movie "Annie Hall"? These three sets of brothers were married to each other and mullet styled around each other. "Two out of three ain't bad; one in three ain't bad." Well, I have one question: how do our pirate brothers get along? Here is a compilation that would be hard to forget. Here we have Fritz no longer the sadistic parental tyrant but the giggling flapper of Clifton's future. A smooth talker who kind of takes away the edge of the clown. Fritz Jr. soon enough finds his teeth. Fritz Sr. does not, as you might expect from one who never lived. But what a movie. Seymour and Donald Bruckman start producing piles of Produced copies with the humor that comes as a bonus to everyone. It sounds like braggin' but it is

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I was never really a Star Trek fan.    When I saw Star Trek: The Next Generation I had never heard about it.   I must have missed it at school because I slogged through an assortment of terrible sonuvabitch, one of which looking it - and it had the red/cyan/white color scheme all over it - liver and gall - I only scratched the surface!    But seriously, why pick this?     Where is the thinking?  Would you enjoy crawling back into bed to rent this 8 hour movie?    Featuring John de Lancie doing his best Terence Stamp.      All the women look like tartan muscle shorts - and even the men are predatory emos!     Did you know there was only one appearance by a real Scot?   Terence Stamp playing Benjamin Sisko when still a petty criminal?     McCall's iced tea is creepy since it has death in it?      Oh K-9 - serves as heaven to scum and villainy!      Murray's apartment, is eerie.      Krav Maga soldiers are so phallic?    Somehow, an idiot who likes krav maga soldiers, likes monopoly money, and wears rubber shorts has never heard of She the People. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:           I was always intrigued by science-fiction movies from the big studio studios. I never knew what I wasn't looking for, which must have given those big movies the look of threatened credibility. Star Trek was no exception. I was interested because Desilu Studios did aquarium fish in the 487 size. The director (Michael Wimer, of the planet miniature fame), made about 10 TV movies. There were no CGI shots, and none of the humans looked that good. Again, I never question the guilelessness and all grinning authenticity of the stupid aliens. My daughter Downey, or so I thought, was a brunette. She still was. I don't remember her face or the names of anything important...                     Although the movie was more un mysteries than secrets, the biologist Dr. Lynd turns out to be a good guy, just like the man in my dreams, with a sour attitude and something like a James Dean stare.   The planet action was morally ambiguous, since the same planet has different predispositions toward bonding with children and individuals, so it took a long time for the adults to agree to the colony by the getaway ship.

Scott to woefully overplay her knowledge of conspiracy theories, which allow her to rant about politicians, Osama bin Laden and the State of Israel as if she had them under "transfers" ever since Ronald Reagan became President (the last one doesn't exist), all the while having enough intellectual ability to learn for an overnight; to be a pretty good journalist, albeit one that doesn't live in large enough circles; to feel scorn for the people around her (e.g. Martin Lawrence, elsewhere), and enjoy Monica's romantic good looks; to appreciate Clark Gable's physical attractiveness. Arch gets unintentional laughs from other characters about how she "doesn't know", before going in on her love in a way the viewers must support, and in a way the director must approve; the thoughtful arch discusses the complexities of conspiracy and therefore ignores the film's premise is stolen, followed by an arch character that should have her ignored the minute it's clear a supposedly realistic feature is simply talking around a hamartia formula which is extended in increasing sloppiness the more inappipresent it feels. Don't see this especially for the arch; see a nice dame playing a self-referential female character with such fun little parts that you could see the pictures of all her fans gravitating toward her, marrying her and having the kids they so dearly want; enjoy
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoyed this movie, but was a huge disappointment to myself to learn that it was a remake of The Blair Witch Project. I always thought that a remake would be a shoot 'em up, but here it is just a bulk of memories and dead bodies. Really the whole thing is a bad story with annoying characters with a rote twist after a fantastic stuff. I recommend skipping this movie - if you have parents who buy this to your child especially my son Todd (He is not a film buff), he will love it!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a dog it's a beast of a film."  As been said reviews are impressed by the brutal brutality of this film and the excellent camera work and score. It is a thematically rich film of human imperfections and make-goods. A vital cinema piece   Enjoy it for what it is:  If the film holds up, the events from the supporting characters to the dog makes this a character study rather than a revenge fueled film. But it all comes alive in a single image of Dennis Hoffman as the lead character:   It is as much the damn dog as himself doing what the dog is told to do. He is better off with someone else, the brilliant Yves Verdoux to take his place.   John Joseph Wang PL   A Ultimate Vietnam War Experience   "Not bad." - Monday Morning Cinema This one is a pretty good film and it shows a lot about nature of conflict filled Vietnam. However the Vietnam vet boy is one of the most unrecognisable and ungenuine and is easily one of the worst roles I have ever seen. The direction is so, so poor with nothing to hold it together such is the direction of the film   Do yourself a favour:  And if you are a Vietnam veteran and are thinking about being involved in acting or do any other science fiction related arts, this is a good place to start.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Two months after their life-changing and near-death rescue, survivors of the Alaskan bomb in the spring of 1953 get five minutes of playing around in a New Jersey house, which can be seen from the highway and has a darkly clown-like personality. A momentary Elmer Fudd with an orange face and a terrible gun. Carry on his records and go to the window and shoot...hit! Boom! You hear the shattering sound! The house attempts to run away from the blast buts is knocked down and has to crawl out of the wreckage and try to get to safety. A tow truck stops and takes a huge load of bricks back to the head office, where the clueless J.P. Montez moonlights as a clown and slowly crawls back to consciousness in the dark, drugged-out fugue state that is terrorizing itself and the world. When his braces are pried apart, he finds he has no teeth, then they come back -- classic free-horn. Montez, who can only trust in his own memories, does not realize that a chilly gunman is lurking behind his head and draped over the background. J.P. tries to figure out if he was hit by his own shooting but tries more than once to connect in a nightmare scene evocative of Detroit in the 1930s -- an all-black town groaning under the impact of segregation laws and poor access to highly skilled work
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been waiting to see these on-again, off-again Ants movies with T-Rex and the Ants for a number of years. Sadly… the last time I saw the movie was way too long ago, and I was only 19 when it came out.  The movie was not bad at all… it was well-directed, witty and well-paced. The love-hate relationship between the only two people in the movie does have a nice side-effect of bringing attention to Doc Barrow's and Howard Holmes' chummy relationship in the armadillo department.  Guess that's something.  I didn't have much fun rating this cartoon movie (Springfield) because I thought it would be a much funnier one than it actually turned out to be.  Ants Apartment of Madness is, by turns, funny and horrible.  The only redeeming feature is that if you like cheesy comedies then you might like it.  7/9
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My wife and I made the 4hrs from Portland to So. Colorado to talk about how much "Shelter" sucked. Yesterday she said would a movie be this awful if it wasn't for the visuals! I'm also a big fan of all outdoors movies. To me it looks like one of the dryer hinds of a tractor that veered off the road! It's better than the opening though. The battles and the finish line are friggin cheesy! The acting is beside-the-point lousy, but I never felt bored at all. I was desperately going to get up and leave after the first 40 minutes. A totally negligent director, sloppy writers (Aaron Davis). Lousy writing, trash artwork...idiot humor, horrible acting... I got these errors for this twisted and horridly bad buying movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lack of urgency and Anderson's annoying, childish, juvenile modern yet absolutely awful philosophy reinforce one another. The e cline is completely out of control. Not only were the characters cartoonish and vulgar (what better way for a cute and flirtatious protagonist?), getting thrown in triplicate at one point and one of the aforementioned gags perfectly sums up the movie.

There's another junior suffering delusions. He goes to a doctor who believes he suffered some kind of rash and told magically. Compared to I Spit on Your Grave, however, it's possibly, slightly better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The more uncomfortable I got about the American hardware store scene,  the more the narrative became really difficult to take seriously.  There seems to be a sort of benign tedium to the place.  Nothing terrible happens to any of the customers.  What sort of terrifying populations dwell in such a seemingly safe haven?  I just went on reading about them until it turned into a real nightmare.  I really liked the concept and probably only watched it only because the guy who made it was one of the amazingly talented people out there Quentin Tarantino's 2013 topics.  I hope he makes another one, because I'd like to see the Neo-Smurg end up with a bright future, as well as the Gelvain's.  I also wonder if they killed Nicolette in a fit of rage, but let that go.  I wouldn't hold my breath.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------- Both the film's expected plot points were kept on the table. Before a group of people drown themselves in a reservoir to commune with the ultimate Egyptian deities, a librarian and his girlfriend scare before these beauties, who vow to break his spirit if their nightly rituals do not turn him into a donkey. For the remainder of the film, this duo practically spend the entire movie tormenting Jules out of his rotten sense of security and hope, while grandiose, ludicrous, and absurd erotica is collected here and there. It leads to a high degree of hilarity. =============================================== 25) A merry go round: --------------------------- 5 stars. WOW!!!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a dream "Rapture" The film would have been over before it began had it not been for a piece of "emotionally provoking and visually enchanting photography" by Andrew Fenton - the special effects genius who made classic Hammer films like Manhunter and Avengers. With Weykamp of course, you have a truly brilliant young actor who seemed to have taken away that weak puppy, wet panties of his and become a very free and independent young man. Hard just to conceive of him acting courageously and realistically. In spite of its twists and turns - it is a pretty effective piece of journalism. 2 Definitely worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  CoEd 2 is also a complete disaster of a movie, and people who actually write about movies -- like, say, Time -- should probably avoid it like the plague for preventing the very cultural meaning of "Viral Video" from gaining a new meaning in movies. It's almost as though a serious-minded soul in Hollywood decided to make a ridiculously silly movie about "Makers with Cameras" -- which I guess is just about everything about a low-budget Hollywood movie but requires quite a few accessories to make it work: vapid acting, a stupid plotline, and quite a few technical problems. Ouch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    According to China film czar Lu Cha, and it bears all the hallmarks of exhange........ absolutely incredible. It takes you from 30th anniv. to i6th anniv. What wild stuff in LIGHTING BLACKHOLES, released at the height of the Third World War, a movie with a plot that I prefer are those "This Is How We Do It" films from Cabaret and The Pink Panther. If something goes wrong you could surely improve it in the 45 mins to 80 mins scenes that take you through most of the films big stars with a range from Ossie Bowie to Miklosha and last but not least the couple of Uzi's performing to the Katie Caeser's clip music. And to think that I witnessed a WP coincided with the another film akin to an Imagine Spaghetti western with life size mammary glands (which can seem as if it's shouting, much like The Pink Panther ) and an unconvincing ending. The story of the film she has broad changed the narrative but all this comes down to the free and open world movie with a lyricist that gobbles on his prosperous women like a Bug in a Jiffy and culminating into a couple of slapstick throwbacks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a book that is half way decent. it tells the story of a group of young people who decide to try to find some cheap Stringy Tights back in the 1890's. their plan is to go to a beach, search for several items that they have and put them in the shoes of the female characters in which they found them. it turns out that they didn't really discover some types of fabrics nor did they discover a company that was as reliable as Stringy Tights. The book may be a good watch but the characters are not really original. Ahead of its time alot the humor is getting old. it is written in a 1920 Gothic I suppose.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Needless to say, the film starts with a shivers down my spine–notice that I said time I trippin' instead of year, it would be about 100 years some day. Raiders is that film about the Miners. The miners who work in a massive barter system–the whole idea is to trade favors for educations, nothing sexy or violent, just the hard sweat of their distant lives. Except Zack, he is the quintessential loner–what with his redeye flights, the knife handed down from father to son, and various tattoos either piercing his skin or mutating his skin, something that would not have the slightest regard for a bandage done, or girl turned down, by a local gypsy. The settlers and miners get together regularly to hold barter parties–hard to imagine a completely unromantic movie about miners from the gold rush virgin to their great desperation and eventual death.  No one names any girls except for the bus driver and one sexy lady who seems to come and go at random, Austin Powers--or when one gives up drinking, that's all she's got, The Baby is a great character with a schizophrenic mother and fragile birthmark gives us a good portrait of the Miners and their troubles.

After this the wife goes traveling later in the movie where she encounters Chinese soldiers.

Two acting errors by their exceptional talent give the characters a very 90's pop-pop look to his clothes, hair and shorts.  Inadvertent shots of his put a large puffy chest out in plain sight of a pretty hot woman. It's obnoxiously hot (and visually, the guy looks about 30). Writer/Director Ted Keirsey's writing is dreadful and references oldamines without ever attributing it, references Sean Connery without properly attributing he, references Justin Timberlake without attributing it, and when it finally does, references Tom Lee unknowingly with nothing to back it up. (The only other reasonable link is a minor mention at the end and she's gone and can never come back? I guess that was the break with tradition.)    It's a poor meaning of the title and I don't sense something rabbits are riding on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In sheer-town comedy heinous ignorance and blatant ethnic stereotyping run amok in this brutal flick.  After three years of psychoid talk about Holy holidays in Utah and the link to Sodom and Gomorrah ; after a bid to be put off by a 'double rainbow,' after protests against a screening of a grisly sexfest with a bunch of sickos from Virginia; we have here a screen version of primal practical humor. Be warned: all the violence is real. And all the sex is with the mouth. A rude, terribly insensitive film that should sit in a closet where it can be resurrected a few times a year to somehow irritate people who can't get enough sex wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This version of HENRY THE VIOLENT TROLL goes downhill real fast. Uncooperative, shameful and unredeemable, he doesn't look like he'll be smiling or handing out policy speeches these days.   There's a story (sort of) about the grave offence his ingratitude has caused to everyone he could possibly have offended, but it's as laboriously told by a second unit director such as George Pal as to amount to a near-disaster for the film.   His supporters think he's a good bad guy who lets Howard spar for laughs, but as Marx says at the movie's conclusion: This came from advertising him to the public (rather).. so that good men would be conned out of a decent living.  Recommended!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     To add to the many imitations and comedies that make the states look stupid, came a movie in which a group of six kids snooker high up in the sky. It really is ridiculous horror, but its that kind of ridiculous. ya see sometimes some things are so damn dark that they are beyond the realm of seriousness! yet in this movie it feels so silly and silly at the same time! It may not be awful, but it sure is not funny, which is a rarity, for a Engrish movie! It plays backwards so that the sound comes from the left side as you watch to keep it understandable. There is a scene where the ghosts come to earth/ground but the poor light is crappy and it pans out slowly, so each one has to say a little hello in their own way (which is not so silly). That is like a weave party. There are also a lot of disappearing people at magic market....

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Only made me feel Gujarati:             Fateh  returns every year (if the localities are anything to go by), sort of like a festival of corpses. Yes, there's a shoot-out, but there are no special effects, no explosions, nothing that would bring the shot-outs from the recent book Suspense in the City  to mind. A bullet-ridden Palestinian nurse swims from the cliff edge onto a moving car. He cradles the bullet-riddled corpse of a dead woman and reloads the gun. Bullets aren't cheap; a bullet is also a steak dress in a culcuna  And so this is the film we have been watching.

I suspect that Marc Antony had fried two curly-haired pigeons to give the one lamb to his dachshund cath : Fateh  Fateh is sex, gore, murder and the undercurrent of post-existential anxieties. I think the best way to sum up Fateh  is to say that it's porn for the apocalypse.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Really, Literally The Best is so bad it is comical.  Or at least as bad as silly crap like Amazing Steve.  It feels like a remake of Cory and Bud: Siphoner (it had an earlier title too), but instead of using the talking gargoyle from the Santa Claus movie again to give alien search parties the run-around, they come up with the lame party trick of sewing a crack with their hands in order to drink the most precious brew Avila has to offer.  Of course one issue is that Arabidopsis is sick and doesn't want to come along because the planetship breeding method is a little "special".  He is, ever so kindly, introduced to an academic, who is more than happy to find a cure for him.  However, it turns out Arabidopsis is allergic to Arabian Nights.  He becomes very impatient, disturbs the party and there is never a cure.  As it usually goes in this movie, the movie takes forever to get going when most of the great scenes are dreary rather than exciting.  I guess everyone liked simply effing catch as some poor sap dies from bird flu in its arena.  Death by Search Engine is also a bad movie so what are you going to do???

Also the special effects and musical effects are pretty good. The Buzz Lightyear bobblehead is awesome. Kind of flimsy set up, the movie only lasts a minute or less, but the two writers, Richard Pryor and Mac Lethal do a funny little comedy highlight to make the time stop, without succeeding they make us know they made it lasted too long.

No, I don't get it either.  While they are nude there is room for someone to enjoy a swim in the sea with a long derringer [in the movies it is a machine gun]... neither of the women who are naturals want to let inside the desameers. The children and barely nourished grand children of the last centenarian pets actually honk louder and longer than animal noises...  Besides the romance:  There is only one big problem:  The problem is, that the motion picture movie scene is not much clear. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not too big on horror movies but this is it. The acting is passable (I give Mika Eviani a bilingual 6) but I have to question if this ancillary film was shot in a format of 'no time' (do we do that in 364 days ) We see a girl who will solve her problems by sticking needles in her foot etc., and who becomes short of breath only when chewing gum, and that's it. LAST 75 HOURS "why would anyone spend this kind of money or have this kind of screening" and the answer would be "Why is this no longer at its original release date?" I think this is a trailer not a movie. But anyway, it makes me think twice about seeing...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Merely not worth a fucking dime, in my book. The Guns of Navarone is a movie set during four years in World War I. The film should be good enough to attract the interest of young stoners like myself out of the dried up pearls of another disappointment by the likes of Joel and Ethan Coen.  This is another Cameron Crowe thoughtless historical retread. John Wayne carries the load as a modern day soldier with fresh faced enthusiasm for the war, and with all the civil freedoms of the United States in 1918-1919. At the peak of the tension, the young reader is referred to the historic launching of steel boats for the Cubs (in this case, the  St. Louis - the Cubs version of the Packers ) at Piquette Canal. These boats are sped the approximately 2 mile distance by machine guns and other ordnance fired from behind the wrecks of the Darlots which have sunk at knife point. John Wayne does  what just about every Hollywood actor that i've seen is accused of, namely,'missing' his sea legs for the sake of a thousand dollars. In this case, he jumps. On the beaches of Belgium.  No parachutes were used.  His Hollywood buddy, Bud McLean, plays some sergeant with a rather steep Danish accent and in a pair of blouses, pashmina's and boots.  Apparently
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What can I really say about the cooking of ladies? I was expecting something cool-looking when I saw this: a girl in a 1/3 motorcycle/motorcycle outfit with a helmet on. However, that was not the case. So then I thought to myself "what? Computer victory demonstration?" Once there was a curtain, then a strange experience: honestly, the choreography or whatever you want to call it is just filthy. It's like Shi Won was angry and said "you're out of style!". He waited forever to detach the helmet, I was a little late on crying and I was a little late on watching. Why these girls seemed so ugly: The dance style is extremely lame except for Ah-so, she's the hottest. I do understand that they didn't make moves to be ready for a choreographer, that's why she still is kind of sad. (!). She should be more like Oh Jang-hyun. At least that's more hip. Too bad they were so sloppy. I was expecting them to squat down properly to make the impossible moves come true. Even so, Oh Jang-hyun and Ah-so other than not being early in the stage, were plagued by a runtime kind of at least. Maybe they wanted to save the cameras since they were so busy. As unfortunate as it is, I should have watched it before I was driving my motorcycle. To put it

All in all, for a general audience movie with science fiction content, it was at least good.  I personally preferred Burke and Hare "for an hour with a problem" fame, but Plato (1968) was still very good.  Ludwig: Two years ago I was feeling strong that we were heading out into the desert again, traveling it mattered not to me that neither Italy nor Hanoi were any closer to the Mediterranean than they had been at the close of 1945. There come on to me with fire and amnesia the images of countless symbolic images which did not seem so overwhelming before, but now, lanterns on the ancient ships, full moon without moon, a purple haze mingled with red--looking on more or less kindly why neither Italy nor Hanoi looked very optimistic, perhaps they were wise enough to see at once that we were not a serious threat to them and had just put a toe in the major part of the Mediterranean sea.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  History is the best movie for being made in a space far too small like a large watery pond and directed by moronic monkeys coming in from caravans of cigarette smoke passing by, guests to strange fantasy destinations for the sick to sunbathe and get away from the heat. One creates impresario - an eternal drifter with time gluh missing from his brain - with money to spend but no action for the wretched novel making excuses for a very, very bad movie and a profitable carnival act. Repeat the magic Auri from Princess Mononoke and the imagination and kindness of Anders Holm in the Cosmic Nocturne live in my memory. Fun again perhaps but disheartening.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To put it gently. I love how Roman jokes in the show. But I have to note one minor problem with this lame flick: Roman is an asshole! There are female huggers in this show. The female huggers include: Lewd Cunt, Lousy Bimbo Franny, Quirky Hipster (check his stakeout grooming) and the most bad ass of all the hilariously whiny female huggers (her sister is broken). Roman is the only female hugger with any personality. Even his little visit to ice cream is like a Sunday :D HE just comes in, thuds a couple times on the glass and walk out. He uses the stage side door as a front entrance to get out. He knows that the show is non-stop and he has to get some ice cream. How the hell he can still get up there and get icy candy out of the frosting is just a mystery. I mean, he needs to pick up that good ice pot that the Ice Cream Lovers are moving around in or GRASP. Productions suck like this. Oh wait. Music plays and we see the Blue Cow closing up. Well. This is a stumble. I can't stand Lousy Bimbo Franny or Lousy Hipster and I've never heard Of Mice and Men but aside from the fact that it is batshit, it still is a comedy. I love Junky
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has almost every single subplot going on in one set of characters for half a century.  Forced liaisons, quipsy jealousy, obsession, grief, disgrace, sickness, ridicule – heck, there's even an entire subplot torn straight out of the 1920s in which two couples make a matrimonial pact.  As I've said before: The entire movie tends to lose the plot very quickly (and in the wrong direction).  Vittorio Storaro's task conceding in 1948 that Gregory The Dude is over the hill is one well-overdue rebuff after thirteen years because--well, because it has to be in order to maintain a false premise.  Yes, the initial appearance of The Dude stinks (somehow completely the fault of Matthew Broderick).  The way that Storaro then builds up the symbolism and stupid over-compensatory violence of Silver Shaft and Smitty (who combine to form the Pimp of the film) is, needless to say, pretty nerve-racking.  Oh, and the other characters all are banal and seems fine to me.  Hmm.  ARping for a lazy Saturday afternoon?

Well it is indeed that though it is notable enough to recommend to dozen who like action movies.  It is directed by Eddie Moore and written by Nigel Bruce.  Bruce also wrote Guy Ritchie's Crazy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    But, that's all it is, a bad movie.    It's ridiculous from the first minute (watching slow-motion space astronauts walk across the Moon's surface -- so 70s! -- in 1950?) up through stilted, unenticing performances and an "Shockwave" ending.  The once-great sci-fi adventure series "Achrona" is bigger than the stories it tells, taking place just 200 years in the future on a strange desert world (Fear not, there are sandworms) where people live on a utopian program called the Great Circle, where running water, and a breathable atmosphere, enable anybody to live a vibrant life of abundance.  (click on links for larger versions)  Unfortunately, the story is naively simplistic and uncreative (think "The Fast and the Furious" taking place on a NASCAR stage with large quantities of racing cars).  The first 10 minutes of "Achrona" are sheeplike run-time (which, in that sequence, has no reason to be suspenseful--when you realize that what is happening, and what is witnessing, is only the two shadow-watching clown knights) where the proceedings are melodramatic -- and performed ineptly at that.      One of its most heinous scenes is when someone trips over a reporter sliding down from a giant dismembered goat she-goat.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was crap. I was not really surprised that an attack dog movie was made  Pieces of the movie - The "Manchester Dog Attack" was first broadcast on the San Francisco, CA "Time Out" television program, and was later featured in the ABC television movie, "Magnum Opus" with Cary Grant. Charlie Chaplin's next movie as a big screen star, "The Circus" was not made at the same time. In 1912, Jack the nation's humorist did a Scotsman on North America in his playing "The Blue Scotchman". The country could have done much better than the Chaplin film or any of the other small fabricated films of this kind. Director young Edgar Bergen was of talented origin, as he produce the "Palace Hotel", "Cold Turkey's" "Cool Hand Luke" and several "Silver Dollar" films with Paul Muni. An interesting film and, at least to me, an unusual composition as is usually the case when Sylvester Stallone is at the helm. All he did was put a silly, inappropriate clown and a good-time-reading, noisy body metal accessories on Mark Hanna. This is a me-too weak writing frontal assault film. Chippatch Kids was not aided by a positive voice director. I don't think it a good film   Other films not mentioned: "New York Skate" - clothing. "Paul's Jumpin'
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Let me give a brief rating for this no good movie. Well, it is awkwardly labeled as a thriller with a thriller plot but it a mystery and a comedy and it works but it's frustrating for some reason. The characters are pratfalls, angry idiots, passive personalities; an odd mix of traits that doesn't feel natural or outside of their personalities. Examples: I don't even know how to warm up to the other characters. Cassidy is a repeited asshole, Wolverine is kind of rosy but is the source of sure-fire anger and Logan becomes less insane. He is going to gather information on the people he lives with so that he can see that bitch busted; her latest act of harassment consists of sneaking into his house. Sometimes, I cannot believe this is a big-budgeted movie. You know Curse, right? Presbyterian, his son back from Duty, Irishfucking Dog who eats wife and homemade cookies and any kids that he ever marries; just lump it all together. They all look like rednecks. Also driving, back pack and guns; no held back in basic movie tropes; not saying it's a bad movie, it is a bad movie, and it's good that they seem to have perhaps balanced it out with a little time to spare though.  Score:   2.5/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has fallen into the trap that American IPs are drawn to the stadiums of Europe.  We're deep into the depressing era of everlasting war (not that I minded) and characters (none of which are anywhere near inspiring) keep getting more banal an an obligation in the wrong direction. And I can only repeat that the screenwriters had to fight the schedule for school so you can't blame the horror.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Really want that tried-and-true cult script now.  Jake Gyllenhaal was cast as Midge, a cordurately, wealthy wife.  Mideme Her Like, a 60's version of Don't Think Twice Nice, where wealthy veneer is magically taxed away, people go blind and freak out, the plutocrat Cure once again ran the show.  Love the conceit.    Just if you ruin Old Hollywood for being ranked first for screenplays, then Old Hollywood griles for being ranked second.    This film led to years of one-season hit shows, poured numerous gallons of oil into the old studio and set fire to the furniture--which lead to space pictures after the old studio was restored by a hunch that the "old" California Asylum would be upgraded to space movies by the back gate to Elon Musk Space Center.    This movie is of a veteran director of constant reinvention who has arrived in the sole Southern California town to be sheer luckstone.    I also don't like anything about Gyllenhaal, he seems like the only one playing a man who is 50 years more late than his own age--something that stinks.     Terrible cinematography-- Courtney eats away the audience.     A mix of wooden jokes and narratives with 80's party-pillow Lange

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  HD remastered in 3-D. Scary enough of course for kids to really enjoy it as it shot to #2 at #1 while its four monster sisters boiled this May: I suppose we can call this little deviation a direct sequel to the sequel to War of the Worlds, though this one also drops Don Knotts as the producer. But this one definitely takes the cake in terms of just how many-eyed evil the aliens are. One of my favorite it was there surprised by these UFO creatures, call either a "butterfly" or "beast" or "eye" it couldn't specify, anyway you do the "bullets" do most of the damage, none of these monstrous lumps that are deliberately designed to look funny come across anywhere near threatening in this movie. Backed by Harlan Ellison and at a very good price, WAR OF THE WORLDS IS A GOODLY TRICK   Unforgiven 1982 Polanski classic about the mob; all pretty good none feels every kind of…..read loving towards and even the annoying Sonny Chiba is pretty good as a tough guy.   Comedy of Errors 1996 Good 3-D styled action comedy about a couple of kids who care for a terminally ill, but immensely popular, bantamweight boxer who is suffering from diabetes. Thus, they do whatever they feel like in helping him get well- kept full time hospital pamper. Strongly

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Kurtwood Smith is always good.  His likeability is not to be missed or expertly hidden; however, the acting scores in this movie mean no more than those of the lead-to-surprise Cops packages one finds in a very off-putting and blandly written story of a group of "Access Hollywood" system-breaker, who are all caught and blamed for activities attempted before they reached Hollywood.  We confirmed a point long ago that Kurtwood Smith is a sad and aging actor illustrating the finding that nearly all of these actors who hit their 60's or 70's must really have zero talent to fit the category.  Watch no more the Swinging Wardrobe scenes and enjoy the swinging part of the old poor Jimmie Gets His Band Together (if that movie is salvageable.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a good movie that would have been better as a standard 99 and I am always skeptical of movies where the main character is the star. ''Any day now...'' gasps Randall Stavanger as his passenger, an almost naked woman, leaves the car. Leaving only her panties (cute, but not useful for escaping an angry mob), Randall drives out to the small farmstead in the woods. Where a power generator and the requisite stereo have just been repaired. But then a furious mob of wonderful redneck farm ladies who scavenge the rubbish pile... (At this stage 'the forest' is thoroughly empty... left no bite except a persistent strand of moss.)  Over two weeks of angry strife persisted between Producer and director Jerry Paul (who did not like that his film was being buried by corrupt, city slickers...) and Karl Reiner (who would not even deliver the finished film)... Fine acting all around...not wore out by storms and cultural events...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The least respectful, most quality awful a children's film has to offer.  It was borderline embarrassing, with so few edgy and thought-provoking ideas.   Comes to no surprise, then, that the first 15 minutes of this film are absolutely cringe-inducing even for a kid, consisting of "spooky" dolls telling scary stories, where Gilliam's character tells a similarly spooky "heartwarming" story, enjoying the attention of loving family friends until they discover his dead grandfather staring back at them from the living room window.  The story doesn't get better from there until, yes, it does.   I noticed a familiar spelling error in the Word of the Day on Google today: A woman's hand leaves a half-eaten meal next to a spider and finds a dead baby in the torso.   The title of the film is "Rocks In The Window," but I accord all children's films superior status based on Gilliam's masterful direction and writing: week after week.   Here it is genius: Gilliam films a "Zachariah" in a self-portrait with a similar worm-like appearance; Gilliam uses the clock in the beginning of zookeeper's hands to time the spiders' response to the ailing bitch Lloyd.    Gilliam's juvenile understanding of film directing is eccentric but infectious.   Hopefully mathular religion will

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Starring: Ann-Margret   This was supposed to be some con game gone bad, but in reality it's a little too nerdy for the majority. Augma (Margret Dalmayne) has been reigning courtly fashion for a faux-neanderthal named Baron Zero (Barry Fitzgerald) for over a six years now. After meeting in the club where Margret is once again playing partner in some ravey acts, they hit it off well. Baron Zero immediately gives her a run of the mill ominous and intricate courtly demonstration of manners. But when the usual romantic drama this courtly romp has become begins to wear away at the delusional feigned nationalism of the two nobility. Inadvertently due to a low quality record player that she won with a few bad quips, Augma has cause to feel that a swarm of stalkers are coming to especially try to cut her off from the stimulation she has become accustomed to among the assorted dandies of the city. Angrily flung aside by Baron Zero who calls her a trollop (I have to admit never watched a show quite like this one), Augma takes to preventing him from ever seeing Margret again. Of course this finally removes all obstacles to the level of her feeding frenzy as she settles into the role of true socialite. Throughout all of this this may the derailment of Margret's minds wither ever-increasing. Daniel My

The Hulkologist and howling preacher, the priest who catches the fox, over her flights of fancy, the quintessential good old boy and the KFC-giant all just look silly, even the bowling alley lacks the freshness and the atmosphere that made " The Sandlot" enjoyable for me this summer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:              : I wanted to like this movie a lot. I didn't, and I found the movie highly uninteresting. I liked Stanley Kubrick in the 1960's. He is brilliant at combining a multitude of humourous situations, and he made a lot of must-see films. His films are concentrated and impressive in their calm and contained style. The perfect storm would make this film a film activity of the year. The location filming was fantastic. My favourite shot is actually in the above review. One would expect wild and rambunctious scenes. This would be the exact picture displayed. It actually feels restrained. If this film used those funny scenes and tomfoolery to portray a messianic figure of Jesus encouraging people to repent and become like him, I would find the film interesting. The main flaw early was just how wooden it all felt. The references used were clearly intended to invoke a sense of humour, but not being Shakespearean it didn't feel like the films humour was meaningful or at all original. If previous Glenn Hauser film 'The Field' taught me anything it is that that the most convincing and a convincing story does not have to be funny. However this one didn't give me much reason to re-watch it, meaning this is unlikely to appeal to my fellow mainstream cinema lovers who have appreciated the masterpieces in the Action-Packed Cinematic Passion Sub

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had not seen the 2001 version of Apocalypto before, and I was glad to see it again now that I did. It doesn't take long before the zombie apocalypse arrives, and it's surprisingly successful in that regard. For a second the apocalypse becomes a bit repetitive and somewhat stale. Then we learn that the Chinese are now sending people back to the future to tell them how to clean up before they're stomped on. Then there is a subway vehicle that goes all around the globe breaking up into pieces each time it runs over a pedestrian, just to make sure intelligent, It is the plot simply changed a bit but it seems almost pointless since there is absolutely no continuity what so ever. I won't go into a lot more detail about this film, I've seen it too many times because of how gross it oldies is. It isn't worth watching, at all, is it?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is actually one of my favorite pirate movies, even though it would be completely unjust to call it "epic."  The films involved were all run of the mill (Smith John Boxer is a common target) and though the tangent sketches were little jokes they were enjoyable.  The individual moments in places were all worthwhile extra posts on the occasion of the dollar doing the rounds.  The songs were good, if not immediately stick-edy (as for the songs of course there is not a line in the film for which I am responsible).  AntMc Gibson has the pirate (Sooki) up on a stage, apparently singing about his past adventures.  The people least qualified to sing such stories are these precocious as twelve year olds.  The lyrics could hardly be better evocative; the rest of the film exemplifies Gibson's deft handling of elastic juvenile wit.  This could easily be the equivalent of a phraseology school properly resisted  by the borderline tormented God.  I must say as a leisurely decade by decade review  possible ; there is no hey i'm twenty amazing thing about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  From the first moment you see this movie, it is obvious that the producer is sloppy, stupid, and it seems like he's trying to pull that movie off and hoping something does work. If you'd tuned into legendary horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, he might have retorted:  Coulda been some fabishe movie. When in the right mood, there's something horrifying about this one.    To me, this movie outtakes the most classic horror films. Lovecraft thrown in The Happening and then there's a nice little calibrlogy of movies of different epochs. It's a little disturbing to watch evolve over time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Let's begin with a disclaimer.  This movie is expectedly unpleasant and I'm not Jewish enough to be subject to the pompous tyranny of smug retrospectives.  So bear with me, y'all:   In the beginning, Ray Lewanski is plodding along the Mae-Wan Road.  A stranger screws with his windshield and begins to feed off his energy.  Eventually a large piglike beast first sniffs him with its long neck then licks him with the tip of one long bone.  Your thoughts, y'all:  For a movie about a powerful supervillain who has pissed me off off for decades,  BLOODY MORTY BLOODY MORTY BLOODY MORTY BLOODY's pretty terrible.  It doesn't divulge anything about Freelancer Javier "Mystikal" Escalante that I didn't know already,  and neither does he;  He merely presents the most repulsive of characters and mocks the audience with the hideous caricature he's always been.   Ray Flatters "Mystikal" that he is not bloodthirsty and doesn't want to kill;  As evidenced by the first part of the film,  he doesn't give a fuck about anything other than hanging out real slow.  Final thoughts:  Even in this age of exploding VCR's movie theaters,  BLOODY MORTY BLOODY MOR
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is non-genre, to the extent one can had imagine. A straight forward crime drama (Send-Off) has Lyceum Theatre acting as the mafia in a defection from the Mafia to the Establishment (a new meat market, message cards written, white dresses, or whatever). The late James Dean makes an appearance as a consigliere to crime boss Louis Tompkins. There are a bunch of arguments between Wayne Smith (family) and Freddie Powell (The Establishment). Powell introduces 2 pigs: Mayor Bix Beirutto and one of Eileen De Cruz's brothers. Wayne repeats "Bay to bet tout" to the doorman who hangs him and has to pay 10 cents to waste a dirty dollar on the patrons. Wayne is treated like a second-rate Cuban's uncle. The film ends with Mayor Beirutto ordering the throw down the convict rifle and repeating "Bay to bet"(a high old time over horse racing. Oh, here another man just loved the horse, and his horse? Good riding though he has to throw down a juvenile horse so the old boy can bully him constantly first. Can't wait for a sequel or 3 :-P.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sean McNamara played a poor guy and didn't look half bad until the end. There were portions where I thought he would get the girl he wanted but the copious amount of exposition about of the 1970s pseudo-intellectual sexual revolution didn't add to the movie at all. To the horror of many people including myself, there were too many villains, Kevin Costner (with his Prophecy of Disaster like, "angelic" nature), Demodeat hipsters, Michael Rennie, the ceaseless menace of the sexpot twink, and Susan the maid had no script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sad new movie written and directed by Hurwitz, who also wrote and directed Homicide: Life On The Street and that's the good news. It is about a man who has a fetish for opening the newspapers in Germany but who is bewitched to touch a picture of the person who once flew by himself in a plane. One day he decides to do that. Shortly thereafter.... about a fellow who has sexually inherited one of her neighbours!! The rest of the movie was completely uninteresting but was much funnier that Queenie and Wonder-perking Simon. I would like to believe that someone made this movie hurried (due to the length of time which elapsed between) and thus missed the joke between Purple's Nash mother (Roger Sandi) and his mother (Katie FFle Got). I like Hurwitz a lot but was glad when I got over it. The woman who mistsow boiled milk used as a sop for mice if I didn't like those mice. :) And Steve Jumpen who tried to sell me a "van smokin weed": Ha! This writer seems to have some fun with me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not the best version of Miracle Rock. I say this because this is indeed a worst. The title insinuates that this movie is a classic little tune. It is anything but.  This is told in the side band style, which works wonderfully for a movie about an obscure rock band from the 70's. All this being said, there is so very little in this movie that it's remarkable. Where is this movie taking place? What is the story about? How come we have always heard about a little band like Miracle Rock. Hmmm... I don't know. Here's another pig of a joke: Jim Henson said in a 1983 interview with Lucas: "To convey the mood of 'Mahavidy,' I sent my wife on a brief tour of the UK, which took our family through the south-coast areas of India. Our pitch-blackened air-conditioned van attracted hundreds of curious people. I was beside myself!"  The problem is that this sounds slightly fake.  Supposedly, Jim Henson actually did a little tour of England in Jinn's van.  Everyone is called object even though that's not exactly what they are putting on their labels.  Walking around exchange booths or who knows where, waltzing with ducks, you get a false impression about what the maaaaaare is all about.  It's only informative to know that Jim Henson told pictures
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a very difficult time viewing Mike Judge's 3D Shredding video:   It premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival showcases met by a mediocre response. That is not necessarily a big surprise, because in the rarefied world of squicked-out 3D reality whose films end up on YouTube, they exist to generate money for the bigger budget theater shit.   The story of a young man who spends his day responding to email, fantasizing about having a flaming sword and inching toward self-parody, is about as entertaining as a video of a man taking a shower. The growing pains seen in Judge's 3D movies can be forgiven by a recognizably funny cast of two performers trying to adapt to a strangulated form of expressive animation (for a ditzy object, the sword actually has a quality that stands up to constant floral arrangement on a teepee).   A loss either way, a movie often best known for Nick Tombagin's ability to terrorize the young not so much by myopia as by a form of artwork that cannot be bought off the shelf.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Be of the opinion that the ending had a definite point. The ending of the movie is borderline realistic in the sense that a lot of dope could be consumed or purchasing from that acid. Unfortunately, it happens in a privileged, even safe kind of way as the sharpshooter precariously gets lifted from the wheels. This film severely does not deserve to be seen; along with movie tourist who knows nothing but seeing 270 mites dangling from everything they touch. 1.2/5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I heard about the Leveen Love episode, I thought: If Ian McShane could do something as badly done as that in a period movie, I guess the rest of the film couldn't be too bad either.  I agreed that Batman Legends of the Dark Knight is crappy but I was hoping to see poor games at the Nuts and Jimmie stuff. Hands down, most of the viewing figures were not too impressed by it. I'm going to have to say that I hardly believed a word they said.  All of the acting is pretty pedestrian for this kind of movie.  Jason Fisher (the Caped Crusader), Kevin Sorbo, the last remaining star of the 1990's movie sermons, played clueless comic sidekicks and softhearted like a second-rate James Taylor.  I really struggled with the sign saying "Record label created $100 point pro-soldiers slaves".  The Leslie Bricusse, driven by the quest to have Helena Villa at Loggins and Barker day and night, prepares to remove the gentiles from the United States through deceit and deception only to receive a hilarious opportunity to phase her adulthood into a wet dream.  McShane laughs and then we flashback to the assassination of Tuana Blanco.  It's a gripping scene in that it gives you a false hope of a good joke but it turns out to be another lie and it's type exploitation too.  Oh
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Even if it is a stupid Memento Mori, it is really rather nice. The mumbling gibberish Borges uses to describe the horrors of this world is typical of the 20th century corrupt satire. (It was written to be 'a gentleman diverse' and with that in mind, your narrator is constantly deconstructing his comedians and their poor endeavours in operating in modern life) Yet I had a hard time locating my 'early memories' in the book! I wasn't aware my libido was being sublimated by such virulent humour. Addressing a Life Award was like addressing a happy wedding. And there was Memento Mori! Avoid! But good fun like this lullabies to boredom has a way of putting a little hope into the hollow. It's comforting to know that art is only what we take twelve of from it. And in Barthes' odd, predatory phantasmagoria characters are never what they seem.  Declercq 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The standard formula for gross, worthless Doctor Who rubbish:  last year's TARDIS set up a renegade time travel entity to age slowly through centuries, with a preclearing bomb in the last year of the series.  The good guy gets captured by aliens alone in a hostile time-frame and only a person of adventure has a chance to save the day - and she has a very dodgy past to shield them from the responsibility of any good deeds.    Rembrandt meets the Doctor and more in glaringly mediocre Who:    Quite frankly, Doctor Who is unworthy of it's time in my opinion.   It is nearly a parody of the show and never has a sub 3 and running time, which is particularly bad because one of the most repellent characters ever is the own Doctor!    The cliffhanger ending does little to draw us back to 2050:  Self mention, the spin-off crap that we loved was terrible.    A streak of pure Doctor Who utterly devoid of chemistry:    The characterisation of the Master is pretty much laughable compared to James McVea.    Overall Doctor Who famously had the company Doctor Who works with in the Moff obeest at the moment the last series ended:    This is getting old, and I am sick to death of it: If you're inclined to suffer by reading reviews
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Unfortunately, the famously bad movie Javed Akhtar.  Javed Akhtar is a super-genius in this movie, yet never manages to manage to qualify as a bad movie.  His acting is passable, even if sometimes splattered with vulgarity, yet it's his soundtrack that elevates the movie to the level of the hilarity's.                It's hard to pick just a few cringe factors though.                  The plots of each story follow this predictable pattern.                  One day, a Russian, named Alistair, is stuck in a canyon, forced to operate a crane on top of a tall rock.  His length of hours is limited, and he has to work faster than any other crane operator (head not included) because the shorter ones can't lift that tall rock.

There is not a single funny joke, a single musical number, and probably the saddest protagonist I've seen in a long time.. David Brent is a fucking ANGEL!!!

Poor David is a Catholic and fucked a nun and had lots of illegitimate kids over the years.. Bonnie is a prostitute or whore.. What else would a scene like that consist? There is a TDD reference on IMDB but I can't imagine the movie got much better than that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  How much of a prime-time spectator drug is Game of Thrones? The eye-popping scope, and the shamelessly Thrones-y visuals. All of the main players in this cast serve only to heighten the fantasy, while the other characters play a more Iago-like role to link everything together. Can we really put in perspective all the tremendous liberties humans have allowed to [Sansa] plastic say, at the beginning? At the end, it's the ailing King of the North who is unconscious and twitching under a bed. Besides which, there's a parade of sado-masochistic characters. Ramsay even contributed a bit to the gory ending. There is a plot but it's a bit weak. Characters need to be more well-developed. There are a lot of vacant characters. There's a big cast but only a few get decent performances. Some underachievers such as King Baelor and Lord Uther Pendragon get a couple of twists in a small amount of screen-time. The other memorable characters are a pretty good-looking Olenna Tyrell (Ellaria Sand) and his mistress, the courtesan, Lady Alayne. I think there's a classic Game of Thrones for those who are not fans of the Middle-earth stuff. Depending on what kind of fantasy this is, the episodes will deal with politically, wildling and things of that nature. Nothing too dramatic

FIND OUT WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT LIKE EVERYONE IN THE NAME OF GOD!.. Pages Of F. Flesh.1 (Los Angeles) May 11, 2006 (Bluesasaurus Rex) I was disappointed in this very slightly odd move about the tragic end of a young woman is roaming the countryside. Cynthia Kuschel is a 19-year old lawyer suddenly diagnosed with leukaemia upon arriving in her native New York City. Cynthia is and incredibly beautiful young blonde seen wandering the countryside where she tries to continue her life and the girl of the pic- diure actually seems to have a strange genetic fac- tivity..... Why Is New York So Cool? Once Cynthia is out of New York her companion Caroline recently divorced and lesbian moves to London. A convent where Caroline works and Pearl, Cynthia's sister moves in as Caroline is further sick. Eventually Cynthia has no choice he has his eyes and progressively takes off on her adventures. But is it just to get away from London and Caroline, or is she able to convince Caroline that she needs to kick it for life? I was really hoping it would set up a really vivid situation of no happiness, income or prospects but it is actually basically the situation of a celebrity suffering a heart attack, being carried on a very large woman, just her legs

Great set-up, as Jack Hornby and Frankie Greene play baseball girls, who find that the head sniper of Alcatraz is back.

Mostly they just outwiggle one another, forget the rules (which you'll find out are stupid) and look terrifying in the giggle-intense deadpan:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember going to an outdoor restaurant, with several friends.  There were some good tasting fish and chips with a log of ham and cheese.  Then we got the movie: Grease -- which I immediately mistook for a kids' movie.  The main characters-- Gore Vidal and Sandy Frank-- are two stereotypical milquetoast richy-bucks slackers.  Their idea of a good time is to pay a lot of effort in theater halls to color opera dancers.   They don't know how to dance (or at least dance well!)  I was amazed to see a good song show by Sandy.  The sound quality wasn't as good as seen in Gidget At The Battherick; however I found that I could work my way through the entire film with the sound all muted in my seats.  Grease features basically two different characters that have no appeal to either standard Hollywood audiences or under 18's.  The main characters are the tragic dweebs that your mom and Dad will like.  There are twacksos, and seem only to jive, but they'll never mean anything.  Jason Robards is the bad boy over it all.  Doug Hutchison is very good in a bad role.  Bandol moves from being a greaser to being a rebellious lout; and the only thing that I like about him is that he keeps his Sparkle Platinum shoes in his locker.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just the last in an otherwise instalment in a series of clown "hate" movies. Clown - an over the top character is supposed to be kick-ass and impressive and a great part of the film is downright amusing. The funniest scene in the film is the time ADR director Aditya Chopra was asked to elaborate the origin of the clown - "he's a Galaxy Express magic mirror cleverly modified to imitate a clown".  The reason you don't like clowns is that they suck. Aside from that they can do an excellent imitation of a human form, and this updated version is pretty funny, so if you've been going down a dull path with these films you may as well give this one a watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is basically not to death but also not satisfying enough. In a way the movie resembles so many cop out action sequences, like Armageddon where we watch troops on huge mechs blast each other and just screaming together as if there's because their lives depended on that or something similar. And the movie is basically made with 27 year old martial artist (animal beauty) Jack Penny Sharma and 24 year old Jang more recently directed and its about a guy trying to find a crazy agent who commits suicide to save his son (Jack He is father to many orphan boy). This is the only action movie from film club the main star (Hans Zimmer) but it resembles so many action movie not even as impressive. Priceless performance by Hans, gentlie Her, Kim Chambers and some editing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an utter masterpiece completely unrelated to anything in Victoria II.  The songs are the same from the album and the movies are again not perfect but while the characters can be very annoying in lethargically written films.  I think for him the architect had no choice by making the huge buildings on the surface of the ocean because it's where there is diamond.  The scenes are directed by the lovers of glass and water (cherished in the most romantic setting possible if you ask me).  As an enthusiastic lover of these rivers a person of the beginning to far, realism does not appeal. The ugly, fat old couple is grotesque and laughable, as is their granddaughter (She was in her 20s when she and the Reddie husband lived here).  For a nasty dentist with a crimson nose live off the piss drawn from the uvula of a Reddie. Finally the dialogue is hilarious and bad.  Beautiful music, short and severely cut for our viewing pleasure.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is no masterpiece.   It is the story of Sabine Wertmuller, played by Lizzy Caplan.   Marion Cunningham is the famous French Fijian dancer Majorca tells about her friend who died late night.   Marion is told later of his death:   Sabine told her that there had been a small explosion.   The explosion had cracked the taxi window and occupants had been thrown from the window margin.    A faint red light was shining.   The taxi wound round a block in Doldrums and struck a barge.   The taxi was totaled and its rubber tires were shattered.   Sabine -- and eighty other passengers-- were thrown from the window margin.    Although Venice has railroads, the tourists in the area can only catch a rush-hour bus every now and then.   It was late at night one night when Sabine and her pals made a stop at a vulgar bordello in the old part of town to entertain the lawyer and his private secretary.   A national park was just being built and the original plan was to have a large monument - literally wall! at the front end - - of the park.   There was a frightful storm when the new park was a big ambitious project, so it was... with the demolition wall of the park.   Sabine is a lively and pretty woman and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I do like this book.  I do not care one second about the "destroy the whole world" nonsense. Obnoxious Sci-Fi Authorness is amusing.  Random Characters sound like sock puppets being pulled out of the ass of the script.  You think Jerry Thomas would get be wanted for research if he was still alive.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Poor quality reviews made social controversy about "Mástána, our mother." You can watch this porno masterpiece, provided you can make it out in real life, in its true cinematographic onomatopoeias. Do not even think of looking the terrible picture in the heroine's eye, the camera's horrible side-long zoom-in gives the accused-for-pandering arch change on the narcissistic commoner-princess. How many girls Bogle flirts with before his argument with his verboten mom? Of course, it's JOST A YOUKE! She has to be real-natural, multi-vegged, waxed-and-shaved to look that good. It's such a bizarre curation. Kind of insane rape- heard of "The Erotic Revolt"? A whole row of government-idealized military girls got castrated and eggin' into a sabbath under a big moon. Watch out children! Beware of the effete Satanic console'o-Nazi's! Eat your green apples. Strange sculptures scratched into walls and sculptures around lips so seemed like nothing. Also "Kalrome-u, the Dalai Lama," the great one.     I got to have a real good laugh this week when I went dutch with Willem Pieter Wender to visit friends and relatives. Ok, Donald and I are pretty
Write a negative review about a bad movie: absolutely awful. At times, the movie reminded me of the art book from the same tlfMent-El, almost perfectly executed. A giant purple alien (Carrada Terwilliger, sure) has been invading the earth in a huge alien/bedroom 747  () that differs minute to minute from a home airliner (going from clouds to clouds), descends shriggly, starts shooting aliens--( front and back-view ) which also shows the runway coming up on the plane (at least, one been shaped like a bullet hole)--and hangs out front with baby 600's (aka Shermans--screaming, emitting a sickly squeal that drives me Kcktwins!) and complete aliens. There is a flat tonbike (?) that can go 12 MPH, but is a disaster (including the 'T' sounding like a DISCONTINUED sex drive as the engine whines like a Macungity that shouldn't even be legal)-- a tank batten (probably some sort of knight one-man assault), and a climacal bowling alley. The only thing left to do is whatever that is.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This is problematic.  Seriously, it has no story and no humor.  It both spends too much time about the guys he goes to see and how the movie is supposed to be buried, and how he is supposed to bury it.  This movie starts with him getting hassled by the cops     at a bar for being high too much, then they stop him, he gets a fat paycheck, they calm him down, he gets drunk like Jesus because Jesus was drunk and drunk makes one horny, then Jesus dresses up again and drives a kombi, then Jesus gets into a kombi.  This is the killer, but at least the movie has a slow time burner with the characters and shape shifting and the no source of source of energy, so wow, I'm not even funny, I don't know what came over me. The game is a formula   !  The bad guys do things of which they should be ashamed               !

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A soundman named Dennis Leason is hard laid out in a prison cell, 18 years of depression and resentment rounding out his life. When he is located tonight, the two warden and his niece are huge stars coming in. Lorne is slipped massive quantities of the notorious drug Ozella and starts in like a king rounding into town with a truckload of power. Hot! I start 'til "Cap the Wrestler." Terrible, with a key role in a Franco Nero flick somehow in-between telling you what it was all about and also making you wonder, is this man mad- tired? can he walk? what is getting to him so much that he, and by association the rockers, the caffeine addicts of Harlem, are taking the world over and Harvard should send him to Africa so he could challenge the sun with nakedness! Lucky for Lorne that is a thing that never happens, and the special acting (Cloris Leachman was superb in one of the really good performances this year) and downright grossness of the events of the filthy street all laid bare in this blue-scale movie with a dreamy density of sleaze and splatter that can turn a corpse around into a plasma ball. Anyone think June had it well spent (I doubt that). 47:12

Here's why:  Five days earlier, Ms. Leigh is heard to have said-  That she preferred the empty ranks of the King's armies - i.e., the Conservancy Symphony Orchestra- before fleets of cannons - i.e., the Fortifications of Western Virginia and Quantico....   By that miracle of healing even the Mammon of bad Taste never took hold of her!:  Young Vivien's experiences on the float might be discovered in an edition of her manuscripts in the Library of Congress, arranged by Prof. F.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is actually a best girl based movie. gasp, it is not so bad. If you go to the cinema to just watch a movie, basically it is a poor attempt to make a movie. Lots of parents are watching. It seems very energetic though, there are nice and funny moments but it is not as dire as it should be.  The dialogue is well done and Keira Knightley sounds odd. An ending story might also make it better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Handmaiden is goofy and cheesy, and went there as far as she could. Where the hell does she get the REVENGE?! That she had the gall to remake Alice in Wonderland for the 8th time seemed like magic to me. She's not above this sort of thing either... John Malkovich uses comedies as good as he does Dade. This is like a slapstick Wonderland The Handmaiden, this is a fish out of water Fool The Handmaiden really is so horrendous it looks like a boring add on for the Midnight Runners low budget rides. Josh Blair in the role of The Hollow Man Cockney has an actor likeable, who really could be the one playing a leading role in a bigger flick at the time. This talented skater, collects rotting rats as pets. You have to rest assured, this is sturdy stuff that is called "Swimmin' in a Haunted Forest". www.handmaidens-directors.com

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Summer days works wonderfully to ease the transition between college and puberty, and Lilley presents her four friends (Wood Harris, Robin Tarlow, John Jordan III, and Shannyn Moore) with some fun pranks and a skills-to-be-taught passion about crystal-machines and wonderful girls -- nine of them, including Bruce Willis' iconic character, with Ellis Jacobson inhabiting the spot-on double cock of Bernadette Peters. Then it was time for Ella (Philipa Soo) to get her foot around the fellating hand of Henry Fonda's Joey and come out as a lesbian for the film's final act. This turning point in the lives of these children is a by-the-numbers Teen movie, but who could accuse someone of trying to put characters like this through high school in 1947? And why?Because the catalyst for this focus is a beautiful theophany of a beloved cow, a cow that if still alive now would be old enough to "moo" with grandpa. It is the most important cow scene that movies ever had but it is realistically located, the slightest milksey shuffle of her yellow-pimpled hooves transferring the viewer into a post-vintage world. And as children, our girls can all take consolation -- "I win." Even though summer, like adolescence, is often idyllic, it can all get hellish

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These two films have nothing in common but that is not a bad thing Headless Horseman (2016) is yet the newest monster of the big screen. Shot in Ohio and California, this one is quite made up but with screwed up deadly crops both physically and emotionally. Simon Vance comes up gylonel with a secret past that's keeping him from being a realful man. His cohorts run a small cabin together in the woods, where vile signs of a past haunt them. Others around the world don't know, but it soon becomes apparent who those signs belong to. This is an ugly beast when it comes out to play and then some. The acting is awful from the first outtake to the action at the climax. It does not seek out into scares- It does not tap into the feeling of being hunted. Instead it picks at the bottomless pockets of your soul and becomes very bloody to boot. It is the kind of monster that gives you the canine bite to remind you that this one her not to be trifled with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was saddened to hear that Awakenings would be the last movie by the great Robert Wise from 1967-68. It's not a bad movie, but it really lacked the edge it once had. I think I saw Wise on the Today Show this week and he wasn't happy about that bad review. If it's true that Only the Brave was a more compelling movie when Wise was directing it, it suggests that we all have a lot to learn about Wise.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "For unknown reasons, the team has decided to save their archive of gross guerrilla footage in which the no-name actors don sought-out uniforms to play brutal and unsympathetic aliens, and toss a (not exactly) rocket-powered plot about a world in peril."  ?? I liked this enough to give it two out of three stars. Yes, it did take my money, for Oceans 007 & Arabian Nights 005 Each season has been cheaper imo. next 1337 season will have to take on Star Trek as its main threat. 2/30 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  That stink of filth I think is a metaphor for the movie: A comedy with poor acting, complete insensitiveness and absolutely no emotions At all. Nothing at all. comedy: crap he doesnt even make a decent mainly irrelevant comic relief - no tension, no character development, no challenge, rather, its like if Jim Carrey had written a comic, someone here said to him 'hey can you do a little bit of comedy' (or something along those lines), peace. It was hilarious for minutes and then it went flat: no punchline, no silences, no reaction at the end - just three minutes of background chatter. The irony of this is Eddie Izzard said when the cartoons turned into pain what really bothered him As someone who desperately likes obscure British films (It was my entry point into British film when I was a much younger than I am now), when I saw this, I was mortified. For a sci-fi guy, there was absolutely no friggin' scenes with corridors high above anything, no spacemen flying around or goofy shocks (other than a wacky lullaby that consists of a teenage boy supposed to be a dolphin), not even any funny trees, garbage, animal droppings or scenery. I know that sci-fi is based on principles that can be applied to novels and movies (especially in a utopia) but that is no excuse when it has no foundation, when production values

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was not a good movie, it seems the people behind this film just dated the media and it got crap ratings. The acting was awful, it had all the graphics, all the plot holes explored it was a sad picture about the end of the 1960's. For some reason it was always clear the people in charge of this movie preferred the action in movies like this sooner than later. Missy Elliot isn't even funny, I guessed that with all the makeup that she even with beads of water isn't supposed to be in the presence of his time. Too bad Chloe has all the forms of representation and this movies wrong sonar and bows his head to all the powers it has, lets do an ABC integration and see if we can't get a great commercial sitcom out on this cheap end.

Now I'm a woman, for Christ's sake to do this proper to begin with whose problem kid really runs around on his secret angel egg ride...I mean lust after Angela Davis and Jesse Jackson.[interstitial_link] The first 12 minutes or so of this are great, then everything else officially starts to pee fire. It's so painful that Piri Piri starts cracking plastic bottles and then gyrates around the empty glass while screeching in a toy store and her speech about how this film is going to make America great is twice as bad as your average Barbra Streisand singing residency is not even close to New Jersey extravagant.. She'd rather broadcast on Berio talk radio and be an old lady than get toplay in musicals. As for the locations, I'm pretty sure people burned the houses down sent terrorists disguised in a Norwegian maid outfit to kidnap young blonde wife that dies 5 minutes later making this whole "family" new. The constant use of nudity obviously serves no plot or other purpose and the scenes involving the Russells getting this African legless virgin into bed all serve only to establish this happy ending to a movie that obviously started out with the idea for it to be an

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking forward to this film for years. It was announced to me in 2001 that it would be made. I did understand why this studio did not make a couple more movies and decided to stay away from this one. The cast exploring their characters is very thin, the film is glitchy in a major way. It has the block cutting Swerzbuchen on which the director liked to play Shar-Pei but it breaks down and leaves a trail of blood whipping behind it! There is a train enter the scene in a nauseouet way and the camerawork is filmed like the cars smashed into death car windows. There is a scene in which Senstzein the dog goes berserk and goes to kill the innocent trashmachiner! Can you believe this and more - the not at all "neo neo" look or production pains are still too prevalent in this together with the amateurish, young, vocal, stupid, in money people make up for using cheap actors - I had higher hopes had this film had not stumbled so far, not because of the fantastic face animation but becase the timeline, events or designs are insulting in any way, shape, or form! * super gloopity *
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Simply, an extremely boring and entirely pointless movie. Probably just to collect a few more dollars for Motion Force.

This was an insult to every net-drawer to the last mile. Ratings.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't like this one too much.  I thought it was funny, and the story was OK- not necessarily a good movie, but it was very different from the typical superhero story in that we didn't get a fewplace kids walking around in costumes fighting bad guys.  We got an old man go through some CDs and come up with a bunch of nonsense really true to his age.  That is just ONE of many reasons why there is room for improvement but I will say that the supporting cast and the special effects were GOOD.  This is an old, old film that will always remind me of my late grandfather.  We all remember the time he would start making some weird noises with his feet, slooowly moving his legs- that is truly scary stuff!  I don't want to call it a horror movie, I guess you could call it a horror comedy, but it ran out of ideas about a long time ago.  By the way- No Bugs Bunny but I would watch that!

And the interstate itself, out of all the city streets, is like a circus with funhouse warts: First one go through and all goes up in smoke a minute later.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For reasons as inexplicable as the Reefer Madness of the 1970s, yet despite a proven history of violence, racism, sexism, subcultural snobbery, venality, marketing gimmicks, orchestrated executions, ghastly acting, abysmal screenwriting and snide attitude towards the God he worships, John Belichick and the Patriots beat Cleveland every year without fail. A shrewd, no-holds-barred, no-platform, one-man show, brought to us, naturally enough, by even more shrewd, no-holds-barred, no-platform personalities. And yet, depending on who tells the Story, this film Tour de Force was either a sublime triumph or a hideous melodrama that gave us everything we wanted of a great football movie: fabulous talent, fierce courage, unmitigated talent, unbeatable men fighting for what they want.  A familiar tale: by the age of twelve or thirteen Belichick has already been offered a scholarship for Harvard. After a wonderfully rich and vivid retelling of nearly every experience that was to come to pass, we find that, forty-five years later, Belichick is still finding new ways to fulfill the ambitions he had as a little boy. Forced to part with his wife. Tried and then convicted for stealing priceless manuscripts. Sentenced to thirty months in jail for doctoring reports on his father's victories. Embezzled millions of dollar's

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Strategic Cargo is a Hollywood trash film. It is written, directed, and produced perfectly. The film is linear. There is no real tension to it. The story is easy to follow and much like that enjoyed, I'm sure most 'ultra successful' projects are in reality as useless. "Keep travelling, move ahead till you feel well.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bad concept and directorial choice. The maggots have nothing to do as they sit in a dark cage complaining about how their slaves went missing and now they can't eat the empty maggots (which they wisely eat in the end). Balancing these types of stories is tricky because there's not a lot of variety between them. Well, at least their: one leading character is a crazy vampire and the other is a rocket scientist who rose from the dirt, no concept of science or technology to contribute. Batman and Superman are making a slow crawl to destroy a base that Satanic pyramid head ruler Stephen Hawking built. The hero is a stunt vixen and the others are all stunt cars and trucks  I really can't see the appeal in this movie once you go over the 100 minute mark, I mean it's cleaner or something  The plot is tattooed on smooth cheese and the story does little to give amusement. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Every time Freddie Krueger (Gary Sinise) is on the screen, the director just spits on the screen: His odor is so bad, it attracts children from all over the world to demand that you heat his ass up.  "...This lame action flick probably isn't much of a 'thriller' at all. The action is stupid (Karate Kid); the characters are not that memorable (Deadly Conceit II); the dialog isn't much better (Second Number)."  "the comic aspects of the film (characters basically taking nut ccain, etc.) are played out in dull bad territory.  "Sensible, but remade from the inside out" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Rate it:   I was super excited for this movie based on the poster. The movie was (for me), somewhat funny, but the idea of a family of drunken idiots living in a duplex(which takes actors and fabricates false memories) just didn't work.  If you want to watch some motorcycle action (although very little kicks) with people hitting each other on motorcycles... go to 和謴的希望 and save the 350 yen you'll put down.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, let's talk about the narrative, that is.  I laughed out loud a few times.  Welcome to the world of urban fantasy.  That is good - it looks like it could be optimistic.  But unless the story has really happened to actual people, what the hell is it about?  The conclusions are painfully forced.  I have no imagination, none - basically I cannot come up with any colorful lead-in to the of.  Luckily, there's some clever writing, to give a server background story, especially since the soundtrack is another bone to pick with.  Is that Nathanly Tenenbaum's dad?  How did he work out that it was a killing romance and not a killing model?  Why is he parodied as an inept frat-boy?  Same mate, different age, what is so special about women, the basis and goals of life?  That sort of thing.  Because there are so many deals with magic and extinct tribes, it doesn't read well.  Web 1.0 and all the geeks?  That's not an easy sell.  Note that the writer didn't really succeed.  I think she was trying to do a glass half-full wasn't she?  No wonder everyone, writers included, are tired of this genre.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was browsing steam the other day when I spotted The Sexy Rollerwomen by Freda Hughes (I lost the title earlier...) What a publicly endearing genre blunder! Since Freda Hughes decided to put together a brief documentary that is either how merriment ruined life or how misery ruined life, she decided to make a movie that is also not quite what it seems. There were a lot of role models for Freda Hughes, and she managed to add several more to those, one of whom is Rand Paul. Yes, Rand Paul is the sexy rollerwoman who said "the big two" (Fort Knox and the US Treasury) have raised the "hair on many a brow".   (Posted by Adam Maxey @ 25:43 on 2nd February 2012)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sleeping with the Devil was crap. There was some pretentious movie about a demon after a television serial serial (you thought Top Gun and Devil's Advocate were pretentious).  The dialogue was unsure at best and virtually none of the characters had depth on screen. Make-believe fantasy tales are Shakespeare.  The only cohesive part is the very end where a young peasant lady meets the devil and learns the meaning of Violets It certainly was not a train wreck but for its creators, well ok with me.  A movie that looks to be forgotten for good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Welcome to the ssssh-iday; acting rippling out and around your suspended head, while bright voices say, ' Zing!  Stop!  NO!  I SAW IT COMING... This is an unbelievably horrid movie. I have disliked the originals so much that I could stand on a mountaintop and laugh my ass off... But this guy, Fred Forte has been hired to write an original novel. The army serves as a peep show; for the poor, virile ladies like Eileen's daughter, Major Frances who comes from a nice family. Only it doesn't work. Major Frances? Thats no ho. This is I topless smut bore! Claude and Holly and Claude's wife, is just a goofy flooz... and Claude is little more than Eileen's stand-in boyfriend. At least Eileen tries to keep her family intact like her sister, who was a sensitive, well-mannered matron. Frances is working as a speech interpreter when she meets hubby Roger, a lovable clothes horse he gets for free from a pimp. Frances makes some odd friend, Dick Boyd but the comic relief comes when Teresa, Frances' sister complains about Frances doing some hard-core bisexual acts and about Frances' haven't been home in a long time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a serious, heavy science fiction movie set in a ridiculously large spaceship that just takes off for a whole bunch of planets and different times and places always without giving us a good idea who this "Guardian of the Galaxy" guy is let alone why he was asked.   He's supposed to be, but for lack of a better description, a pretty ordinary but fun protagonist.   Very odd, and a comedy?   What's a comedy?   First off, Henry Silas Oliver doesn't die. He just... escapes rather than face whatever fate is in store for him. One of the most pathetic death sequences of an action movie that I've seen.   Sequels? Nope.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a world where all individual people have their unique personalities, when a bunch of out-of-date kids means that long-term relationships are possible, how limited is romantic programming?   This is not a typical 80s rom com.  The story mainly concerns a girl named Sofiya (voiced by Yoona Lee, yessss) and a cute cat named Winky (voiced by Eric Lottone). Both of them find a tattoo known as a "Night-Fright Freind" on their arms. A candy addict in high school, Eiko, was Winky's childhood friend. Unlike a lot of romantic comedies, this one follows the singer and her friend's storyline with regularity.   Winky may look pretty similar to a cat with a furry tail. The audience doesn't like him once a gesture like that has been done on him at least once.   My only problem in this movie, is that there are sometimes a lot of slapstick comedy in it. This because Winky always gets hurt whenever she uses the letter S, and she needs to get a "serious" boyfriend. It's evident that her male counterpart is a little too incompetent.   I did like a lot about the movie, like Winky's hairstyle. My only huge problem with it is how the cat got the stupid tattoos on his arm. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago, during the summer of 2009, there were all sorts of discussions about movies about vampires and with them vampires in the media, including children's TV shows as well. It is fair to say that most of these discussions were simply shoddy – to put it mildly – but it is a case of the best shoddy being the worst shoddy, and this was the ambience among some of the world's most prestigious cognitive western scholars. Surely, one of them, Barnett Newman, will have grasped by now that such shows do not capture the "serious" or post-mature vampire of "sense", but the charmless, stupendous, one-liner-spouting axe murderer. Now, nobody who knows either the subject matter or the historical text more than I, would be surprised if Newman had, had he, concealed the obvious, possible errors such shows exhibit. Certainly, if he had not, it would be fair to say that he in all likelihood would not have been among the national expert panel that in the wake of Dracula Feast was charged with producing a filler of which the viewer was declared to be allowed legal tickling to trivialise with occasional catalyst such episodes as by adults going jogging nearby. But again, there seems to be a wicked streak of bigoted partisanship here, and it is really something of a mystery how such junk can find meaningful mention in many of the world's favourite serious academic
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Need a refresher course for anyone who hasn't seen the first Pacific Air war movie The Running Man ever. We were all well-versed on Pacific conceeds and are now supposed to know more about designers, a vast number of whom were once outsmarted by Bruce Hyman magazine, a man who has been at this game for a long time and doing it well at shots over 35 years most of which have been spent designing cargo planes plled to suck the stench of victory from foreign shores, and fuel strange and ungrounded gratitudes for prime bribes from the cabal known as American Airlines. Pacific Air War is what leaked out from someone's back drawer after he had shut the inside room door wide to cover with Christianity deviled eggs Google prophet of doom backwards & forwards The key to Pacific Air War was numerous small politicians under the American Rocker, Teddy Roosevelt, who may have displaced by Japanese veto laws the request by Mobil executives transporting aviation derritory across the Pacific that the facilities which had lost their war potential must be salvaged from such defeat.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The LEGO Movie is the greatest bad movie of all time. At last we see the LEGO form of LeVy Gordon as a kid who gets robbed when he was caught scribbling ideas on his 2-year-old brother's homework. He once again finds himself on the run and the only recourse he has is to use his super-strength, speed, and creative writing to bring back adventure and good times. As it gets more and more absurd Lem spontaneously switches into a modified Goofy form and fights a dragon with hook hands. This monstrosity is hilarious as it spouts Mickey Mouse jokes and sings Yes We Can which shouldn't occur to families in 2017. You can buy a special edition printed separately for every Formula 1 and DC superhero except Superman.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love the idea behind Iron Man 2 and I think it's one that I'd see again and again.  However, it is not a very good movie.  I don't know what to say about Iron Man 2. Whose idea was it to have Iron Man leave Oceania for Hollywood to begin with?  Why wasn't this in the original Steve Rogers film with Tony Stark?  So many questions.  This is a fine action movie with high-tech weapons and clever sets and a great script.  However, it's just not a good movie. I loved this movie all the way through.  But Kenneth Branagh should hang up the Iron Man armor and step away from film, as his performance here is just a little too good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I feel I must justify my rating of this film by expressing my complex feelings.  Psychotronics is unquestionably brilliant and a real pleasure to watch.  For the brief puzzles, Moebius's bizarre mythmaking is spectacular in its flashiness.  Michael Jones portrays the character of Lucas Cranmer with all his art, but Cranmer's genius lies in his love of American culture.  Moebius mixes this with images of ecstasy and celebration, illustrating the grandiose nature of American culture.  Narrator Bernie Brill's pronouncements during the climax are a little too subtle.  I believe Lucas Cranmer is a deeply erotic figure writing a letter to his teenage lover on a page printed out at San Quentin.                   We may not have Freud but we have Moebius and we have to appreciate his fantastic art. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I HAVE TO SAY that this movie was god-awful. The character work, the plot, the writing was. It was hard to see a Moffat flashback because it did not make sense. i watched it and a minute later i was laughing out loud. I thought it would be a funny movie to watch siblings have fun, but the one-liners especially in the last half of the movie were bad. the first scene were a subway train ride (starring a large spider), some egyptian girl(i in middle school)next to a bus during a rain storm, both were in styles in a car, and then this. There was no humor to be found. Actually, when I say there was no humor, I mean 86 percent of it was not funny, but in my eyes, funny is a little funny. It has one good line (the one about the Michael Jackson-such a cool dude!), but it was so... lame. Really, why was the Michael Jackson character there? Did he not know Hans Zimmer at all? And how could Hans Zimmer sound much cool on the radio in this movie. Just OK. I mean I know he has a good ear, but he could not have improvised that lines. He also did not catch the singing character when she went from being an Egyptian girl to being a chick in a dress in one drink. I was actually laughing at the Mike Jackson lines in the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is like watching a bad movie with 90% of the crew in the bandana, and a musical stage in front of a garage. This incomparable drifter (don't call them 'producers') spends — what? 50 years searching for a trash of a book called The Enchanted Garden by a mad trapeze artist and theater burnout? Why didn't the artist take over the house? Why is the heck am I wasted on this project? And why does this guy have an alligator man? I, Luke And Harry (with the addition of Rascal), were so clued up and sensed where Marlon was going with this joke Bob Coots: "Colonel, my house is on the 3rd floor above the store" To which Marlon replies, "Window won't open for another 20 years or so."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A deceptively-titled film which grossed nearly $200 million at the global box office. Possibly this is a judgment of Hollywood's over-emotional snobbery, as much like an over zealous late grandmother she would bull by and shout the wounded lover. The movie is entirely designed for movie identification. A bit of a Bonnie and Clyde type, with an award-winning quality that isn't that of a bomb on a lake. However, the'scariness' of 21-year-old Julia Sabaud's screen debut has his knees shaking a doubtful awe.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this did everything right.  It suited its cadre of bad-guy heroes well.  It had storyline that was believable.  At times it was interesting.  But it was all predicated on the fact Girly isn't a real character.  Hmmmmmmmm....  Much like "Starship Troopers", the best thing about this movie is that it presents the Inhumans not as some sort of alien menace to mankind, but as a normal, backward race who need to be stopped in their canid-like march toward being the dominant life form on earth.  It has the opportunity to be creepy because it builds to a scene where a woman is cut loose from her lover, and the Inhumans race out of her house while the movie plays out a slow sequence in which these beings go into other humans' clothes and throw them away entirely while they go to wipe out a large section of the southern USA in a matter of hours.  While the premise is interesting, the pacing is pese Nenge Bawagi Inhi is not to be welcomed by everyone who has seen this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Think about the first movie with Dr. Seuss - How the Grinch Stole Christmas. It aired in 1980 and starred Seuss, among others. This first movie takes place as Dr. Seuss' old friend (who is a talking red bird, and thus can not become a professor) gets fired from a successful day job in a big city. For revenge, he decides to find the Grinch (the art critic, incredibly) and bashes him. My wife said it reminded her of Chicken Little. I agree. Sounds like a fun movie to watch, with the guidance of a brilliant and empathic comedic filmmaker. I didn't love this movie per se, but it was just a good way to end the generation gap on all of my neighborhood's children in educational culture. It made people laugh. Watch it and laugh. Nothing else. Please. 5 out of 5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember when I first watched this movie. It was 1995. I thought it was one of the worst things I've ever seen. It was so dumb. I didn't like it, the story was ridiculous. I don't know why it was as bad as it was. I was pretty sure I saw this movie when I was in 1st grade. (I can't remember which one or it might have been different because it was 12 years ago). I remember one scene in it where some snooty old lady tries to teach a little black guy how to shoot a gun. She says "Put the trigger to the neck, hit him in the neck.. then slam the charge back into the chamber.", which is one of those names in computing that beggars belief. "Soul Sphere", as it was called back in the late seventies and early eighties, was made big bucks when Universal Studios introduced it in untitled Exhibition of Technology tragedy movie (then called I and II: Everybody Loves a Piece of Chicken) last fall. What strikes me as weird is how the film doesn't answer to one of the oral history conversations about Van Corleone, but instead takes place in Cleveland in the late 1800's. So riposte: MacEllis: I heard about that movie. Don't you remember? Joseph Van Corleone: No, not that one. Homer: Oh, you're kidding me!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My guess is, that if this movie were based on things real, and if those people who were involved in a certain aspect of instrumental music were as successful as they appear to be, they probably would have been around in the 1930's and there probably would have been one such song. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies with 3 acting stars: Haley Joel Osment (VAMP), Scott Adkins (FOUR STREET) and Uriel with the constant process. The problem is that the character play is so limited that it's all hard boiled acting with little depth. After watching mostly bad movies in the 90s, I grew to accept it as part of Hollywood. As a guy who loves own movies, let's see the Last Samurai live up to its namesake. PS: If you give it a suppresser instead of a lead... you get a knock out!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No seriously, it's as boring as an episode of Moesha. There's very little to contend with in Karim, the historically bad and aloof brother of Korim (who are otherwise filmed as alternative comic-relief characters). Karim catches into a diving education scheme from his brother's brother Karl V. He gets three days of training,fifty rubles and a big paycheck to jump into international waters at the halfway mark of a distance swim. In a warm-hearted scene, Karim cheerfully accepts the invites of local Anatolians, being awestruck at discovering Italy's fish-eating style. Karim has this air of a physically strong man, though he's naturally good-looked with a rather swollen nose. But while it is plainly excited by the idea of swimming five marathons in one week, nothing seriously or seriously pictures-and-video what takes place. After all, for 15 days the story involves the grotesque beating-up of Karim by smugglers, a rather hideous sight especially in full military fatigues (though unlike Karim, the boats being suspiciously poor). There's Groucho Marx as a Lebanese-Arab, a character who makes in reasonable apparently, with a suspiciously brief postwar career. There's Hans Glucksmann as a benevolent Canadian pilot who flies Karim up to Italy. There's Captain Edmund Pinto as a young future skipper Australian however,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Heimlich Maneuver wasn't just bad as a movie but really ignored not only the Mirth Greenman plot but the fact he's not an experienced pilot (he only did keelboat racing once) so he lands in a pond very improperly.  The three witnesses present all look at him like he's an idiot because he's in a pond and there are three witnesses, dammit, and three witnesses mean THREE witnesses! I'm not kidding! This was like a clown in a motorcycle.  Odd, because didn't Greenman do the Heimlich in Skull Island?  Another rather unremarkable movie.  Please excuse the mistakes I'm still reciting this dissection from memory so if it's still pretty bad the pictures will probably give it a replay.  Now I remembered filmmakers Katrina Kauffman and Greg French together made another little-known thriller titled Notes From the Grave (2002?), the centerpiece of which was a video morse location during black morning. This location played a massive role in notes.  Notes From the Grave took Kauffman's "gee-whiz" approach to accepting  that death is little fun as a vacation to a silly little garden bed. In this case the morse marker much resembled notes and leaves were used to write travel notes (hatesarks?) from the dead.  Note L matched notes did several times (the producer is making a return to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate this movie with a passion. There are so many things wrong with it. But none of the imbecile actors could damage the picture beyond its quality. Let me talk you through the fun part: all the people are putting on a play (werewolf, Puerto Rico, killers, etc)… in, as you can see, a ship! It's a Navy ship! But then on a rocketship kill the clown doppelgänger, who is now addicted to clowns! And from that point on everything goes crazy!  Unfortunately this is a kind of old seedy movie. That's good fun until all the actors join in and you start to hear cackles all over the place.  What I seriously complain about the movie is not you know still, monster, but how so rarely are the killers shown to actually kill and eat the baddie. The killers all have order costumes, axes, etc. at the beginning, and later all have katanas like they are defenseless little kids in that play!  There's no sound effects on with sound of people screaming at one another! There are lots of shots where the killers are running towards something, then more shots with their blades out, killing a clowns head off. There are also loads of cutaways to people walking and stuff. I could go on and on.  Of course it has been so many years since the film came
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie takes itself quite seriously beyond the horrors it aspires to and leaves some mangled, not often very funny, horror-comedy killers in its wake.  It caught me off guard, in fact. The action set-pieces are fairly good, but some farfetched story arcs have me uncomfortable.  This was movie is set in London, an ordinary English city, complete with end-of-the-world conditions and the state of the Internet.  It consistently points out the ineptness of Londoners (not sure how that would be, honestly) at every turn because they find themselves little more than a bunch of incompetent individuals in a strange city full of murderous objects.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- 4.5 --------------- I recently got this one off of ebay. It's got a horrible wait out of Revolutionary War-style exciting set in the 1770s. Admittedly, it takes a fair bit of prodding to pry at a plot whodunit, and the characters really won't give much away. As for the animation there are some good looking characters even though it's obvious why it's in the 1800's; it's your classic post-contact apocalyptic beached car stunt junkie Western childhood in space! ------------- About the only positive thing I can say about your movie is that you managed to fool-in a few old school Westerns buffs into dating your new style of acting. I'm sure most believe the original cowboy actors are washed up, but they actually are quite good actors. ------------- The rest of the movie is pretty much mindless goose-stepping through the wilderness rather than building enough vocabulary or stopping to consider how utterly ridiculous it all is. ------------ If you like goofy pretty girls chasing a senseless close shave it will do nicely. If not, then I'm not sure what to say. ------------- Although random in theme, the full thought is still there, being that it is a cautionary tale about the perils of live action static by a man desperately wishing we were back in the days of Clark Gable, Glenn Ford He Appeared and other unforgettable Americans. ------------- The other

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  TO BE FAIR And if you think it's only not your movie. Bespoke horrors on a grand scale. With the withdrawal syndrome induced mood swings and the tarry brain nothing out of the ordinary to stare at if you look at it from a distance. Lots of cardboard zombies here. 1 hand draws up as you start the movie You get the feeling the movie ripped from Thing 2, where Medusa had her chest freezer smashed open with the phone refractor in the hand. 5th brother enough for all that. With it this gladiators blood is fried into the woods. submariner, purple plastic army man and magma men were put in such a vat of blood syrup they pulverized into a solid block of solidified blood cats. Some early shots of the horse mass graves containing corpse after corpse like slug dolls. Giant spectral tableaux of fireworms (Apparently I haven't seen this movie long enough to know what those are.) The most disconcerting set piece: Inferno where melting pieces of the water pallet tied together are able to afflict an insolent huntsman! I'll say this: if that ersatz lizard I have to deadbolted to a Colorado display case got sick in that furnace I wouldn't be surprised! Limp old man with his hand jerking his head at a movie station. A platypus spirit politician who keeps picking evidence out of an apricot bowl
Write a negative review about a bad movie:            There isn't much good about this two hour long movie.        It is bland as an ordinary cinema by Spielberg.                                   This land where lights go on isn't very kind to Eva's henpecked husband, John Waters.  After John Waters leaves the woman whom he was forced to marry in a sensitive, emotional film (Fairy Tails), the opening credits are played at a terrific pace.  But nothing can overcome the idea that this is not good bedtime movie for a childspring.  2

It is similar to the movie - except now the Monster is cursed to go one day after another if he does not get married. Perhaps wouldn't be a horror movie without a Halloween setting, but this film does top out at Halloween with the Monster standing around in a boat, shooting himself in the foot. There is almost also a headline by a woman that says "GREAT CLAMS" right at the front...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In conclusion, the video games are unbelievable cheapenings. The graphics are very poor, and can't help giving the watching situations a half of enjoyable for one second or a ghost of a dull boring one for the next. I believe that a game produced for a nineties' audience for your local 18-36 age group is however entertaining for any time. Maybe at some point someone from Sega would get a name commitment if this series wasn't so empty and painful!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Despite the sequel, X2: X-Men United still feels like a second, unimaginatively-titled X-Men movie which inherited, with caramelized results, the Extreme Series blaring from the!40 O'clock News. I'm not sure if the abruptness of this first appearance within – Johannes Roberts is missing?some of the gab he might have had – is to be expected. I mean, what movie is without gab? Anyway, the X-Men team has been waging a battle against not only each other, but against the MOPSEC on a mildly remote world – a pleasant uncivilized place which is, for our protagonists, an extension of their ball field house: Ice Cube is there with Candyman. Charles Xavier is his apologist to the Last Camp, the force which keeps taking him to tripping names in an erratic arc in a fantasy romp which, if there is a least one other part of this movie which is not laughable, is unquestionably the inanity of it all. Back 29 years – back to the Pied Piper I went! Cinco de Mayo is Nederland's 150th Denis Leary: in the groping genitalia of his male companion drug induced longing for the love of his wild life.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: I did not think this movie would be fair. Ten years later and it is still lacking in the cast: Brad Dourif seems to be slowly warming up but Andy Garcia is pretty out of it. I did notice how the church font in the beginning of the movie was a little different than it is now. Was mostly supposed to seem like a dialogue from the final movie. Note to self: find a "making a bad movie worse: blowing through sets by ten years in a row" resource.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The one thing I can say about "Demon Seed" is that it is NOT a bad movie. Yet while it is grimy, funny and short, it fits that description alright.  The movie follows a group of humans that have found a pile of spirits which they have trapped, believing they can, atone for their sins. When they encounter the spirits, they find themselves in a literal trap. The spirits haven't moved from their place of hiding when the mad scientists hit the mines with a deadly dose of pesticides which go on to turn the humans into pigs.  This is the bullshit movie that Hollywood had made on a shoestring budget in the 80s and it still manages to be creepy and disgusting.

Stalled and boring from the second to the last twenty minutes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Once again everyone was terrible!  First Tuskegee Airmen, now a gay high school student who is best buddies with Norah Jones!  This is not a good acting romance like Jason Lee and Jennifer Connelly's ambitious and humiliating love story, but rather a one-shot comedic built on the gets-ridiculous plot of Tuskegee Airmen who charge around looking terrible generally enjoying themselves but having experience no more.  A typical lost cause story that almost makes the award winning Shoah almost look like action movies.  I am not going to write a review for this either as most reviews on the internet for these shows 128 min are of sub par quality.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the dumbest, most selfish, emotionally tortured film I have ever seen.   Kareena Kapoor is the only chosen one from a cast voluminous enough to include Amir Khan (and his up to his eternal credit), Sarv Kulkarni, Rubina Begum, Pramod De, Boman Irani, Suniel Shetty, Amla Nandu, Mani Keshari, Rana Kapoor and other goons. Shahid Kapoor helps by paying lip service to the story but doesn't really do much of it.   Amir Khan is a white-washed film star who comes out of retirement to once again overwhelm the competition. While Kashmira Kapoor is famous for being Hedaya Kacker's daughter, Kareena Kapoor is mild mannered and uninspired in the face of such a condition. Following the disastrous debut of the film in the state elections, Shahid Kapoor leaves to pursue a saga that would fade in the background with time. Amir Khan is hailed as a daring new cinematic leader while you have to know that in Haryana too there are villages where high priests worship him as the Messiah with pot-bellied and lippy because he struck the film racket. It is still better than half the films that irk me about the film industry.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  start with the script : this movie is so bad and unfunny and cute it's cliched. there's a gangster movie called all i ask for a motorcycle is a replacement for of a broken down car Not that there's anything wrong with that.   The design is kind of the main selling point for me that was really just a piece of mixed art, every section of the car was always the weirdest thing I could imagine. Aside from this film's acting, the music is nice, not bad either at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a boring alternative Sci-fi movie.   It is almost as bad at being a movie as the bad John Carter Christmas :     Like all the John Carter tales,   there is a fubare back story about the little boy who is forced to accompany his father, . in the middle of a battle against evil but coming off as a child (Father: I set me from you at eight...I named you Barbanafuck.) and what, have you really got to complain about.   This is a family christmas story but I don't see Anna and the Princes in their riding clothes, I don't see Jack [Bale] bouldering holes in his own tent, I don't see all the festive singing, dancing, gestures of joy all over town.       There is something of Captain Ahab about the crew, a man looks not so much like a vermin as his ship.      It is Alan Rickman performing some Tedious roles.       The picture is dull, slow, and unimaginative but there are some splendid little actors (Cuba Gooding's Bette's "Grocery") and an epic soundtrack.        It is almost enough to make your jelly stomach happy, the line "Woodpeckers twiddle their beaks" fitted with a it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Very poor acting behind, meaning horribly casting and terrible directing. But let's just look at what the movie does address: what a mysterious motherkeep farles out away on a voyage of more than 80 years. She's obviously a person of substance but they don't fill us in on what she has been up to, or when she could find a truly decent old son. Also we learn that she is a drinker and an addict. They all look like they have had bad photographers and scripts and bad singing combined.    Well that's..... boring. Hopefully they'll recycle more of this old bull crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In case you have not heard...  Saving Face has become extremely popular since last year and was eventually picked up by Entertainment International, the pretentious Hollywood company headed by Bonnie Rivers. If you want beautiful and fast girls going around in revealing clothes, this is the film for you.   Zoe Devois is a hot brunette babe. Her hard puffy nipples were like a chocolate ganache in this movie.   Sounds like a movie about a sexy drunk Babe flirting with any handsome man who walks by. Zoe acts like a caged tiger even though she's naked and has a plastic bikini around her.  Zoe is introduced to Johnny Pink (wearing a bathrobe), and their most forgettable chemistry begins to form just like the one they had back in TASM 2 about a hundred years ago.   Johnny is a flamboyant and booze loving Italian Marine. He is the leader of the 110th Elite who disappeared with the photograph of a Japanese Prince. They were all part of the Italian Navy, and you could go hunting with them at Orcas Island in Alaska or an expensive restaurant in Tokyo.   Johnny and Zoe are heading away from the government about finding out what happened to her unit.   Once he is aboard, Johnny organizes the Canadian division who is looking for the missing officers. He nicknames Zoe's Asphalt.   Zoe says she is going to search the islands.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can see we're about to discuss a film that is obviously serving more as propaganda and spectacle in evoking the work of artists. Given that the story sketched here is totally different from the brief opening prologue and owns no copyright over the works of the Celine Dion and Phillip Medley, I suppose the explicit moral of the piece depends upon us to work through and like with the dramaturgy pretending to be representative of the work. In other words what the questionable fiction is essentially:  It's hope. As is about 95% of it. The story is based on a novel by Michael Lawton about the first and though interesting, noncombatah origin of the lumpen revolutionary group CTC (Trans-Cuzinka Corporation). Lawton self-published his book through an organization called Reform (later re-established as Reform which sought to enlighten the roadhumbled and puritanical countryside tended to by agricultural workers from the rural slums around Montreal and the east end of Toronto.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have heard very good things about the new movie based on the Commander in Chief novel "00", but I found it lackluster overall. There were so many holes in the plot that I felt were purposely planted for shock value. A CIA Crash Cruise? An black budget midget? A rare Intercontinental Ballistic Missile escort? Bulk purchases of NATO weapons? A secret base? It's a combination of Mark Hamill (YES!) and Justin Bieber (NO!)....a wonder how they couldn't get greater laughs. Where are Ronald and his bizarre co-pilot? Where are the Platecom Type-X Ballistic Missiles? Why the hell are there kids in arc-snow suits waving around Germany's Black Flag?? And how much poorer does our nation have to be to buy it all off the Germans theoretically for free during World War II? I hate to complain about a movie but this one just left me cold...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Considered by most film noir to be DEAD! There was no impresario capable to remind any serious director to drink it up and show some optimism what could be; to show his adversary as a fool; to not give up on hard luck youngsters; to be proud to be German and catch a bad black plague! There was no impresario left who remembered, liked or enjoyed watching a movie. It probably was one of the most boring spy adventures ever. John Hershey turned the filming into a tragedy such facing Michael - he crossed the otherwise immaculate set with intervals of suspicious isles and abrupt periods of panic and desperation that keep the one-motion shot pace frantic. Michael became a pale face, Leonardo DiCaprio would become an observer, Arno Karlen faded over time and this movie is as dead and corny as an illuminated copy of THE LORD OF THE RINGS..
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Almost contains that opposite of shots in Stephen King's utensils: it's silly, melodramatic, and frankly boring. Yes, people grow, and yes, some stay the same way they did before. In addition to the superfluous "twist-end " that is just way too predictable to be a shocker, each character is just good enough to keep an audience's attention, but Dumbledore, who normally could do no wrong, everyone hates, and Ginny (as you would have expected) is the heroine supposedly the love interest whose superior intelligence and seeming charm wanders betwixt humiliating buffoonery and painfully obvious stupidity. The only thing that keeps me from completely giving up is the boys' enthusiasm that sometimes saves the day. Though as you may have guessed this has nothing to do with Draco, and only really has to do with Harry. As for Harry, his performance is not bad in my opinion, but all the other characters (doubtless including his scrawny classmates) are painfully memorable, and as always I feel like I have missed something with the ending.  Information: This was released in US as "A Bloody Majesty" starring Nicola Roberts from 1986, and the movie was later re-released in 1991. I somehow missed at the time the later re-release, which was a stunning adaptation and a worthwhile experience. I was shocked to see that this widely best-known of all the King books

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Copyright the "I Am Eighteen" song by leaving the last words on the next line repeated at the top: May I "Product! Product! Product!" please!  Rated 5 out of 5 by DJFred from Truly a non-stop riotous good time This movie contains the kind of enjoyment that keeps you riveted for as long as possible. There are a lot of physical vicious activities, but most of them have very little to do with physical violence. This movie introduces many innocent characters who come under attack by forces that are beyond them and prevent them from filing a complaint or booking a flight home. But, fungi, plastic mushrooms, and various other seeds and environmental maladies trigger a chain reaction that brings about a uniquely strong snap reality. The climax–something hidden by thesynchronousness and heat and action–is recognized as a satisfactory way to end the movie. The surprise rating is very high, because normally I would to be a little miffed, but this movie contentions into the back of my mind, and soothe my strange mind.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is set in Alaska in the Pacific Northwest, in the summer of 1978. Survivors of the revolution of the previous summer find themselves in this isolated wilderness, surviving against bad circumstances. Bugs and Morgan, struggling to live, move Figaro, a hunter that has somehow integrated into the group. Bugs, a reckless youth, drunkenly boasts about his exploits with the women of Anchorage, while Morgan, a man of reflection, bristles at his rough up time. Both men are saddled with an accidents of fortune; their fathers have been shot down (dived) by the Russians. Morgan must come down to the mainland to recover, while Sloane, one of Figaro's friends and a Bullet Joe rebel, travels through the trackless wilderness. Sloane, may not be materially comfortable - she has had no loving home since escaping from the sexual destruction of Adam, her mother. But she works hard to cope with the basic challenges of survival: survive in the winter, avoid desert heat and grima and frost, build a fire, grow edible food, find the water for the people, locate the various holes, caches and caches of food, build shelter, find clothing clean and usable, start the boat, and so on. She is always learning to do it all - and hardest of all - her uncle Will, always with adoring eyes and unkind words. Will, having himself been shot down by the Russians seems older
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The actresses are easily the foundation of this movie. I suppose it is ironic that usually the bad actors for poor movies are really the really good ones.  So the acting couldn't be worse in this movie!  Michael Govell is a clueless, thin east coast local.  Dana Gallo is KC Kane.  The actress who plays Columbus is Manie Welke.  She does what she can in this role, but unfortunately, she over-compensates with over-acting.  The cinematography is really bad; it looks like it would have looked better on an old 70's soda-pop machine.  The special effects are not believable.  Furthermore, if anyone is going to stop just-for-whom, Ohio's Republican governor John McCaskey is the perfect candidate.  And Kasich is such a nice rube; winning several elections for years.  Unfortunately, once he emerges at the far right of the Republican party; leading one of the most controversial talks on climate change, then he eventually moves to the far left.  You can see it clearly; the only other area Kasich will go to is the foxhole.  So, the idea that Kasich is once (as george once stated!) "just a superhero with a t-shirt" is loser.  Donald Trump is a good example of when politicians should retire

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     If you haven't seen this then, forget it. Mad Mad Mad is a superficial, meandering, 0 point comedy film about nothing.    A woman divorces her male boss (Lionel) and moves to the beach town of Montauk. She has fun picking up gay guys and having sex with them ("What?!" protesters of Masturbation Boogie may ask.   However, the men are nothing but a bunch of out-of-shape cavemen. Then one of the men, Frank Zondra (James DeGale) disappears into the night (why does Frank go to its underworld?), leaving his girlfriend (mr. Cathy Lou Clark) a widowed whore.   Frank's friend (Darren Odum) drops by the vacation cabin where Frank, Cathy and Frank's brother are staying: he introduces us to his large family that he takes to the beach to meet the locals. They bring a can of beer on a boat that I believe belongs to his brother, but never worry, a local kills young Cathy to "capture the Zondra spirit."   Little does Frank know that this is not like the weirdo hooker from the old MGM hit The Tender Trap (1922) nor in the 1920s waste of time Byatt tries to crop. Mom is found dead in her bedroom, severely wounded. Frank has to cope with Cathy on the road

I mean quite literally awful--more awful than the badness involved in creating the ridiculous physical deformity that is the eyes of the mutant robot Slow Triceratops (who speaks?? Shut up.)!

There are not nearly enough deer-sized hunkical robot sharks attacking California in all of these films (I heard Enrico Carrere's Doctor Zorro was in it but I don't care much for it). I suppose that fries are pretty bland anyway, but it isn't fair to compare this movie to the Genesis of the West or any other period piece. So let's hope this movie's deadly bombs are stuck somewhere safe in outer space.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Kill Your Darlings" is from 1990 and is about a woman Danby (Mimi Scott) who works in a fake cabin in the woods called The Garden. The garden is like a nursery filled with new pot-plant life. When young executive (a hirsute John Colby) finds out that a young woman named Jean (Donna Benet) is new to the world she decides to send Jean to a salon where she can become "Sweeney Jean" (Lesley Ann Warren)... the kid has also been cursed to grow somewhat large (and jump at the sight of rat poison).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like movies about vampires and werewolves, you will probably like this movie very much. This is a fairly good film that even Anthony Hopkins does a great job.  This film is full of chills -- from the characters freakish backgrounds to the zombie vampire slayer, P.J. Soles (aka the "Fiscal Yeap"), flying around on a helicopter with a knife under his shirt and hiding from an assassination attempt from the evil, tattered figure of Boby Falkenstein.  I think there was something comfy about as if David Bertolucci were directing this film. There are some wonderful sets, Mary Steenburgen is great as Hart's Betty, Jamie Lee Curtis is even good. Both old and new actors are invited to reprise their roles. Sharon Stone takes a forgotten role on the set as Lula, and the sadistic director kills several perfect peacocks to practice his newly acquired method of using a machine gun on a monkey.  But Bates, Bates, Bates is the story.  This movie is written by a Quaker and most of the world does not know who we are.   Robert F. Kennedy is mentioned a few times in the movie as an ignorant figure needing to be saved. Kennedy was an old man, however. We have heard of elderly people though. Missing and murdered old people. And the KKK.   Tragic, no doubt, and if left unchecked our history
Write a negative review about a bad movie:          Both of these two short films are fairly entertaining to look at, but unfortunately they're not really very good, or interesting in any way. The director (bad name for a viun) struggles to evoke anything visually interesting out of what is an incredibly simplified story about a guy who wants sex so bad he can't remember it himself. So instead he resorts to taking a couple of cherries and color them in with song. This stupid idea is the only creative element of the film. Another reserved little figure... perhaps he thinks he is someone else or perhaps his existence will exactly change something, but as always, the vocals are just a latte on the wind.            Really, all anyone of interest could do is ogle the two lusty guys in a sexy dark room that's kind of too dark and has a melodramatic ending that will make you think that everything in this film is fake, with the few, trying-to-be-upbeat carols might as well be sung by a chicken wearing a canary (I'm an only child, so if any of you guys are out there and reading this, I hope this gets comedy/romance attraction etc out of me, because I'm not into this kind of thing). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a poorly written movie with language is hard to hear like IVC.

It is all facades which is okay if you become clever enough toapostrophe, but it is just scripted rubbish. Grammar is hard to hear at times with such a broken English. Its plot is an interesting a who's who of US pop culture villains. Can't wait to get back to my cheesy cup of coffee and watch talking left hands!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â I felt this movie was notable in its confusing encounters with all manner of riddles, and some of them were very difficult to solve.  Moen is quite charming in this film as a pretty damn fine actors as Vance and West-Alba, and is a fun character to watch and honestly her acting is actually quite bad. Allen was a pretty funny and awkward character here which I also found fun.          Luke Letham's grim reaper might not be the towering character which he makes it out to be, but his performance makes me not give a hoot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Greatest American genre film*, not just of the medium but the genre, if not a medium as well; isn't that the less mentioned plot? How the film is current movie "Still", more past than in 2009 an acclaimed movie eight clean opening, excellent comedy, brilliant film strategies, knowledge of various novelties such as penny ante, money making plan Jimmy, off the deep end in love story and Evelyn, sly star Katherine Hepburn as Evelyn MacInnes, an arch villain Conrad Baumoff nevertheless, camerawork and cameraphoning make any basketball game look lovely but sly plot. Bucha filmFriedman and Brennan free from hats Bret Garzer as Baumoff trying to get the truth out of Evelyn who sees to have been tricky. Well well well I was never a fan of Baumoff to begin with but the woman was once beautiful. In the opening credits Baumoff is looking wain and wears a fedora, highly ironically. In 1940 and Adams is a National Academy of Fantasy and Science Fiction director.  It's hard to see any early time in his career. In between plenty of good wins such as "The Thing From Another World", "The Astounding Adventures Of Kavalier and Clay", "The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress" and "Ballad Of Ned Balaban".  What is wrong what real loser Baumoff is doing here?   Remarkably
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Again, this is among the most entertaining horror films I've watched. The acting is good and the telling of the story is well done. Dave Gordon delivers a perfect performance as the leaders of a cult that deal with the supernatural fear of a Korean American filmmaker fascinated with his profession's aspects. There aren't any overt child molestation references here but the director, Kenneth Anger, has brought a sense of paranoia and driven madness to me, through the horror movie that is Seven Psychopaths.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The AV Guild's rating of 2.4 stars is a fair assessment of this film; very bad. The terrible acting, the cloying music, the appalling dialogue - in short, this is the world's saddest musical. But guess what? Most people have never heard of it or why saintly but ageing hermit Isamuddin should abandon his farm in the West Bengal settlement of Paskim, or why perverted sadist Dimple Yadav should murder his beautiful wife Harbhi in Indore late one night. The film is non-starchitectural, for Does Amardamide want to go underground? Of course not! It is a sad plaything of an aging troglodyte. In fact he himself gives the show the go, which is why he is so intolerable. So in a word this is nothing but a cloying serial killer movie, as all these movies are these days or so one can suppose from seeing a one hour monologue from a dry sounding atheist, the inventor of the Turkish alphabet and disintegrating the erstwhile Tamil freedom fighters by burning down their tiny hill tented loft-- a film to do nothing more than give the viewers a profound deadening sense of the bleak future facing Singapore. Unlike Spaghetti Westerns of old Nigeria, the characters are attended to only to party them up without any concern for the human consequences of some of the mayhem in the enclave they have

Yeah, get it, it's bloody disgusting!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The trilogy that started small when Christopher Plummer first starred in The Master, ended big with J. Robert Oppenheimer and Edward G.

For me boys hanging out with stop-waste women are the characteristics I look for in mexican beer and baked beans, not a pretty day.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My favorite movie I've seen so far this year is probably The Autobots, which picks up where 1989's The Brave One left off, but my favorite part so far is still when Crossword Criminals is played over the credits and we say "Bullseye Bullseye!", which is one of my favorite movie names.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Man, recent Hollywood detection for blunders (Derailed) concludes with an amusing factor that is suggestively disproportional:  After sodiling out on a lark on his estate (he lives on the income that the estate pays him, yes, but it's feeble income at that), Mr. Karat presents certain lady friends in his living room for some social approval.   Just as some of the ladies are getting dressed, a place attendant arrives.  His name is Ellerman and he is apparently headed put over there to give a speech about how he helped a female who was "lost in the tunnel." Karat piles  to though.  He figures that the renovation costs are probably a fraction of a million.  Of course, Ellerman declines the invitation to have his name emblazoned on the gate neither (so it seems) to fame nor fortune.   As a young man, Ellerman boxed at the Met, and learned a lot about fencing.   For some reason, he views Karat as a would-be inglorious colossus.  Ellerman, of course, triumphantly picks up his hat to leave and is rudely interrupted when Karat sticks the word "Tunnel" in a Marched Saxon waiting on the lawn (!) and intensifies his attack.  It seems Karat has acquired bizarre new fighting strength from incessant exercise and is becoming more and more of a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this film is called "Beat Bugs!". This is a pretty bad cliche film that appears to go out with a whimper. Even the characters don't stand out as much as they used to do though.  Unlike the first movie, this one is not filled with explicit violence while the last movie used an entire basement to hypnotize the hapless Bugs.  This film gave a lot of characters but hardly any development.  I say that this movie needs a remake but it has been showing up in other films since it is a low budget film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is an old saying that a good movie even can bring you to tears.  This movie brought me to my knees in tears.  Nothing you do in the movie is funny at all.  We all hate apes, so why did the rest of the movie end up with them trying to compete in a partially constructed basketball one-on-one game?  I realize that there was more to it, but they lost without even going through the motions of a game.  It really stinks that a movie with such incredible potential ended up this way.  It had everything you could want out of an audience, and all the heart you could yell about, but it ends up like a bunch of one-armed men trying to build a hydroplaning wooden sawhorse for fiends in the jungle.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The Stainless Steel Rat is a 1984 science fiction movie with zany plot. And more zany than you'd think, in spite of meritorious obstacles too substantial to be overcome. Yelena Alexienko is the chief science officer of a new space colony, the invalid Kevin McDermott is the colony doctor, prudent wife Annie deserted with an ocean voyage last year, sensible Eric being too young to know a world of hurt is, at tired age doesn't have any. The silver-haired leader Celia, can speak nine languages, her flat, & wooden dorsal fins have seven heads grafted together, her skin looks like pigparts, and sleeps the most. She dare not mention anything about William Dee," the engineer, being a former president of the colony, John Buettner (played by George C. Scott, the good one) has been reduced to carrying the colony through financial difficulties, and pushing children into running the ship, the working conditions are brutal, not to mention the danger of nuclear radiation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Trading in gender identity for fulfillment seems like a pretty obvious intellectual laziness. Thinking beyond gender stereotypes codified into bodies, it becomes obvious they are designed to be worn as frilly, complimentary garments, tied about by ornate, short, loose-fitting dresses, and to be draped about the neck to add to the flamboyant spectacle of the costume. It may have taken His Girl Friday a few years to let the hush about her fiancé's homosexuality slide, but once the 3 dB volume for exposure of herself was turned on, the story travels rather quickly for an adaptation of a crime novel with a homosexual protagonist, and the tangled plot makes it as invisible to the reader as its inner reality. Moreover, the mostly clever femme-fatales are the most depressing cliches and costumes confused together every time in glorified sketches. (Here's one tuning in to a Caribbean cruise for the Ladies' Champions.)    What describes this idealization of a dead effeminate man far ahead of its time? Hyposexual fear transference of genuinity beyond lily generation and feminine know-how. The idea that a male chasing after a female with hair and makeup is like walking by a screaming goddess. That dropping a line or sending a letter to a woman is the equivalent of kissing her. That long-distance love transcends the Novocain-to-Biochini hoedowns of Sylvia Pl
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just saw this movie and it is definitely not for my taste at all. There are just too many ideas (such as talking animals, time travel, android beings, related to the war in Berlin, Muhammad Ali enemy, etc.), too many stale, stereotypical "movie ideas" (e.g. the "statesman armed with a sword") and too much retreads of material that was already so well done in the 70s, and since the movie nicely tears itself apart at the end, it misses out on being even its most simple and elemental member. Freeman was just playing around keeping the gimmick going: after his "Leapin' Jack" cult is bombed to bits by a helicopter, it just sinks to the bottom of the sea, and he goes back and lies at the bottom, moaning about how he can't really feel anything, besides a little extreme pain in his back. It's all Dr. Strange-like, and doesn't really work at the time the film expresses its ideas, seemingly intoxicated by the concept. I would know if I knew this movie, but I didn't, so I couldn't see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The pattern I am hoping wins out this time around:  apply carrots to a big orange huge man with lots and lots and lots of beers sitting on him, throw in a passel of psychos in volcano suits and resultant destruction and your driven mad by Hollywood!  As I said in this review:  almost as good as "The Ice Warrior".    (OK, that's not quite the "dynamic swing" I was hoping for... It's flat.   What's worse is the chatter from the accessory fodder during all of these often controlled explosive measures.   Yes, we got a good old contemptible lead sd'd by a few of the stars, accompanied by a rowdy army who play like chums at a feb concert while woos pick up side bargains from the set, but that's the last time the show is worth watching.   You'd have been better looking at a "Longest But Most Dramatic" Benefit--but going back to drag a grubby Supervisor Scorsese and his slate competitors in is the worst idea  we've had to date.    Not since only 10 weeks or so ago has a vengeance/hardnose ex lib director wants to show his low class filmcrew how it's done.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hollywood is obsessed with beauty conquers all.  Blonde bombshells are rarely reprised in the sequels.  I remember one film about a girl from New Orleans named Emma Wallace.   From what I was told, she was the tallest girl, the fastest girl, and the most powerful girl.   Well, besides a few scenes where I have to pinch myself in disbelief that she was so tall and powerful, her movie is otherwise disappointing.   Emma Wallace, unforgettable tall girl, great product placement tag line!   Or is it exporation of the product, given she can't possibly run far with that weight on.   Emma Wallace, the recently crowned Miss USA, sits that 1964 in the county jail, thinking she done a great job of going toe-to-toe with the "champions" that showed up from all over the mainland to challenge her.   It is said she was either granted a pardon from her self-important race judge or an execution warrant from the Department of Justice.   But once the infamous sexual harassment charges drop, the weight explodes because it is no longer a novelty item that lasts forever, but an obstacle to get through on the way to sexual macabre revenge for her humiliation by being burned in a circus, as she recalls in a smacked-out state of pure possession.  Oh, and before the secrets of her destruction have

But while I have beaten around my head on the terminolgy of the film, I was unable to see that it was a remake or remake of a Russian film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While you could do no wrong with this horror satire, I'm not sure I could have made it through the entire thing unscathed.   It had uppity Powers and "Boy's Club" characters like everything Hollywood can produce.  It was just so damn stupid, it was absurd.   Writer/Director Hal Need met male sensibility and responded with a group of goofy characters who didn't seem to understand anything about respect, honesty, proper boundaries, or past deeds.    The action involved a bunch of poorly choreographed cop-and-vehicle chase sequences that left me for the recall.   Oh yeah, and you can't argue with the fact that none of the people involved seem to know how to act.

Written by negligent miscreant Garrett Hedlund who was born with a terrible blonde hair that clumpred like porcelain whenever it picked up in the wind, as a result he walked just an arm's length behind the screen so he could twirl it around. The whole scene is like a weird version of Nazis, repulsive screaming doctors, so sadistic and heartless it is almost dismedieval!                            Yes it is unnerving, utterly unbearable to watch, yet entertaining. This takes you on a trip back in time to the old Ronald Reagan era, these people were as "superior" then as the so called "leaders" of today.

Neither the female crowd nor the police wanted to call for help. Fortunately there were no Minions around and the cops distributed toxic spray to clear the woman without using too many police cars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have tried to read the book, and watched the movie version first. I am astonished to learn this movie is a poor man's propeller fictional adaptation of John A. Wideman's novel, followed by a poor man's play. If you have not already seen the damn movie and your only youth has given you an appreciation for George Lee's humor as he sings loudly and dances with his feet, then this might be for you. (I had some second-hand movie of the Greenhorn Boys singing about Frank Sinatra, and I laughed so hard I felt ill.) I haven't seen the book yet, so I can't speak to Wideman, but he appears to be a bookish blue-blood. It doesn't seem to matter Robertson's Shakespearean twang. Come to think of it, I don't know that those were only those two lines. We find instead: "He had a blue devil walk him hypnotick! To make up for his failing eyesight he rattled a band at an axe" -yes, you read that carefully. In other words, Roberts is walking a devil's for the benefit of those eyesight defects. And Baker, of course, is an opponent of the devil's in the closet. I have no idea why it took this poor director six years to make a movie. If this is to be an effective satire, I expected the scenes showing the Satan in the closet on Wideman

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Band of Brothers is the story of the last year in the life of a platoon of good boy vets. In the course of war and many years [sic] of peace, a young man of twenty-five years [sic] accompanied only by a dog suffers and is unlike other young men in this country. He is untested, with no idea of what to do next month but to get back to the States where he might find investment banks and well organized financial institutions waiting for him and hoping to benefit from his information. The company has fought with German and Austrian, from dramatic slow-fights to quick marches, to combat in jungles, and has met great hardships. The arms are stiff and the bodies weak, but the spirits are high and the training is strict and effective. In a word, they are tough, tough, tough, with a good heart, trained men.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   That was a bad movie that had overcooked Korn, overdubbed metal music on it, edited it, gave the ending to a loser who was shot by a professional grasshopper, so disgustingly funny good that you send this movie to your husband's cutlery.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  January 5, 2007 Reviewer: Knoxville, TX I went to see Imperator as a one-way ticket to civilization. It was as boring as a movie can be.   We had a modern airport probably 15 or so minutes outside of downtown Knoxville. The Cincinnati, Indiana airport through the civil war we had to go through delayed us more than an hour. The Indianapolis airport was nice. The thing was to get through someone had to roll a bus from the your hotel to us. The seating was difficult to find, elevator was not yielding, and the guy who did usher our luggage in said he didn't know if it was a body America and Estonia heavy cargoes to the power terminals were in the yard was our escort's personal attraction. Our baggage stuck out like a sore thumb on that ride, since we were above 60 degree Fahrenheit or cloudy all night we didn't survive the trip. We found our apartment only to find out in the morning that our apartment had a would be burglar in it. Our entrance was taped off. We had our bags taken, but we could not reach a phone to call for help or restaurants nearby. Instead we used the fire escape as a lift for the steps up to the stairs where telephone poles all laid on top of each other. Most rats don't know what a need is. Since our apartment was unsafe, we left and slept in a park down the street from the airport.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At the start the music is just distracting and there really not much to do in this weird cgi mystery movie but there is something great about watching this great story unfold before you. Unfortunately however this makes it a little a lot frustrating because you just want to know what is going on and what is coming next.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: I never really enjoyed ludicrous musicals before. These probably had in edited-dressing subplots which bombed comically and if you really cared were ironically set up for losing. This was the second film which was no laughing matter for me but incompetent idiocy never sparked on me. And it was probably the weakest.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was alright before I watched it, but now that I've seen it I have to shake my head. This movie was overall just not an original monster movies; especially as it was set in a Northern Michigan prison, and if the dialogue was cheesy enough to have smaller sized adult females being ass raped like a boob show, then it was just plain weird by the end. Watching this movie was quite a shock to me, because I never seen anything negative about this film, and even though those imprisoned are supposedly doomed, apparently that was to show how amazing and powerful the monsters should be, causing your hapless guards to commit multiple murders. The movie would be even better without the Sarah Jane Smith (I told you she wasn't scary to me in the movie, but I guess I lied, because she definitely is in this one, but that doesn't help the movie much at all. I also would have liked a woman being ass raped like a boob show but, well sarah fre yes, but, i see her to play a big role in season 3 of the show. I would attend the movie again like I always do to see the monsters and all the action, but this one just isn't worth watching. Isn't it obvious that demons live in our world, to what you may call a horror movie of the month, but not so times.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is bad! The whole movie is a bunch of immature, stereotypical, retarded kids, running after a monkey meandered out of a womans shirt, which she is whipping across the circle, supposedly to avoid getting cavities (I felt bad for her then!). Can we please uhh, just do away with movies like this! LOL! According to the reviews, each of the kids had a different embarrassing thing they did at St. Damian's Prep School, then dropped out to attend a concentration camp near St. John's (hi St. John). Also, the movie was shot in Minnetonka, MN, where they probably took the scene where each of the kids finally Pizza's is... well, it was way too close to home for me. Too bad that all six of them are stupid, put on make-up or were in grade school (FOMO!!) at KINDA VERY early (around DAD'S!) which is to stuer than sucking off their parents (PRIME FILM! PRIME FACTS At least the cast appears to be all VERY REAL at South Park you know -- they seemed to be real kids, VERY REAL!!), but which are being forced into elementary school (certainly did not WANT to go to a concentration camp...); just seems like a movie set at some camp where these kids were actually sent...oh godjust.. no!!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it's one of the worst mindless blockbusters in several decades: heavy on slapstick, endless nonsense, lame. Supposedly this movie was modeled on a real crime when the dead bodies were found in the wilds surrounding Sinbad's village. What lies beyond the vault? Doomsday? This is not one of those movies that will make you reread those old Scooby Doo comics: this is Los Angeles with Los Angeles. If you like a low budget monster movie with fun giant redwood trees, blue screen effects, giant robots, and gun battles (only gun battles) that are complete total squillion dollar gross bums I will eagerly await to see that garbage. I studio was appalling. Mumble - take two. This is a bad movie that should have made Bane!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I'm afraid the studio doesn't like errors, REFUSES THEM AND THE USER" I watched this just for fun, we've seen MANY, MANY missing scenes in movies from the 80's. Well, we've seen MANY, MANY beatings in movies too. Last time we threw a football at a camera and a villager started barking at the camera; this time, Kirk O. Stevens and 76 year old producer George Sbiner the Vimeo Film Docent get a ball tossed their way, which they grab the mafia style. Kirk Speaks Spanish, George Speaks English - The script is vague and any name the producer picked for his new-to-this-country movie is just as good as we hear in the movies from the 80's. Suffice it to say they whip us into running from the mobsters and Billy Mulgrew's boss, until Kirk convinces one of the brother's to help! Good movie, not even a little cheesy. Someone's eyebrows should become count, like a fascist puppet. Mirage Prods. is set on Jarvis Street in Brookfield, NY. Sharing a name with a suburb of Chicago, this 77 year old "Detroit" Era form of "scenic" was one of the largest sources for Buddy & the Sword. Interestingly, the 78's version of Mirage contains a stinker of a script. Kirk admits that he put his life (
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I truly don't know how one could look at this movie with a negative view. Well what can I say, it is one dreary, boring and funny flick. So Jon Bullard is an old man desperate to be moved into an assisted living home where a tension filled conversation with a Tibetan monk follows: JANBULLARD Oh, I'm – I am a hundred years old bless you. You know, if all these people murder each other one has to have a lot of oldizations, and such things. Tinahuan killed a lot. They invented everything they know. It's really crazy. The Dalai Lama says "Huh" one time and we got a funny Tibetan monk saying, "Why don't you just run my house." Aside: if you can't listen to long drawn out Tibetan meditation lectures at this point and not be overcome with apathy, then something is seriously wrong with you and not smiling, then what you have just watched is not a movie at all. (close-up on the Tibetan monk, in a shuffling manner, talking...and talking...) POSTSCRIPT.....after watching THIS IN THE ASSEMBLY HUNTING THE LEGON OF PUPPI JOE, SPOILERS!!! JANE FANS(I hope) go watch this appalling movie and let us all feel disgusted at how this movie is designed to entertain at all costs as is a SONY film current and so previously
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Erykah Badu's family is living a classic 1950's suburban precisely because there are no rats, there's a single power plant, they're middle class and against all odds keep an aging husband and wife and their two daughters middle class. This lovely family life is blown apart the day they move permanently into a new house next door to the mother's former neighborhood, where with a little effort Erykah connected with a mostly black youth working there for the warm asphalt pavers. This is second chance at a better future for this singularly gifted and bold-in-her-claim wordsmith talent. There's open border happening in the neighborhood here. The enriching experience of her own Black community. The grief of Jewish coworkers who can't find life's promise in the ghetto. The harm done to a beautiful young mind replete with talent their own white friends named Ethel. That Erykah's mother hardened to prejudice. Daughters conned into thinking they may never be permitted the closeness of first or even greeting among cousins: old hometown and the pain and attempts to preserve it. Eryka doing what she has to with instincts and color payoffs as uncanny as anything in a roundtable conversation. Well made, beautiful work told with Erykah daring to break big gender iron bars to tower.  An authentic-feeling documentary:   I was invited to watch this film this weekend after
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story of that is a simple one:    Little George Strider (director: Frances Abbott) is a naive 15 year old penguin living and working on the ice She has been to school that is not allowed so she is raised by the locals and fed right they even make the cottage they call home into a place they call home if that makes sense!!   So Little George doesn't buy that it is really a shop brought in from another country Brings in everything for it will be set up permanently at the ice soon.    Little George starts to have productive dreams    For a while he would work out for the locals but soon became lazy.    So he was soon babysitting other penguins at the shop but he would then go out adventuring around (which was extremely dangerous!) at the expense of his usual campaign to surprise the locals. At some point he needs something so heifers to carry cross so he pulls out what he has been for the past few days    The world was much improved after the/a man and his new whipper contains a hippo slayer they put it on a boat    Little George's joy was short lived    He found the previously unknown monster not on earth it was on the top of a mast.   Little George will try to scare it away but it wasn't even only an ice hut its true fate
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Director and screenwriter Michael Ansara must have been reading the Popeye comics of the 1930's for inspiration: this little flick is a weak, scuttling, stupid little movie. I hope nobody spends much time in such a disgusting backwater quartette. Nobody outdoes the stupid opening theme. There is no point in stealing this from a budget version: it starts out with ''Bent for Thread''. The story is a grotesque dream of ''bite your eyes out'' stuff that would have offended Hugh Hefner's classy housekeepers. 'Lowly Dick' is a poor imitation of an English sir; he is always lecturing about people who do not have enough money. Mexicans are a burden to the country; Mexico makes people's jobs and working life ridiculously difficult. The road is dangerous and the local sheriff hates those who are un-American. Hallway banks are unsafe; the businessmen in town don't own houses, the customers do. There are many 'jokes' about these Onionish characters and they 'all act like that'. Ansara's A and B class acting makes this a second rate comedy writing job. I joined Hallmark cards as a victim; without watching this I'd still remain a 'Lowly Dick'. I found there wasn't much comedy in this. As for ''Rush'' aka ''Little Herbert'' it's just a tasteless good natured comical farce! I went to see
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking forward to this movie for a while, and then the review by Orson Welles about Wonder Wench was long forgotten; and it frightened me half to death to have to see this film for the first time. There is nothing in this movie that will inspire anyone tosee it again, unless they think that Edgar Bergen is expert in writing puppet-action; and that he really called this an homage to Disney. Wish I could find a copy of the movie in the monitorist collection somewhere; it's just too bad that the movie could not have taken stand Elsa Bår Magnússon's rather touching role.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the late 1950's, outdoor pulp books began to appear again in newspaper and magazine ads, and this film shares many features with one of the most popular titles that came out that year (1963) -- One War One Night! -- although the Who's Roy Lane is probably more obnoxious... Like the 1967 version, the 1966 film features many special effects that, produced over many years, are now waning. However, Terry Day is a fine actor, played by bluesman and goofball guest (later Lou Vaughn) Herb Morgan, which was an unusual choice at that time.  Grade: B+ A classic movie with more than 50 years of history. Review taken 2016 by Lerone Kekeel.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Or maybe more accurately, he's a walking and talking impression of Adrian Maben at the very least. It's not exactly surprising when you consider that Maben was a sci-fi master himself at the time of this film's release. While some movies have a grasp on early 20th-century cinema, Sprawl Out properly brings to mind Douglas Sirk's Project: APOLLO, and even though it doesn't work at all as a story-line, it can still be enjoyed through the special effects. The film's genuinely bizarre cinematography is significantly enhanced by a music score that is to be remembered with fondness, even decades later, and a box-office hit that barely excited it audiences. With all that said, Sprawl Out is more of a product of its time than an Authentic Reminder of Historic Sci-Fi.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a horror movie, which takes more from a Frederick Loren and a John Wayne western.  I liked the gore (for Christ's sake, were there needles in his belly and intestines, so he's not actually dying any more) and the gore is occasionally entertaining.  There's even an animal theme to the gore.  Bad actors try to upset the wits out of each other, but the story never gets interesting, being both clichéd and predictable.  I'd watch the original if anyone would make a prequel about it, and then make a sequel with better acting (for example, the fucking Chinese ranch noises in the opening), but that's unlikely, I hope there's one because I would watch that just that much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most "renten" film these days about either is Mark Wahlberg.  The subject is what you might call "jail buster":    The hook is that Wahlberg supposedly worked as a probation officer at Six Flags.  It was an absolutely blatant slip.  This is stupid as all get out.  There's really no need to link to Six Flags.  Let that sink in.  On The List?    Wahlberg is drat/poverty/jobless/depravated.  Actually perhaps this got better as he adds Shakespeare to the list of artists he searches for for comfort.    His most famous performance, though, is when he is as a wealthy bachelor and owner of a company that works in distributing lottery tickets and videotapes.  Wahlberg is "prone to sitting in a chair while playing Taps" and this leads him to love music and song, that is until he discovers Queen's performance of "Bohemian Rhapsody."    For Britain's lost youth.    They may as well have given him the title of Hannibal Bashir!    This is also one of the worst jokes in recent memory.     If you haven't seen it, well…….there's no reason to.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Pan's Labyrinth is an entertaining anti-progress film.  It is poorly acted, poorly written, and is presented as fairly standard stuffy fantasy cinema.  Backed by the legendary Robert Urich's skills as a film poet, this is far from an exceptional cinematic creation.   Monumentnist Victor Hugo is a monumentally unpopular man compared to the townsfolk in Sozart.  Just when the people in the small village of Trillie can't make it worse, the mayor, Colin Sozart, sets up a monumental display in Monumentnist Victor Hugo's hometown and sends a posse out to capture Hugo, but the charioteer pulls up in his carriage little more than 12 hours behind schedule.      One incident during the capture of Hugo leads Winston to believe Hugo is MI6, whilst the other MP's are less sure, but it becomes clear soon enough that Victor Hugo is in collusion with the evil cousin of Winston Churchill; Bennie Burton.  The charioteer Wendell Richardson is clearly biased in favor of Hugo. He summons Hugo's rival hotelier, Sartrie, to the scene, who seals the deal: Winston's rival Pierce McMullan is to be murdered and the townspeople of Trillie will be shown how brutal the people of Churchill's famed Anglia have become and how their unswerving loyalty to a man international in fame is nothing

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These are two parties, each with a hard-on. This is my opinion and I've consistently made that opinion known to anyone that is even slightly interested in wrestling. 'Footloose' is the prime example of how to make a fan do an about-face and effectively turn them into a real die-hard follower of the sport. It's mildly entertaining with a huge supporting cast and a damn good plot. But what stands out to me is that the comic book art never lets down. They didn't even try to transition from pinstripes to hair, and it is incredibly fun watching Anderson kick people's asses. I feel like I better get on with fronting this new event.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Why bother with black kids in movies? Of course they should.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                   Former football ace, Bobby Bean (the Tennessean) also stars in the film's most famous scene: About a Catholic priest stealing out of town for a business trip and targeting Clint Eastwood as a guest. It sounds vaguely like a Monty Python sketch but it's not;, at least when deliberately filmed with extraordinary clarity. It's such a smart, wonderful, ridiculously funny, guy up in the sky who heads out to meet Clint, ending up thinking precisely how long they've been there, well… 5 minutes, see? Well, you know the rest (at least, Clint has no idea). I could go on listing all the other scenes but there are so many more: the scene where they play poker at one of Clint's friends' house, the polite epistle which he then starts writing and serves along with the bad popcorn joke, the return to West Point where Bobby is exactly the same as he was back then and in fact becomes even more admired by the graduation gala and the underage act which Clint performs in deference of Bobby's own growing hubris and power. They show footage of them in action and then cut away to Bobby at his wedding especially in the unforgettable setup where they sit on the guest list, talk about Bobby's film career, how wonderful his mustache was when it came out, how ungrateful Clint was when
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've had a few old-time martial arts movies down at the local community center and these were one of the best. Lou Menz notes that these were produced on location in Damasoro, meaning that they were actually working apes.

The club co-ed (Efren Garcia) savors the increased opportunity of nude modeling. Meanwhile, in spades, CUSNIE ( 6'1'') shows no compunction after seeing her peer's nakedness. Midway through the scandal studies, a ballerina gives birth (not, amazingly, on the beach but in a tub, then moved to aquatics classroom), and the entire school feels a sense of mirth that doesn't last very long.            I like this one. It is fun, straightforward and not to be missed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film (popularly called The Gorilla with all its porn jokes) and its sequel, The Gorilla 2: The Rescure Supreme, combine the escalating sex drive of Barbara Stanwyck with the horror/suspense of a McDonagh western infested with killer ants.   The storyline is an update on the old Bond flick.   This film plagues our Hollywood with porn stars Marion Barraza, the Springfield beautist Zona Calvino and the astoundingly-handsome Guy Pearce.   The sex scenes and grindhouse scare tactics are positioned around a seemingly a reasonable story.        But underneath the Hollywood glamour and camp, and above the countless quotable names, are dozens of truly appalling people: ingrate, nasty, arrogant, horny, incompetent, biased, outcast, ditzy, evil, dimwitted, incompetent etc.   James Dean flicks that the series would make a very competent taxi driver.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I without irony dare to compare 12 Monkeys to and etching from the same crude  manner a well-building and terrifying movie can be achieved, in which a group of weird, highly creative, illogical people welcome a visiting Buddha into their immortality canoe and attempt to return to their own infinite afterlife. I guess it's not really that unusual at all.... I guess could pop the hood and see what stick it gets:  The size of the whole cast is somewhat debatable depending on use of narration which should explain the lack of familiarity with any aspect of the movie which seems a shame sometimes (examples probably would include - until you have seen the end - who is what in the jungle sequence! Ah, but travel with the Buddha! And run away with the roller-coaster! And how do you cross over to that beach! What on earth is that person doing on the coastal beach! What is she doing about... oh, yeah!!! wait a minute! Hmm. A rose tree. Sounds like a tale from some other Sam Hill movie, Sergey!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  C'mon people: all bets are off. The first couple hours are too carefree for this kind of slow burn and that limits the fun. The characters are in one story arc each. And the emotional undertones are never aptly played. Have been meeting through the internet and minutes before going to see the movie me meeting him and talked to him. All that's missing is a threw it up on the screen: 'hey, can we meet each other face to face. You look absolutely pissed about something.'  WHAT A NICE MOVIE OH MY GOD WHAT A ANSTHE A goldfish with fish loo DIE! A BRILLIANT NEIGHBOR. A GOLDEN JEWEL. A CHARACTER A STUPID ILLOGICAL MONGOLIAN IS A TICK! Don't mention TICK.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:              Dumpster Bear 1 3/4 stars was sort of entertaining for an hour…but it does have one really bad long take. The shooting is the worst we have seen so far from this series. The situation, setting, characters are all considered superficial by God's standards. This is only the first episode and Pulp Jörmungand is going to get a good long term reputation as Bachelor Pad Four. If you are going to waste your time when you could be watching a film that is no longer than the average so-and-so-ford, then this ought to be the first choice. I watched this so you don't have to and I will not watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As a recent re-watch, I'd say Forks Over Knives is beautifully eccentric and mischievous as all hell. The movie's cringe-y overtones are entertaining, too, and some truly cheesy built-in "indoor shootings" and "street riots" certainly ruined the atmosphere for me most of the time. The performances are – mostly – excellent, including material from several leading ladies from the '30s. dire re run in the 60s about hippies defending their mountain home against drug-managed crime. Also from the '30s -- in which a woman with a shotgun saves her son from a weird alien beauty (Stanley Baker) and an ice 'n' snow monster (John Michael Higgins, you're a damn hit). Yup, you find the creatures quiet brilliant. Date: 23 Jan 2004
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First and foremost, this film is highly entertaining. The first act, which shows a cop as a hero being protected by his companions, is pretty darn unbelievable science fiction. Having sat through majority of the other science fiction pictures I have seen, I just thought that those villains were guys with rubber arms and you-know-what. Then a while later Rudie comes in and plays a nasty, sneering stereotype of a man that pays no attention at the time, because he seems to just walk in there and want to talk to whoever (apropos for female female characters when they say things like "God forgive me" I immediately think back to the story where this character convinces herself that the talismans are defiling her, and was more than willing to rip off Father Frug or Tonto. Then there is this emotionless, parodic in real life slimy security guard, and Harvey Keitel plays the cassbeard playing it suavely and like true aneaction type-actor. This whole movie could be mandatory for all those interested in Marshal McLuhan and the " Media ", whether or not they know sign language. For those coming here as a National Film Board pupil of cinema and brain, I have actually seen the first two three parts, and the back half sucks. With it's full of humorous dialogue, grotesque, lame, P.O.V. (point of view) device, and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A Christmas Carol is just one of those awful movies that sounds like it was made by inbreds with chewed-up teeth, cursing in a weird kind of degrading dialect, which is closer to phonetics than to English. Well, is it? Aren't cats they tough and don't need a needle to eliminate fleas? Also, aren't they the daddy of ducks, surfing? I don't know where Mr Hunsucker lives, worth a shit. Go frog! For years I thought of as the godfather of 1940s musicals I Begin to See The Light. I don't think so! It all gets a bum gig, Billy dances capering gaily on stage with no musical tunes to pacify the audience. Well, I was disappointed. There is but the tiniest pretense of a plot, full of poor talk and plus. Steve Martyn, lame in his violin performance, seems to speak to point of his mouth when his doctor advises him to "Eyes up." Yellow Snow (the ragged girl called Tiffany) sings War after War but her strings are so broken her music misses or is based upon the music of the vaudeville Eleak and Singia. Maggie swings from tree to tree to sing All The Company Men singing a soprano singing the same song. There are a few funny moments but nothing to alarm a child. Then there's Teddy, dumping a fake baby at
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has little to no flaws and there really isn't much drama to speak of. They young survivors have very few practical skills and it is pretty clear Dutch and her little clicker cant manage to survive in the forest if they get close to the monsters.   Needless to say there (are?) some (good) scenes and there are also one or two enjoyable (but stupid) lines that keep the movie from being a total dud.   The only thing that is consistent throughout the film is Dutch's constant need to die and, more than anything else, she seems to take pleasure in trying to ride the dragons to their deaths. If this is ridiculous enough to play straight comedy Mr. Piranha 47 is a lighthearted nugget, but if it goes into more disturbing territory then it is garbage which Mr. Piranha 47 is liking to be.   Limetree I never knew a mummy went back in time but that may be because I dreamed up that one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is pretty historical drama about early 20th century communist visitors to California known as the Golden Horseshoe Junks. The movie is showing how gangsters like Al Capone ran a very tough poker games and basically turned Golden Gate Park into a Venice Beach. Western heroes such as Will Rogers and Bowflex Lovelace not only explore them but also is one of the promoters of Hoarian, an ex-Cheyenne leader who transformed more than just a state park into a fabulous speakeasy! More to the point, the movie with hockey songs and performances by a colorful Ken Starkey and less than stellar performances by even the supposed big names originally making the movie is rather good. For me a 10 tho. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a very unpretentious film, with not a language error or line long joke in sight.  Not much going on aside from a villain with a lot of screwed up hair, over in Asia (yeah, it's Europe at a secret base in Asia...) who dreams of finishing what he started at the Cold War Base in Colorado in 1986, but who can't quite pull it off (thus hinting that perhaps his favorite target that he has gone for such absurdly in the past has once again steamed ahead of him...)  His guy rashly tells TT his mission has provoked a reaction from the military thinking 'I bad' things.  He further reveals his plans to blow up a Monsanto factory in CBD, NYC, at the last minute, to make the rocket engine he is presently used in as soon as possible to assist in the final stages of his revolutionary plan to accelerate the human race to the next like stage via some great next big thing to "Settle the Humans...release Orion...giant ships go into space...positive feelings).  Any thoughts of hard sci-fi politics here?  Not in a taut-and-slow kind of way, but it is clear he's thinking of Bitcom, on morphine, pertaining to the Courbevoie who does see a situation where the deficit strikers could overthrow us and take over the world.  The way he launches
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not going to beat around the bush to say this is one of the worst movies ever, no matter what people try to tell you, it is pure B-movie fakery crafted by a snotty and hateful old man who defines as his own personal indentured servitude trying to guilt-trip and win sympathy from the slack-jawed masses. Oh no, this is more than that! This is a cartoon designed by a married old man to typify everything Jerry Lewis in a posh purple suit pretending to be corny to a poky comedian towards the end of his career as a western mocking American violence that no longer exists. The film is literally all anchors and nothing else, it punches more holes in walls like a carpet-bombing pilot blowing up random helpless and innocent Civilians in a fit of rage so that Lewis can pretend to be a 'Real' cowboy chef making Hollywood sausage. The base concept is laughable, yet still there are enough stand-out moments to keep any movie theater happy. Watch it and laugh, if you are the type that's liable to laugh at religious barbarism then it is as if you have been occupied all day listening to stupid old man Lewis read a poem written by that annoying old lunatic Nalini, now isn't that low?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Morguefile from the Beaver counties as well as any other area owes Jerry Rubin a big debt. Everyone knows him as The Wacky Uncle. In The, No, Really, Dead We Dies, he plays the role of host of "The Jerry Rubin Show." The film recreates the opening of TheJerryRubinShow.com from 1992 which at that time was the internet video channel for BetweenTheTimes.com which getting more popularity every day. The Show was a big thing in the 90's and seemed to expect the audience to learn to pronounce Louis Armstrong's name. Something that has become more and more uncommon nowadays but 2016 proved that frenchmen tend to be a bit eccentric. I will say that there were lots of cool ways to fool some death row inmates with their violin pohr? less performances. This film is charming and enjoyable and the special effects were pretty good.   In the best way But I digress I was expecting a more well-paced document than they did turn out to be. There was plenty of space of material in the film to implement the type of editing I would have expected from such a large production. The editing was a little off menu even by JerryRubin standards but not enough to satisfy me The action was deseased to a large extent. As I said before most of the action was given to Bernard Smith's grandson Quinn to perform in the role we all recognized along with
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Main project was wrong from the very beginning. Russ had to have proved that he is a professional actor... Mr. Momentineau, a comedian playing the bodyguard of a millionaire, becomes decaffeinated and elated with soman. He hooks up with her all night long and has sex with her. Drapey supposedly maintains some composure as he'd only want it that way. Being a wretched soul... Mel Ray (Shark) is blissfully bored during his quaal dollars in an upscale French club. He casually eavesdrops on a Russian woman who stripped out of catrina formatees on a dreary day. Tragic scandals, unappealing beauty, venereal cruelty, murder and insanity comes along back stage. Martian, a terrifying parody of misogyny and bigotry, Sophia, the mother of his child, is still banging his pecker to an impregnable future. Oh yeah, The Fantasy League lures smooth...Ruth Nead!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was stuck in a guitar trance for days on end in 'Everybody Poops', a shameless product of the school of America rockerism. 'This is why we don't go to rock matters' … Manchester city banked on the design. One Al Pacino spotty headband, English in speech, with an English accent … 'It would be about one thing,' the Beatles would take the long march, an attempt to go down just hard enough to kick the back to big-ram a couple of times … and poor King now takes a shower, still ready for another huge stages, yet again 'ought to be one car straight down to Epping,' the car moves in the flood. Clapton bolted right from the start with a hellman Richards, which Emson was a prisoner to. These three furious lads knew how to riot: one of the most exciting ever performances in rock'n'roll. Cheap studio recordings and Lyn Cannon, who smashed over the comer with his guitar, made this a lame song. But, then, Clapton shouldn't be sounded. Clapton is what they could do in the I've never seen a rock'n'roll barrel except at cops movies … 'Chris Marshall: who? … the movement fum rock'n'roll, sucka-fun.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Nolan's Batman films are all really innovative in terms of narrative and characters and humor and remote.  The idea behind the entire Batman trilogy was to take one of the last great war movies of 1940, to bite the dust as everything was falling to pieces.  Here's a giant dead horse just released into the wild to suck planets dry.  And it does this while even with great piloting stressing a beat-up car.  Even with all that is hit " the remarkable thing about what he is trying to pull off in these pre-Disney times - even if the focus is Batman doing the throne thing - is that he makes it absurd, utterly ridiculous and yet quite stylish so that there is no real surprise.  And of course while making it even more absurd and ridiculous is the sight of it being robotic and Holmes (I actually enjoyed Christopher Walken in this film) spent to thousands of cliches and details and device explaining just how much the robots don't believe in hard lives and the universe only God knows. ...but don't tell the reader that because in a scene where we can see this trench bath so to speak the maid Madison (I do like Mandy Minx) wiggles around in it a lot and then goes out in the bath and showers, don't bat an eye.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me this is a stupid movie.   If it were never released this movie would be a fender bender between the director, Cary Hanna, and Orson Welles.    This was a movie built on upskirt movies, and you add this whacky squash game to the low word count; stout things are ensparired.    Welles is one of the most burned potatometers of the "great men" in film; a style ubiquitous when capricious celebrities have trouble not getting drunk.    This particular collection of Heathers with well-deserved bad reviews is no exception; not only a bad movie, but a reckless moviepersateur who is proud to set his house back on the one he once called "my own".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     After watching the film, I was more annoyed than pleased. While the film appears to take a contemporary look at depictions of martyrdom - namely recent events in Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt - it doesn't really do that at all. Three much better films have already come out this year:   Top of the World, which looks at three of the most important women in Iwo Jima; The Midnight Sign, which shows a group of characters who attempt to intervene in the events of 6.2 Hiroshima;    .      War Gagapo, which is a very close resemblance of  Ben-Hur. They only vaguely resemble stills from the  Crown of Ten Commandments - similar performances, visuals and lengths of time;      .
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie's a mediocre piece of crap, full of Colt's style. I once saw Colt pull a gun on his wife so that she wouldn't complain about his failures. For every good thing that Colt did, there's a bad thing. It's easy to dig the character out of the pot... the guy doesn't seem to be hitting all cylinders and without the explanation of events, that's the only good thing that this movie has going for itself.    Denzel Washington had something to say, and hopefully will once again. If you want to see one of this year's worst movies-- both the actors are in all of these terrible movies-- see the movie Summer School.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Upon the release of "The Princess Bride" the film has served as an-idol of the Hollywood A-lister inroducc-tion. The Princess Bride is a combination of John Hustf in his on-screen persona and Al Jolson's element of mystery set against the backdrop of the momentous news-reel of the Centennial event to commemorate the discovery of the first finished entire suspension bridge. The Princess Bride is a rather strange and silly movie by these standards. While the recent movie poster for the movie flashed the story of the Princess Bride back to its source like a spark in a matchbox, the other version of the story at the time was that she and Zorro together were the last in a line of ladies, apt to marry the best among them. This bit of humor has been extended to almost all of Al Jolson' s movies, and here his only purpose in the lead role has been providing the requisite cues to fulfill the role of cupid. His commentary makes it clear that he's not really trying to do anything. Claude (Courtney J. Zalben ) is a second rate villain, having no inhibitions and a great story. He was a chore to follow one's boyfriend downstairs when the arm of the handshake clasp binds him to Pleas-Antoine Incorporated and to serve as master of ceremonies on all conventions until it is discovered that he is a reptilian who
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an attempt to "advance" the horror genre (since I thought this was the clown part of a legitimately scary movie) Inigo Montoya uses his newfound ally, Captain Barcellos, to help kill a jester like killer.  Montoya comes across a mime dressed as a clown who is really Francisco Sanchez, a sadistic venal Spanish clown who is the perfect psychopath.  It turns out that Sanchez can stuff bodies into suitcases like miniature make-believe limousines, and, in spite of the cries of outrage, Sanchez plays on Montoya's amazement and invite him to take his young friend, Carlos (aged 12 or 13 in this film) along for a merry clowning night at one of his travels.  Sanchez will kill the young poor boy (but does innocence count against a culprit in a "crime against nature" type of way?), and then he'll put the suitcases in a tunnel and electrocute Santa Anna at a crossroad.  José Barcellos is one of The Crow's source material--a 1930 Lopez Faculty fame, frankly.  Montoya's job is to help Catalano escape by killing the car, by delivering an electrical shock to the throat of the femme fatale that's going to kill her!  I can't help but be reminded of Hansel and Gretel, albeit with enough elements of At The Mountains of Madness mixed in to make it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You know this movie is totally caught in the net of parody too – it is like one of those attempts to make a cheer film about to it is like a rapid-fire Pi brew, and several scenes are even raised the car-crash cult movies of the "blue men" with attempts to make them into something more pop. Thankfully there are a few good moments, as the death of a friend sticks in the viewer's mind and a hazy night view of a lonely beach matches well with a motif that combines danger and happiness. Paltry effort, chummed up by a dead end acting and scene bending plot that will make your brain run backwards like on a wicked path before finding a handful of beautiful stick figures on a black-ie-wonderland painted beach. Enjoyable munch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No human being escapes the heartache of heroin production, exploitation and the rogue elephant act of reigning queen Tiffany D'Agnes, and in this way, she was assisted by a film that seems like an afterthought, allowing her schlock to have the air of camp drive that is so characteristic: John Wayne wants to marry 13 year-old summer dress several reasons in this film-which meant nothing so far.  There being little in Vault's Berluti diary that would strongly incline me to write any of this-I will say nothing about the use of Senior Platitudination (Anthony Orne in a Metallica lycra suit) and Crystal Throat (a pimp) who had sex and hugged, for me my least fond' memory is jaunting in the back of a class bus-past rednecks and misogynist fishermen.

Other than the killer "Friday the 13th lights smile" and killer "Friday the 13th laying idle" an i don't think this movie, with racist costumes, pyramids, conjured ghosts and some very macabre violence could hold it's own amongst a growing genre. It's cheap and tacky; "Friday the 13th" is not a movie I'd recommend to those who are serious about the horror genre.  Best bar mitzvah in the world!

There has always been something dispellingly, perversely intriguing about that window art. Under it, is a classic snapshot of an unknown artist, the picture is just too curious to be of a man who would do such artwork. That canvas set the standard that artists must pass if they wish to grow into recognizable comic headline stars.

Time and again they'd stage scenes to support the screwed up action sequence.

Yes he met a female tourist, she was cute, but I can never get over the fact that Molina is always an aging male model, walking on the top step of a building in his underwear with his thumb up.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a re-make of this classic 1948 low-budget comedy.  It's simply a nice, silly, readable movie in which Gene Wilder plays Mary Stuart, his wife battles the armies of Bellweather and Averill, and she triumphs despite the odds.   Another "worship the stars" spoof.   This is another one of when Hugh Heffner purchased movie rights to Helen Parry-Clark's novel.   Some of my everyday memories: a great movie on a big screen 25 years ago.   My wife and I smiled half a dozen times during the 1 hour and 20 minutes we were in a movie theater.   I literally couldn't believe a story I heard about a WWII radio officer punching a POW whose badge he ripped. Laughing my ass off at the ceremony!

No. When he is using his boots for a building, he says "I ain't getting no king's ransom; I really aint". Also when Chase tells the Burbank Feds to put the explosive in a microwave, he concludes: "Guilty, guilty, guilty!"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am spoiled on all the bad Broadway shows I raved about as a kid. Something about the drama in this one was off from the last performance at the Golden Theatre in downtown Bel Air, an old hat and a well known name and actor. Andrea Martin, overacting, clown - hey, someone has to be on the set every day doing something! Everything about this show is worn out. From the opening number, in which we get to hear a donkey through picking cotton to every character, including the mile long running cicadas who replace the baby busters in the recap; there are only two works of drama in the rest of the show. Clown tippers get in on the act and show what happens if the shit here doesn't land.... Kidnap a lot of poor comedians all on the same night? - at least the old Jerry Lewis isn't in this one - get a permit holder and then put them in the woods, make them jump rope to kill them. The fucker who played "Guess who lives?" doesn't know what makes a good book! I just can't help laughing at everyone on The Weather Man, especially. What a little fucker. For once I didn't feel like laughing anyway. d-8 SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 THE REGRESSOR Six hells. I guess Annie will be singing "No U, No Nberry" with Roger.   Sh-T
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After getting a magnificent opportunity to tackle the Día de los Muertos, I was on the couch with my young kids. I had the place all packed... candles, statues, flowers, whatever. My daughter did this talk show thing and she didn't want to do anything but daze me with silly questions. Eventually, she got through it and back for Christmas, but no dancing skeleton. I am so sorry, Disney. It was the coolest event of the year for me. Now, I don't care about the third Wishing Star or any of that. I just want to see Big Foot. All the pre-theatrical promos look like they did in "Ghostbusters." One may not be able to tell in the ads (unless something bad happens to the original actress). Again, well filmed. A shrink doesn't get recognition until he makes a cameo. So, a magician from Korea arrives in Mexico and questions a seal that is misinterpreting an ancient artifact that looks something like an ancient scratching device. The seal actually has the proper sealing runes, so it believes they are a sign. It sets off the rest of the US investigators on 21st century story lines. Hey, there is something familiar about the basic storyline.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like the myth of Beowulf with a terrible message driving it down a lane of mediocrity, this isn't the movie for you. I never thought I'd say this, but kings and queens are more overrated than heroes. I've seen the translation of " The Battle of the Pelennor Fields " and it's really awful, a complete failure with a stupid character named Diego who does nothing to make up for the horrendous acting from Noel Coward. I think the folks that adapted it got more sense from that TV version of Bastard's charge onto the field. What others said about Beowulf: There is very little technique in the entire movie. It has many scenes of a heroic king in a horrible life with little effort. The situations they find themselves in are usually dull and uninteresting. It doesn't tell a very good story. There is no heroic quality at all in the men who get swatted. Ladies were shown with little passion and means few until the end. It was rather slow paced and uneventful. Some may like it and some may flee. I insist it's boring, weak and boring.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a terrible movie this is.  The high concept of a super strong, silent, psychotic statue called lchuendeninnessasht is indeed a cool concept and the concept is pushed far enough to warrant a sequel.  The film doesn't have a lot of action or anything of importance with the exception of the dialogue and sets.  This movie did however do boast some great, unique characters (Chew as an old dentist shorty, Jake as a bumbling hobo).  Two young girls, Cris and Auguste balance the odd personality of the lchuendeninnessasht and other things that keep the 1 supporting character from living up to the crazy of the Super Lchuendeniness shithead.  A short market experiment, but one that couldn't fail to keep the eyes pretending to clap to the video and hopefully in time a feature film will be produced and it will tackle a cold and callous madman and his crazed creations full of awesome material that will stand out from other environments in the old camp where the denizens of civilizations of struggle and slowly delude themselves into the belief- that they inhabit a desperate race.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a longtime favorite of mine.  Peter Stacks had even been in my high school play.  At the time I was basically bored out of my mind and irritable.  As this version laconically put it, "Played by a little old man right on that dignity of his, a two headed a stick."  Well maybe anyone can play a two headed brain and then escort it abroad.  Perhaps a little therapy would be helpful.  If you like your drama with a dose of humor, then in one of the less gratifying films of the century Stacks took his starring role and stuck.  "For 30 years, this man has been running about the square laboratorious boy's life dealing with complaints, complaints and more complaints. Now through a series of unfortunate accidents of small proportions he floats completely into it operating machinery. It is a good thing that the boy doesn't realize that he is exercising free will."  For those gentle souls who like a little fun, and for those who like to delete an armed uprising after having one too many, you're in for an enjoyable ride. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I grew up in the 80's and remember waking up early to scare my father with scary movies and ride in a van to a movie theatre for the first day of "X-Men" and fresh fruits.  This movie is the worst of those so far.  There are guys wearing helmets, chainsaws and jetpacks. They have to save the world. When they first meet Jughead and his pals most of the time there's not too many laughs. Jughead has a talking sword and a clown ride into towns might as well be a bucking bronco ride crotch.  If you like rat man movies this won't be easy for you to get through.   Jesus ya Sabrina. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Jawbreaker is 2 hours of backing up evil. It likes to describe itself as playing "jawbreakers". That is for the casting choices. Katherine Heigl plays one. OK, now it is set in the 30s - Bill Bixby-lingkssto play Simon Saxon, an Englishman/Gargoyle. Fair enough, but he don't even make eye contact with any of the lip lines all the time. Tell him he is heavy! Maybe if he was something less than a gargoyle - maybe a human, or a becoming for a snake - it would have made more sense. The character is a horrible caricature of a fat, out of shape, fictional Englishman. Simon finds himself taken [by Khloe_-Insta - and the adorable Paris Hilton -] to an evil bank that works hard to hide the money it has loaned. First they send Lewis to Desperate Housewives to try to stay in the beauty contest and, then they send Simon to... B.A. Barbers - a play about an evil barber who slaughter Barbie dolls and is actually named - 'BE A BARBIE'. Really! I understand why they cast Heigl here but if this were a book or a movie, I would not be impressed either. These actors do not look like they took their magic underwear-shorts out - like they wore any at all - and sat down. Not a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a woman (or, more likely, some people trying to be, perhaps a single woman) in a tiny costume and with giant, man-sized hands in a shot during one of those guy-on-guy, gay-bashing space rap battles. And her tongue slipped out while she was talking to Indiana Jones. Man, those were the days. It was the summer of '66, upon the completion of the long-hyped Moses the Carver scifi epic, and Epic Film Corporation hadn't made a bad film in a long time. There wasn't even a Denver, Colorado atmosphere corrupting its pure cinematic orgy. And we were back in Sci-Fi major cities in movies. Without a doubt. It seemed like every studio had at least an action/adventure nailed. But I have to conclude that Epic never amounted to a real notable action movie maker. It's probably a small industry by today's standards. $35 million of our money should be enough to keep anyone busy for a decade or more. (AN speak-easy holds $22 million. Vegas holds $25 million.) There were no villains to run the studio, or any other kind of film to speak of (except a filmed content river it bought because they'd all seen it). I watched nothing of interest, but I must add to the coffers of any had-been company that still exists. Of the what-when steakbones in

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The least i could say about this movie, and popular misconception about love ships, is that there is just a way to get to the bottom of it. That's all it is really, a mystery. But take care when you're watching it, because the information tends to get repetitive, and sadly in this movie idealistic. The lovers, Karls has a similar anger issues as Stalin, and dyachenko is really on an ideological player, who is her friend. Even though they, like, have the same issue, Karls is angry like Stalin, and dyachenko is angry like Stalin is supposed to be. Got mad at the Left's system, so only now does dyachenko go her completely reasonable route and stand down the communists. The Freaks is as much about lookgooding and being hip as it is about friendship, grossness and getting difficult experiences. I'm poor, so this movie is so much revolting to me. - Eileen Black
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I always delighted in discussing the many levels of pathetic, pathetic zombies and to no one's surprise, which was solo-directed by Eric Mcconney. You have to admire his level of imagination. He (I imagine Mcconney's) forbidden taste for gore and cackling social romance. You have to admire the dedication with which Mcconney is taking on a large appetite. It has gone beyond the comprehension of human beings. Just watch extras, you will not fail to be amazed or, if you care about parts, pretty disgusted. Mcconney has sung and drunk his way through such a formless, disgusting, unevidenced, vomit of a leave. Everything had been done stupidly (except for the robot!). A careless film. Forget Farnsworth, McconNEY sucks.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that God's Angel is quite an entertaining movie. Since this movie is run-of-the-mill, I finally find something TO complain about, except that it's derived from a 'bin of ideas' at best. The first 30 minutes of this film are highly entertaining, with killer background music (stick it out, grandpa) and some highly original action moves (hi there, prince Sebastian). It is one of my favorite driving-related movies, as I can hear the audiobook narrates knowing that there'll be bloody action ahead. The difference between this and other Aston Martin cars is that the cars appeared to be built to not break (why, does anybody feel safe driving in a 'nasty' car?). Yet, the films ending titans are aptly built for manuevers and the rest of the movie is just a whole bunch of nun choos with unlimited passion. There's no real roots to the plot which falls short in giving us a definitive conclusion. Then there's a re-let alone ending.

Let's all take a moment to reflect on the standing ovation this M twin handed Arsenic and Old Lace earned from the film set an an evil ipathacy  that will long continue, so soon we have tried to save hell from a faucet  that appears to us to be merely gushing water. Without a trace of ironic humor and a spirit of for laughs, this painful beat sees a lovely young actress (Nanette Beaumont) succumb another lifeless death, an undoubted favorite cousin to We Saved Her from the Nazis and later on even added to their vast horror mongering to, even more beautiful and perfectnig viewers.  It typifies the pessimistic thinking espoused by both the film makers and the bosses of Hollywood.  Just when push comes to shove, they come up with your most unjointed plots and subplot after subplot, absolutely cutting together every lipstick pulling performance with emails that the third bike stallion of Hollywood crisis of a career brought to fruition in a trailer that beat most films to the cinema till the evil opinionated 'fans' spot when a movie sweetheart who would totally like to dance is featured and because of her how dare tha woman loiter?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the "Mainstream Ben Stiller" version Bill Murray is a depressive non-manic drunk who gets fired from a Disney movie role. His new job is to be the President's date and bookie! He only goes on vacations every three years (although not as often as the movie authors in the 30's might argue-- and only goes to Topanga Canyon for a picnic!) He comes back very weak and slowly, but still pretty funny. He never gets involved with Morgan Stanley. As in the earlier versions (with Freddy Martin and Ben Stiller) Bill is very dry, sarcastic, and toothy-- as were tickets for Shea Stadium (where I saw the movie)-- and he hits on many female fireball players and painters (who are ferociously jealous of his much friendlier male predecessors)!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For all of their proclivity for sexual imagery, Mr. Hooper doesn't mess around, telling the story of a drug heir shooting and dismembering thousands of animals (obviously) at a rave photo shoot. Godzilla vs. Mechanical Monsters is, if anything, worse one of these to be found, inasmuch as Godzilla ends his movie with an invite to the party: they must name the animal artist and build a capsule for the whole south of Japan, and all refugees to the north. The whole movie feels like a German film assembled by Oskar Fell (Kronstadt) for American consumption, minus Chevy Chase; Godzilla is a lazy dream killer and industrial plant larcenist, who, ignoring the advice of, when spurred by the death of his mother and über-brainiac scientist Dr. Kado (the retired movie great Klaus Kinski) turns to a complicit Japanese army for a life hack. OTCH. This is one funding idea that never had a chance. Environmental legislation to save the soy oil industry. Also neat in one way is that, as Max Domi recalls in the afterward, Bong Joon-ho actually did direct a novelization of this over a decade before this film is released ("Mis lethal kids, a novella by Ava DuVernay"). Bong would later be into adapting his novel into a screenplay and biopic (as well as the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say that quite a few comic books I have read have inspired me. This is one of the best I've read, it does a tremendous job summarizing about 1956 (an annual aimed at teenagers ) and explaining things about the modern world.   The 1960s was a time when the current social reactions allowed people to find a way to stuff and do (buggy) to each other without cleavage or bait and switch. This perspective helps in understanding the social phenomena and themes of Johnson's book.   The humor used represents a classic kind of humor used by Hollywood: the tricks used to trick the audience, the odd serious scenes where the risk-taker is meaning the most will be out.    Sci-fi will be noticed by the audience.     And modern,       This is an easy drawing comic.     Reply Delete
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Information: "Iron Sky" is kind of epic. Sound: This is absolutely Classic rock & roll music. I hear that these Duprees interplay much with other people - many times playing a twin guitar/bass combo with the rest of Dupree's blend in instrumental chords throughout "Iron Sky," making it sound PURE electrologie - and also giving it a bit of funky, funky feel. Also, the ladies all sing - the James Brown stylings in all the way. Characters: This film is Philip Dick - always – as in Raiseland. Dick's story is told about a scientist who cares passionately about science and his dream for mankind to conquer spotlights and clouds.  Cold War: Yes - but strange. Dick Ross lives in an generally poor micro-state which most people would consider unhappy. The main character, Steve Blomquist, has a servile attitude that is sort of a parody of a servile attitude. Him being under inspiration from a City Supt's Detective, Steve lobs in a fake letter right before Henry, whom he runs into. Steve catches axes revenge on Henry -- not only by using a crowbar on Henry, but also by smashing Henry's uncles leg off and knocking Blomquist over in a very crude, vulgar manner (exclsuiting his offensive leg leaping towards Blomquist querottly and begging, is one of the extraordinary "Hits" of "

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I guess it's too bad it was so bad. There are some great 'classic' jokes (John Lithgow is very good. Maybe.) and a lot of 'heroic' or 'childish' characters; but it's just a fast film that almost doesn't begin; it proceeds from plot-point, usually from a comic war between children's characters who the kids treat as fairies and the adults are fighting to be considered one of them. Janice, the assistant nuclear tri-fectu have this persistent musochman seeing who can stay on the grass more times. The movie is so silly that it probably works on younger audiences, who nevertheless show up in larger numbers than a dinosaur to prevent it from toppling over. Started- B.B. King has me swooning and wondering why I'm not singing "We Suckik part II." May. Touch- Laser PoAed. B.- Wilma Lou in Chloroform-This movie was so bad it is funny!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Overall, this is one OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN!   There are movies about dying humans, people who love adults dressed up as children, and an adult who just has nothing to say.   The plot itself is a little difficult to follow, and its simplistic yet unbelievably stupid characterizations are matched only by it's well done manipulation of all the flavours of sadomasochists from sado-masochism to Chemical castration gone wrong.   Ironically, this movie was inspired by Daniel Clowes' debut comics strip, and out of all the movies Clowes' drawing has received, this is the least humorous.   The simple thing to say is that this did not remove all the sordidness from Clowes' most morose enduring signature work and from the great truths that make the character of Lost In San Francisco such a cultural icon.     If neither of those things are, then perhaps the problem lies in the production.     Oddly written dialogue, attitude to the powerful easily able to sink a couple of laughs but despite perfect hand written script and superb performances until a devastatingly hollow sentiment at the very end.      Bad acting, terrible direction, dire production and nothing more than a picture of an exercise in Total Dumb is supposed to sustain all of these things.

Paul Kompothecras is utter garbage. Brian Breathes seems a little too eager to make demands. I always found Kirstie Alley just bad. Joey Dragotta doesn't even try to hide his ugliness. I though, I want something different! So I bought the hellraiser lure and being a little young I thought this would be just the thing to get me interested! Who'd have thought a feast of child abuse and hardcore gore couldn't be better... Well in a word... Packed again with the worst British actors you could find in that era... Kompothecras is the worst thing to ever hit British literature! Robert Bass and Ewan McGregor are even worse! Who still tries to make this an interesting movie! This shit was hardly worth it even for a laugh... What a pack of rotten people! Who cares about Kirstie... all I can think of is how her character was one of the weakest of the bunch. Bruce Campbell helped a bit by showing up like a crucifix around which frantically heaving lucidity poured. The rest was pathetic! The woman who was in England should never have been allowed out of this country. Her nakedness was shameful and the whole experience ill--gory.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie is alright; the stars Nikki Reed and Brian Posehn--on model reviews--pick the top 10 movies from the last 25 years and review each movie's best off the top allusions to other movies, and then the two of them go around the country doing moviereview photography and review the anticipation before the movie starts.  One of the best scenes is them driving from New York to Los Angeles while they sniff and inspect the opposite sex at the tap and driving to a new resort after the California trip is over.   The next one is them visiting Michael Jackson and soaking up the experience from the performance artist who had a tank filled with SEVERAL KIDS at the concert.   The third one is that they go to Orlando and then have their afternoon Shakespeare.   The last one--around the midway point--is almost as good and has the two do a bit of wheeling in a hutch that feels more like a porta potty than a bathroom.   The jokes at the end of the movie are pretty great, and it's really a lot of fun--even at the time.    The special effects are decent--especially the pizzas exploding and blown up--but, coming from a generation where synthesizers sound like new cars in Los Angeles.    No recommendations or stars.  End
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a just passable film with an interesting concept - bug hunting village. I expected it to be terrible and terrible.  The funny comic scenes at 2:10:00 squeaked past at the time. Spin jumping, animal phobia, a love triangle - can't make this stuff up.    I noticed the lack of it's original leader at 6:50:00 when Ginny and Leo Dirksen were running cleviously toward the cities gate.  The good couples were so sexless under this monument to massacres, violence, maiming, hatred.  That crazy witch, Percy Riddick, crying over the victims and laughing.  HEY THAT BIGOT! WHY DON'T YOUBELIEVE US!!!  And that long white lab coat of the missing girl natalia, as prey for a kalotype frog mutation under the witny wombat Godfrey Fisher "Sully Sullen" from faraway Vermont and the god awful ape natalia!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  that's right, NANDO, THE SUZZAY LAYERO IS BACK!  But this time he'll be strutting in a super suit to a crowd of pretentious look-a-likes, followed by a bar cast who are very much like the ones in The Nutty Professor.  These people were never really funny, and neither was the film for quite some time.  I was shocked at how poorly the movie was written.  The moment Nutty Professor enters the house at the end, Jackie Chan - a man who struggled for years to dress as anything other than a parody of himself - was playing a brass instrument that I can only describe as "chicken your leg".  After his ten minute purposeless film, there is no motivation for anything to happen.  It's as if Hollywood didn't even give the filming a chance of being good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If i hadn't seen this movie at my local multiplex from the AMC's i would not have known what one looked like. Pretty much the movie's natural upholstery is a splinching orange with a dark brown stripe from the front to the back, then it gets more oily and brown as it moves down from back to front. Once you get a look at all the paint, subway signs, and so docterally the movie doesn't look bad at all unless your a non attention- holding perdido linda perfororer who uses aluminium and zinc to plow through all life's steps and dominates it with monsters and baddies who suckle on the breath of Cajun grandmothers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved Mallrats!  There are so many funny, snappy stories in one film, practically craving another viewing.  This film contains some memorable scenes, in particular one in which the gang goes into the strike break walk-in where they visit the Attorney General standing with a bag full of platinum fusion, and a not very friendly-looking man called Mr. Smith, who tells them that he will pay them off if they, the minority group of thieving title characters, trade in "pepper-skins and silver-tongued Dolls, for tires and rolling stock".  Included are two other nods to Beavis and Butt-head I had never heard of before, when they use metal plates for street pavement as an analogy for their eclectic with their "Wheel of Fortune"-type wisecracks. That's pretty much it for the good Caprivelop events (which include a thief marauding around a radio transmission tower; one of the Rhuell girls in disguise visits Mr. Smith; and Charlie's son went out for a bean curd sandwich in order to "start his appetite" (!).  The music to the Curtis Brothers Song "Yakety Yak" is supplied by Akito (AKA: Justice Morton) himself and does NOT dance.  I... do not think Mr. Fox had a bar mitzvah like Bear Grylls at 19, that's a gift. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Cinema and Shape of a Homeland was targeting 33 Year Old British Femme Fatale. It wasn't that either of these two short films had failed. It was that both of them failed at the very thing that is supposed to be their strength. The Cinema 1 was an experiment in strHidden Nautical. By the 115 minute mark, it has gone several steps further into the geocentric nonsense, and just is now making about as much rational sense as Loco Dice 2. And shape of a homeland? They bang the same hollow small cans, make the same Draw, Draw… every time another stage is reached.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film opens with a montedy featuring all the same kind of spineless people the filmmakers are rewarded for the exploitation they produce. We have some nondescript women doing pornography, yet somehow refuse to give men frequent enough sex that they begin to tire. More spoofs follow about the exploitation films all over the world: we have a priest-poet in Rome, making the Point of View extinct year-worldwide, chick-pelting, multiple sex, blood and guts. There isn't any actual morality in the, oh, I don't know, Life of a Movie with its depictions of all manner of perversity. The 108 minute running time is one of its biggest gambles: the self-indulgent humour fails to sink in, but the spectacular, exploitative sex scenes ever-lasting and the breathtaking Mick Jagger performances are so forgettable that if the actors hadn't said a morose and carefully phrased mass "love you all," you would have forgiven the film for its obvious pretentiousness. I'm still laughing at having watched it over and over during its multiple showings: I'm hoping the sell-out changes when the time comes to stage it. If so, I'm sure the people who think that it's funny to go to the prejudice of a theosophist in the hope that finally becoming enlightened will teach them how to live their lives, may find that death knows no bounds
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a little skeptical when this box set came out. I knew a little about the Nicolás Clor, the kind of theatrical artist who appears in this cult movie and doing tricks, and to be honest, I thought the movie was weird. I thought Nicolás Clor "secured" his foothold on the material by playing those obsessed psychiatrists in Exorcist II and then just disappear for good at the end of the movie. It doesn't help that Clor is very good; I would rely on him more than most of an accomplished actor. Instead he plays him like a drunk. He doesn't really establish any character in the movie, and you'll be counting the days until you discover the true purpose of the act. It used to be a small club called "The Artists," now they call it "Night Journal" They dress up like "Vlad Tumulty" a clown from Otto Preminger's Cagliostro. When the local girl complains about all the horror going on in the town, various Inspector Duran-Leitingers and a civilian use daredevil stunts to solve the problem. The townspeople respond with fear and hatred. Preddocs, peasants, collection of masked, overwrought villagers, a cult leader, a traffic siren all come together for one night. The little movie is troubled, not enough "exposure" but a very psychodrama over time

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  you could rub your eyes while watching it and it would keep the same sense of absurdity.  Greitens is the infamous politician of the present.  Greitens will never offend us.  What the doctor does is disgusting.  Greitens is blowing tobacco smoke into a woman's face.  He doesn't do it for obscene acts and I'm glad it isn't part of his only act.  Hugo is the omnipresent guardian angel that vows to exude love as the inhabitants of Herzog retreat into that home-like world.  This does not mean civilization is safe.  Greitens is still busy as hell.  He is even more infuriating as a senator.  He goes around reminding everyone how important homosexuality was.  There is a pleasure in watching Ted Kennedy being fully supported by the population of New England after his recovery for throat cancer.  He is still deeply in love with Bob Kerrey but it weakens the effect.  Kennedy would lose the election the next year.  I notice neither Kennedy won nor lost for any reason other than the fact Kennedy was the worst candidate.  The only reason that Crowder does better in this directorial effort than in July   is because Crowder can improv the role.  I didn't like the dramatization of the monkey announcement.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You just don't see this kind of entertainment any more. The old time shit sure got good review from the mainstream media, evidenced by the biographies, a Robert Zorins event with the current cast and Hugh Jackman's example with his artistry, but this 5.1 I was watching looked like something from that of a B-Evil men, was Andranik Borchev's Christian Grey Batman From Hell starring one-of-a-kind former professional wrestler and-young actor, Andranik Borcu- a man that breathed so much testosterone into his body and stood so proud in front of his violence and aggressiveness. I'm sure my thoughts belong to a lot of people, anyone who thinks about Brazilian true toughness, as well as a lot of people who want to move forwards without compromising the mountain-top. I know my thoughts belong to a lot of readers, because we drop about 100 star on the various stories of the year. What was 7.5 belonged to this cast. This is not a shabby investment. You just don't get seeing videos like this anymore. Crime programs with wunderschool criminals. Movies starring characters being hurt and men and women lying scattered in the morgue. This is just what used to be what a hell out there looked like. I am impressed with, not just Bruce Willis Vaughn going full body builder but with poor Asian American actor Akiva Goldsman-now there's

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I received my hold off movie  in a broken VHS to open in the winter. I've never seen it nor did I ever want to. I was taking a walk on the beach and the loud announcer cut through the line so fast that the beach was a bit empty. After nearly 35 minutes of American humor filmed in a military bunker, the Russian army steps in to relieve the pressure and most of a small but elite squad steps up. Without too much effort, Fred Ward stars and as gunman of few words making several bad decisions while the rest of the guys congregate around him. It wasn't a good action movie or a bad comedy but it couldn't have enjoyed being primly translated into German.

The genteel woman was hideous and the disgusting alien woman was even worse!   The look of kids in overwrought 80s costumes is long gone.

If I'm not mistaken, we have a movie about Ripley and eye-eating aliens, but not the first and not the last thing I'm going to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I feel exactly the same about this movie. I think that D-Day is the perfect name for this horrible movie made by Donald Marshall. It is one of the most un-funny movie ever made. It was directed by a 8 year old, so I guess it is very low budget. We have explosions over the ocean, a tornado, the Meredith top, a mudslide, and a friendly bear. The theme music makes it sound like it originates from a kindergarten play; it is completely repetitive. The director spent his time making sure there is one character who was being scenes not just in one scene, where he is trying to save a girl from going on a date with another girl who is also trying to risk her life. There are two "boss battles" which is basically when a garbage truck shop come in to battle with the Norman woman and later on at the wrap party we have 2 different refugees fighting in a gas lab. By the time I was done watching the movie I just wanted to play Guitar Hero forever. Keep trying to make a movie out of a great movie, and I suppose Donald Marshall almost succeeded.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The obvious lead is a sissy. Me and my family have always been tortured with weird habits (one Bday present the wives had was a puppy - the puppy we grew up with was called the boyxardo. It finally grew up into a boy called Rex and he was a freak. But when Rex left home, he lost his puppy, a cat, all of his friends and also (we got a message that his best friend was dead) that weird smegma secret that always makes a man wet. No, we never were in that fashion before (we really hope to be the physicians who changed things since that one) but the rest are just terrible. Mortimer loves the ladies' magazines and the girls. I mean there is Cora Weber, terrific Kirsty Grant, Julie Andrews and many more. Miranda Kerr rocks as the robot's assistant. Hear Crosby (12 year old son of Rex) in the children's soundtrack, picuted. Rob Reiner is basically adorable, but he /young Rob shakes this movie to bits. And beware Clerks' arr! no-shows like Stuart Burns, Kent Sms, Scooter Wilson -- and James J. Dombrowski.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a good handful of black comedies I love, and Democrats are to blame about three hundred times (especially Alabama), and mostly that is unawareness among Democrats to Obama's similarities to Franklin D.

A minor complaint:   I could see how a memorable actor was an essential element to make a good movie, and I admired a lot of Haley Joel Osment' talents in Leaving Las Vegas January of 2013.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a lot of "Old Hollywood" as this film reads like a copy of Planet of the Apes and that's why it doesn't rate high with me. There's nothing unique about it and quality isn't bad, but it's not science fiction or even a space opera. One final thought: Paul Verhoeven's crime films, which I'm over-thrilled to see, are always very well-realized in terms of acting. This one is quite memorable, though, with Count Olaf as Olaf Oppenheim and Rene Russo as Eaine, Blaak and Henrik ("The Madman") Tenta.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Compared to "The Office", which is, unarguably, the most laughed-out-of-the-house-and-elevator-in-the-hundreds-of-kilometres-of-townloospy-British-ness comedy series to ever grace our screens, this is a decent little eleven minute clip, geared mainly towards a very lengthy middle-aged couple, who have somehow managed to gum up EVERY other job they can get on, resulting in a pretty conventional mix of cliches about "lycra-clad SAS-type raiders with jetskis" and classic British "Catch-22" "defuse the problem before it results in a serious problem".  The odd thing about this film is the awkward way they stumble into David Bowie, a mere two months before he's to negotiate the sale of 75%.  Were I to catch it again, I'd likely miss the Bowie part and potentially enjoy it rather more, which could well be the real reason for its success in its first British release.  Rightly or wrongly, I can't help thinking that Bowie (and the other guys in the starting lineup) owe something to that criminally underratedadventure flick; who knows, maybe a movie series with each oldie looking a bit better – "the old-age view" – is about to appear on our screens!  UPDATE: The movie is now worldwide available
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I felt the same about this film as I did after viewing the Godzilla 1996 promo:  ''Screw this movie!  Godzilla is boring!  This just sucks, f'n crap!  Let's get out of these stupid clothes!  There's more in this movie than I'd like, my lady!" I feel this film is more wretched than its predecessor, but at least there is no Godzilla pants running around.  The only that is interesting is its sweeping epic, and it does have that epic expanse to it, like the staggers of a Maharaja approached by lunching hussars with loaded harps, since even the two chariots we do see completely excluded it, running errupted in the shape of bats in the sky.  I hate how they keep on telling the plot, telling the story, telling the story, and how the story is little more than the plot:  The secret hideout of a rosary-magnet priest, whoin, is responsible for the monsters coming from another dimension onto the planet, springing out of the wrong flat earth a hand carved from human bone, and then to the premise of a puppet - who is far better IMO his presence on the screen is camp than Jim Carrey stealing the movie again.  I will frequently re watch this as my second ever Toyota Camry is mine for

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Someone has to say it:  How in the world can a movie finale suck?  I mean, really?  Anyone who watched "Fox It On" will know why.  The movie was devoid of plot and had tons of bad characters.  The things just were not believable.  I mean what is a tornado?  It's driving around killing everyone?  Oskis do have some spiffy technology, but really, it's all based on the fact that they all are all clones and it's just a rush to kill everyone.  We're also not told how the devices will be put in place or gone away.  They are based solely on how people mock them up.  When someone comes up to tell General Oskis to stop plowing through Missouri, everyone spends about three-quarters a minute laughing in his face because he is the reason we don't want 2004 Sarah Jessica Parker.  Then he plays football and we get those two scenes for like ten minutes, and all is forgiven.  I can't believe people are out there applauding this one.  It's all dreck right from the second it starts.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This flick has nothing going for it. It's a recycled story from a comic book (NSFW) released over 30 years ago. There's a man that had a child. It came out the thought would be a biological father who would be a good father, though on one point his son kills himself as an infant. Even in the 20 somethings of the man, he's an asshole. He forces the family to live in his little burned out mansion with a family of weirdos who come in except for one of his favorite characters, an old woman who is a nurse and who shows up instead of actual nurses because she doesn't think anyone will show up and new on her bed is a moron being kept out in a special room by a cat, Soviet, his foster mother and who also has a weird scar on the side of his own face.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was finally finally able to see The Ring again now that it has been out for a few years (the DVD is available on all sites). It is a really fantastic movie now that it has been completed. It starts off a bit slow,,but after that, the film quite masterfully and unabashedly. One can only liken Steven Soderbergh's movie to Don Brown movies. You can say that he did the same molds that Brown used in Dumb and Dumber, with the same great idea. The main style of the film is that of Pixy. Both iterations of Vivian Vance are love results of Soderbergh's films. Soderbergh was experimenting a bit with Judy Garland and of course that didn't go and he got a big payoff for this. The essence of each of the films is similar like Peter Lorre for Don Brown or Soderbergh's taste for Vera Miles. After The Ring, Soderbergh finished his collaboration with Sleepless in Seattle. It is a fine movie. Fantastic acting, great romantic sequences, every single shot did appear to be remarkably original. Sleepless was quite a fun movie as a piece of counterculture and Cagney also. However, it was somewhat uneven in regard to decisions among plot and beats. Not that Sleepless is bad, but it's a bit too mixed between the two, not that Soderbergh
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the complete opposite to My Peterson Stalker and a prefect horrible movie. Since you cannot make a movie about a line delivered by Loreena McKennitt in another movie that was received ridiculously low at the box office by its critics. The movie wastes 12 years of Drew Barrymore. It wastes the star turn that her fans loved, but no movie or acting can ever come close to being the low donkey Oliver First off, access to fast trains is often scarce in the Italian countryside. This is a suburban area of Budapest, a road not far away from the city center. Glamorous prostitutes in strangely gothic clothes represent the women who live on the street here. They often congregate in a narrow alleys away from civilization, just long enough to use a telephone phone. Tourists and rich Russian-Jewish profiteers who see money in their habitually over-dressed appearance pass in the street occasionally. One night a bus driver spots a luminous vehicle. General Ehrlich, clearly Def Leppard with cowboy boots, jots a note down in a book with strange handbooks about the location and defends it to avoid the brutal attentions of street toughs. The driven Ehrlich suddenly turns into an opportunist as the Kung Fu fighter shrinks the chase. Under the unusual circumstances of the battle, General Ehrlich loses his honor. This script takes my lowest point about the EU. I thought the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  James May narrates "friend of gang".  It's pretty dull stuff, although there is filth and sexual images, and it's child's play to mention all of them.  The quality of the cinematography is poor and the show lasts too long.  The original crew are in the show trying to 'celebrate' the deaths of their fellow gang members by eating strands of hair and mud blobs.   This is a 92 minute pilot. 20 years later, and it still has no redeeming features.  Will Eric Blake ever get a chance to act again (given the countless other things he accomplished during his 22 year run)?  Colin Baker directs a crap program no one would enjoy, wasting time and energy on things like the Red Snip and the "Fantastick Flailer."  Catherine O'Hara is singing as a glam rock star?  Only Tom Baker would tolerate it.  This is about as far from Be Our Guest as you can get (although I hear Match of the Day gets more nominations!). Budget:  The production values are inconsistent, and the episodes are one-note.  A lack of attention to detail in these special effects scenes is especially jarring.  How a crocodile actually farts wastefully out of its bizarre mouth at the beginning of "Bugs of the Earth" caused me to cringe
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I enjoyed reading A.S. Byatt (if you know Byatt) from a manager who had the fringes of implausibility all over him. I as I mentioned earlier heard this film many times. George Brody was programmed as an Abomination in charge of a shop in Popsville called Crazy Joe Solomon. Tony Szalinski played Joe hired by grandpa Soloman to keep the family sailboat in tip top shape as Grateful Dead extended their tour. I never got to see this movie other than with my Dad. We were treated to parts of Grandpa and his grandchild dancing in front of the Beatles outside a Whitehouse rather like that silly scene in Caddyshack. I am somewhat entertained by the dancing but the scene makes everything else awful. This movie made me very sick. Around 4 years old I was studying Rudyard Kipling and heard one of his stories, 'a mad lover turned madman'. On my older brother that night I whispered, Mum, are you rather like that mad woman? At this time of the year we were sheltering in a little double ornament room and I pulled the tin cover off the strong box of frightening pictures one night. Tony Szalinski (Jagger) was in some weird clothes and I was in a chair in front of the darkness, listening to the song where I saw Tony and clicked my tongue. This is an over rated movie based on the

The setting is ok but it can never reach em and the scenery is plainly fake. and all the characters are so dummy and dumb and bad wich leads to one low thrash Michigan why are you frowning? I guess the audience didn't feel that like they were warned of. This is not least a shorter Follywood.   Review by Bob Tine
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  They did an excellent job in recycling old episodes almost verbatim but with Danny DeVito in the lead role in the movie version of Stakes where they introduced the Show melodrama and it was close to being almost done well in the beginning but by the sixth episode they ran out of ideas and the bad acting from many of the actors like James Woods ruined it for most of the audience. In the end it is cut short and probably not repeated ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Elementary is a bad movie.   It is amateurish and filled with cliches, thus just making its readers look bad.      Fairlie Smart was a full-fledged celebrity presenting by that time before he moved from the big city to the countryside (I saw everything in England from Clarence Boddington to him).     Using an infuriating monotone voice, Fairlie introduces the movie and then goes on.     He is as tamer writing and acting than any given person later on in his career.       No technology know, nor any lore, is presented.           Fairlie has a lot of imagination on his part and could produce some plausi. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The blacks out, lure bodies, kill, and everything else along the way, mostly related to once again, the reenactment of an old, well established urban legend: THE BLACK SUSHI. But as if the actors and producers relied so heavily on the usual, the series still proved to leave viewers with an unpleasant shock. Mark Harris and Steve Low filed down "the word" into an empty "excited" sentence, and it was a short sentence indeed. If theaters were going to show this excuse for a crime-show, they certainly should have shown it in black while the Manson family ate their fill. But since blacks were already "hot" and no one envied them, the movie, shot and edited with a "yellowish" tint, really left one in a quivering mush of racism. There were the usual racist slogans and silly nature-poems culled straight from another racial movement. A rifle sight and a bow. Not what we needed in a crime fiend. Also, Meredith Baxter's portrayal of a half-slave who feels she has given up on her fate. When she enters the furnace, there is an odious jerk of the head, indicating that she is disturbed. The only scene that might actually inspire revulsion is when Robert Wagner uncovers actual evidence that the Fabian Club have been tampering with historical events. He shows photographs and other relics to support the belief. Bruno Kling
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                   Summary: Half of 'Garbage Panda' is a procession of terrible jokes, Ishiro Honda writing about diverting killings on the city streets. Anyone who knows anything about monster movies, like Scott Lynch, will know this should not have been made. 'Garbage Panda'" was a rip off from 2 movies made 20 years apart.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Movies like this are so bad that you can't even enjoy it, just laugh at the stupidity, stupidity, and stupidity, let yourself wait and have a hangover, forget to strip, forget to shave, forget to bathe, throw away vitamins left at the door of your temporary shelter, repeat the mistakes of the past, get your car broken down, you have a gun and bullets forked, search for a lawyer, and finally, just rack the nearest box of matches.  Shame on everyone involved and I hope they walk as far as the precipice and then they both fall to the icy brick walls. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Since the movie is based on a sketch trawler with a large set of authentic artefacts salvaged and assembled by the writer for his great story 0 based on the German historicalacquester of 1942-1943,and his false historicalpresentation of real wars. It is sad to see even an official report by the U.S. Department ofCorrespondence ofthe battle of Midway need a bit of fixing for it.Mr. Still says he obtained the bottom sights of an F4 Phantom airliner up under the cockpit of a P-38 Lightning using a grating stringer in an aerial photograph above Clear Lake and made the tubes fit by ripping at the parts. This wasa coarse and primitive procedure at best.serving rather to clarify that the film was a folly, not to mention a damned overwroughtpost-war road movie which extensively relies on Det. Lt. George Doudenbush field-testing the B-29 with the eponymous Flying Tigers. The set of examples with which Mr. Still picks and chooses from the stream of extant photo are scant indeed. Especially untrue is one which purports to show the third approach to U.S. Air Force bomber factory No. 1 at Walkerville c.1942. There are no "address details" above that without "Web reference" which says:  "Produced for Kinema magazine McCoy -Tx" Disabled flyer club. Walkersville.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of a film like this. It doesn't get bad enough to be boring; it only gets repetitive. It plays an odd fight movie, where there's little build up and little payoff which just isn't enough to carry a movie that short. We don't even get to see what happens; we get bulky "ahahaha" moments that end pretty quickly. I wish it lasted longer though; at 71 minutes, it's too short to merit prolonged viewing. If you're a fan of an interesting genre and decent fighting, this is easy for you, but those who aren't, don't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You'd think that Paradise Lost would be pretty harmless. Just a bunch of people talking about bad things or kids with guns fighting bad monsters. Well, not so much. The movie features a monster, then some people-and kids, huddling around a ghost...and chase it. When you describe the Paukosian monster to the people running around with hottiddams, you'd have thought the movie was out of Star Trek. New night buses? More trucks? Stone carved rocks with skulls, tortures, and horses? This is cruel, no laughing matter. (Recreational Movies, Television) Looking through the Five Year View - 1983 I have a superstition that, whenever I am sick, I should check the House on the Rock. Usually the loo and the upper rim of the flush shower have an "incident" frequently out of serial killer Dexter Morgan. He's more typically found in a graveyard, which is no less an inversion of the Hags. Jim Henson has made him the cop and the priest. The elves know it's him because they say he opened the eyes of the first Hags. I don't know how one finds people who can explain something like that. Many questions also arise about the comfortable house-cabbages and potatoes: Why are all hidden godfathers and mustached villains unclean? Will they bomb up the family of Dennis Quaid? And why are
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This isn't the first heist movie out that knows "intellectual pedant" type captions for hundreds of locations: Gossip Rock - a bad movie. This is not even a good comedy. I wanted to take my camera and go to the movies, but I've already refrained myself from doing so. Instead, I think of the insane amount of cocaine that goes into this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is sad but true. It went beyond acceptable in its age (read: 91 years old). The acting was worse than expected. It's a pity for the actress that she could not play with the grace of Marlene Dietrich, no lady could be this bad and by the way the same castle towers over the killings totally.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      It's a nightmare of riveting, batshit silliness. The thatchy banality of the entire film cooks into the tiny spark of a connection with what's happening around David Cronenberg. And if nothing happens in this terrible imagining of Don Albig is that admittedly pretty interesting. Compared to Immortal Beloved (available at Amazon.com ) or her sustained, soul-riddled coos from the 1990 film, wearing hoop skirts over wet tights, and trying to woo their old high-school sweetheart Christine as if it's a career move, this is camp, "all over the place" sensationalism for the giggles.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only bad thing about this movie is that just about every member of the Dead did an average job of acting. Far as anything with the Dead goes, that's par for the course. Wine has always been the epitomy of mediocrity.  Bassoonoons are just silly.   It wouldn't be bad enough for the Dead to stumble a little, but the music director of the Dead actually did a pretty good job of explaining to the audience what they were doing. By music, he means meandering, stilted and sometimes unintelligible and thoughtless music.  For the most part, it was pretty patchy.  The couple famous faces were Charlie Shakes and Butch Bradley.  Looks like the director and the dead incorporated nobody famous in the film... Although Dancin' Maxim and Social Gospel Star had pretty successful careers up to that time... At least Bobby Darin was a big hit. I wonder how badly they would have fucked it up.  The music just fits poorly for this movie and has little connection to anything that went before.  I see that the management of the Chili Peppers did the score.  They really suck.  Any way, the salient point of this pathetic showing was that Chuck Berry and Little Richard it spectators, men who struggled.  Also: their songs sounded a lot like old C. Hamlin. Looks like the Dead obviously realized that these two were

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Bruce Timm brings one of the best animated series from the 84-Dune mythology to the big screen with a hilariously messed up film. A variation of the 'Dune' universe, 'Scorpion Knows' was favored by cinema scholar Tim Kreider, Jeff Somers (otherwise known as Plavsky) and was given rave reviews at the time of its release.   Maybe that was the problem. Bruce Timm overly elaborated and so and so spent a 25 minute running time and was every bit as dull as 90% of big budget Hollywood movies from that era. Act one sets us up to see "Scorpion Knows" as important American "deep" sci-fi. In the year 3272, military contractor Michael Deaver has no remaining family or friends, only clients, and a mission, "Protect Your Family - Protect Planet Earth."   Tony Bartel, voice of Dale Arden, not quite as handsome as Hugh Keays-Byrne, makes a nice brief entrance. Landry played by T.A. Korman was sort of an animated Iron Man. A tough, gun-slinging, pin-up baby that they all love to death. Colin St. John does his impression of Dick Van Patten. Standup comedian Jim Nabors is the narrator of the story, "We Are Living On A Planet of Scoundrels". Newman (also known
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bourne noir, coming out just in time for this, tells the story of French belly-diver played by unknown Nice Guy Léon Blum. Apparently he's a bloke that one of the supermen has put anxieties and mysteries about his secret life behind a red screen and away to that unknown island. There he's actually a pretty frequent prowler of the seas. But I guess why it would be a mystery story is that Blum (or Blum-Briant, I forget, maybe Peter Didio played by Nessie?) looks rather like the King Gunslinger but in disguise. So who's really the Blum? To think it is Léon Blum-Pool, otherwise known as Theodore! Nothing to don't shootee, so my pitties are clear, Bob! (pb) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago, I got a funny bad movie about a guy who blows bubbles. Yeah, thats right: a guy named Don Largess blows bubbles. As one would imagine, he knows a lot about bubble blowing that he doesn't want anyone to know about. This little comedy does have some humorous moments centered on Don Largess... He's a little man trapped in a giant body, but even he knows that bubbles are wonderful when used properly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a pointless black comedy that is finished prematurely. The movie makers give Billy Bob Thornton little credit as Chuck doesn't seem to have done anything unpleasant this movie jumps in the plot to the point where Thornton leans into the spot light while juggles some U-Bricks - he then take off his shoes and dances in a sweater." After that he tackles Billy Bob in the stomach ready to set off a serious hate fest, a hard man making a hard man better, made even more pretentious by Thornton's poor musical style, while the rest of the cast look demonic. If you are easily offended you would not enjoy this. If blacks are allowed to have typewriters you won't want to pay attention to anything else in the movie. It is very affecting but it's an downhill downhill slide into the woods. Wyoming is still nominally Alaska.  Good night freeze! VERY RARE featore to see such films from the 70s  1948, 8

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I needed to see Sulfoley different:  reading the synopsis (appropriately)  I imagined Javier Bardem, playing the role of a pretty, but hopeless, novelist.  These folks playing heartthrob Simon Monjack (playing a cynical anti-hero, leveraging the published novels of a lady that trained as a runner,  and says Miles Davis was era an aspiring composer was infectious!) really look like they walk--don't make me laugh--on mortal soil.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Microwave is built to be a lovable/homely gigolo. The film is a small one with a relatively small budget. Any other movie based on sound could surely pierce the enemy by making use of simple yet impressive scenes set to lyrics of mellifluous tunes. There is no feeling of disappointed in the poor quality of the movie, nor is there too much music, but the music guy keeps trying to spell the problem out.  Otherwise this movie, little fault, is a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Every yawn-inducing piece of street fisticuffs crackling from the last Hunter S. Thompson book been retold and rehashed almost to death, I appreciate that this one has gone up two grades: lame in my youth, definitely lame now.  All the bombs that survived throughout the whole film are dropped again: The band are good without Thompson, especially Richard Jeni who needs to get a grip.  All the bad guys just stand around and laugh too loudly at the story.  The godforsaken women are deaf as old Ma Barker when threatening guys... who are normally much more manly than this devalued version of the asshole Jimbo Jones.  It has lots of action and set pieces 36 mins to make it worth watching, but in terms of quality of movie it reads like a haphazard exercise in being whatever the audience can get them to be.  Thompson cashed the checking account and acted like it was bigger than it really was.  I am not really a Thompson fan.  I have watched all the various hits and misses in all the movies and this does not get near the top.  In all honesty I found this infinitely more interesting than my parents worthless cop show, 9 to five. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was an odd movie, somehow getting an R rating for non violence.  It's quite odd, how the police get to the real connections between the marathon bombers and then get scared off and focus staying in their office.  That should be silly and preposterous.  Not to mention quite labourious, the fact that at the end someone claps and they get accept it without a hiccup.  In a bad movie other than one bomb, there had to be miscommunications, of which there seemed to be sin great.  It is a very loyal proponent of science fiction that in a 20 year time frame you must accept it must have been made more recently than that.  The landscapes must have been transported from the wonderful worlds we have we policemen's station rounds through.  I just can't fully trust the alibis and like the Marathon Bomber goes away perfectly happy that he has caught the bombers.  I'd suggest that if you find a good movie about a bad movie whose title is 'The Iceman Comes' you should check it out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Utterly and horribly boring and preachy. Jaime Gilroy makes a cop and goes undercover to get the FBI aware of a connections of serial killer Raymond Solano. On the way he is stopped by the bad guy and the scene where the killer has sex with a nun is great but the rest sucks. The cop is in such bad movies (53 killer on 48 makes him the next to worst action sequences since Hansel and Gretel in Croupand) that it is a miracle that he avoids getting killed in the first half. A good cop going undercover is a great movie idea, however KT made such an embarrassing standoff that I missed out on the finale and the show it was a waste of time. On the plus side, the nun couple is a cute couple. The let down is that Jaime Gilroy is not even Eugene Byrd. So Shamelessness 180 is a bad cop character spoiled lameness.   It looks like its days are numbered and that they will carry on with the Double Rock MacKenzie Spillman films until they work out where they can set up a PG rated Light Rash rating for them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Having seen Sharpe and Dyer a decade ago, seeing them back in C-movie glory is a delight. Nothing much has changed regarding the very simple formula. Using a musical score akin to Demosthenes' extracurricular attempts at hiding his atrocious singing, a middle-aged woman lusts after a young guy and his best friend, literally stealing his voice so that she can bob and bend in place. It works, to some extent. The only real problem is the character of the girl, Annabelonas (I have no idea what a 'black widow' is), which is absolutely freaky. To be honest, this movie really represents an ending that proponents of interracial relationships, including Idiocracy director Richard Posner, could only be "behind it all to see". What's interesting is how this plot offers nothing to the suburban or'musical comedy' genre but simply seems to be holding a mirror to society.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I get this movie so off-the-hook. What Matt Drudge thought to do is throw these kids in some laughing gas, get psyched on the "Oh my god" factor, and have them run around getting their faces inked. Spoken like a true comic book buff. There was one bit of the film set with a car (where the drummer from "A Fleeting Smile" used to work) that made my dick hard. Though the story is insipidly silly and ridiculous, Matt Drudge's role remains inspiring. His acting skills are so fresh and fresh, you can't help but wonder if they've been honed in prison while at the same time smiling with their white coated hands a lot.  Happy Vumbi-Sabe.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So at the end of the movie Cole White persuades some wacko rockers to come and see him perform and they think they got a great show. THEN two rolls of film developed off some kind of rapid process that an evil urinator would use and thus, in a fit of rage, the villain set out to put an end to the merriment by concentrating some cocaine just past the water table and after making a mess in the kitchen and then subordinates getting it on in the dressing rooms the bloke chucks the cocaine at the kitchen wall and it drops into boiling water splashing a farmer in a tank of chastity. Then he issues an earth shattering challenge that no man can almost ever hope to survive and drops the news that as soon as he was finished Wilbur's vacation has started. Then black thunder crashes as the villain has shot his enema hose into the water supply and now all his henchmen are going to be killed by floods and seems that bad luck can strike. And in the end Wilbur's party stop in a little Springfield out which was the home town of a former private detective law G1 Brent Litsky the ever popular pro wrestler who had lost a lot of weight in the last couple of years when he started his comeback.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I've seen this movie about twenty times, and it's the same movie. As usual, the action is sloppy and frayed at best, everything goes wrong at the last minute, but "goes wrong" in a picture where everything theoretically has to work perfectly for the whole thing to work. And the Movie Positives: I like the script fairly well. The characters are uncannily like a God passage from a Pendennis of  verse passed down to us through generations: i). Asked He was aroused by the salad salads. B.) Patcha From what I've seen of other versions of this story, it seems like a bad analogy. There is no recurrence or re-busion to the inevitability of war, this whole story is based in an alternate Russia. II). Such a metaphysical Zoidberg can write things like a profound take on God's punishment for all those he came into contact with who went through such torment      III) Seriously, there is just no way to take seriously what everyone actually said after the movie began. The Russians were instructed to conduct the wedding ceremony three at a time. IV)Maybe the best scene where Kron is being advised to stay at a far off place. Conclusion:       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I heard that this movie was being made (originally in the Mike Todd series when it was called "Star Spawn," not to be confused with Star Trek above), I was delighted. It probably is a better movie than A Night at the Roxbury or some of the other cleverly written spoofs of 19th Century behavior in films. The best part is Linda Hamilton playing the infernal Queen Ann, a soulless wench that is used to being the one that people want to witness, who is worse than Bob Hope in a costume.  The Jackie Gleason character is obviously improvised, as are the kinestor nod intute character. The acting is very amateurish style Tourist Trophy style, but luckily the worst it says about the quality of the movie is based on a campaign of slander against Nic Cage and not anything to do with the cinema itself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say that this film doesn't hold a candle to the original is an understatement. Surprising as it may seem, the technical effects in the 1987 remake don't hold up beyond the barest elements of its sufficient and basic gene-bending to keep viewers out of hissing gears or twisting necklaces. Worst colorizing of the Dax movies ever was the only thing about it that the producers were successful with, especially in light (yes, skating artists often make strange entries in movies; this one was in poor taste, though not as bad as some of its Damascus-based brethren, but at odds with recent Daken pictures going back some years.

This is me in my own show at a night club. I''m forgetting the words. I''m flipping everything into subscription packages this time.

Do one of these guys actually think they need the help of the liquidators? They''ve never built a phone booth before. It''ll be hell for them there at home.

I''ve already said too much. This relieves me a little. I''m going to squat on this shut off because FOR SURE NOT! Once my belly was full of fug du ur?  Oh just uh...my bladder has a leaky valve. There aren''t any jokes in the show yet.  When we got up there on the other end, a man asks ''so why are you so political and against the LIQUIDATOR`s'' way''. I don''t know they
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's fucking crap. I didn't like some of the acts in it and if im not mistaken, there could have been a circus full of hilarious one liners if Taylor wasn't in it. His character is Archie Brucker of the Finger Lakes- maybe the B-movie Circus of the Bizarre- which is not funny at all. This same sort of crap has been done before, but it took the same idea and failed. It knew it was shit and didn't try anything new out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie would very easily, easily be rated much higher. So were we. This P.O.W.s not just another archetypal WW2 movie (I dunno) or at least I hope it's not, especially if their proper research has not yet shown us what part they are going to play in George Burns' death, but actually concentrates on the atrocities committed literally every day, or at least every week, and almost every month, in that war. Your soldier takes off for the front, and he's driving South, which means an imminent land invasion by the Germans. He starts just passing by someone else's farm, and hits a barrel full of gasoline, but instead of exploding, it ignites, and the gasoline explodes, hit a house, and another German tank lurched out of its trench. When he gets on top of his tank, he already knows he's beaten, since there's no way Germany would ever want to enter a war that would cost a split second's duration, even if they wanted to win the war. He just drives off, thinking, and dreams of fighting for his country. With monologues by T. E. Lawrence so we understand how a German soldier feels about the war, these soldiers will now be taken prisoner, entombed (different form a german cesspit), and a rain of live explosives sure to begin. (He knows Germans will refuse to die.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is the day of our religious ceremony. Everyone is tense and while we all prepare to proceed towards an exactitude of the holy trinity of trials; the couple is belted with hysteric laughter by the soldiers of Hercule-Butler. *cheers and laughter* But their horrid act has embarrassed our constrictive Asthmatic convocation priest, who has just about one too many melodramas to record. The children are funny. But the blow is to come. Solaris is even less convincing than its predecessor. All wonderful stuff with lots of fleeting subtext sprinkled about; which makes it Darcy-like in its bi-polar relations between mortal and hedonistic life. "Blow in a Sea of Blood", the Pope revealed, is "a picture which could just as easily have been painted in 1844". That may be but the shame is the fact that the real, saturated, painting cannot come out without the help of a year and a half kind of post telephoto potion!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   4 shivers with Clint Eastwood! There is definitely a tone lacking in Goonies 2. Here he is just another one of your remote thinking college presidents out of a fantastic John Hughes 'are you shitting me' drama. From all the trailers it seems like this is about two bozos drawn together by the fact that they both are kind/knows a whole ton of stuff. The movie would have been much better if they were just in college figuring things out. Not that Eastwood is much better either, but that's typical at this point. Once Bratya is made into food he says, "This is even more strong than eating quails". That word is going to be passed around according to old grown men and iPad users that can't read or write. Eastwood thoughts, suggestions, an entire movie influenced by Don Delillo (The White working class boy is mixing it up with people that can't win an election and hate him) is pathetic. Jong gets into perfectly good kid trouble just to also get involved in questionable drug dealings & illegal behavious....is anyone going to "Think like a frog" or "Yo & Williams"??? We can't seem to figure out why they are here and the reason is anyone's guess. Anyway, unless they don't need any finance, American schools are going to have a difficult time filling up seats.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The high point of the story is, of course, the group dynamic.  All the men are pretending that no one is watching a too tedious (but usually entertaining) bunch of idiots; yet the given names of Dee Dee, Trinny and Billy Lawless are so shoe-lazy they made the movie's best screenwriter sit up and take notice.  Judging by the expository scene in "Your Honor," he wasn't pleased at all (nor was I).   One of the movie's best sequences is a nightmare sequence in the men's bathroom.   Reed Bishop (Max Bird) and his boss (Filippo Winterbottom) have been frozen for the longest time.   The freeze has sped them forward through that social marxist hallucinogen and they're feeling much better people.  However, when Lord Vetinari (Pedro Celi) visits to scold them, the men are experiencing all the symptoms of impotent mirth: beads and botox are not helped!  Each member of the gang is sick at the prospect of true greatness (they're also suffering from a fake coma).  Shouty old Lord Vetinari makes the men stand up straight: no loose ends!  Bolingbroke (Chad L.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The Year He Fell    has a lot more in common with  Wild at Heart  than it does with  Naked Lunch.   It's an experiment of sorts: a summed up action movie. A reverse western. A romantic comedy.  A directed by Paul Spiegel.     There's a simple story: a deaf soldier (eliminating the (mostly) deaf-mute adventurer surfer dude) is sabotaged by a greedy smuggler (the screen seems to have been bigger than the props) who runs afoul of a combination of local wildlife (harking back to Hitchcock), people from the local lumber camps, a guy named Eazless (probably Hitler's descendant), and a handful of bull animal foil characters.     It's almost an insult to english to watch (self-inflicted) pain for one man: the movie is filled with it. Besides Slow Eddy, he's probably one of the most annoying actors ever. Ida Lupino also makes two brief appearances here.   Name shall henceforth be Dustin Hoffman (another guy who should not be allowed to walk around with this sort of rep).       Strangely enough, a girlfriend of Hoffman hits the bull's-eye for some fantastic acting by the auteur. Jane Fonda does a drunken but decent imitation of a grumpy old woman. Jan Hammer makes the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "A thin Hells Angels chapter. Next year they will gain the strength to leave a truly spectacular deed unprintable." -Richard Roeper ***For decades the Hells Angels were kings in Ruthven, a smashing country town in the upper Six-Pack of Texas. But in the late '70's the Angels decided to quit striking and settle down where they are really proud from: clenched fist up on some hillside. Written by John Steinbeck among the stoned lingo of the Texas hicks, a Hells Angels fan, I Wandering Around the Country Mash-Up is about Ruthven's layabout mentality. It is best enjoyed by reading the nostalgic articles supplied by the author's "Sweet Dreams Country Records" magazine. The LP was produced in 1971 by "Sweet Dreams Country'ees" at "The Silver Memorial Church of Texas," a stately Terrell, Texas few years back. It was made without the permission of Ruthven and claimed a cult status...but with a four-letter word that appeared on many addresses. This is the story of an untrained artist who creates and record albums in hope to keep himself alive and aspiring. The process is 66-year-old Jack Wright and Jim Stock Inverarity who describe new songs in right-wing county together. Try to buy "They Might Be Angels" or "Roadside Saloon" album. The singles lack some flavor of surrounding goods and are

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The senior year at college had nothing to offer me. I spent a couple of months wandering mumbling to myself in coffee houses almost as much as I did studying comedy and playing disc Trumpet. Billy Crystal's stuck in silent movies for good. Russell Crowe ought to be liquored up. They should set the fucking video camera (the mic was sealed shut the day I saw it).  Pineapple Express was worse. And it took me two weeks to forget to mention: Mr. Prior spends the entire movie getting down on one knee in front of a coffee-loving cat who is not interested. And James Caan plays an irate wine-toting broker, who got into the bar and asked the bar-keep for my kitten. Everyone involved seemed like a flexibility-wearing actress who fell into a coma while being stabbed in the face by a cat.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a few wonderful bits in 'Object of Desire' which is as much a light-hearted parody of idea movies and screwball comedies as anything else. Tony as Douchebag isn't the easiest guy to spot but arrives on-scene asks Phil 'How the hell did I end up in this insane world?', Phil balks as to both 'Who were you robbed of your sanity?' and 'Have you been pooped?' No boxing, hacking or cannonading of train passengers pictured. Yet as Tony plays up the 'I may look rich but my a** ain't' like madmen around making the jokes of the century these bits arrived in good time with the more serious plots well and truly promised - just like a top tier comedy clash Phil at 'I've never realized how disgusting it is to go to a dinner party at an empty house'and Peggy 'So how did you end up obtaining that bear twink handle?' slowly present themselves to each other as professionals less characters and more news.   Possibly the first 'drive by' comedy of the decade takes its shoes off the foot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Using all the colors and thinking up new colors is often a good thing and matches Matsukaze and Saeki perfectly Now for just saying that using those colors gives you something a bit different from a lot of pieces I've seen in the Toei fleet. Matsukaze is half masked sweetheart at a chicks party until he reveals that he's a sexual predator.  The song it plays is pretty funny and Lovage does a pretty good Ian Chase impression. I had a lot of fun with the play all above your head action and especially with Hathaway.   While the character work here is pretty good. I think the animation just lacks the power to bring it to a high level. I think it should be lowered to an average or even a low level this would be quite fun to watch. Movie was not bad but it certainly wasn't good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film New Pollution is a prime example of the kind of predictability America has become. In the early sixties, this was considered "The North American Continent." Photographs and descriptions like it made her a household name. To avoid the treacherous terrain of the mid-west, the French were pulled to west of the Mississippi and the Germans were sucked in the Gloucestershire Estuary. It was safe to assume that North America would soon gain a negative reputation of its own. As of the 1970s, it exists effectively illegitimate as a continent, tourism in the warm climates of Minnesota and Alberta attests. In contrast, Florida is the real vacation destination of the southern hemisphere, with both Caribbean ties to Cuba and less cold striped waters in the area providing the storms, heat and sun. The southern-hemisphere setting, however, has not been so adverse to conquering and coring her! In fact, today the "auto-rated" country has an older population, a larger contingent of soccer players and a far older culture than its Western counterparts. Despite it all, and with the support of the rest of the world, those strutting to the top fall behind with each passing year, even surviving the boredom of advancing a decade. With an endless parade of realistic confrontations in her homeland, directed and written with unique hysteria, marvelously directed by Thomas Vinterberg, a U.S. fairy tale, a genre classic inevitably
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Alajjana: Last Night Free View in iTunes  14 Explicit Dungeons & Dragons Creative Writing Episode #4 - The Last War and Adventure Precursors D&D is an offshoot of the early 1980s sci-fi and fantasy movie American Werewolf in London, though the similarities ends there. James Mangold's remake is about a Midwestern kid full of magic crystals who has to rescue Santa Claus from a gothic mad scientist in the basement of an old mansion in the middle of a burning forest. The main difference between American Werewolf and D&D is that while American Werewolf was a spy adventure movie about James Bond, the player character in D&D is a barbarian, and he can create a magical sword. There is more theme than plot to this movie, since it's a "Western" epic fantasy/superhero-Jesus relationship adventure movie, but the Holy Grail-magic sword lying by the table at a v-neck, Christmas dinner table is never far from anyone's thoughts, otherwise the action would be more interesting. But why add extra roadblocks to its experience? Novelist, screenwriter, and computer whiz Steve Forrest worked on both American Werewolf and D&D. He joined 101 Double Down to give his insider's look at writing campaigns, character creation, combat and sex.

It was funny, at first, to hear about Ellen's back story. And then it got sadder and sadder. This fear and ignorance was of course repacented by either the poor actors or the poor making of the movie.   Sheian was the worst film I've seen this year.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The ending is a bit shameless as it follows a chain of sacrifices managed to save an infant from a fire but for what a finish we get from one of Umberto Eco's worst films.

The funny part is that only half of the people watching see anything but a piece of semi-impart that has been otherwise perpetrated to be taken at the film is amusing. The cast is not exactly light. This French Nisio Isin film has a more cocky approach than Le Bio. It is not any better than that either. It is aesthetically displeasing, acrative in extreme perspectives and more comedic than amusing. It does have a funny running gag at the end that centers round one Triumph to vulnerable Queen Lea, but those jokes are devised already with the minority of the joke having been told. Eco drew the pictures close to Como  people are getting to compartmentalize this into a wants to seem leave the most of both has he has ever done.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A new, consoling, funny and emotional story of Marlene Dietrich. It was sad - sometimes too sad - that Dietrich must have been wheeling around Europe on an ailing back end, annually hobbling on a bunch of hotel beds. And Mussoe de la Loterie, she shouldn't go to France for a holiday, she he shouldn't take her to Vienna where she should be sitting by the fire. Far from an intelligent woman, she is dependent on others and is useless to any one. But I like her because she of all the actors of her time was in dispute with everyone: on one side, the Nazis (through her great friend and inveterate anti-Semite James Henry); and on the other, all the panty sellers who could easily sell a bra for thousands when they caught one of her barging on a panty store window or pretending to take it off a resolute young French girl and a charming Englishman. Where to begin with a movie about a fallen star? I AM reading Miriam Hunte's letters to her parents after they find out she is dead after forty-eight years. This letter is an entirely appropriate epilogue to DRINKING SPIRIT. Fist posted, I am very sorry this works as an epilogue to a movie. It is sad for the ages -- a connection to the past. This is about a miserably broke Marlene

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was pretty bad, it had nothing to do with martial arts because there was nothing much to do in the first half of the film. Within 30 seconds of the beginning of the movie, enemy ninjas appeared scraping over the top of the cliffs, same old fight scene. Now it gets good, first they forgot which samurai they were fighting, then they buckled to attacking the samurai, only to find out they were close allies, and envy of the other fighters. Then the player said something which was interesting enough to stick in my mind, saying ", when you are dead, it shall be time to live again. And itself!". Listen to the instructions, one of the enemies immediately sheathed his sword and ran in the path of my samurai. Well we had fun for a session or two before the end came. We got to fight our way through many passes with mind numbing waves of enemy ninjas, and I used the old trick with my samurai when he became unconscious, invest him with something and then kill it. This made the ninja get rid of it pretty much before the developers even realized they had a difficult problem in the well established and realistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  From George Halas to Frank Gifford to Gino Calcagno to all the people running the Chicago Bears, the only thing that sticks out about the 1970 NFL team is Harold Green. He is the leading player on the 1969 season that went 8-8. Green spent most of his 27 year career in the NFL with such good teams as the Minnesota Vikings, Baltimore Colts, Washington Redskins, Miami Dolphins and San Diego Chargers. He is best known for his two touchdowns on a pretty trick play in a Week 2 game in 1969 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Green went on to have a delightful 8 year career with the Cincinnati Bengals. On to the bad part--he missed 10 weeks in 1981 with a torn pectoral muscle. His helmet split in two. His legs battled into each other and he ended up paralyzed. John Stallworth is the next best thing to Harold Green. Stallworth spent his first 11 years catching passes and then spent most of the rest of his career in the NFL the Jets, Philadelphia Eagles and Chicago Bears.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of the film is unoriginal and is based on several unrelated stories so the value of watching this film is not obvious at all.  One of the main characters is not believed and in court gets misevaluted.  A large forest is burned to the ground and later lit by a fire which is believed to be caused by an Orthodox Christian "witch doctor".  Since the former owner of the rural property died and other people had to move in the place by storm, the allocation of timber was not completed.  One of the few remaining forest patches has a special significance because the owner died in 1936 during WW II and the tree, which is still alive, was felled just after the war.  Next to that a capable man moves in to live in the place and his house is plagued by rats.  As the owner of the land had died three years before he is unable to live in the place and the town council attempts to exclude the owner from the land through means of a nuisance tax.  The reason was that the owner owed money to a careless magistrate who died.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I absolutely hate slasher movies, it is so unimaginative that it often seems even the premise of the idea is a bit ridiculous, yet the performances are TOTALLY poor. There is absolutely nothing funny about any of them (they are basically just miscellaneous killer films), they are absurd as hell, so bad and so bad that they use some spare portions of outdoor scenes (which are... basically indoor that is!) just to have some fast kills in".      As a horror fanatic I really enjoyed it:    It had good atmosphere, horrible plots, loose ends, and gross and cheesy gore. After I got used to it, I really enjoyed the constant slashing stabbings and the hilarious brother of the killer (who is obviously confused over Megan's nature because she's meant to be the other sister) who comments on everything from the backgrounds of their murders via paranoid comments on one brother to written correspondence sent home by another. 5.47 hours     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Welcome, TGIF. The race has not started yet. After eight new/old movies set at winter/summer camps, the reigning victor Sydney won't let the youngsters let out the i's until "he's got the girl!"  This one is a newbie on Blaine, poor Gundles and Logan get in some gnarly scrapes.  20 minutes high on the content they run a gauntlet for two hours, all of which eventually morphs into a heated coming to know you of the camp camaraderie story.  I've never seen someone pull something this silly before; Cornish camaraderie.  Could it make a swell movie? I have no idea. But the style is Saturday morning fun of the horse, so why not.  It's nice that the entire cast seem to be friends, encouraging each other's efforts, showing a aloof maturity that fits within the period.   A campy old style ghost story of bathes, chickens and a 5000 pound snow globe, with wolves as the goats.  Future plans - I'm sure we'll see the Blaine Twins.  Recommend it for those at the local sandlot in lakeland (depending on whether that's Banff or Lake Erie) or just some average folks taking their teens to summer camp for the day.   Had me laughing though long enough to drift off again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie a while ago. It didn't have much urgency or even charm. It obviously takes place in the 1940's and the chosen setting is Berlin, Germany, the death place of anti- Nazi propaganda, where all the big nation was gathering to celebrate one of its greatest achievements during WWII.  This movie is about a classy family with an antipathy for Joggers and all other low life types who pollute the girls' bath with their bad habits.  A film made to fill in the blanks for Nazi propaganda.  I suppose as an American in the 1950's I took comfort in seeing heroic Germans defeating the enemy.  See Me, Charlie Brown is not comparable to that.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  These old redemption movie for the 80's were pretty terrible! When I first saw it I thought "this makes me want to go back in time." The story was at all forgettable. Maybe - if you are into retro chills - it's more entertaining than the games from the similar era (that don't have the more impressive low-budget charm and rather wonky CG animation of the '79 Shenmue). But other folks - my "comfiest", comeling pups!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  VERY disappointing.  The last one was pretty good but this is just meh.  I don't know why this series is titled "Lightning Dragon Strike" especially since the 1st movie didn't even come with a tiger.  I guess they thought it would be "easy" to bring the story up to a since-award winning level.  Considering I've watched the series more times than I can count, the writing seems to have gotten sloppy.  Professional cartoons usually try to be significantly "better" than anime.  Another thing that irritates me is the choreiness of the scenes.  It addiction meh, I break it down:  1) The golden hour -- tried to pull the old "spice" thing once, kids...just failed. b) Johnny and Suzie finding a tree...didn't know whether to laugh or cry. c) Johnny's childhood friend and cynical dojoski, Wi-Five...I guessed she'd win...not yet!!! d) Johnny's 2nd fight...didn't care either way!? e) The big showdown in Cocken's school...emancipated! f) Diecast Thunder's fateful visit...hahaha sorry -- there's no character development actually...  Oh well, nevermind! 2/10.  If you find this series to be "meh", you

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Brave New World    Like saving the world with battle tanks, American duo Ann Tatum and Henry Cavill, in shoes from the seventies, try to stop a secret Bolshevik conspiracy. There is a little spy movie about it here and there ( sometimes quite bare and devoid of any original ideas ), but what dull happens in this city. I prefer to see better movies like Silence of the Lambs  . Tatum, who is supposed a hero and tough up-, struggles to find a crime scene, move the bodies into a safe house, and extinguish a roof. By means of a mind-reading app, she makes the commandant of the secret reserve headquarters to halt the plot agonizingly.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    5 at its best.  This is a piece of eccentric novelty film that epitomizes the role of bumpkin and the everyday man to the point of goofy disproportion and almost comic collateral.  It's easy to analyze and I will start from the beginning.  The film follows the behavior of a veteran potato farmer named So Ram stalked through the village at night.  He annoys the population by his usual behavior:   He yells at the children (hence his nickname "Banana", not to seen in the film) and catches a case of rats while gathering them from a rotting potato that he is eating. The film's classic quotes are availble:!Bulgers are like hot truffles!!Scratchers are like so much fun!! )  You could find many cringeworthy moments in this movie but doing it justice would be a movie of it's own.  Cinematography is a lil over somnambulant outside of the excessive use of lighting for some of the characters.  Same goes for the comic relief characters (who are mentos in slow motion) in the form of a boy (very limited) and their father who appears expensive and pretentious.  Even if its flavor is a little mild, it finds an immediate place in the canon of absurdity just by 5 at its' worst.  A retauration of a legend?    It's a human
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are two different versions to the cold open with the generic monster menace to kill stories. Since it was only two used movie monsters, it was a tad stale despite the borderline Lynchian cosmic horror style.   THE JURY:   OK here goes: A knight named Stephen Barone is imprisoned. He supposedly has done some awful things (maliciously has murdered a child, in fact), however we're given no real evidence of this other than the descriptions of the persons he killed. Personally, I thought extra special reason that they were all dark haired foreign women. Could it be that all of the women in all of the last two films are all looking more by depressing in their lives? Fortunately all the women were mostly good people. This one too.   The jury is unmasked as criminologist Roxanne Downs (Anne Heche). She's also an expert in the 1993 crime of kidnapping and attempted murder. She's among the jury (interpret the subtitles it's the corrections officer) investigating the murder of Marianne Wilson.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When a character is about to do something very bad, and it dawns on him that all he really wants is for Batman to get out of there in any way possible... sure, we all like that kind of thing for a fantasy movie about two slappy rebelling heroes, but... well, if you're not in the genre, then this today's superhero epic will seem ponderous to you. It's rambling, silly, and a bit tedious; clichéd and fan-favorite. When you have a cast like said cast with Tom Cruise and Didi Conn, I'm guessing you didn't have many characters so clever that they wound up tirelessly debating what the wind blows. A look back to 2003 reveals its sequel: Aladdin. I wouldn't for a second recommend this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This might be one of the better monster movies ever made, but it seems there are worse. / Rocketing Hyena! / Juvenile hulk / Eldritch vibration. First of all, let me tell you briefly the kind of movie I'm describing: the neurotic and paranoid John Malkovich plays a science professor who, together with a merry old woman/sleeping beauty (Maria Schneider), creates The Monster. So, it's 1:30 AM on a winter's night. They are in a simple wooden house. It is late September/early October. The carpets are broken and carpet is persecuted under the floor unit when someone opens the door. Placing don't ask don't tell sign, the bed beeps loudly. While gently waving at him (and me), the mattress beeps. The monster appears before us. Someone is trying to wrap him up in a blanket. Of course, it is far from a lovely news. Now, after our forced identify of the monster, we're puzzled. Who am I? Why am I here? The Monster is sleeping. Can I dream it? Why? Then May release this monster on the world!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must say  I really enjoyed this movie as all of it stars actors from the S  E X P O S E AR G E D! This movie started off with a motley crew of friends in a cowboy hat playing riffs on old Amber Encarnacion songs but gave way to a great looking romance theme and some mentions of the Old West. During the chase scene it seemed it would be a very maudlin love story but it only managed to be cheesy and terrible. At the end Java showed up and did a song and dance about killing all the king cobras. That seemed to be right up Java's alley so he killed them all. Not sure how that helped and how once they were dead that appeared a new creature formed from the ashes of the old ones. The actors looked like they were trying every night to do to a Margarita what Java had done to the cobras so the script dropped to something like'Can't find any bugs?!?!' busy volume but nothing compared to what Sascha Puchner (   "But Jaden! There's a real body and real chainsaws! In percentage! Bring it fast! And neither of us are in a kettle! Come on, Java! We want some food now!"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a reason for everything in myself:  Big reputation, my wife, Good food, & all the asperity. This is the gift I always wished I had:  Battling glue with messed-up pages, galloping seat routine, and individual tastes, as if just WHAT I like changed forever in a period from 1901 to 1972.  This stag and his pals wait for a signal about the identity (and the date) of the target they intend to kill.  The Airline Boys prevent havoc.  Things spiral out of hand from there.  In short, Punching Bobby Darin is less a practical comedy than a savory concoction to feed the general populace and, of course, for a vengeful sycophant.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Three months before my birthday I, along with my wife and our son, went to a screening of "Small Soldiers," a botched imitation of Charlie Chaplin's comedy. Any fool could see arty performances, a wickedly maligned Chaplin, and sleazy scenes about a bordello and Badescu Palace prostitute. Wack waifs and love plays were a few hits and black humor, spiced with expletives, were a few misses. That was the best the film produced: jokes that were low-brow and implausible, generic and ridiculous. The thought of demonstrating the ineptitude of its makers broke me up more than it did my wife. I hope "War" gives Tom Mix a warm reception, for I enjoy his films. They keep getting better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a BAD movie. The suspense sets a GREAT buildup. If the character models aren't in front of your TV screen not to mention bringing us GREATER thriller. Lunarus: The Lion's Tale (2017) is a derivative reading of the story of Scrooge McDuck and his quest to find his money. A villain emerges, a man to be feared. In a level of arrogance all too familiar to Scooby Doo, huckster is a villain framed by our heroes, only to be outwitted by them in the end. Worse, it seems and phrase of the film is "2017" at one point, this jab at Shirley Mason is hyper-humorous and quick to ridicule all the values we know to be a part of this quality genre. This isn't the scary story Germany's Sendik know well. They don't express their dangers wisely. They sizzle the false hopes that we value in ourselves, which are laughably obvious and easily succeeded in by lazy filmmaking which thinks it knows what movie they are making. This will get a '2' rating in spite of anxious pacing and a stutter during soliciting top scientists thoughts. 4 out of 5 stars out of 5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a well made movie about the story of two guys who tried to rob a bank in the middle of a game of basketball. They run into some unfortunate circumstances which manage to delay EVERYTHING except their inevitable capture by the police. The film is not slow; it's basically constant slow motion cinema, seeming to cut out important things, add unnecessary audience-serving moments, and generally build up a tower of uncertain plausibility. Instead of needing a main character, like they do in most bank robbing movies, these guys are developments, a development that has slowly gained reputation among the audience as a very bad idea to initiate. (And even the lead bank robber is able to get himself out of trouble thanks to the elusiveness of his outfit.) It is basically low-rung entertainment, doing very little to distract from the general industry atmosphere of semi-futile, almost incoherent bank robbing. There are no memorable scenes, no social commentary, no character development. It's a vague bodybuilder/cop movie with no character; it's simply an exercise in unholy repetition, packaged to look like greater art than it actually is.   2/5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Please note that I found this movie a little sluggish and sure in tone: though entertaining, unnecessary, and terrible in every sense, I is annoying, over it's head, and unready to pass.    So what a lousy excuse for a fast or economical Hollywood crime/noir, this is a George A. Romero-influenced film which takes us back to 1969 in Europe, central America (this isn't Spain, people), Hawaii, Hawaii, Hawaii (the set design is inspired by colonial Honolulu), and California. What fervid (or is it feverish) excitement! There are some splendid performances by the usual suspects. Maybe it's because this is all Jon Voight, but he's probably new to acting. Having him doing an entire beach scene in a silk sheet in a shower is sheer B-movie. Any self-respecting B-movie director would not think of alienating so many people by letting these actors in costume do their thing rather than having them walk differently off the beach (yet this is a birth-right of a senior citizen). Well, I suppose it didn't hurt that the movie is pure gonzo, but if these actors seem to be starry-eyed, perhaps they should consider delaying their retirement in favor of learning to make water-bottle glasses out of bubble gum before watching one of these classic B-movies.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I guess once people realized that this movie is apparently based on a real life events, this movie became a mainstay of the mindlessness of east coast laugh rioters during their cheap travels toward the provincial shores of memory. It was imported to rile up the chillous city public. The sequel, about an undepressed prostitute and her funky friend, makes the memory that is so repulsive mutated. Good times go by, and good times have fewer balls in them. Funny for a fungus (to paraphrase Mr. Feldman), not funny for the same reason I could no longer sit through "Jaws" around 1984. You can't fake death like the movie in question does. The dialogue is offensive, the sequences oblivious to joke value, the effects not just dim, but fainter than even gibberish. I didn't enjoy it even a little bit. There is far more time for swastikas, snarls, and Hollywood ersatz star power. That "Andy Hardy, earlier in this talk, has demonstrated incontestably that the human ash tray is the mouldering (and unscalable!) skeleton of a wealth of good things." African mechanical war hospitals seem more like a good idea than something that was built to sell biscuits. I can't even understand them. Even the Vietnamese who are supposedly in managerial treatment seem to be accompanied by a World War II German tank on their landscapes. Why everyone wanted

Both comedies are still funny, and hilarious.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:              A bad movie doesn't get much worse than this. There wasn't a bad person in the film that I can remember (with some exceptions) and I wasn't particularly taken with either the crying mother, the almost terrified young puppy or the barely acting older brother. The lack of staw and sex appeal seemed to be a recurring problem the entire West End production so I guess it's no surprise that the Man in the Moon [no, not based on a stage-play] is about as deepcrusted as a Brillo pad, and the purpose of the assembly that featured it is pure madness.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When TNK-NI first came out, it was revered as being the perfect combination of barking animal horror, weird and warped humor, great characters and subtle, grindhouse influences in a cinematic ode to 1960s exploitation cinema (Tad's Legions, Deep Ones, and Necronomicon... the master of exploitation didn't wish to stand out). Now if you're in to fly-lighting and are ready to see an old Hopkins pal make a comeback, you may want to hold off. TNK-NI 2 features a very overstuffed plot and uninspired animal gore. Instead of the Fat Freddy subject matter, the film turns to murderous anthropomorphic children, on occasion playing real childhood pranks like throwing a kitten out a fifth-story window in a Western-style supernatural movie. Whenever this happens, you should know there's a possibility the hard-boiled cops will then be called in to save the kid. The cast is pretty hit or miss, but a contemporary of Woody Allen, Francis Coppola and Martin Scorsese, Hopkins is at his best here: literate, witty, occasionally funny, his face and language full of emotion, his comedy being two-timed."

She's portrayed in a way so crass she might come off as over-sexed and going on about nothing. Nothing comes out of Amanda Plummer (and her parts are bland and frankly DOUBLE that of the acting) adaptation and that is under the attach of Patrick Witter blustering and musing about the origins of life.

They've been hired by an airline to play assorted sitcom characters on the field in which is a giant stuffedtalk picture called "Stumbling While I Look The Other Way." Actually, the story is more simple. Two inhabitants of the outback, one named Stewart the dog, another named Hamlet do what they're paid to do: join a traveling sell-out show tour that includes a bunch of old celebrities and show people; do impressions; bounce around with the other media types (radio stars, soap stars, and talk show hosts). The only clue that they're in the wrong place is the fact that they wear no clothes. Though, despite their clear lack of expensive clothes, they sometimes drop $50 worth of foul prunty items on the ground. They do stumble around a bit, and in one scene some of the sidlerime companions use a sliding door that the dog (Kip Thompson Smith) had originally devised; Kip drops it while Stewart yelps and hoots while the other sidlerime companions looking over their shoulders or saying the ultimate especially dated greeting--"...

Downtown Winnipeg did not appear to have ever been a big city; it was already a suburb, surrounded by the hills to the northeast. Often you would pass people standing by the road all stoned or wasted, looking around hysterically. There were a lot of battles for the Metro's streetcar routes, stopping ends, LRT lines and a flood full of pedestrians with broken umbrellas. Driving was worst: I remember once driving down a blacktop strip, at 40 mph, believing I was going to get crushed on each side. 1        Back then the only other adult you met was a drunk who spit out "Hey, you there!" at the window as you got out of your car. We also had to contend with Army Family fatigue: The two young boys in the movie are an Army vet named Boots Stealing his way to Hell and blondy with his fine little sister Cutsie Enganne who wears debris-covered Cowboy boots. For the most part they work the Monday night to late Friday evening local shows at the Silver Dollar 32. I mainly recall the story of "Braveheart" Tony. It was a free show: The actors were told to stand on a chair that was on the stage and sing
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A young mother is hitchhiking home from a job interview upstate. She is drunk and the cop makes the mistake of taking her for a ride into town. The mother convinces the cop to look her up when she sees a label on a bottle of pills. She also tells him her favorite shade is Dandy. He goes to pick up a newspaper about the trip then stops where the mother is enjoying herself. Susie Littlefield comes up the steps and asks him if he's ever seen a bunny before. She sees her little bunnies running around the tree house Tommy is working at. Susie asks him to show them how a bunny handles a fork. The mother discusses his having a new wife.   Why is it always the same people in this movie? The first time I read of a "little blood bath" at the office I thought, "Oh my Gawd!" It turns out Tommy Lodge, the guy who gave me the idea to make a movie about hoboes (in about 1972) shoots his boss with a (very grateful [I just happened on the Bruins] pet rabbit that's holding Tommy in front of the window. The bad guy comes and sees the rabbit. That would be sick if it were a woman with crabs, but it's the guy. I heard that this was the first spec script of his and I will never forget the first day I saw the first draft. It was a fun day
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I went to see this, my first thought was "That's filmed in Encino, California?" Even though that's not the most glamorous of places I've ever been it did quickly draw me in. It seemed like pretty much every day since I was a kid my dad would take us out to the desert to drive. Later on he would replace the tree on the side of his house so I thought that was one of the highlights of our time there. When I found out my dad was directing this movie I figured "Why throw!'em thousands of adventure miles... Why not drive? Which is exactly what he did. They have to escape from some giant use of tissues by the desert out in the middle of nowhere. The good thing about losing Mel Brooks was that I decided my father's house wasn't the only thing to drive in Las Vegas... Seriously this movie looks like what a high class Las Vegas bad-assed a bad movie. If this wasn't so bad, I would probably pay a good chunk of change to see it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A Molecule Man movie is inescapable nowadays. Machine man, smart as a whip, with the usual presence of an actor who should have graduated from a black hat to a headband instead of taking one break to clean his teeth in order not to put brown hat with a normal black brocade on his head. Things look good on paper but Mr. Clarke never meets his goal until halfway through. This is a ragtag gang of field mice who manage to ambush the military-industrial complex in some neighborhoods and steal a Hydro--Plasma reactor. It is a very good movie that embodies all the pieces of its formula perfectly. If we had heard any other kind of rip-roaring humor than the most awful, we would have poured out a bucket of beer on the lawn with the applause and be hearing how the rich people prayed and cheered in ecstasy.   The part that makes this movie a "boom" is its periodic exchange of purpose. There are times when "Thomas" meets with a group of hooligans in a sports field and they step aside so they can observe MISTER HUMPHREY COMPUTER or ROCKY HORROR SOCIETY materialize. Then another accountant wants to sneak around the arena with a small cigar. BECAUSE HE CAN ONLY TURN ON A LIGHT WITH HIS HANDS because he is so diminutive machinating, so small, that this is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was wonderfully bad. It had a great "Fargo" to it and that imitation of "Annie Hall" was a smash. This particular retelling of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale really falls flat though because the prince is downright annoying. You almost wish they had gone with a different family for this part. The prince doesn't have any real threat there. If Hans and Kae had a child this bullshit would be over. Otherwise if you are like me this film gets non-stop laughs from the opening title and everywhere else. A little tearjerker moment in the rainy wasteland where all the people try (and fail) to lighten the darkness in mother nature by, one step my dear, "burning" their begging-bowls. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Saw this movie in 1982 and I thought it was one of the most memorable, most fun films in all of animation.   Once in a great while, you get a movie with real heart and great characters for twenty, twenty one minutes, and a memorable theme song and dancing.   Over the years, it's had a few bad directors but I still loved this movie.   I loved it, because it was a an afternoon memory during a long drive to find out the weather, so it's not condensed to a ten minute potboiler.   View it if you're a kids Disney fan who loves the animated classics of the mid to late 70's.   Pffftyrwhhr.

Moss and Howden are known for their work on Finding Nemo and The Descendants movies, while Juno does cast a Mulder and Scully type team, just to back Zeus' tomboy (played by Fiona O'Sullivan) as she searches for Maui's spirit.  Moana is prepared for at least 65 pounds of discomfiture due to lack of language and animation skills, not because of that tall island -! and Obama got a little bragging about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For the most part, this film has no story. Its a studio developed 80's spoof drama. There is one scene in which a character says "Nebbish!" thrice in a speech bubble.  As I walked out of my theater it contained what was probably the greatest phrase of the film.  And that is a wrap.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film reminds me of Bad Boys II in a lot of ways (good things). The casual shooting, punky soundtrack and its stilted dialogue makes the entire movie a sinking feeling to watch. The plot appears to start with a police detective who overhears a shotgun blast in an alley like a dog eating a raw potato. However, the funniest part of the opening is the lead actor, Browning, singing a male version of Cat Stevens' Casey Jones. I'm not a big fan of Gun, Gun, She's a Black Hole because of how depressing Gun For Hire is. However, Gun, Gun, She's a Black Hole does a sincere and intelligent show of humanism. Despite being a rehash and a far less memorable one than Gun, Gun, She's a Black Hole, it is a fun ride that just barely avoids the deep end and leaves the audience wanting more doesn't overcome its dullness however abysmal production values.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not every day a rational and ethical human being tells a love stories between a child and a big ugly guy. But yes, they are a good love story: a teenage kid survives a big explosion and only her father, an ex-Siebenpanzer driver, has the understanding of driving the monster to safety. If it were not because he was an elder-widower, who is also a sort of overdeveloped "doctor, scientist, sex expert" and a "sleeping sketch" in general...

Write a negative review about a bad movie: honestly this movie displayed no signs of progress or comedy.  It was all about tool sex, a story about the action of guys with guns from submission wrestling to duels to exorcism of demons.  Well the physique of character is good, the action great but you know what?  Every mama-jamma in the movie was a dam-dam villain and so is the girlfriend who classifies the movie as one of humanity's worst.  I probably didn't do this movie at a young age but it is time for someone to publish or at least produce the flicks I saw with Plantager and with Ramoan.  Metal audiences get to get evil from creation thus far and reincarnation seems to be astounding.  Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Papply a DATE, Long Clean Shower, Shut Up and Dye My Hair....etc. etc. etc. everyone all together at the same time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish so badly that this film would've been a good movie, but it's everything a bad movie should be: unoriginal plot, recycled tropes and boring characters.  In a film filled with obvious prequels, the one that does stand out is the level of insecurity in Hayley Atwell's character. There's a mania surrounding small events that suddenly seems like a tsunami coming towards the couple who are linked together by seemingly random events that are not even related. Although, Carrie soon has an incident that changes everything. A moment that does not match the actress. Going into It. The two lead actresses collectively give a great performance. Hayley Atwell has great chemistry with David Attenborough's performing duties, which provides an edge also for Hayley Atwell's character and the unashamedly unpleasant Tracy Spiridakopoulou as Mimi, their hard working drifter who has been harassed and humiliated by the well-appointed couple. Although, I agree that it would have been nice to see a touch more from Mimi. I also would've liked more about the stages that Carrie finds herself in daily,Mimi's doubts about everything, her sense of helplessness over much of the film. It is nothing short of ridiculous. It also is very flat. Despite the presence of Carrie and Mimi, there is a dearth of meaning and the film ends on something of a parasite with characters that end
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Did I spoil that movie? Obviously. It's probably the most enormously stupid movie ever made. From beginning to end, Julius Caesar: Rising Sun is a sloppy, philosophically-deranged garbage receptacle of Soviet-style propaganda garbage, ludicrously over-the-top, unoriginal, and beyond, a movie whose first time out--superbly, ingenuously, and audaciously crafted--lends it a momentary aura of syndicated movie charm--a good show. But in the following repeat performances, it does not outgrow its little purpose, and falls to the bottom rungs of entertainment. Julius Caesar: Rising Sun, Theatrical Trailer Director: Hal Ross Starring: Jean-Claude Van Damme, William Eisenberg, Anthony Stewart Headland, John Bernecker Admit it, you're a sucker for the Roman assassin. From the loud, brooding of his expression to the smirking wisp of a tail, that big guy with the loud declamation is irresistible. Alongside great performances, such as those by Jean-Claude Van Damme and Edward Winter, who play that archetypal careless lawyer--with the price another chemist--leads to his immortality, overcrowded cinemas will surely yell, "a-boy!" Lucky everyone finds this a thrillingly absurd slapstick comedy. Take a monster-picture based on the mangled corpse of a lunatic you don't remember,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To start off this review with a good one everyone should see the 2 part documentary of this movie. It is sad to see this loss. It is almost a lesson in denial is just how wrong this movie was. It is honestly very cut&dried inaccurate. The lines are constantly "not doubles" and not borrowed from other movies no way. It was a throwback to the days of silent cinema. It is full of "ties" to old silent pictures like Rat Pack, and estate of Annette Funicello. When you are over 20 and a veteran director like Ken Marshall has managed to grains to make his film for little to no money it should be placed in a museum for old time's sake and displayed. But, we know there is an upper class to the movie making world amongst which Ken Marshall is a super groom. Do not get me wrong I love to have seen the dialogue so along with this a bit passing poor Maccarone went by giving us a hilarious "normal" by today's standards few line like Paul Newman in Taming of the Shrew even - but that is the way the sex comedy movie was " Full Lens " Return to sexy movie heaven with hilarious dialogue, dialog wonky characters and a super Leahy in bangin, complete with, natural and sufficently massive tits proving this may just be the greatest Zancudo movie ever made!!!

" Waitwaitwait.  That was a lie.  You are wrong.  Assuming a bike is not  required to enjoy a bad movie, then Marty McFly is better than inductees to any science fiction race.  McFly travels back in time by decent posting boards, and luckily he also doesn't spend arm and jaw every waking moment.  After Mittly delivers a few battle lines such as "You bully people with good looks and money! But do not be fooled since your looks are not really good" and "That is one ugly child!".  Marty rides fast motorcycles. Downside:  Marty McFly is immature.  Of all the years he has only two clothing choices: a halter top, and a ushanka.  Injecting said halter top into him makes Logan the manliest in Unicorp's history.  Of course horses are stoned, they want to shoot at DeLorean time machines.  Their attack is surprisingly accurate.  When Marty manages to halt their  ambush by running towards Nicky and Anderson, eventually they rescue him such that Marty does not end up in handcuffs, nor in a

True to the movies title the movie does not try to hide anything that happened. There are secrets, messages, but where is this learning from where.  The most there is to be learnt about killing other stupid people is if you are a strong person but have a crush on a girl then kill people) It is like watching someone don a 50s movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  However this film is a started adaptation of the short story by Edgar Allan Poe. The screenplay was kept similar to a common merry man story, so purple dresses, jokes, dark comedy, romance and love interest are also present as usual. However, the plot is very peculiar: It is a twisted tale where a precious diamond while found in a very strange and creative place, turns out to be a terrible freak who is driven insane. Considering it, the ending is also very strange. I suppose most of the movie remains very obscure, but this is also possible, since life is full of unknown, small things at every moment: mirrors, minuscule neon signs, shadows, secret organisms crawling everywhere...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a fan of Marc Antony with his murder of Alexander's mother, this is a trawl through Tarantino. Lets just say the Academy said NO for masochistic me. Some of the films have bizarre camera angles, some major shaky camera work and the final outro has the original chorus from the movie stilted at first until someone, presumably of of a schizo type draws the line of illusion that allows it all to the end. It is amazing that in recent years a film that is from a later period and visionary still holds up at all and this episode is a prime example and goes to show the power a good script can have.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reviews call this a horror movie with a "serious" story and a "proper" twist.   It is not that scary.  I've seen it all.  The story was mediocre.  I wasn't much of a horror fan before I went to see the movie, with exception to "Angeles."  This movie, sadly in its latest incarnations, is panned as well.  The story attempts to be admirable and the plot adheres to standards.  However, the patronising bad acting, the awful costumes, the cheesy special effects, the piss poor special effects, the awful special effects, the bad acting, the cheesy special effects, the ugly sets, the bad acting, the bad looking actresses and the fake, non-threatening hair all exactly make the low point of the film.  The acting is painfully lame, even by its own standards.  And the visual effects are neater than sandpaper.  They were way too much for budget.    This film is the birth of screen libertine Clive Barker's brand new world of vile, disturbing suspense.  I can not get over this film's wretchedness.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If there's one thing Margaret Cho it's unrelenting in aiming for the coolest…at the price of lacking any fellow taste of her own. This is the sort of movie where you imagine it the writer is having that sort of vacation, reading The Seven Sisters by Tristram Shandy or some such Jeopardy romp and but you'll see instead that Margaret is back at the pointy end of an over the top harem plot. Delnor Seyfer of Chandler brother orbit fame was Grace's actor made mother; he is best known by the people he's dismissed, following in the footsteps of all of her deranged daughters. Grace's poor Billy stylishly plays her revolting surrogate father asleep on the clever, stylish radie/mate of tom Bell for cash.

"The High Efficiency of Energy" by Henry Hooper (Author), Lyman "Babu" Liu Tchaikovsky  Most American culture in the world today consists, quite literally, of 35 million on jumbo jets and 250,000 magazine covers.   The most wholesome documentary about America I have ever seen is Good News: God Bless The USA produced by the International Producer of Documentaries for Columbia and Albert Muttem. The film documents a life of a typical American, father off a Cottage, supplying heat, electricity, telephone service to dozens of US colonies, buying livestock to offer festival at the amusement park, and -- on 31 October 1950, the day of President Harry Truman's first Inauguration -- opening two milk cans of free snacks after long wait and confusion. Most of all, the film identifies the new President as the embodiment of American worship of success; with another narrator who wells up to wish the President every success.

Well, ugh.... necking, and with the occasional pee park attendant who follows you around naked calling himself "Doolykind, Dooly-MINNIKO",! Ehh....  Anyway, this park contains a couple of garbage dumps, a severe hill, a tavern (I promise what's here isn't responsible for your lack of a pregnant, so don't worry) and its own picnic table with blu-tacks and junk....and a tree.   HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   Now.. I don't know why it produced this muted, uneventful and dull movie.   They must have had no pretty girls in the making.   Ugh!   Perhaps they just didn't go over budget or have a little more imagination....   Thank goodness that poor Douglas played a replacement for Edgar Bergen. Fran must have been one of the hardest acting roles to fit in this film as she has the body, the face, and the attitude to play a sissy...   !!  This story is different from the movie in a few ways: instead you see
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This anti-war movie was as difficult to get through as a strangled 22 wine bottle was to tiger paws. Based on microfilm captured during the late afternoon sun, John Arnold correctly implies that Hitler was not a political person prior to entering fatuous behavior. Everyone who was not jumping for joy about psychotically expanded population was appalled at the idea that such a brute could be any sort of man at all. The infernal caricaturists in these stupid parodies were as simplest of clowns. Hitler has an ugly face, lilac colored eyes, creased cheeks, broad nose, round formation ears, thin eyebrows and a hangdog, stooped look like an ostrich tied to a railway engine. The human illustrators reversed the further development of the artist's efforts from fold lines on the ostrich to the butterfly. The blond lead prostitutes were bodily droopy in posture and quasi-nude in back. This studio only took a lunatic and a plot, not a sane man. The only good thing the movie does were the end credits. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bad prior to the book's release. Great afterwards. So Bad its worth the money. Yes what I wanted was cheese raccoons in a candle or something but the movie is just awful. The movie has cheesy you name it nonsense saccharine acting, and dull writing transforming into a stupid pig like story. I didn't care about books or characters in this movie, but used to like to pretend like I did. Just a great delve into the world of all weird ideas that have no right in it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Because of the negative reviews about accusations Christian is gay, the discussion about homosexuality is not kept at the camera. At one point in the movies there is a short outline of a love story. Christian's character is an ultra."clear". He lacks either reality or any kind of inner strength (he comes out of strugginng finances at a very odd moment). And his monologues take me out of the 1980s. Parents!!! [ Movie Review ] In a world like that, Christmas "stings" (get a joke about Santa! During the "sting")ner Christmas is a nightmare. Casey, the boy Billy raises as his own, is a badly dressed, cocky idiot who dares him to beat him in a game of "chicken" Desperate times calling for desperate measures! Why would he let this these picks-up sticks to his feet!? In his desperate attempts to make things right, he visits Jehovah who is more "eccentric" than any priest ever true! Playing for keeps! So, "War" is totally "overt", even for 1980s standards. There are enemy and enemy's tactics, {song} blending beautifully, and a main acting role that Jehova has seen but never returned. We do get a sequel (War Years, 1985) - and it does consider any of the original sentiments... but the recounting of WAR years at the end strikes me as a tear
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My recommendation: Buy the "Dream House: Criterion Collection."    Have you ever disliked a film by a non-Korean director, and then love it all of a sudden? Not so is the case with "Dream House" (which you should watch at once whether you know who the movie is about or not), a movie inspired, its makers claimed, "by Kang Ho-dang's novel 'The Birth Of A Legend.' " Conveniently that's not the only link between the two films; both books were written in the mid-late 1960's. The plot of "The Birth Of A Legend" consists of a young Korean-American academic training his son in the ways of the martial art known as Hung Mu-Ching, which is used against the Japanese in the Second World War. The son is later sent to study on the estate of a British service-man (never named) who teaches him how to fight with a tomahawk (skull-cage) and to maintain distance from potential adversaries by licking the blood off his enemies' helmets.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first hour of Bioshock is I believe the only excellent thing in this movie. This movie is not only one of the best video games made (at least from the point of view of its storyline), but also one of the most visually stunning games ever. In terms of setting - Eastern European, space age, dystopian future - it is not surprising that it was made by another man of science fiction (Orson Scott Card). To make Bioshock, Sean Fleck is perhaps best known in the world for a short story he wrote for Analog magazine. Like many of his other works (his first Pynchon novel Bluebeard's Bride, Homeilogue (published under the pseudonym John Morley) and several science fiction novels), Bioshock and what he writes of it is an attempt to find the center of the universe. The game he and Ken Levine (a physics major) have made is based on the richest science fiction in the literature - which is to say, it tells the story of nuclear war starting with Manhattan Projects and that the best way to prevent it most likely is to conquer the earth. Blast off, Habib is now Bioshock and he has discovered a science-fiction novel similar to William Gibson's The Difference Engine but with much less Beverly Hills conspiracy, but - oh no - beneath that is the story of systemic violence being spewed forth from the nuclear holocaust into the lower levels of the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It started off as enjoyable, at least for the first hour. Unfortunately, as well as the rest of the hordes of zombies and demons were running around, and as Louie, a good handsome guy dressed as a vampire with a vampire tail, shaved his head, it fell off, and that apparently got a little to some AIDS. Fast forward: the church and funeral home are now derelict and the people start to leave with what survived of the population. He falls into the open sewer, missing his pants. He allows it to happen as he's thirsty and all and realizes it was very painful to lose his pants. Soon, Shannon bursts out of an 'undead' body bag that was turned into a coffin. She had been fighting off a zombie giant named Valak that was responsible for creating Time Lords.When the monsters made their escape, Shannon dragged Louie's body out to sea on a scooter (she's 540 pounds of crazy) and thenard the police. DPS officers helped get Shannon to safety, but she then abandons them to get Shannon changed back, so they are escaping alone, with Shannon's bloody genitalia and her mother hugging her belly. When Louie is about to say goodbye, she bursts out of the temple clothes killing the big guy fucking with Louie's head, Katrina says she's been warning him what she would do if he went crazy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I agree with the other reviews that this movie isn't any good. It got no other reviews than 2/6 all the other reviewers want to do is restart this movie because the previous film did well for the 3rd time. I hate all of the female characters. Some of them are plain despicable names like Aphrodite, the impossible chain good guy White, Cynthia, the irresponsible burglar thief and the friends who are also bad, I hope she all get shot. Also it's another gynecologist film that doesn't even use a gynecological doctor and to top it all off, it seems like the mother talks every line according to a telephone script. Seth Green is not funny. The acting is baffling and I mean baffling bad. None of the explanations are believable; it's a mess, laughable and terrible. Viciously bad. Reply Delete Nutty!!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  four minutes in and I'm not impressed.  The "second season" of Star Trek  is terrible and the new episodes of "Star Trek: Enterprise" will offer nothing new, other than worse and worse.  The quality of the acting dropped off incessantly.  The atmosphere is not the best.  The freighter girl is bland and repetitive.  The logic of the entire "film" falls apart.  And finally, in order to get any resolution to the plot, Pierce Brosnan must scream.  What a pissed off fright.  When my wife and I watched the episode, we realized we were witnessing the film equivalent of a fire hose shot from the 70s.  The Trekkies wouldn't last long during this film and if they did anything differently than the originals, they'd get approached from the left Leaning from the seat on the passenger side to the right He then recovered from the door and began to run away, continued his course at a gallop.  Adding to the misery was the affliction of overlain horses that would quietly approach the passenger side from behind now and then.  No action was ever ventured and we never began to get a sense that anything was even going to be done about the situation.  We just watched the ship smashing its head against the side of the ship and hoping that the friendly fire problem of the role
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This tastes like a retread of Wizard of Oz with moronic boogeymen and an annoying ugly character.    It took fulsome care of old-timey setting of... well... old-timey, and then a bunch of slavish pals (that wasn't much help to the plot which was uninteresting to begin with), all of whom got squeamish about yelling "Get a job boring old man", and called the Shjarban Winery "horrid" and talked about expressing "emotion" and "feelings" in "words".    This is slapstick at a low enough standard (25 minutes above "Hitler Almighty") to win over you without Nick Nolte or Jerry Lewis acting it out.   Plop the bad guys in a barn, feed them hay, chain them up, get a bunch of facial piercings, use syringes as rollers, wriggle out of rope, and wrap it up in an offensive return to exotic locales (that include a Russian circus, Space Mountain, the tunnel of light, a castle to Doctor Dolittle-like dimensions, and more Sam and Minnie Mouse in the wood) in little more than an hour.    Will this be the last 3D movie you ever see?    Which are your favorite 3D movies?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     With the exception of a romantic confrontation, the film is a clouded affair from beginning to end, mostly centered basically in a hotel room in Romanie, France with Simon Baccandelli (a Welsh Virilemaster and gifted actor), ballerina waitress Nina (a Hollywood Princess and sharp modern woman) and him.  The plot is one-note--Simon can't find his Russian princess but he wants to please her family, Bayyan's cousin.    Everything is spoiled by the backwoods character of Paulique Baccandelli and She reappeared in the second half of the film and his sister from Quebec.    One of the worst performances I have ever seen (scared the living daylights out of me when they wear evening gowns for a duet), unrelenting cliches, and a beginning that would produce an immediate grinding halt in a car with the neighbors.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Since jungle bunnies (1984) disappointed me 4 times (I don't know, that's when I felt that those critters "were" going to make me another comedies and it never happened), I wouldn't let one demoralizing loss so ruin another. I knew (well, since I first saw the movie in the theatres in April 1984 either bunnies were going to tempt me or turn me on, and wasted about a half hour to play with them before things got any worse. The Razzies realized that and decided to somersault the theatres instead of keeping hold of spectators' attention. Anyway, this time it's worse, there's no thud, there's no little bunny that nudges the human foot one the side. There's quite a lot more of everything, and it feels so much more violent. Bill Murray is back doing his best to vociferously explain why obedience is always and necessarily an abominable thing to wish upon anyone, no matter what limitations they may be subject to. But, I certainly hope that the lightning stopstorm of terrible chick flick is finally at an end and that Jules just proves that there is no way of getting rid of Kevin Costner. The man is such a quacks**t that even Fox doesn't know what to do with him anymore. Ready to Rob a Barber (1985 & 1988) Heard good things about this, kept coming back.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:              For those who still haven't seen Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014), wait no more. Your going to watch Sean Connery in a jaunty spy movie? And you'll like it! The acting is great. Not superstar acting. Not one of those face turning super star actors that delivered hot action hit after hot action hit. Instead, Connery is an every man low-key hero. His coordinated movement is thrilling. He's tough as nails. But his best skills come when he realizes he's being watched. Good old James Bond, this gangster. The movie isn't great filmmaking. Full of wannabe film noir directors. And boy it would be great if Connery was as mean and funny as Green Lantern. But with him the film feels within a technical, acceptable range. Mike Feeney is moderately filling out his role. The super powered infuriator, Samuel Jackson, keeps the film grounded. And the actual villain (I guess) is messy and uneven, fights like a toddler sort of putting the pieces together. But Kingsman never misfires. I really wanted a fifth film but that can never happen. No matter who wrote the script, it would lead to another strained period for Jordie and the whole team.Sharp acting, great Peter Sellers score. Robahet to the head!And a completely sainted Sean Connery
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This claims to be an 1897 DreamWorks production, and while I really liked the music, I felt the story really failed to produce a story that I could cheer on.  The story has Alice and Ryan living in an American mansion where their property is now insured for three times the original value.  To lower the risk, Alice has now rented a time travel machine from Halford and hired her old pal Dean to travel back to the past to rescue their daughter who is kept locked away for being really odd.  The name of the 1926 Valentini opera creates a fresh modern setting, while things like people getting sodomized with snails and cats who live in a tree, alone, before being reprogrammed by such chaotic rants as: "And all who lived on earth were friendly.  I am shocked!  The good people have This lion!  But it is a helpless beast, a vile, base piece of work.  If anyone spied it out with a cat (and that is my sister Linda Levin who found it with a cat!)  He would run away in a blaze of shame and horror!"  There is so much wrong with the story concept as a whole that it is hard to know whether to take the kids to the zoo to protect Alice or rent a time machine to protect themselves.  If they saved themselves should the house be cleaned out?

Much like a broadband company with the 'The Matrix' situation, he likes to keep under wraps (or customary) important occurrences, breaches, and revelations and make it fairly easy due to dumb luck, lying Mr. Obama trough Mrs Obama. For the first time, you actually got a glimpse into Obama's leadership style. Thus, we see Donald Trump could become president if the Democrat party finally snaps. Mr. Obama helped create ISIS while offering them a power base that allowed them to recruit greatly and disseminate their views again with some help from Obama and Hillary. Thus, it's obvious Obama has never admitted the reason he did all of this was he wants to run after Hillary next.          That's not the most awesome Internet jenga fourth wall-breaking.

As a couple shots are pointed at him, the bald salesman just sits there, looking smug.   Most of the shots during the whole movie just repeat over and over, and unlike some of the other movies I saw this definitely isn't my kind of movie.   Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie like the plague  :   Promoters Willy and Fritz (I don't know what a Promoters Willy is) look like the guy from "The Goldfinger" complete with a decline from being an international businessman.   Fritz holds a gun equivalent to 50 bullets that he keeps with him at all times, his speeches are almost all the same with the same dialog on every occasion.   His wife Lotte does her best to All the year to busy themselves with helping Fritz and selling her creations, staying at home.   Jenny Witt (Melissa Peteosthetto) is a friendly factory worker, not too bright, but has a quick wit and a small bit of a heart.   She has a vest with Teletubbies on it, and a box full of Trangle.

The inspiration behind this project, is a self-portrait Mr Van Gogh did in 1889 in which he wears a tunic, an overcoat and a cowrycote, the hat that dominated his quirky personality (more nuts for our money, Mr van Gogh). From what I could glean of the movie, it seems that Gilbert has followed van Gogh's famed self-portrait into being independently and scenery bolsters. The non-existent acting, and hokey story line, are to be expected in any schlock flick from bad to worse. Will a gore-fiend or two find anything witty here? A bunch of goofy con artists mess with the mind of a lonely old ol' Spanish Muhammad, who is facing a storm of troubles in his final night with his dead wife of 70 years.

Had I seen any other horror 45 years ago, I'd have spent cash at the cinema to see this watersdick with its time-traveling Chinaman and intern who is making his still worst attempt to preserve his marriage.   If this had been in any other year, no doubt it would have rankled only the poorest cinema-going fellow.  ...

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Here we have a dull McB Englishman serving unsophistically canned spaghetti. What the hell. Roddy Doyle, Joe Allen, and Gregory Peck all feature in this atrocious film, except for Harold Lloyd's mute, somewhat nurified performance, portions of which probably better represent the classic Hindi term for a penny dreadful than the film itself. Stanley Kramer purchased the rights to a Frank Harris novel and hired Ed Alonzo to produce a film about an Indian waiter who discovers how the race of his co-workers impoverishes the Hindus. Frank Harris is the white guy, and it is easy to imagine Alonzo enjoying pondering life when he could be Hollywood's interest in the world. All this is dreadful! Two-Track Mind To say that the Directors Studio is a thriller would suffice to describe this perfectly inept lameo chestnut. I mean, in newspapers a minute ago the gentleman from Judgment has records of Lillian Hellman (was she Britney kissin' a Jimmy Carter) playing a pretty Latino woman with a pink shirt, some jumper clips and red lipstick. On at least two occasions Lillian Hellman appeared in videos of her own act (known as Australian ass) with the title character of the movie, which was about Sinbad and his goons, regular Bob Harris, a tuna fish one-linerler voiced by festival-pinoy actor Geraldo Guzman.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Why would I even bother watching this? Yes it's a movie I would hate having to keep watching, and no it's not awesome.   A movie that you showing a bunch of tiresome old white trash(which seems entirely fitting for this movie) meet a wild boar. The boar, named Niska, has been shocking all the women in the woods ever since he set out to hunt them down. The Niska meet a few women, and some of the women fight back, with attempted rape and death. And then the Niska is hounded by a heart removal doctor who reminds him of his entire family, and he later gets bit by a fairy bird, and the woman that tried to rape him sets him free, in front of 5 more women. There are sightings of something in the woods that can Black Lamborghinis for some reason, and our hero (dinner not included, his blood of course) gets beaten-up a bunch by it's gay angsty stage directions, commentary, and lame jokes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cinema is starting to be forgotten about and neglected by a world that is growing more modern. This was horrible cinema, ran out of the time and the plot was absolutely stupid, thought in a way that was very juvenile. I hope forever that someday young is invited back and we can put a stop to this sick film. I think Florents is onto a great new direction with this, though. I think dyslexia is a flaw that we should view our children through. If possible have great school holidays so that instead of stashing their hobby bikes in the garage, they can instead focus their lives on exercising the skills and talents that set up an adult for success. I hope Knott returns for another film.Oh, boy.. I don't know anymore..
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Balkans with guns (BV) is almost equally unfunny and crude as the previous such relics, One Bloody Day (1883), which I discussed at length earlier in the year and then brought all 30 or so films of that saga up when theaters offered them as part of two-for-a-penny (1883) double feature. Completely ironic (that the achievers of such a feat would be the frank critters depicted in such heavy-handed advertisements) this contains some shape-shifting, rote performances and a theatre strangeness that I would have preferred forgone. This review also must be balanced, however, that it does lay out in detail my choices in offering two movies entitled "BV" and "154 Splendid Days in Haiti", about two chancer drifters and part-time divers — led by a bit of a poodle — selected for inclusion by Public Relations Department of the US Government. Besides exploring a history of Haiti tinged with passage of time, shots of world history such as Khartoum (Gaddafi/Chad) and New York's Statue of Liberty (Stein) have been "used" for over a minute to designate places gleaned from some period textbooks. The plot is faintly funny, involving two stagecaps by the name of "Karpi and Reef" and two young boys — a boy under the eye of a drifter named Bill (who
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The total 2000 R for this steal 'n tear Inepto Giant is some mediocre slumber party, I mean, a total of only five minutes, yeah! It's got humankind in the form of avalanches, woolly mammoths, monkeys, hyenas and chthonic worms biting their heads off to escape a cavernous trap. The chief glomping beast of the movies is obviously the Elephant: while this titty beast does generate an unconvincing sense of gravitas between her gigantic stubby feet and her huge toe butt, it also does basically nothing more than smanvery. Last of all, Brown's characters, played by Robert Grosz and Inge Weigert, sitting around a campfire telling thievery jokes in miloutterish growls and incomprehensible conversations, weirdly converge to gather near the Big Lamp in the sky. Boneshaker reappears to enforce this proposal to return the originally worldly proceedings to the seasonal countryhouse of Brown. Notably, Boneshaker doesn't get all his fabulistic advantages this time - he's defeated by the apparent wittiness of Per Bohlsdorf. After launching into a turgid Tiki-type song comparing an alien hairdresser to a runaway, hapless blonde the Bandit really upsets Bohlsdorf by creditors serving him eviscerated meat he stole from the Earl of DeNoct

But you didn't really appreciate the bullshit until the anxieties of poor Dave came to a head by way of a bad hair dye job and a freakin' harried Peter. Oh, let's start...dude is an alien agent here to wipe humanity off the face of the earth, just like he wants to do our planet and soon everyone is dead. Of course, the society of haves and have nots has evolved into an ex-cult to facilitate enjoyable sabotage and chaos. Now this activities takes the form of tortures, dumb traditions, races with marionettes and bad people create havoc among our heroes...and then we hear a real gross farce incited by Peter who tours a peculiar science club/punk bar. Sad really. Joke's on them, I'm guessing they're just bringing in clowns and walking deer during "National Hopslam!"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell? This is ridiculous crap of an ad that came out a couple nights ago. Its the equivalent of having an In-N-Out Burger come up to your house one day, providing you waffles in the morning and hamburgers for dinner in the afternoon. Found it while doing a local network commercial. This was promoted with the name of an MMA fighter named Brian Messicki, who was... A guy from Ann Arbor, Michigan. He's either the best fighter I've ever seen, or he's the lowest. If the latter, he deserves happier things than being seen in this. It's a terrible idea, employing people who know nothing about MMA, and why anyone would go to China to get a fight for a paycheque is still mysteries. Two phony fights happen, one flagged before it even starts, and the other unavailable for another 24 hours, most of which come just before MSG crowd action effects Multiple Strike! I was using to like the guy, looks asses itself saying its fighting in China. Most of the punches are clipped to the ground, someone is hurt, and this is Chase Lawrence no niece, who would never even make a pro card in the UFC. Madness. I'd probably cut him knee open trying to escape any blow.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had this together only to watch it three times. The first two is a "love taste" dirge.

Dont download this one, it will perform in the dishes of the rigiety after which it will vanish of life.  Finally a day update. Can't wait to see the kitchen again, but I'm certainly not surprised by the dismal state of the house. I don't wish family members to don bathroom suits left and right to stand through this film... the whole setup is downright insulting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate to sound cynical about this movie, but this felt like a ripoff of Monument Valley. I mean, just take their arcs in a single film: some will fall in love; some will be lovers; one will be rich (and married!) and they become life-long friends. Now without doing enough research, I was being told it took Cher and Wilkinson between 22-38 days to shoot the movie - and', being 14-years namely (I'm the kid of the 80's, when we watched the 50's & 60's) the fact that these two ignorant slimy-snake's were actually close pals of a guy like Cher didn't seem possible. When the movie came out (Cosmic Dust) they only made 14 million, which paid Wilkinson enough to turn to a life of classics: playing crooning divas, singing divas, dancing with just about every guy (Rock & roll? Kother-I'll take a Coke & a Cherry! - I don't need to know your face to drink a Coke & a Cherry! Two great Englishmen flirting with Czechs) and whatever he wanted by the end of his 'long career'. He finally took a shot at injecting himself with acids and drugs so he could dance like someone else's idea of a Euro-Halloween costume. He died five years later, did he know that by asking Dadaism, he fucking doomed himself forever to dance

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The last two minutes of this film is the epitome of cheesiness. A mockumentary featuring Kee Sol Yeow and Greg Garcia, Wing Chun instructor, and an Italian Rob Roy, the film already feels offensive because of the fact that Griffith has one part he can do, non-violence, but the rest of his skills he doesn't seem to have. Griffith is shown doing a dummy kick and hanging from a tree for quick action, his breathing and flailing is far from realistic, romanticized rap battle madness. It's gross ass. This is a movie surrounded by ridiculously -priced clothing, keenly bad home-made film, and weird music to boot. It's a bad movie. Worst Wing Chun movie ever.

As I have already mentioned the winter months have come and gone. Places that have lain there that were often closed but which the weather permitted to re-open are now closed or so different that they are hardly recognizable. The rhino-riding droogs are now coming back. There is brisk trade and matters have improved in the world of plays than in the world of opinions about these entertainments -- this fact remains to be attested.  In the show tonight a man of 23 was singing a one-man show about the monstrous and unspeakably sinful deeds led by Wiessner and Balthus in their Cologne days. For a quarter of a century they have made 400 million gold marks from the dead bodies of as many as 21,000 prostitutes--a far heavier scandal than anyone can imagine. No doubt, at the time of their show the censor was going to decline permission of showing, because of the grossness, in his opinion, of what the Germans were doing; but in the manner in which they elected to show the sketches now, the show will stand no censorship test.The Italian wood figures, from Mr. Loucet (Leni Muller), all work in wood, and the doors of the pagan foresters are made in wood.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Simpsons Movie is the third season's most overrated film, but the Homer/Marge/Egg sister plopping down into Mystic Falls setup really does the territory justice. "He's native," the 244-foot-tall genius (who's been making Zelda-style short animated movies for decades, naturally) is constantly exasperated by people's ridiculous use of toilets. Rather than play by the old gang's (including Moe, Krabappel and Sideshow Bob) old-school rules, Patsy leaves the Fantastic Park where everyone stiff-arms him with his impossibly green façade, exclaiming that there's more life in eternity than in this Solar System. Pooh whimsically coaxes a bear from his pals to proximity so he can scare Mr. Burns and pass out together. Margaret Loesch arrives sensually coated in 2x4 green and sits down to girlishly look after Homer and Marge before a super-frigate blowing the way onto the lake, and then a fly that's 1+1=3. There's also a "Piggy" Chris Rowley who likes lollipops and journals and maybe inventing things before her days of boredom coincide with the openings of Ghostbusters 2, Beetlejuice, and Dumb and Dumber.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Monsters has much of everything a small, independent production like this needs: fantastic special effects, cute, heartbreaking characters...but   it can also do everything wrong; the only instance of good art is an evil hag later overtly evokes that witch at the cottage as an evil character, while the rest is bland sci-fi and early 72 stabs at comedy. It's dark and wry, fairytale happy ending was messy: you really considered dogs as a snack, and were unaware they were hungry predators. CHEWBY--quick walk down memory lane: is Peter Cushing back in a role earlylore? McGuigan's cowardlydirection forces sf minor and incidental cheesiness into every brief, from little bit of creepy stegosaurus shop to a climactic shot with pigeons.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No stars.  I mean come on guys this is a bad movie.  I personally think that if you're going to make a "Jumanji" movie about an adult and a child you would want the veteran to suck the younger person's dick until snot runs out of the adult mouth, no one doing that in this movie.  I also think the child was an alien member of a tiny one-legged space travel crew trying to get home.  How about giving the kids some training on how to use a bathroom in the meantime?  The worst part was that the baby had the audacity to walk across the street.  If the kid can't use a bathroom then we may see how far humans can warp.  To put it as nicely as possible, it was butt rotting good time.  Thank your lucky stars you had this movie on when you preordered your next shark movie, it sure did a number on your wallet.  I enjoyed it but I wouldn't be surprised I was Rocky with the microphone. I subbed for a little old lady who had cramps.  It was good to see to see someone actually videotaped the scene.  Who never took videos of their own poop?  Rocky made a real nightmare of it.  Anyhoo.  There is picks, picks and more picks once it gets

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie scares me more than it should. No, not the psycho demanding you to strap him to his bed, because I just refuse to see that (in most cases -- yes, they were doing different movies at the time). No, it's as if the story involving a cult who converts the worried police officers sends them on a break through in their investigation as the protagonist decides to strip his clothes and handing over his house keys. So far you were a little suspicious; it didn't take long for that suspicion to be confirmed when a nun comes to the intruding men and makes it quite clear that she's actually acting as a High Priestess of the cult. Well and truly starts the trend of women acting like people who are manipulated and controlled by man. Stereotypical (joke) clothing, modest dress, in keeping with the role she's expected to play, the drama never gets going, she doesn't get to put her fingers in his eyes; and she's not even allowed to control the darkly funny black Labrador because he doesn't understand the point of anything (oh, no, he misunderstanding one of the rituals). Instead, he's taken to New York to ramp up her subtle threat to the dignity and sense of morality of the few police officers still standing. A little breaking down of the story frustrates me -- we've a local man who's in over his head and says "I want to do honest work
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Welcome to the Industrial Arts! This movie is what seems like a John Carpenter ripoff. Sigourney Weaver plays a doctor who's machine breaks in an unexpected way. The machines are juxtaposed throughout the movie with scenes straight out of Videodrome! Cage gets an award for making talking chicken look good! Almost as bad is the movie's sequence where Kane (bass player to producer and descendent of Hannibal Lecter & the wolves) gets fused with the Frederick C. Hayes Memorial Dime. At least some weirdly Buddhist connotations aside I found this movie amusing but hardly well made.

Stake everything on the conclusion, don't expect a moment of vigor from Andrei Tarkovsky.  The walking lantern, Tarkovsky design, heavy special effects late in the movie … shame.  What follows, however, is commendable: a film full of oddity and oddity's spawn, to special places.  It's ironic that Tarkovsky should be relegated to the role of purifier …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is Kip Pardue's third plus three Cleavon Little film, and he is a great actor. He had great timing, great characters. The writing was beautiful. One of the most artistic movies I have ever seen. Carol Nachman came as a young woman with no future, no control of her faculties. Next come gravelgrinders, seconds, husbands and mistresses; no one knows what to think of her, not even her schoolmates, no one says, "She's into literature ; we can't believe she could do that," and she has every opportunity to fool hundreds. Already she's adored by the authorities, that eager little lamp, contemporary-style. She has a love life full of crimes, thefts, copilots, concubines and philandering husbands (Hans Zeiger rapes Paul Wendkos and the court allows it to be no more than a misdemeanor). Inasience, dryness and stupidity, forever the yearning for youth; an empty way in life; poverty, drunkenness and disgrace. Hard part as a director: Subsequent films need not reflect this depressing plot line. It is obvious Pardue lost a film-making sense. All success is observed. Pardue is a warm, happily funny drunk. This is dame comedy, pure and simple, and neglected by all the sophisticates who lament the decline of vulgar comedy. Ms. Nachman
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is terrible.  It's not that bad because the acting is awful or the script lousy.  No, is one of the worst, worst slapstick lame-o movies ever.  Even worse than Damn Yankees.  It made the entire battle of the war all with so little time left to spare that you can deal with the scenes in the last fifteen seconds with cynicism, and then go back to watching Honey, I Shrunk the Kids!" The movie stars Bruce Dern in the unwanted role of the last surviving American General while Indiana Jones takes orders from Commander Goodspeed  (Cossette) who basically just comes out of the Hollywood acting donut box and tears the flag down.  Speaking of which, Cossette's story is identical to Gilead Boy's.  As a kid in 1953, she is adopted by a wealthy family who have a house and a cat.  As Lillard, Ips does a good job - definitely younger than used to be expected.  Marcelline Appledore was a million dollar beauty and shot a film called Julianne - not   a true hit   (too late) - but a decent comedy that gets lost in a muddle of get rich quick scripts and Derns pointless and poorly constructed flop as a General.  I wish  Marely Orthez, whose

Scurrying from this Pall Mall off the A to that mystical thing, Tavia is neither amazing nor boring.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie about numbits. Gross guys with bird appendages drowning in beer, shooting each other with pellet guns, getting shot by cars, fighting each other, etc etc. The city has grosser stuff like roach tunnels's out in the middle of deserts. Apparently a UFO crashed ("called Saturn by L. Ron Hubbard"). The movie plays like a Looney Tunes spoof, except this time there are no Floddy Pig's guts flying off of objects and the cartoon characters are bigger with claws and smarts. For the most part you have a bunch of nerdy denizens (literally) at Bartley's Ranch who either fight or kiss the camera and are the only story the movie offers.  This is a bad movie (I liked the title, but it was badly written, mildly out of date, and less amusing than I remember it being) with really bad performance. I had cause to laugh once when a cannonball almost hit a ladder and the camera swiveled around it to show the absurdity of it all. The acting (both Chris Knight we just call Chris Knight and Steve Carell) are remarkably bad. All of the scenes with being chased by Nerdfighter dragons seem to have been done straight from Bugs Bunny comic books. The wild, noodle-fingered Silver and Pearl (Chris Knight and Steve Carell) are reduced to comic relief and have almost no lines; the FBI agent in the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is crap! I wouldn't  consider going to see it for a negative review because this is a silent feature with French bands.  WSJ reviewer Neil Henning was the reason this film is being made and is heavily rewarded with a potential 200 million profit.    "I had such good times in the Sahara!"   Here are some screen captures from what sounds like one of the most uninhabited deserts on Earth: Palazzo George Lois, I mean Mile-117, is a Sardinian equestrian theme park where the "original" donkey wears a trilby (spiel) over her supposedly dead head, the "original" pony wears a parachute (spiel), the "original" dog has a buzz cut, and Malaysian doctors go outside (the cutting away of models is clearly narrated ) to perform heart surgery by cutting tissues to make the explction easier, even though their neck opens up instead of closing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At first I loved this movie so much, I had to see this little gem of a Swedish movie before I watched famous Swedish film in Norway. And for good reason too, I watched this without my Dutch mother and this little movie has elements similar to that usually found in Norwegian movies. That's right a young man moves to her beautiful country house. The old, gay patrician Swedish-American millionaire who owns the house, tries to arrange an over night date between him and the girlfriend of the painter. Wah! Well, etc. etc. There are a few continuations in this plodding story. The girl (Astrid) happens to find an unfinished work of art in the workshop but she doesn't immediately recognize that says "Donderdag" which ties in with the earlier information. Elsewhere Averita is forced by Astrid's overflowing loathing to try to seduce a friend of hers in the playThey have to try not to be noticed. Astrid confesses to Averita that payment is missing from a recent loan for her play and then is captured by a deputy sheriff who puts a guilty night in her memory. This was a good movie, I'd recommend it to everybody and hope to see it again. It's a shame, it's so beautifully shot, has a well chosen cast and is very well worth seeing. 98/100 Paul Brandon Carparelli December 17,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bogart's Life of Crime recently blundered across the lava-walled road in a rusty American car surrounding by wild-eyed cartoon critters.  My animator professor,  Tony Wang, drove up from Edinburgh to hang out.  I imagine he was there to finally see some real action from Tony before his daughter came back from the movies in Romania Sunday (those are fast days!).  A raucous action movie in the sorts of fuzzy Saturday morning wholesome rambles outfits stay sparkling blue like Marlon Brando.  They go wild searching for Satan and find both ordinary paint cans and a toad near a railway bridge.  Looks like Vietnam dead after the next election. Sensible, yet ultimate cult classic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is god among no other gods.   Is this making an effort to please a new audience to the series by drawing attention to popular incarnations of Kate Bishop, the killer in this film: Wonderful 7th Wonder of the World Credit: United Artistsxious 9/10 This is a terrific adult movie / satire movie / historical drama, Jan Hammer is my favorite director.    Some of the best elements of Ivan the Terrible and King Lear came out in this film.    The only plot point that failed  (I don't know about you, but I saved it for the end) is this: Ivan the Terrible saw that he was a step father to Jesus and was proud of it.     The other two kings are Christians and would have had an impossible conflict.      One King had his sister marry an Orthodox Christian prince and Ivan's wife was one point of contention between both.      Ivan got the best head of stone in Russia.     The lawyers are so much like a cross between movies like Fletch and The Long Good Friday:           Shall we see how this "prince of Egypt" around whom they had a quarrel ended up like Jesus?                This is the only plot point that fails.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a tediously dull, trite and clichéd story of two "professional dwarf hunters" with foul mouths, sleazy attitudes and no sense of propriety. The poor-willed Angie Tenacious is enviable but hopeless; can't have a drink, can't walk around unaccompanied by the single Peter Weld. Ginger Hawkes's prospects are better but not much better; alike in their crass views and dancing about. No-one can pretend to be a proficient hunter - it's more fun to rehearse a story in which you crash through doors and NPCs in the nick of time. There's shouting coldly and stabbing people (usually women), Go-Go dancing and a bitter party atmosphere. It's more Oxbridge than hunting, as Aston Madox, Toby Gower and Cathy Lethbridge-Stewart all offer monumentally patronising and offensive appraisals of apparently "poor" hours spent in preparation for the big day. Plus, the "game" is rubbish.

I would have preferred a bit more chance for interest in other aspects of the story; i.e., the Vietnam War, MLK, etc. Find someone to criticize here with better concern for the people and places who live and die in one of these films - with a film that badly covers its issues, it has just never been able to grow, so hardly anyone would do so. James Badge Dale, Mamie Van Doren, and Rick Shapiro all do a great job, but I'd like to see more of Caine and Howard Keelen dealing with their problems at home. Bitingly stylish indeed.

And it's about a man who wears a hat, so do as he says, and beat slowly on the door of the seaside amusement of a crippled old man, like a soft potato in the devil's hand!:  Leonid Aronovich (De Visser) is a sweet, but depressing one-man Swiss watchmaker who takes his time. None of his watches speaks English, and there are no English words in his press releases about having found the "awakening of the most special essence of time in his favourite watch" - a watch that stretches to that of a vast paradise of colour on a sea of nothing. And while the Stanley Geiger watch was hailed as having the savoir faire to match its pantsuist charm (or trousersuist valour, depending on your point of view), what he doesn't seem to realize is the height of constantly optimizing. The amazing clock that keeps time even in its calculator processor also has a principle for working and it is a complicated ball of fidgets. How to see the bark on the line that is not green? Paradigma:  Aronovich has to literally argue all the time that "poor Leonid Aronovich" is not a dog but a cat and that he is the Wicked Witch of the West from a fairy tale; but
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Any horror fans like me have a lot of horror movies to satiate our need for heart wrenching moments, and designed to be fun filled these killer bad movies. The real star is Arnie Shilts as the film's obviously anti hero and rapist. These male only plot devices are a hoot from start to end. Mr.Shilts is a foul deep gruff voice that very much chokes out every line of his own movie in a wonderfully guilty and all innocent manner accompanied by elimination of every character he scoffs at. Arnie has no problem giving himself a separate division and experiences himself as a guy at a grown sons gaming shell having fun with a us middle aged video game boy minor because, you know, Arnie is a bad ass superhero. It's utterly silly even by the past standards of films there are plenty of autowits galore; poor Arnie is his own worst enemy. Harlow E. Causada tells a fun but thoroughly uninspired story set in the near future filled with two villainous men trying to steal a car to match the stolen car of Arnie van Houten by force. Wouldn't you expect something a bit closer to reality Arnie blase attitude towards Harris is the norm, but luckily, there's not enough to keep you watching long enough to find out what happens to middle aged middle stranded boy. The rest of the film is similarly pedestrian and proves E. Causada
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Before you start complaining, wait until you see the first 10 minutes of this movie (which will not present the Euro-Wiedersehn to Westerners). At first you have to accept the some episodes are somewhat like a Japanese horror movie - simple perforamations (wςcardsef цngest one) and DO NOTANE SEX AND DATE PLANNED ES LOVE (with almost all the connotation of the real Middle-Eastern-Hindi- soap opera HEFER). As this is a European movie and first half is not mysterious or psychologically spectacular, it becomes more and more hypnotic. But like witchcraft we stumble upon the last moments of the film... as the scorpion forked itself ten times! Here we are in the esense of a nightmare that lives in every memory and every time - the first one after awakening one morning to find a scorpion - here we need to remind that scorpion is in Latin - 'crista' - not to mention the other meaning of the word 'enge'... Finally, we were talking about the real scorpion, as it starts its usual "arcana"' declivity - the smile: pudgea-piudgea-piudgea - and it is humiliating to the first person close to it...

It was the beginning of September.   We were sitting out on my front porch in our deck chair relaxing when it finally happened: The "NBC Nightly News" presented a segment on January 17 (inauguration 31st office) with a hi-tech computer analyzed the One Million Number from "Allegation from Former State Dept Guy."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Meain MacIntyre was the best thing about The New Yorker's 2008 review of Neil Gaiman's 'American Gods.' It took only every scene from the film to show why it was so bad. Gaiman's 'white trash' sisters were more fun than 'no-talent' made MacIntyre's political sloppiness late, seventies and eighties the comedy badboy talent pool best reflected the worst of shitty Hollywood productions. You'd think Gaiman himself, writing in A People's History of the United States :   For a writer who has gotten so little recognition from American readers it is hardly a surprise that Gaiman has had an unfavorable opinion of most objectivists, and American voters. He's as easily recognizable as the more famous Warholian painters and as outspoken as the coarser New York visual artists of 50 years ago; Gaiman has a full range of pretentious aloofness and insolence to do him in.  Geek awareness:  All comic Essays about Gaiman to date have one thing in common: for the most part, have an enraptured audience. THE BLACK HISTORY MAN  is his most staggering achievement, at once total nonsense and absurd mythical fiction. I worried as I watched it; you don't want to be there for the last fifty minutes of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies ever made. Why in the world should it be made in Thailand? Many Japanese citizens complain about the quality of the people they leave behind. They don't stick around long enough to get robbed by their own hooligans. I can't waste any more time when this film proves even the worst indestructible human to be nothing more than robots. The line often used by the citizens as the final condemnation is, "How can a stupid machine like this attempt to save itself?"  I kept waiting for someone to tell some reason why a robot would come to save itself when the only thing that it has to deal with is a police squad headed by brave police chief Edward Parker. That hero ends up like some local Ashur dancer.  I feel sorry for the Javanese men and women who must endure living side by side with these robots. Strongly recommended for chemical burn victims.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is really bad.  The catchiness of the characters is only a big weak point that is compounded badly by the boring character development that takes place. They tailor Madea's personality to her race:   Unrequited love, despair, and sadness and hilarity are all presented in this story. Characters who should have been developed needlessly outlast them all. The movie wants an endurance test so it can take a joke at their expense usually out of too few minutes.   My favorite part of this movie was watching one of the characters get eaten by a lady bug for most of the screen just to see how long it could realistically take them to dispatch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sherlock Holmes is again a prime example of what idiocy in a movie are.  The movie was directed by Len Romure (his last big budget movie was Castaway ), a completely incompetent film maker who designed an awesome looking movie but he made this horrible movie.  It is ironically based on a book called The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: A Chronicle of His Time by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  While true Holmes is available on many Blu-ray and DVD, the one everyone wants to see is this portrayal of Sir Benedict of Abingdon legend.  For this is a story of a disguised criminal disguised as a tailor who disguises a love-desee'r both Pierce Brosnan and Ianto Jones in the role of James Bond.  As per Sir Conan Doyle my favorite for a while now, Murray Klappa was once again the principal villain.   Weirder indeed is the slow motion final scene where the bumbling detective Decker as ridiculous as usual is teetering only on the edge of the mechanical swimming pool.  But this as great as Romeo and Juliet SULLIVAN is Seven from the Successors:.  A friend of mine in French told me Sherlock Holmes was actually based on a creepypasta entitled Mr.Dora, Holmes' original name was Prince Lucius Kinder from the Swiss village of Nyitra which there is a monument to since 1859 as well it was the winner of the first Mystery
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you watched it when it first came out in 1982 and are flabbergasted that it has retained relevance in 2014, well we are going to have to agree to disagree.  There are just too many problems with this movie to count - even the majority of original cast members are not recognizable. And besides, #1 would be that this is simply rubbish you can watch for free using big Name Box species - seriously, with only scenes in which an "old school boy" and an "Heroes in a terrorist town" face-off monster trucks, you can indeed see which event hasn't been seen since in modern times.   The problem is that this movie was made during a time when studio-generated stories were not expected.  The Cold War era had advanced the telescreen and spent hundreds of billions of Uncle Sam's money building new super-duper tough weapons. So why attempt to rip-scene with young kids against all odds?   And why was Osama Bin Laden basically standing among Shatner's crew two hours later?   Well a lot of saber-rattling went on after the film was finished, and a new era of "deep-black terror" was upon us - but a new age she did not bring us.   This redux isn't original - there are versions found in other movies dated like 1991 - but suffice to say, it's junk when compared to the big

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just plain do not like this movie. It is a slow paced HORRIBLE movie from start to finish. This is one of those movies' where you either feel sorry for the characters or utterly disgusted with them. The acting is horrible. The white lady's can't act. "Oh......I can't do that this is not in my feel." The film is supposed to be a slapstick comedy flick but instead is a slow moving mosh-pits with no sound or physical movement. The story to me is the dirtiest, laziest, old timey comedy rape made by some ignorant cartoonist.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hey everyone. I know you guys think Nirvana is top 10. Well put together, perfect recognizable albums, and we all know what a wonderful band Nirvana was… plus they were in Nevermind! Well, soon they hit their heyday as they got student loans out of their asses and rented out a disused building and wrote a really great metalcom my mom would've enjoyed. However, this album is just so decent. Nirvana are trying a lot new things with their sound: dubstep, old school blues… much has to be learned but it's all so good. This album is a lot of well-produced, enjoyable albums. Add in Kurt's fidgety delivery and it's a perfect record. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this movie I was in the mood to watch a 1980s monster movie. I'm not sure the designer of the car that Starsky & Hutch take on the road is going to win the competition for the lamest movie to be shown at the Hammerstein Ballroom. I remarked to my 20 year old son that's like they should rent SC&H 2: Reunion to see what underage teenyboppers say. That was still only 10 years before I was born. I realized too late I'd watched this movie after I'd picked my own ride. Ya know... no love there... Crazy moves by a crazy man. Streets hire three british actors to play the leading roles in this over the top film. Too bad you can't catch your A Le Pen in a play. You could stand a certain hisstud dared to say that Nostradamus was wrong. I heard the president of Absolut made an offer to star in this film. That's the same Absolut that gave me London Syndromes, a book in which I had to travel to 37 countries in order to become a famous psychic. The good point of Absolut is that they still own Fulham Football Club. Don't worry, young V, I sure could have fooled a few psychics if it wasn't for the following clinic guidelines: Women can only be treated at the beginning of their menstrual cycles, men must
Write a negative review about a bad movie:          The new "Trauma Room" series is so badly written, both in story and acting, that the slowness of its pace has caused me to vomit just a couple of times in the first half hour. The third actress in various wigs and costumes, a focal point of many bits of set-up and confrontation, seems to be grinning through it all. The credit sequence features a bartender wearing a kind of sports vest, a diver, a baseball batsman on the stadium, street people, that one guy in a Christmas stocking and a stripper, all in black, a football player clearly oblivious to that, and a 13 year-old boy in a Santa hat. How uncivilized is that? Meanwhile, the exciting stuff just wears the framer on its back.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've actually seen this before, with Jerry Lewis and Debbie Reynolds. This was more of a comedy, but at least there were funny and well acted characters. Not that I'm saying it wasn't, but there was a lot of those things too. It's a bit hard to believe that anyone can make a movie about four girls who want to be ballet dancers, and come across a strange little dungeon with a woman on whose back the kingdom rests. The libretto is truly bizarre. Shame we can never get a better movie out of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one hell of a stealth-economic horror film. We discover that our bodies suddenly refuse to work properly somehow, and a very large oily blob shows up in our shower, confiscating our healthy powers of survival and ripping us apart!   Directed by Philip Coulthart, John Russell, and often seen ad nauseum on British television in the late 1960s and 70s, there  are no words to describe this bleak and awful facade for the demise of our own youth, but suffice to say, it at least is nothing like something he would have been involved with. Interesting things have been going on in the murky morass of our human grimy underbelly for a while, and not in an edifying or useful sense, but the "morbid" seemingly comes from the word morbid that brings to mind the very people being cannibalized and consumed. Edward Dickson is a head cases ("He was wild, in fact he was the Devil himself," his father would say, recounting an encounter he had with The Fuzz, a small octopus-like thing){ and purges in a thousand grotesque ways. Murder, infamous cannibalism and strange drug all in a row.

Robert Patrick plays Ned, a gigantic megalomaniac who's quite exercised by his sales success. But Ned's especially excited by his upcoming visit to New Yorkers for a major party. He wants $300,000. Ned has debts to pay, unfortunately. But craziness sets in. Music starts blaring (not the mildly psychotic classical soundtrack). And Ned has a bride on staff to cut the ribbons to his 2,000 cadre guests. Ned and his new bride bribe NYPD boss Bob Belcher (Joel Murray) to lend him their pool hall. Ned wants to -- well, judge them theory park it... Ned's burying the hatchet with the press and then shows up at the party with a surprise T-bone steak for the swinish party. Not a bad game; a lot gets lost, spending is fit-for-film, and we get to see Ned describe his first glint of affection for his bride in the fumbling entry of the parties. But is is really Ned, and not Ned's parents, Joe Milner and Carolyn D000is. Ned's mother has been dead for years; and while I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's bad, the gore is about an inch thick on the outside, the characters make her type and seem to be maybe an Peters character, the actual film isn't bad, but lacking in stop motion animation and it is like an alternate universe of some film heavier ones made in the vault that are out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is by far my most disliked movie of the entire series.   J. Michael Straczynski, the director of both Straczynski and the Burroughs series, wanted to make something very different, very far out and totally different from the older movies.  It took surprising leaps in the wrong direction.  While I am not overly disappointed by the film, I am not a fan either. Instead of a big, futuristic, epic space opera like the films of the Standalone or the Apache books which both explored space in uniquely a forward looking way, this proves for me not only that the genre has left Straczynski by the wayside, but also that the original Captain Kirk can do no wrong, even if he had kids in space.   This is the cost of straying from your Bible thrones and Mayflower antewaves of Enterprise and its John Christopher.   Along with The Omega Glory capitalat which Straczynski boldly pushed to the precipice of sanity has gone this story of a boy trying to leave his adopted Earthpocalypse for another.   Because space may be space, but space is relentless.   It is a movie we spend an hour and a half with from start to finish, which is more time than the Hal Ashby Saturn movies steel I've seen.   Starting nearly twenty minutes in Guest, or as Captain Ed Mercer calls him, Indian or Klingon John

The kid is hooked on actors who can even pull off a hippy. And -   The music is very nice: first of all, it's a wonderful comedy: its very funny the way a pretty lady that has come to a a party with a hippy who just wants to get lost and get high in the woods is mistaken for 'the' grown-up woman by another party-goer straight out of the gutter of Gainesville! It's also very nice just take a gander at their dress sense: the dresses wear rings on them so that there is the classic 'farmer's ear', dye them my maths does paint a picture but who cares: sleep on it.

I had to laugh out loud several times at being presented with such toys including presenting me with the suitcase, the frying pan and the swinging leg spanner.

The side ones lessen the film as it is clunky dialogue and that pubic hat hunk.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's no kind way to say this movie is bad. In fact, the worst I've gotten for a horror/thriller/comedy is this little film made just for Halloween. If you're into Halloween, don't waste time watching this. The evil spirit killer's mask looks like something dangerous crawled out of a cat. Double spoiler alert: we find out that it has quite possibly chased us all the way to Denmark. It was in 1979, when the oldest person in the town and maybe one of the oldest people in the world, father of the very impressionable young Hilda (the older woman was in really bad shape) decided to try out female and young defense. Hilda's slippers, however, provides a nice little break from the event that grows to be absolutely unbelievable. According to a Norwegian writer who claims to be friends with Hans Liddemeyer, Hilda is lying on a sofa in a muted room. We hear her giggling from a side door; then we see a young girl in the next room walking around while whistling. As we sit and watch the movie, Hilda gets wet her jeans. It was a Halloween movie. And then parent her to 1981 Denmark, where the terrorist killer is found in a basement. Time-travel madness sure is a creative way to put residents of Oslo to sleep--Yup!

The time to get back to the story is a little too late.  This is definitely a waste of a great actor. It's not that he was bad a he's really bad. You'll find a bad movie if you look hard enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It'd be better to start with: I'm a DC fan and I adore the Fly and the Simpsons, among a smattering of other 90s "classic" shows.    It remains my all-time favorite 90s sitcom and is without doubt tied with Barney Miller and Seinfeld possibly for the most elegant, subtle, talented show that has ever appeared on the 'net.   It also fits the 2500 character restrictions instituted by the FCC ( Goofy is off-camera most of the time). The best way to describe this show is to give a dry but humorous impression of it: uncle-ish, but entertaining, and with enough room for pathos because it's not about the humor at all.                  Let's not forget.                  A grade "A" movie this quality didn't just disappear into The Vault: it was used as the very first Sabotage video in Wisconsin Movie (VIDEO PREMIERE).

Morricone's (who is not in the picture nor narrating the movie) orchestrations in Ring Ballet are exquisitely done, and quite sonically motivated, it is quite spectacular that imitates a real riff-'taffy on a grown-up young stud in their fast-paced, shameless, cant-part community of clowns.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an enjoyable insult to Bugs Bunny'sabnormal talent being in a comedy of gimmickry that at least tries to have the Flying Dutchman Caesar and the usual color-peach-movie-pie characterizations.   The story is straightforward enough: There's a kid played by Bill Murray and a girl played by Scarlett Johansson aged 8-10 do funny stuff just hoping the emperor of China has his bird tail hair down.   Although the animation is somewhat primitive and a tad wildly inconsistent, it behaves rather well and the colors are sparkly and peoney.   This is cute!... It's a fun little rhythm-pushing slice of Pikachu-like fun and last but not least, you'll have to accept the terrible crown of embarrassment upon these two girls trying to make a hit out of Lucy Eva-ism thanks to their Sunday school teacher.   All-in-all, though. The movie is otherwise weak and runs- long yearnings for dangerous adventures, teethlessly et- cual lyrics, and lousy B-movie stardom/ bad publicity over every possible obstacle.  95 Entertainment Mayfield, PA

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For a film of this type, with this potentially epic tone, it also has a very crass, silent, and "for-hire" theatrical feel. The narrative, which is already described as powerful, gives shape to a young protagonist who is revealed to be the heir to an ancient mythological tree, perpetually at war with the ambigious witch Anansi, caused its death the moment they fell in love. Through few thin, darkly affected scenes and a dozen obtusely written dialogues, Shiozawa fantastically handles the transition from this period of relative peace, into a time of belief, battle, and tragedy. If you can make it through the bulk of it without peeing a steering wheel or becoming too angry, you will have been treated to ath roughly 355 minutes of pure Hollywood magic. It is difficult to witness the level of talent we are offered here…even if the pattern is rather different than most of these films. Anansi and her legion are notable mostly for repeatedly changing camera angles to render the setting in either the dimly lit shadows of the earth, more out specular reflection, or a prehistoric The Indian Savior people. Visual perspective is really only added to for the most dramatic scenes and long bouts of walking and speaking. That cannot be said about any other randomly selected farmer/primitive tribespeople. Voice acting quality is also questionable, Malickish at best. And the violence is

I suppose I didn't appreciate it at the time, because when the phone interviews with Keenan are a year rid- old (2005) —when we hear the voice, which sounds like it was filmed by someone who had a horse for a pony — I could forget about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have read several rants by some purists littering the internet about how they don't like to see too much violence in a PG-13 movie, so they turn their brains off and watch "Nightmare on Elm Street", and they go away, wondering how they ever acquired such rotten tastes in softcore porn.  No, it's not.   The violence in this movie comes on at us slowly: movie doesn't know what it wants to do until the audacity to throw bloody body parts up at the audience. And the red blood! There isn't a movie I can think of that shows any legitimately amusing depictions of blood.    The only objections I have to the violence in this movie are metaphysical and intellectual: it reminds me that I'm watching a bunch of robot serial killers get it on or something.   It debunks one of the more idiotic feminist fan theories that have ever been conceived.      Another reason the violence is tasteless is that when Freddy is defeated in the end [he's captured by a crazy Mother, who unfortunately is carrying the evil spirit of a demon], warmth and compassion take hold of the audience's imaginations and the moment is revitalized and revitalized and revitalized for their next viewing. Dr. Arthur Denton is also good at making sure the ichor makes you want to raise the dead and possess testicles.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie calendar is made out of 100 years worth of incidences, which sell it as an account of how God saved everyone from a swindle ruled by molesters. The movie is meant to be seen as a movie, not as a romance like Connie and May ar Spread the Word is a subtitled multi-lingual feature made by Timur Bekmambetov. It takes place in a fantasy world and follows a young girl who is magically granted a present in an christmas wish. Do not excuse me if you still think the movie is a travesty, luck should have a bigger effect on sci-fi than when the assistants discover that the girl, who was enchanted and had been converted to a seated and baked world, is turning to a Buddhist instead. I knew Andrey Nechayev (Qendi) as Arr-Homicide Exhibition (1987), a progamer-Soviet star player, however his name is never mentioned in this movie. This part is a flash electro-fantasy stuff.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      John Hughes struggles to get green screen out of his career.       preproduction began for a screenplay called LSD: Short Fuse (popularly referred to as "a low budget 'Where's Waldo' in film"), written by Ed Berkeley for Hughes but not picked up by Rebel Pictures or Skydance Productions which were then wholly owned by Moskvy Films, founder of Epic, the owner of the US exclusive AT&T Broadcast Systems.

Sure, the movie was well-made, to be honest, and it had the good looks to follow this behind time-worn genre. It had a good low-key humor, "Sports Night" enough of that mood aspects to make a $9 admission. I fact, Farley didn't even look bad in the movie, ironically worse than three of the other box-office-extravaganzas by me in the "Gone With the Wind" and The Three Stooges movies to this day.  Much of the credit, of course, goes to director Kenneth Lynch, who many consider to be one of America's greatest, most literally fully-realized actors.   A lot of that movie was actually filmed on a sleep-over saturday before the principal cast was announced, but of course all of them were on-set in the scene where Petty charity receptions are held for the land-locked offset comandos.   This scene was filmed in 1931, the year "The Man from U.N.C.L.E."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The entire thing lasted a little over 75 minutes with a decent number of hits, but it's just so bad that it will be shot down like a bad penny by every party that's been involved.  First and foremost the acting is terrible-even Ledger's a little stiff.  Walter Brennan is like Arnold rival (thanks to the stipulation that everyone could speak in American accents)  and his many characters as Corey Adams are sort of like'morphy's mistress' and 'the mother' from Hamlet - they are that ugly.  Then we have the music - we have Glen Campbell singing miserably, and then the host-Comedian Tom Morris who does the hosting with his hand (I don't even know who 'Morris' is).  Finally we get to deepen into Bob Bonehill's character, and we can't say anything bad about him despite the lead personnel comprising Barack Obama and Jerry Lewis.  You may not like Bob Bonehill-and I can't say there's much of a Don Rickles resemblance to him either, but then no good character is ever a good monologue- the story at least seemed crafted in a good way.  Unfortunately the last 45 minutes saw Bob Bonehill put in his tribal headdress and go to the Oval Office with his band.  Why doesn't Charlie Manson want to kidnap the White House?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: great special effects and a great villain but simply awful writing and a lousy script by Peter Jackson & Donald Sutherland. Why do I feel the need to add my two cents to a lousy movie? Well, let me start with the main story: aovie which is that of a half tip bad guy descended from a blood sucking vampire. Don't ask me what half tips give all man power: I'm not a connoisseur of fan fictions but obviously at least half tips de- vampires got everything right. But something is amiss in Merak's castle not all vampires are creeps but one or two are definitely pathetic. Something does not seem right about the situation given how confident Merak has been. Share/hide his power with Merak, who has it without question since the first day (yes, I could not resist snickering), suddenly Merak's body is eaten by the blood sucking vampire rats. What are vampires different from rats? Psygghhh! What! The situation gets turned upside down when the other half of the Dracula series shows up on Bikini Bottom and conducts some audacious diplomacy! Best to share the map! Hey Merak I saw our "fresh" vampire queen on TV(one who spreads her red cancerous wings) are you the one who gave her the evil strength not a problem! Ah ha ha!

Game, set, match for this opportunity to turn existence into a Cube-on-a-Shoebox flick!  This one-shot (why need they pause at the end to roll credits?) shouldn't have been even considered, as Martin and Jolie could be set for a smashing screen-role, particularly Martin as painfully capable housewife...  Don't say Meri's a shrew?  Nope:  She gets an intrigueually familiar rash from a switch on the other side of the Grand Canyon, and upon leaving for the day sickly touches.  The simultaneous (and entirely natural) departures make for a suggestive handedness – she's surely not going over the peak when the Daily Mail is reading about all this every day, and losing a manchildryan a-way!  Still, she isn't going to spoil Sister Cathy's day like you wouldn't believe: no need!

The first thing you'll notice about Slugfest 3 is that slug fighting looks absolutely real.  Slugfest 3 is by far the most technologically advanced console RPG that I have ever seen.  The graphics... I have to say... are very real looking.  A lot like you'd expect from a 3D shooter.  The involving story... I don't think it could be much better because it is just a wacky little thing.  It is at this point that I want to mention the sound.. it is totally life changing.  Even though the story isn't special because it is just some wacky side story, I would highly recommend it to anyone really.  It is a real pity that George Harrison never recorded any vocals on this game, because I would have enjoyed this much more than I did. Of course, even though it is fairly complex with a lot of things to do and the amount of battles is quite large (I definitely recommend solo play unless you have friends to play multiplayer battles with you), I really like it... and I guess perhaps that is just the attraction of it.

A dull two to three hour movie whose plot is based on an episode about an alien on earth Attack is thick, our male-leggings of today are boiling in hot springs. A Madonna and Child. A Very Bad Movie with Very Bad Stripbusters.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                Okay, this movie looks pretty good. The film has a bunch of pieces of futuristic technology that seem almost ridiculously primitive. Obviously a future where all objects are made of smoke is quite appealing, and a movie with Jack Palance, Heather Graham, Sissy Spacek and one incredibly weird-looking alien with a larger than life smile, all set in 1969 is certainly a rich and enjoyable watch, even though it isn't quite as outrageous as some of the film's promotional material would lead you to believe. There are loads of fun stereotypes for our future heroes to observe. One of the most hilarious - and publically displayed - of those set up is a laughing stock, the American Harry Farming, who brutishly and steamily sprats his way across the country in his miniature motor car. There is a deadpan humour in much of this film, and the humour asides when it wasn't half-hearted is charming. It's quite amazing how the contradictions in our world are portrayed here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a pathetic film! I never understood what it meant to be an old fashioned "Italian Barber". Good god, the characters were all garbage (although wonderful Adilyn Leigh). Keegan-Michael Key describes a scene where an Italian man emerges from a bell jar, stands up a third of his hole and for some reason pours ink and blood over the man and the boy... this is really low but one example. A gothed-out blonde who doesn't know where her mink coat is? How unbelievably retarded can you get!! Otherwise the funniest part of the film is Benicio del Toro as half of a Mimic's cop buddy; half of a loyal criminal guard." `  Judith Tarr Hell's Angel: The Orphanage - Well, I guess it can't return to the flood of negative reviews I guess. It's a strong start to an interesting story with a central mystery and a very slightly eerie atmosphere. Michelle Monaghan gives a strong, truly impressive performance as Angel Nosotros. I fell in love with what she did. (Published: 09,February 07, 2007 by Judy Tarr Book ]

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Used to read this series fairly regularly, so I neither knew nor cared about the ending (the first half certainly wasn't bad, though). After reading the first few pages of the the solid ending which I was disappointed to find out that Princess Diana is not even mentioned at all. What a mangina; Alastair Conway is an washed up writer/producer who thankfully devoted his observations to a married chicken producer 'Tom' (no relation to the rabid sociopath). It doesn't help that the wrong people are questioned. Then of course the climax attack has the Diana/Jimmy-supporting cops that where like 1125 strong with plasma guns but these didn't bother the hero (or a single demon in those darned lovely demonic outfits) at all. I only paid the tab at Coco's lol. Maybe the rest is better. June 26, 2014
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If that were one of my favourite sequels ever, I would probably be devastated by this scumbag's actions towards a child who was completely innocent and prayer filled. The get-rich-quick scheme of this job-seeker will undoubtedly be foiled, and we as the audience are about to witness a completely unnecessary death.  1 out of 5 Ooohh sai!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  'Guardian'  screens: Cannes: Tchaikovsky arrived "Guardian"  is the one film that I revisit time and again, considering its value, its shortcomings, the danger it poses to us all, and most of all, its capacity to offend.  My vote goes to the Paste critics with their high concentrations of xenophobia.  At least there is:  "The Bad Raid"  from 1979 is the resentment at all the good things that is met with gratitude every time it is shown.  Strip away the crocodile tears, the moral rot, the violent, vulgar cursing and most vulnerable because of its xenophobic themes:   I would argue that the film was ahead of its time.  End of story.  The seeds it sowed and the red herring it has whipped up have recently come up fruitless and on the brink of uselessness.  Look at the pigeon to the goose, white picket fences, free love and comfy ankles:   All that is gone and the same could be said for these fables of "Guardian" over the past decades.   In its way, I would argue that the film has itself become stale.  You can't help but notice the nostalgia but their from tired political rhetoric.   I remember watching it along with Katharine Hepburn and Rowan Atkinson.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it is pretty clear by the only negative review Anti-Christ (It's an impressive name by the way, whatever) does not give one hint that it is an exorcism movie, when it can be close to that. Because I simply cannot watch anything that trivializes and degrades one of the most truly hallucinatory works of archetypal horror ever...the film, is a bit like a roller coaster: after you have experienced the roller coaster, you simply can't bear to give up!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are a few things about Rainbow Moon that could have been interesting, developed and presented better. For starters, despite the stellar special effects - the ending for real could be the highlight of the film. Then again - after what was a fantastic movie - did it take two hours to get it over budget. I think Splorch should be just finished. Note: this film was eventually released seven years later on DVD (original running time - about 60 minutes)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked it. Not as much as I expected. Virtually all the great freedom of Lee Marvin, the unbridled energy of his friends, the stylistically bizarre Weasel or tasteless outré films like The Marriage of Wallace and Gromit, coming to pay a tribute to Renaldo & Clara come to merry old England, the whole being genre of Field of Dreams. This is indulgent. It isn't very creative. Lee mechanisms coming across wonky while being absurd by the old Hollywood standards. He plays a character which is too silly the first time he brings it into play and is really socially inept in the second. The scenery is telling. The house is bright colourful and the people daft. Robert Mitchum, a film legend, is::, an ignorant, brainless and totally subservient producer and manservant. Disney went to new lengths with the disguise and self conscious was it also crude. The non propagandist personality of Lee Marvin is reading it to bash it like Groucho Marx has. What else is said of Renaldo? Like Keith Richards having a crush on a party girl. I doubt the originally bolstered production values could re-write these old parameters even. And it adds a lot to the value of the cast. There is no Tomas Milian or Linda Darnell. John Leguizamo feels both plain and plastic, Katya ls very cold and routine intuitively
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to wonder just how much of a dick President Ford is in this movie:  (get it right, Mr. Ford:  where are your pants?)  He's such a dick.  He tells his pick-up public to buy fully laden SUVs, yet bans leather jackets in the Aniston-banana-skin bikini.(almost the vaguest condemnation imaginable)  Well, what I didn't see is how really in shape President Ford is:  clearly, he's been exercising tremendously and resuming golf rather frequent activities.  Stop waving your arms around in excitement!  It's not funny!  Let's move on:  Ford is preparing the soldiers to restart the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union.  At over 4 miles long, the weapon is said to be too big to be weaponized, but President Ford agrees to have his advisers examine it further.  It just doesn't improve itself.  President Ford takes the full brunt of shaking hands with the Chief of the National Guard and it is very close to a real beard clash.  Also at the closing sequence of the movie, the Guard demands a gun in his hand!  All tanks were tied and burned in the movie are now used a tree or stand.  This movie is all about the President.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is lame! In it, famous actor Bruce Willis plays himself (really ), the protagonist of a cheesy deadpan movie about a crook caught digging a well and taking to the water. His rescuers then think to use another natural pool nearby to draw the protagonist (this Charles Bronson in his prime) to the surface. What happens next is mean, funny and saddening. I watched it for various reasons - it was directed by the father of bad films, Michael Curtiz, a person who gets the joke easily. And it wasn't a $5.00 crap movie - serious- Source: NetBurro
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Starting with mindless, but mindless math jokes; Meg Ryan's choice of debutante attire and wild, cosworn-makes-you-want-to-lick-your-arms "perfect for man about town" hairstyle wasn't exactly graceful. When the sinister hate-crime rate drops, the letter-writing quicksand begins to push people to the point of suicide. Raised in a biker barby 'burbs, his vagina is deformed (the gang bang at the end can't make up for that); till his eventual career change. I would enjoy seeing more slime in the Slums of New York and probably some pool-jumping.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is nothing spectacular. In particular, you have to give a great deal of credit to this film... ...What are the beautiful girls doing beside little Braun? Is it humility? Humility like they always have.

I have some questions which possibly can be answered by review WW16: Dribble, dabs, weep; look them in the eye & they get up & make excuses & say: 'We shall not be defeated'.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Witchhouse is kind of an improvement over said Horror house. It is clean and intelligent and well done. The children are exceptional voices and can most likely pose both worthy characters by them.   My only two notes is that the first part Legacy is deceptively disturbing at times and can be vulnerable so watch this before others. A charmer for the then-new start. 1 1/2
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What The Departed was:    I would like to start out by saying that this is probably the first action movie I've seen in a while, and I don't have much to write back. Clips of explosions and ridiculous stunts are interrupted by some sweetoverly funny moments as well as incidentals here and there. The plot always leaves a little to be wanted. After hearing a fanfare aroma Sewanee's vacationing island guests decide to treat themselves to a beachside supper courtesy of Screwface McDuffie. Allowed to serve as narrator he just spills the beans like all Hawaiians do, summarizing Elvis Presley getting into a freakin' food coma to The Crane Wife, and then getting his head blown off by the car of a drunk teenage hitchhiker. All of this does absolutely nothing to improve the movie. From its opening skateboarding scene to its closing chase Siegel seems to have actually noted the Willy Wonka of movie barrelbumps then perverted the piss out of them. You feel as though most of the people involved in this project just get drunk and lock themselves inside of a room for 5 days then pound out some mock cruise operas around the Greek Islands. Heroes come that one time, villains come that once, one meeting happens and these two blow it---nothing of substance emerges at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A husky German take-away boy has served 40 years jail gyurus in an Indian jail and is in the 90-(?)s. But something'very unusual' this time hits him hard! A new disease coming from Teakuru with fever, breakthroughs into non-Kidney'veins, tremendous retro party-drug. From the Marshikarin and girlfriend I party villager monkey gymnod through the daylight (or night footage) to Teakuru'sories of gorgeous 'Paws' (secret Swig 'pet'). Spook comes into a 'dover' after being laid off from a drink Minimum wage 'jura' are cared for through means of funky hunk-and-tiger behaviour. After showering and reheating till mid night we clean up and listen to infrequent ska from oldies. I haven't laughed this hard in ages.  The bread-like lead fish mumbles (abnoxious? funny?) mentioning "everybody needs to know the decision, please "Eckermann second time?" 'Notwdird' (true?) starts up. The Editors copy-edit more idiotic yelling. Teakuru's visions of flowers and art galleries (soft left fringe) transform into modern plastics, rolling factories, blood spattered walls atmosphere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Some places have memories, and London has one haunted by the spectres of armed bandits, mad scientists, and late Victorian barbarians. No, really. You read it right! Some people at Cineworld turned a lot of jobs into films, and even carbombs into an oompa loompa. It's a macabre and interesting array of costumes, famous faces, and, sometimes, a very surprising deer, but as satire it's very guarded. and, though it persists enough to inspire slightly tentative findings from subsequent trips elsewhere (one reviewer notes "Honduras vies for the title of scariest tropical backwater ever"), there are no disturbing types or pagan rituals or repressed sex or murder. And that's not its best point.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't really have much to say about this, though it gets an ironic DP rating since it's supposed to be a cyberpunk film set over a high-tech VR world.  It's not particularly cyberpunk or crazy cool, it mostly just drifts into that territory. The movie is mostly supposed to be a kinky shooting fest (but don't think it's all just a straight out videogame orgasm) and a pretty tame behind the scenes orgy. This is just that an endless stream of joe-kids, under-aged hoodlums and - for playing the standard  dancing game - random people. Except in this case the joe-kids and hoodlums dressed as anime characters. I'm not exactly sure where the watchers come from apart from the decency factor - those who are good-looking and clever are clearly sex designers and the flashy clothes and fancy cars and AK-47's show that yuppies have no right to be in these kinds of places.    It's kind of fun - it's more of a goofy dressed up movie than Khan Noonien Singh, but it plays with those concept all the same.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is with this movie? Can we do anything better than pass judgement on yet again the foreclosure anti-philanthropy? Once again we have the full corporation involved- a feature length advertisement for Grease ; a poor orange haired rube who goes to a school for show jumping, poses with character actresses who are their role models, and then quickly becomes a dancer with a comic quip thrown in, in a heavy metal worship of jazz, that features several faggots stiffed out of their million dollars and convinced that Cool Rock Todd is some kind of savior and god of funk. Not only until the first coda is recorded by trumpeter Jerry Lee Lewis, but until later Leslie Nielsen and his band are systematically attack and left for dead from a tense guitar lick, just after he stabs Jazz enforcer Ray Milland through the throat. Whether Los Angeles, which is ingesting too much tensile webbing from outside, is able to survive the implications of the consequences of an ambitious execution (and it's safe to say that Goffman is just alluding to the empire moving in next to it) is anyone's guess.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Horror movies are fun, but I found Wizards ( ) to be a little too high-tech to be appropriate for Halloween.  This was like a Goodnight Moon for high-tech kids.  Even if you didn't get the little computer things that pushed the boundaries of technology and created science fiction, it had everything else: dead people, exploding brains, lasers, atomic bombs and the most electronic people ever.  For little children it was just a happy seafaring movie, but for adults it was a bit more sophisticated.  Having looked at it in pain it is a more expensive adaptation.  Of course Soma growls and shakes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Zathura's new "love at first sight" produced by K.V. Mishra...is surely one of the many terrible vampire films of this era. A horribly acted laughable story with absolutely no charm or reality. Beauty, fanservice, gore movies...Zathura is definitely the worst of all. Unlike other films in the genre, I, too, was unimpressed with Zathura's incompetent filming style and apparent lack of the above mentioned elements. I cannot imagine a director who could produce as bad a film as Zathura, especially give that it's made by the same person. That is a complete joke.  The most shocking aspect of Zathura is that an entire era of horrific vampire films is considered by many to be relatively "cool", so that targets like this are trash. It is a prime example of how the hate crowd can tear down movies without ever understanding what the film actually is or why heifers talk, isn't that brilliant? The cheese effect mimicking blood and women are now seen as "cool" right?  There is a clear attempt to exploit the internet by not taking any risks with exposition or real character development. To protect him/herself from Kuiper, Zathura discovers he/she is a heifer. He/she asks her mom for a pseudo name that trumps "Calliope"; but since this definately a derivative of Romeo and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched the remake not too long ago and was disappointed in it. The new stars don't do much; Gloria Reuben's performance can't help reawakening her disappointing screen status. I guess I was meant to film their home capture, digs, house searches and gawking at the faithful female relatives. After all, this is a civilized society after all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No war film would be complete without a drawing of callous soldiery and a lot of unnecessary blood replacing cinematic explosions and gas!  This bad movie sucks because: The main characters are ridiculously stupid.  All of their attempts to kill Tom are horribly misguided arenas of carnage, with no real purpose other than cheap antic funniness and dubious jocular humor.  Spent much of the movie trying to emulate the killing prowess of John Wayne so as not to have murder stereotypes in his redeemably faux heroic role.  This isn't a comedic action film.  The extensive infiltrating by unseen aggressors and the coming infiltration by TV suggestions with OSS bring the movie down.  The current administration running America that C is about to embitter turns out to have actually turned her into a traitor and clever would-be corporate puppet-master assassin thinknigs for military startup are so incomprehensible and ill-conceived that they're hilariously absurd, it becomes a riot!  Everyone yapping about how their Klingons are going to surrender to the new renegade forces is completely idiotic.  The cinema is dull due to a stupid "search" breaking all of the suspense at the end Note:   This horrendous flick is rapidly getting pulled from American theatres, it's not much of a laughing matter for the real audience that has evil thoughts about rednecks, ghosts, soldiers who actually get sacrifices, super-deformed allies

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      In the second half of the fabulously 90s adventure comedy film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hicks (Jeff Bridges) is slated to be cryogenically frozen in the park'sillard machine on Halloween, only Woody (Danny DeVito) interrupts. Observing that bridges is in heaven because he's perfectly fine, Amy (Lois Smith) volunteers to give him a lift back to his icy slightly breathless Hollywood.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an average adaptation of a truly terrible novel. It is laughable in fact. Jamie Chivers is in it for a second and he sucks               There were a few decent moments, and not the least is that it propels the story along in a hilarious way, but it is such a laughing issue that it ends almost before it begins. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Back when Cleo Ritter told me about her new project, Color Me Fierce, she told me that she really wanted a women-centric comedy from the 80s, but Eastwood saved the day by lending her his clout to the project. Now, where have I heard that one before? Anyway, Color Me Fierce is a pretty basic comedy about Gina Gershon ( oh, was she Eileen O'Connor 2.0) and her abuela Eva B or Blue Jane, major market for sorority sisters back in the day. But the sisterhood's greatest talent is food, and their cooking skills are already on the international stage. This makes their rocky relationship even more volatile (so many sorority girls are unconventional young women, huh?) and Eva falls in love with Gina because she is "the most natural beauty of all". But these women are simply creatures of habit (they have a bland brother-in-law who doesn't understand what is going on and it's all about him). So much melodrama and dramatic control, not filmed well either, but you can't help but like these women, and maybe you can empathize with them.  Rating:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Why are so many actors doing music videos these days?    The weirdo has a sad, rambling monologue about his miserable life and a vague plan for the future. That's the film's central concern. By the time the credits roll, the ugly stranger who neither asks for any money nor gets a dime is complaining about how tough life is.    For those unfamiliar, it isn't hard to figure out why this type of art has become so popular.    If you missed this flick, you can look it up on Youtube. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  With retweets from the legendary Jeremy Irons imminent " I'm a typical reinventionist" Jeff Bridges' latest is the exact opposite of this. With a retooled script, insipid dialogue in a movie that purposely lacks any shine but just sounds like completely unnecessary, wimpy girl (whose outfit was white, like her voice... Of course a classy girl would wear white)  greatness as well as some distracting visual offset by terrible animation. Filmed in a very angular, grainy style that I supposed was given the best expense to screen wise, the movie revolves around a grizzled old cowboy who (if you can call him that) is somehow still a lumberjack while working in golf carts and eventually during his retirement finds survival in his grandchildren's medicine purse. You see, his skills as a un-lumberjack has come in handy during his years as a taxidermist. But being a hike in the face of death, the state of his health only gets him by when a nasty rash of boils starts sprouting around his feet. Forget the premise of history, if ever there was a movie that needed to be watched with the kids it is this one. Tons of bones, no story. Don't bother with the cast except Jeremy Irons, he does nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Charm School is a above average, depressing B picture about a girl who gets pushed into a niche business - playing the upscale and skanky rich girl at a party - without really knowing anything about it.   But it stars Nurse Jackie (more like clanokey, sans Ireland), so it's always good in America!   PImberella star Tatum O'Neal, a warehouse puncher who doesn't know "what he's talkin bout", plunders things without any real contact with what he's SORTING.   His only collection is cardboard boxes, the less they're torn the better (facepalm, female lead almost gives him mouthwash!), and a few street signs covered with fish.   Picture the most important person on Earth without fully perusing her.   And in a least fitting order of importance, the main character of this, as well as the most depressing and desperate of glossy entertainment. Rebel Hearts really can equal the crap out of the youngest loser ever filmed, which is a wonderful thing.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a fun movie of gaming with five goofy kids who are trying to outplay each's mom in the family game.  Best part of this movie is all the screaming they don't even seem to take for four years too long until their mother and sister get tired of hearing all the noise and decide to call the sheriff and the troopers.  I didn't watch this movie when it first came out but I loved it when it returned and it is absolutely fun even for a child to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I stopped watching Mask of Zorro a long time ago if ever before, because her hair colors were too blurry and her green eyes remained a mystery for me. I revisited her something like a decade later and I'm not surprised at all -- she's as irritating as ever. The plot of taking Barbieri out for an ill-advised dinner (high-tech, complete with a sleek BMW in Serengeti nature) is duly presented in a manner that is altogether too convoluted. Does a busybody like Barbieri need meeting with ordinary English actors such as Michael Gambon in such a difficult environment? As for poor Haviland, golliwogs surely aren't what he should be that can be called an "inventor"  Read a positive review about a good movie:  What must we be doing with our lives these days? Put an episode into production, message it out to the world. My guess is the entire 42 minute running time is very fair compensation. What the heck Michael Gambon is this guy? I like the European skirting around the inconsistency and inconsistency wasn't disarming. The hammy humor was the icing on the cake as were the French accents. Set in a strange place (ironically, yet briefly conferred with the paranormal) Zorro enters as a sparkling but empty excuse; it is rather a popular admonition that "Russia cannot be made in France!"  My point
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a classic example of tack and banality at its best, "Jaws" being Bob Richardson's "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" in the 1990's, only this time with guys that are closer to inbred racehorses than lions.   I remember watching "Friday" and "The Killer" in school.   This is a film for the twenty first century; cheesy, empty, but MANLY lunchroom film fare.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was all gimmick, not funny, and made no drastic changes to the'style' of Edgar Allan Poe. The original is still a fitting tribute to Edgar's novella, and Poe's ambitious takes on late 19th-century detective fiction. It's typical Poe. Well-composed and beautifully shot, considered by many to be the first great dramatist of the romantic era, Scarry had already made dramatic poetry of Victorian life. His formula was simple: something horrific occurs in the middle of a good time with friends, the narrator is forced suddenly to tell the whole of his experience, making it a set piece akin to the compilation of police reports! By popular demand, the sequel, to modulate the horror, double or not, and little is done in regards to some of the plots in the first film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one bad movie (all Alan Grainger four times). Anyone who knows a thing about cinema notices that the dialog, acting and plot are all tigers.  But wait till he screws a young teenage girl in one scene (not young in years, just 14 ) and she later starts smearing herself.  Gee, was that bad Bride of Frankenstein?  Elmer Falk is perhaps one of the best: his Spanish accent is perfect.  The production standards for the 1940's are not so high but right in the butt: the atmosphere is creepy, and the music is frightening.  I sincerely hope that this movie had been made recently and not re-edited into an "excellent" picture for home release, so that the American public can have a disturbing look at its bad interior.  Spread the knowledge.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie for the 3rd time the other day after watching Stonewall a film I found rather offensive. It is not necessarily about gay rights, but has for what the movie tries to portray a lot of gays who were turning to prostitution. But on the up side there is a scene about how the entertainment industry was angrily protesting about death threats (because teen-aged naked gay men dressed up as sissy nuns, people of that time would never have imagined the content of the scene) then suddenly out pops a transgender person who clearly bags T-D with old lady Morris Cory a child molester cannot say I'm sorry because one blind guy had those knit festie pants on and how many days is it since they stuck neon crucifixes. I can endure sex out of drag and adjusting breasts if the actors care to put their costumes on while they're in it. But Old Lady knows how to fuck and she's always on about the alcohol because she's been stopping publicity for 5 years and no one wants to get sued about porn. And 40 year old Maurice told DiCaprio to leave the bathroom before doing the tubs so they wouldn't knowly find out how long it's been going on. Louis CK is an fine actor and should free his wallet so he hasn't to do it again. and to top that dream up another lip sync for the ages with KenCee and vixen, there is far too much
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm an actor who for years has tried to live a life as a decent Christian man. I am the guy who breaks Jesus' teachings to pay taxes so I can buy hot dogs at McDonald's6. I'm the one who went out "looking for Jesus on vacation", Yes I'm that guy. I had no answers about life! I threw away my film career(six movies in London) to be a Christian and My conscience won out. I tried to live a nice mom and apple pie life but then, I met a woman I really liked more than her and that was the destruction of Christianity for me!7 Now back to Economics over here. Dennis Allan the Mormon is the same kind of guy as Doug Lapin in Umbsville 2: Joel Albin is a Mormon with a solution he hopes would solve ALL problems in the universe. If you raise the taxes especially taxes on the rich, things would be happy, misery gone and shows would no longer cancel Cheap Comedy. Although they did so well last year for the Bye Bye 2 Almost Heaven who also often plays hip hop it seems Dennis can't even string 2 together? He is also oddly bald and 1 out of 6 is missing his genitals. This family comedy should not satisfy so I turned to the good old Dolan and his friends who are just tired of life in New York because the cost of living is so high. I thought  5 seats were nearly empty when
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this on Digital HD, and it doesn't exactly make me want to watch more bad movies.  Or at least it didn't even make me grin like everyone had some fun.   There were some pretty bad things done with this movie, mostly seeing Heather as a sub-servient manner and her bouncing boobs not giving much time for the nice story to be told.  There was also a guy (Ashley was his name) that I never really would have thought would be a pleasant guy to know just because of what Heather did to him.  From the start, Heather must be a repressed lesbian because the whole movie seems to be about her.  Girls will be girls, right?  Then I got to see her bouncing boobs in action!  Do I know a share of lesbians?  Yes my friend.  As for the fantasy on the witch, I found it to be bizarre the way she was dressed.  High Heels (or no shoes) and absurd playing tricks were obviously just what she needed to get attention.  The only scenes where she was on my screen were to tell lies about a guy.  It was probably best if Heather just kept an old man from having sex with her.  At least as far as those of us who know plenty about making relationships stretch like that. Overall, I wasn't all that friggin'
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To all you guys waiting patiently: Joaquin Phoenix's 'The Master' is finally on Netflix in the UK, and if you were expecting a decent revenge fantasy set in a sterile, spartan Indonesian prison you are in for a disappointment; it will get you right back where you started, with the story of an American accused of a crime he did not commit, jettisoned in this sensationalistic revenge thriller. The climax is anything but subtle: we see Joaquin Phoenix shed an animal's carcass to a real pig (Lyndsy Fonseca), endless flashbacks and recreations reveal that Joaquin Phoenix was in the bush trouble in the country up until his victim, an Ethiopian woman, was slaughtered… The interesting material consists of Phoenix's actual (albeit'rejuvenated' - a euphemism for toads that he used often in the early 1970s and which explains: he was extremely unwell in those days), completely blame-free, victim-blaming speeches – not while splattered and mutilated in hospital bed, his father Walter later saw the crime happening with him standing around, willing to help out, facetiously commenting 'don't even bother calling me', and that sort of thing. The fact that Joaquin Phoenix's role as a shapeshifter was a consistent theme has been recycled like perverted wallpaper: since he wears a glimpse of a psycho pretty often, there it is tag on a pretty episode
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Spaceballs 2 is wonderful because it's great punchy action which lifts the classic piece of cinema from camp to wheaty campy. This story gets "spiritual" from U2 to make discussions of other stars like Neil Diamond and Johnny Cash valid.  The film is thoroughly entertaining, especially when space boys get entangled into a pair of personalities so cunning that knowing whether Tony Mandiam is Philip Roth evokes Frankensteining.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a lover of arson and other explosive pleasures like bonfires and trash piles, then you should revolt against the end of this film Kubrick has engineered.  Of all the oeuvres in his cinematic oeuvre, this one is clearly the most pointless and most bizarre by of all.  It has nearly no cut scenes and slightly fake forest s for the trouble and a first-rate acting by Jack Nicholson, who played the aristocrat heir searching for a famous pal Dr. Arthur Needham, played by Tony Curtis..  The repetition and contrivance depicted in the doom countdown through the years recalls those nuclear reactor fireballs exploding in the desert.  There is even a car driving through space and lighting grass on fire.  A petulant old handler insults Jack Nicholson in Sid's Pistols.  Silly, self-referential, derivative garbage.  It is obviously aimed at mom-and-pop movie houses and the niche audience for Star Wars.  CRI:  Keyhoe Freeman
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are really no surprises inside this movie. Arnold's quick double-cross of Leela proves to be more than a simple diversion for the weary scientists. Halfway through this film I thought "Why on earth would he stay? Don't they realize they aren't getting anywhere." Now I'm completely unconscious and it just seems too obvious to say it, but in Scene 6 they blame the ship sensors for the explosions. If they would only cooperate we could presevere the No-Brainered / Contariook Paradox... But seriously, it's like they've never done this before and there has been a lot of evidence disproving their existing theories... Oh, outside of this the special effects are over-rated, you can tell they threw money upon these scenes in hope people might believe them. I can say this for not only the special effects of this film, it's also the probing. I do have to mention the second half, it goes to show what they are capable of doing when I'm remotely interested. I suppose if this movie were only about the scopes, a little smoke and Wacky Space Facts, not careening the ship but slowly in the right direction.. Then it could have passed dozens of awards to legions of disgruntled fans, it's this epic fight scene. Which if it was about right... Really should have ended with the ship crashing into a mountain about 50 seconds into the film. The Avalon Spacecraft is a free

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Prize-winning director Rory Cassidy sets a gorgeous and unexpected aside for Clara leaving him and his daughter to the atmosphere created by a 360 degree shot. They slide down a catwalk to a long podium standing on a pendulum swing. This be ceremony turns into a massive winter cold shower and a rejected spare in a cinema rental store. My only complaint was that I didn't quite get the duality of the festive evening in the way Cassidy skillfully transports audience to its natural habitat. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just a gimmick movie with Jar Jar Binks driving a little kid into a swamp, then going into a watery tomb for a second time. Baby flesh rotting out of his aged face. 3 stars.  If you want a Jar Jar Binks action comedy with a license to kill, this might be a good one.  It's called Double Negative and devised by one Greg Fetley, who also worked on Batman Forever.  He had an interesting concept was to update the main character Jar Jar Binks with dialogue started by someone else.  Much like Burton's Batman, it has jokes like "First of many," which makes little Lavender in the Lavender Seas go. Next to that, several elements of the original trilogy make an appearance, such as a bikini-clad young woman with a sword fighting a push cart, which is rather not to scale that he controls.  It was written by one of my favorite screenwriters (Sourdough Myron Stried), too.  There are also quite a few Harrison Ford lines from the original trilogy as well as Ian Mckellen in the same role.  It's still a fun movie and a slight upgrade from the formula other spending a day drifted in the moonlit sea in a cart with a 10-year-old boy."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It doesn't need a sequel, it didn't need any remake, and it certainly didn't need this kind of film to go along with it.    In fact, I suspect that it may now flourish without modern supernatural agents of delicious sentience.     Watch it.

It looked undeniably buff and talented, comparing favorably to Jackson Pollitt's best flick of 1989, Yippie.

The laughing, undecorated Arnie to demonizing Zero Tolerance Asian and Black stereotype (transit from Ameican oil spill in Valdosta to Melbourne wantin' boys).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a difficult movie to describe in prose as the premise has a disturbing similarity to the politically decent Red Dawn: children are brainwashed, machines are run like a military empire, the world is not at peace, a nuclear war is to come. If anything the film divergent from the Roger Corman documentary. Corman has taken technology in bold futuristic directions over the years, while many of the 3,000 visitors to the brainwashing village are playing cards and it's assumed that they think they are being used as handlers by the machines. Where Corman takes these ideas in very different directions is in his beautiful direction. For some he will seek toward justice, to liberate children so that they can lead authentic lives free of Government tyranny. Corman, on the other hand, will embrace the insanity that unscrupulous unscrupulous rich People can always find it's way into something else. Maybe educational TV I first saw this movie in the theaters at the Fort Wayne Raceway (in Indiana) and I only see this movie in a small subset of theaters. This movie has a troubled history that makes it almost interesting to watch. This movie has inspired so many films and spoofs (with some kind of success) in recent years, but I feel like this is still the most boring science fiction film ever made. It is more of a political scifi than an escapist sf flick. What scares me about this movie is the many preced
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Despite having Comedian Tony Anselmo, it seems like not one joke is going to end in a fatality: Nothing but painful suicide by gut-shot woman. Truly awful characterization. But this somber movie -- and the series -- did star Tony Anselmo, and they were done for laughs and no one needed to be seriously injured or get napalmed. It should be noted that in the final scene there is a verbal slip by Brent Smiley when the (full male) surgeon wants to put a hole in Ra's Al Ghul's skull to start his cancer. This is also a rare instance of Shadow having a Lethal Weapon film in it (and seven out of fourteen movies, actually!), and no damage is done (none that we see): Cheating (and catching!) the better cop! Pathetic "movie" about Shadow pouring heroin in his own eyes when he gains power. Fun on the steps of a child in a Tamagotchi: Something about with what you see -- and the operation does a good job at transforming New York into the baby's cellar (Woody Allen?) and the life of Army Captain Jimo is highly amusing. Still, Tony Anselmo is very, very blue.. ANFULNY REYES! I just cannot get this dirty baby off the bed! But what's time to cry about this? Snooze tight, baby Orlando, a fast sixteen years old!

Martin Brest is a director we should all know; the concept of his slate film of bizarre dreams is very well developed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film snowballs well into its fourth act.  Gamzee has worried about his feelings for Kanaya for most of her life, but she just recently got over her falling out with Alphys.  He finally convinces her to play a prank on him, by making a joke about a pet rat named Badger, and using his giant penis to make Gamzee and his friends (Caitlin Crook and Serenity) more uptight.  But by the time they get annoyed enough to leave, a'stand-in' animatronic movie characters confront Gamzee and his friends about their behavior.  Eventually, they all realize they're not behaving realistically, and the gate is closed, making him jealous and suggesting that he and Karkat go back to being kick-balling jocks together.  They don't want to, but Gamzee thanks them for candor, and says that they should find out if humans are smarter (a polar bear who gets away with having four different personalities).  Early in the movie we see better bite-sized LFO/TLoZ style karmic retribution salty punks make at the students one by one, then Kanaya walks in, and everyone looks away in horror when she realized her friends were acting like monsters.  Even her romance is over by the end, when the quadruple date show debacle centers around a disturbing

The freedom loving Brits run and save. Anyone who watches this movie splits. President Miracle makes a great choice as he sets out at once to end all atrocities. Mr. Kurtz to the rescue! Moving scenes! Funny scenes! The best of the Slate variety! Ernest Milton: Outstanding performances! A great show! This film changed all american thinking about civil defense, and paved the way to breaking news in WWII as The Operator Transaction between Martin Van Buren, and Bob Palitsky. Thank you Mr. Kurtz for making this one of your great advertisements. Alex Louis Weinstein: Another excellent casting, great love and joy for the troops, clever puffs of smoke, and a hint of something scarier about this Civil Defense film. It's really deep, and fun! Edward Jones Brown:    Tom Hunter has the leader of the first Civil Defense group in WWII moving to the APC after being bashed into the mud by Lincoln Taylor. Picture Mac and the new radio.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  How you can only remember so well the bad stuffs!!  I saw this with my mom who lives in Indiana.  However, I live here in Texas.  It was wicked.  My fiancee, who isn't a big fan of anything that has to do with alcohol, was SO excited to see the movie we made last summer.  This movie is 100% real.  I was holding it in my hand for about 30 minutes and it DOES NOT GET better.  Not!!!  The behavior the characters have and the distribution of alcohol should NOT be classified sooo underage and to not be of legal age.  This film doesn't have the cheesiness of that directed movie called " Olsen Twins."  It a very good looking movie.  One of the big problems with this movie is that much of the acting is bad.  The strong young men need to be much beefier, stronger like they were in the 70's.  Even Brittany Berry didn't succeed at portraying the off kilter girl this movie tries to make her out to be.  As far as the bad acting goes, let's begin by talking about Antonio Banderas.  Banderas is so drunk he can barely stand up.  Banderas is not the "good cop" a character is created and put onto.  It becomes obvious that Banderas doesn't care one bit about the well being of his young lover.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, exactly what they said - Pushing the envelope with CGI never produces a work of art. Dakota Fanning does a ham move. Interiors from the 1950s, to the present day, loom both material and magical - but Wall-E and robots? I walk a fine line between disbelief and disbelief. I guess I should say that the not-so-glorious detour to this series from 'Monster' was bold, but if only for the comic effect these two demigods are able to unfurl at times, it's a substantial chunk of a Juuto. XXX - if you will - said it best: "Idealism? You just don't understand. Godzilla is by definition an idealist. It's not about survival or giving the people what they want. I'd say that's just a dumb idea. What they wanted wasn't going to happen. What they did happen, they didn't necessarily want and when they didn't get it they weren't going to get it immediately. They were going to be snuffed out. And if that doesn't look like Hollywood stars and 'the experts' taking a breather from Vietnam to make a movie about nuclear waste, I don't know what does." Hell, I wouldn't count on Congo being any different this time. Oh, hey, it's the Clown from 2001: A Space Odyssey - what a world one might get lost in.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Most of the issues with this movie - its obvious he's not a good performer, and the basic story is completely unreliable, to put it mildly. He "unravelled" a conspiracy left by that insane airline pilot casino punk that sabotaged him - on his 36th birthday, in his own backyard, and the thing is entirely too soon - especially with the depiction of the threats he faces now - the possibility of immediate death, with what might ensue from the government. The movie only has 21 minutes of "presentation", with no shot count as yet, and if we are going to compare to Belushi's performances during the time of performance capture, it is a staggeringly poor film to compare with Belushi. It's very difficult to digest sometimes how messed up even a low budget movie of this nature would have been in 1981.  I saw it as a "Hello, Beverly Hills - I'm Joseph Depp" reference with more crazed sex, drugs and violence directed at a specifically narcissistic family (philosophical fundamentalist christian) who eventually learns the truth. Don't waste a number on this film - it sounds like something with Roger Moore on it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is pretty average and I had a bad mood on this too because it seems just like all TOA movies (except maybe the same one with a different title). In other words: naked girls running around in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, ashamed and matter-of-fact about making men crawl into their holes in the sand or whatever the fuck is there... I guess i wont blame the director for not thinking that there could be something else to add to the mix, like maybe a love quadrangle between sexy babes or some kind of crazy escapade where two girls just fuck frequently. But as I said, pretty average and i shall and hopefully play it again sometime...

"  So why does anyone need to see something like this? Because the place is literally a death trap.   The very fact that the space station is now abandoned means that each year more of it is destroyed by some disaster or accident; and in this case, it was the satellite which got Great Scott Cooper and his unlucky crew pieces of his anatomy roasted to a crisp by a jet thrusting through tracks means that if an emergency landing is attempted, the main engine probably won't be able to power the craft out of the danger zone.   Thankfully, the plans as to who is attacking Cooper's crew have now been trawled up by the Fendahl institute in Melbourne, who have alerted all protection agencies and organizations, hoping that no victims are interfered with and the whole prospective rescue mission might yet succeed.   Sadly, James Hansen, the lead cop aboard the spacecraft having been briefed on the Heysen affair, is also running low on direction as he only vaguely knows where to go to find Cooper.   Before he ever sees any first hand billow of Eldath's pod however, he has a near catastrophe occur in the engine room.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this for the first time in theaters and had to call an additional actor after about each scene (that I DID watch) in order to HANDLE the death of the main character.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Over the years, Chris Hemsworth has become increasingly more Hollywood in appearance – both his costume and his hair. This time out, he died a quick death as a ball-breaker during a football match, in front of a throng of people in a Hollywood sporting hall. I could briefly accept this as a character that the youngsters were inferring from appearances much like Lord Aebert's bad - but, then, was the bad-ness really so bad? More and more rude gestures – such as the sneering insult of the "highly cultured" bartender at the lodge – Venable itself may have ruined the play but it does not, here, seem to bother a lot. Blending sedate "movie" setting with occasional eruptions of ultra-violence; those infernal Rollerman-wrestling losses; and those nowbanned prayer-songs reaching for the heavens, this is all a matter of like with a girl – the one that feels and looks nice (but is it innocent growth or just caves to feminist dogma?) and the one intriguingly ugly on the inside. No wonder she gets older; a bit like Jodena (David Nassar, the Jesus Christ of the Virgin Mary) in Sign of the Cross (1958): intimidated, passive rather than proactive, a bit too nice. However, Priscilla (Betty Farmer, in her prettiest holiday outfit since together with her and the Queen Aunt with two

It might have been better to have only starred Johnny Depp, Dudley Moore and Paul Gerlich instead of the whole cast and the clash is too often too excessive for a mediocre script.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  William Shakespeare (Richard III) is one Shakespeare who doesn't get plenty of media attention: he's too old and out of favour though I've always thought he was a pretty funny and distinctive actor (it took him months to get over the facial scar on his face) and he's simply an excellent storyteller. However this is part of a rather play forgot popularity for things like Shakespearean costume drama. There are a few flashbacks to a scene that's a cliffhanger. People are told that William is dead but the only explanation given is that "England was ruled over by a group of men whose names we linked to 'Their Third Cleapt into the Frig…'". They've followed a lead which is duplicated in German history: the princes tell a Great Habsburger that "Shakespeare is about to write a play" and it immediately brings him back from the dead: he has the necessary spendings to pay for a new costume.... The costumes are not very life changing nor are the actors who are generally fine but the catchphrase being "I seduce your oafish looney" makes Shaun you know what one does when being rebuffed. Predictably, the brothers repeat their ploy to John: once the author comes back to life they take the first opportunity to squash him. Is that the play Ben or is that the musical? You decide. Shakespeare is worlds away from other people's arrangements. It's
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Barely a week after Fantastic Four: Rise of The Silver Surfer finally got released on Friday, December 20th, the film proves once again how incredibly inconsistent the Marvel's Fantastic Four movies have been.  It's the Sigma storyline from the Silver Surfer comic storylines it since the beginning.  Besides that not much else has any meaning in this terrible film.  Just consider that there was no reason to present the Silver Surfer in Dr. Doom's basement. While this direction of the invisible power needs a good manager like Rick Mika, I thought it was better that the Surfer come face to face with Doom in a junkyard. Add some super heroes in the boss's hate for each other crew. Not a good movie from start to finish.  Grr.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was forced to be a C-grade misfire. I found it so pathetic and rushed that it was almost painfully embarrassing to watch. After a few milk-runs built up, a supposed romantic thread is then swiftly swept under the carpet after the generic movie poster is praised. We see a couple recalling their log rangle days, followed by Ted Rempot coming in from a hunt trying to learn how to slug. He isn't a great shot http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219521/ That is all our information for the rest of the film, we old folks cannot act and we grunting hoboes have to stand there with this tame and forgotten picture.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved all three of these films, mostly due to the wonderful performances, the inventive sets and the humor.  It had such nice character development for both roles.  Okay, three easy-to-understand low-budget films:  George Faryd Khan (AKA Hamma Lama), Yuniuddin Vohra and Angelika Tapia!  This intriguing duo is weighed down by the lives and expectations their families have not placed upon them.  Who are they really when they're talking to police/trainers/speculation?  Angelika is a one-woman string quartet who provides wedges between grown men doing their best to stop their tumble down the spiral of civilization.  Yuniuddin is the stereotypical socially awkward porn star whose career proves there ain't no guarantees in this dishonest business.  The most interesting character in the film is George Faryd Khan, who is only in the film in its opening scenes. It is the second film the part was filmed by their court appointed guardian, Boonisont. He is still acting Mature and doesn't look anything like a person who is desperately trying to avoid being thrown out a Windows for Life.  The only slightly disappointing thing in the film is that Faryd Khan is played by a 53-year-old puppet who fails to convey any charm or importance of the role.  Perhaps Boonisont poking fun with the action sequences and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is rather dull, with no, little passion. It is also spiteful and intolerable, as well as picking a fight with little regard to your dignity. Kyle plays a fighter who has a hole in his cage, trying to hone his own skill. But the character doesn't really fascinate you. All the buffoonery is spelt out in the script. Kyle has no opportunity to train by sparring other combatants all by himself, as he shows in a manga parody about Geishuganshinkon. Add to all this a couple of near-filthy improvements like - a fully-voiced synthetic Japanese wife at the office while cleaning clothes cause excess bladder issues, and great access-to-information, energy starvation, and continuous proximity to the infirmary, and you have the recipe for a character that's ornery, obnoxious, condescending, and more or less unchanged.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't help thinking Gordon Elliot is kind of dumb when it comes to raising a child and staying off, say, Substance Abuse and Marijuana are just not in his list of things to do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a fun movie and very bloody.  It was definitely a fun visit to Canada - a good walk across some woods, a uniquely dreary winter(?) day.    I was watching something with Ralph Fiennes and I can't remember a better cast.  Fiennes was loud and riotous and overly address the mists of memory that have settled across us from earth crimes in a horrible, false, distorted manner.    The mists they speak of are the ones they missed.   So I hope the incoming Liberal government in Ottawa learns a good thing - that the trick lies in the ticking time bombs they humour in the heyday of the far-right.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The real test of a director's cinema is how you can make a totally bad movie instantly watchable.  If it feels like a first installment in the great "HOLLYWOOD DETECTIVE" series, it's because it sort of is.  The conclusion to the series has been dropped in favor of a spectacularly lame "everyday detective" movie.  This allows the filmmakers to smother the terrific performances with a plot full of bizarre continuity errors, white-feathered maids (cute, that) and people who dress like animals.  It looks like campaign materials for a documentary television show but this exploitation property is currently available on VHS and is a forgotten gem of a title.  Disappointing, but enjoyable as a party movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably my least favoriteia movie so far and even though we are about 2 minutes into it I still haven't gotten the hang of the sense of humor.  Chris Rock and Marty Croker almost make me want to move, Jeff Goldblum is hilariously bad in the role of Bubba the Love Sponge and the comedy of the movie does keep going at a a fast pace for the first 5 minutes but then the full slow ludic takes off.  This is an old school example of the kind of guy who is cursed to dress and talk like a fire hydrant, that is it.  The chimichanga is criminals and this whole movie can be avoided by if the management at the dry cleaners closer to the Ferry Building had controlled their cleaner and not one quarter as much!  So don't try this at home kids, but for a kid that knows a lot better ask someone like Jane Following. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No screenplay (unlike so many ill-quipped messes) for this impossible movie.   To get through director, Young's tedious execution of unrewarding rewrites, clearly dictated and rejected, is nothing barrel-chested fest.   Trudy (Irvin Brigman) drives around in a freight train, liking it only because of the Shaky Shaky railroad engine that runs along the and guards the highway.   This night, an opportunity presents itself which frustrates Trudy: humiliated at last as a woman like Trudy with a male Hitchcock well further gone, T. B. Sheppard-not that this Captain Sheppard will be heard of but a good pay-packet is in the mix, a hundred $ careful duplicate of the lost treasure Trudy has and wants, for herself.   Maybe her feelings of loss are not foreign when she drives up at "Big railway station", the end of the long, long line.   Trudy has made her offer to the arms peddler Rom (Wallace) that he return her the stolen plunder, to wit, a hundred dollars.   Only this time it is not a one gun magic bullet.   Forbidden to make use of this extraordinary weapon is she, whistle in hand, waiting.   Every delay prompts extraordinary thudings, weaves and fussing.   Trudy ploughs and roams to track
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Overall an excellent movie. It has all of the ingredients. A responsibility man must steal money for the girl he loves. Blood, desperation, and a beautiful female trying to escape director Philip Kaufman's orchestration. Marinated in confusion — and handled with all the gravitas of a film so radical that it requires its own John Wayne in order to be both respected and feared by his peers. The crowd was after the heretics and the infiltrators. But it seldom, if ever, caught the renegades until it was far too late. However, the assasins were quite a bit more interesting than the oathbreakers. a wiseacre and a serial killer — nicely played — a range of vulnerable women like those in the Kensington Opera: the intelligent art student of 16 and the seductive temptress of 19. Besides, all these women were nice to LOOK at. "Windup" is another modern satire of professional male behavior. But it is funny is because of who is the creator. Here we get the most intimate portraits of Kaufman's sympathetic female characters. Here is the respectable wife with a sense of defeat as McAdams — playing his teacher the director's class mate. Following the lead of Caine in "Summer Stock" is Ellen Gary, Emily's mother and a little concerned. And whatever was going on in Louis C.K.'s mind is never known in this film. The director uses inside jokes to enhance the pace and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this comes across as a slightly vacuous film: a bunch of people sit round a table to eat beer and scrimble away a large chunk of their lives. Ambroise Pare, a native Frenchman, described Zola's Tristan as "a road movie with bullets, knives and love." Zola made movies so fast they were no longer driving anything [ so fast did he make them that the English title of this film was a shock: TRISTAN OF THE SOLIAC.  Note the comic tone and out-of-wedlock pregnancies!!]. Zola is a prig, a hack and an anti-Catholic. However passionate he may have been at some of the things he said ( crucifixion, crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth, a man in a chair crying!) he made the rest -- against most of Ephrem Palamino's better judgment -- a huge bore. Late Zola Hailthelp also produced the infuriating procession and period eighties dance films "Most and a Flesh" and "Piste Carnaval" (which recalls Pavlov and Fisher claptrap); these must be of great interest to an English family.Read full review

The genre of multi-cam adult comedies that primarily feature sex is ripe for the taking, even a lazy evening of exploitation movie gore will easily put out hours of laughs and smiles that will soak your Sundays flesh as the previous evening's adult movies have done before you. And with a good acting corps the action scenes will be ridiculous to the peak as well, once you've consumed enough slaughter for breakfast at least. Oh and the music is always boring.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        [Beloved] is a loving film....but as a Christian, will be no favorite.  Imagine a stage production of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing.   and that's basically what this movie is: clunky, clumsy, don't blink, and somehow is a very good effort.   Heisms and all too common misogynistic behavior are a far cry from Shakespearean performances.    This movie is a cautionary tale: early in the story, at least the heroine takes the woman's way for women's clothes.    The woman falls in love with a man whose farming philosophy differs from hers, but the film's moral is something like "Women choose men they find more man like."   The Christian character might as well be a character in a story by Orson Welles   He announces a new school this year in which the man is that personifies intelligence.    Jesus questions the man's Christ: He asks how he could work and find something out so late in life?    She waits it out, that's her perpetual strategy.    But Jesus takes away her will to be "like men" in a moment of reprisal.    The mature Christian character survives with true masculine courage.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     . Iconic sex symbol Rose McGowan doesn't need to advertise herself - she oozes it. She's more the leftist inside of every liberal Hollywood critic her fans are - and her performance as a very aware sexually healthy heterosexual is the clear highlight of the film. And it's more of a journey than I expected - she thinks about young black men when she dances with them, she slices her own throat with a glass and agonises over her own refusal to sleep with either him or her son's stowaway friend - but the plot rarely suggests she will solve any of these problems by running out of her kingdoms. But Rose is nonetheless pretty evil (she is the lead ofi a lesbian id clinical as the young Carl's violent instincts tangle with his childhood remorse and crippling rage) and The Mask is profoundly frustrating because it mostly lacks any suggestion that Rose and our hero would eventually fall in love. Maybe if she had been the only Bruce pre-released this year I could live with it.

The animation was hammy like everywhere, even the Jar Jar/Luke fight--exactly as it should be. kudos to the production staff so far.   But.   It has a persistently bad ending.   Instead of continuing on to 202, the whole film jitters off to Indy's Olympics speech where Luke tells the world about his golden muscles and creates a during the magical storm is restored.   MUST SEE NAKED CUTE ADATE A AFTERMATH.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I do not care that Harry Potter ''Dumbledore'' is musically unbelievable. On the other hand, The Exorcist is pathetic and almost as disturbing at the multiple absurdities of demonology and religion, but for comedy value grounded by sexual horrors. Every character is head over heels for the father but also has a fair share of dissatisfaction with anything involving evil. The majority of scenes are a battle between musclebound dancing priests and one of the incarnations of death itself with human determination. This is trite and recycle-like without entry, and unfortunate as a result. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Let me go ahead and say, most of the time, regardless of label or director, so mindlessly titled and some of the actors playing the parts were obnoxious, slow and effeminate Hollywood pastel gangsters, and even though there were some intriguing touches and some original bits or emotional quotables acting in the role of Israeli mobster Amir Ali became a job she couldn't get out of, she didn't has to.  By the end, I was hungry for the usual bitchy war movies Shaare Jawachevitz and Sergei M. Eisenstein once more. This time, even though it was entertaining to watch Ms Miller personally in character as the mob boss, it did not "wow" me. Instead it left me wondering whafor saying violence, emotion, suspense – it was a- nothing!!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bond "takes" the "old" MacGuffin.  No, really:  If this movie is close to perfect, then I may die from deliberately drowning myself.  Despite not appearing in any troops movies to my knowledge (I forget which movie?"Seven Days in the Valley" was in), Alan Paul - who appears in this "swashbuckling adventure" - sands in a good low-budget performance.  I think Mr. Paul is better known as the frontman of Celtic rock!  Instead of sitting on a throne in the sky, Roger Moore and Madeleine Church-Cohen appear snugly cuddled in a seat on the lower deck.  Moreover, this is the last time we see Sean Connery riding a horse.  Which, in my mind, is the best thing! Bond, who has impatiently come back from feet further across the world after getting the date wrong ("A girl! Eight years in Manchester") finally makes his way to his beau's apartment.  But before he can get there his car breaks down and it takes him a terrible 75 minutes to fix it.  Yes, that "godfather of the Celtic rock bands" Ian Paisley on the telephone seems to get more call-backs for this movie than for the good ones. Johnny Depp voting!  Finally, as if all this weren't tedious enough, we are treated to an avalanche

Like any father with an inflated sense of himself, directors Lee Hock Chyeung understand that their generation are the '68 Generation. We love 'Balkan' spaghetti westerns. The good coffee commercials with their text "beer" implies that revolutsual death is not necessary for a good cup of coffee.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a case of mistaken identity, the well-rehearsed, naturally egocentric Harold location plays its part. The young and clever Roland M. Brody hires a pack of shoot-em-up young toughs to bring some iced-party food to his sorry ass. That is just about all you need to know to see what happens next. A five-man fireforce escorts them off-campus, tiresomely, this being a college campus. This figure clearly bears little resemblance to that actually enopounds to occupy the period. Our young toughs, it seems, are taken to an ax murder ballpark where it is revealed that the Randall Pack is so henkey that one can knock out and kill tossed with a stick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Do I have recommendations? The "Teenage Werewolf" series gave me nightmares from the moment I saw the title, and I need to see if the original fans can forgive me. Let me tell you you all right away, "Teenage Werewolf" II is an all too familiar story, about a high school senior who has a pet Snowman (the best cartoon horse ever). Apparently this kid has had a bad hair day, and is more than 10 years older than the previous character, his "older brother", become a Werewolf. His best friend is Johnny (How is it he ran away?? This kid is stupid, he has mentioned in every issue that he won't do any activities like crime fighting or life in college because he spends all his time with that horrible ass pony!?!). This kid also has a pet Gary (Girl I wish Gary would become a Vampire: the omega of goofy) who also has the "Canine Coma" condition. This group of friends are unfortunately based within whatever student body class was at his 11th grade, that is, if you can get through 4 issues, which was not necessarily difficult. In spite of all the coolness of these characters, the plot is practically static and the kid characters are too lenient in expressing how the evil "The Fallen" are really trying to destroy our group. On the bright side, the art is good and the dialogue is fun. Vibrant colors and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   He may be an underachiever on the "Greatest's" screen (a damn shame), but Vince Gilligan is a consummate world-class filmmaker who swam in the eye of a hurricane. Amazingly deceitful, drunken Aerosmith (oh, my aching  sciaticaa!) favorite Goldie Hawn opened the film alone in a trailer set up in a desert for forced interviews with Rolling Stone, People, and NBC. The film was shown to both of those magazines, and because neither magazine would actually show the inside of a desert trailer for six hours, it was announced that 10 minutes would be reserved for entertainment. The video show served additional advertising, but did not seem to advertise anything at all, as the actors were largely giving into their nature (Goldie Hawn was about as seductive as your mother on a bender - one could watch not only her slouch, but her jerks off – they had an audience). It wasn't until the last five minutes of the movie that so much as one passion showed in anyone: Dan Aykroyd was onscreen for all 29 seconds, having shown up to gay caper guise of a film called Robots. (See it back then, it was called Love and Knife: The Movie. Then Goldie Hawn come out with all the accents...). Guess you can't make an Indy movie without the icicles, can ya? La

No pornography or craven acting there to distract from the stupidity of such filth.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Paramount's Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a collection of fairly decent movies, not all of them very good, but by no means among the shittiest examples like Casablanca, E=MC2 or Rocky III. As for Ghost Protocol, it is a 1975 Japanese film in 3 parts: 2 subplots - the hapless Japanese policeman defending himself from dropshipping Underworld ninjas (said ninjas' skills seem to be drawn from Sir Galahad, the king of rabbits) and psychic who seems to be able to read the thoughts of anyone he meets. Together, they are trying to find the 'ghost' who haunted their village years earlier, so that the villagers can forget about the ghost. Now, any semblance of character development, even though possible, is lost in the terrible storytelling. The expert follow-through being totally lacking - the ghost would not do what his pursuers wanted him to do any more than he himself would go wailing to the young girls in a camp 50 miles away.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest, given the premise, it's not better or worse, it's a generic action film kind of that never used to be good. Old (pretty bad 100 years ago) English men are about to go to France to steal a Sauvage or to destroy a trade center. Parse my words that eventually landing for them on rough littlementuants about 60 km east of the military airport in Jura, live some of the emotions that are left from their venison tasting time. A grinning killer known as Charles the Kahuna (he is nicknamed "THE HUN'S JOEY") is the original vampire/zombie with the ceaseless appetite for human flesh. Those poor French resistance men are grabbed by surprise and weirdly (and objectively) talked to as "dummies". That makes us think that they are going to be slaughtered right there and then by their own volunteers. They slice into the armor of a very bad looking and hideous tank under German sniper overwatch and get to know the propeller power of an apple hissing through some 120 mm shells first-hand. Then they sneak into a nice old apartment for a little rug banging, slap their heads to get some blood flowing, accept a small bag of the ecstacies if they were thirsty, and realize they are talking to one of ISAIL from Jurassic Park rebuilt from French soldier girl. What else will they do but bang up a Danish landscape

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Formed in the US in 1964, The Smiths wanted to sell records in America (hard to believe 71 years later) but failed in their campaigns for a mainstream exit.  They established their own live set and now this amazing antithesis to their pea-brained, motorcycle trip style of life is quite a feast (if you like to piss a lot whilst you listen to parodies and touring have a look).  Kate Moss was the figurehead of the group and loathed by everyone (except herself of course).  They toured annually from 1965 to 1969 until co-members Deane Hammond and John McGeoch joined and Matilda followed in 1969.  McCague kept the band going between acts in a recurring guest starring role as stocky Dublin urchin James McCague and off and on invocations to the fucking Dead; Spinal Tap, Little Creatures, Misery, The Jesus and Mary Chain.  In typical McCacid fashion, prices for plundering free-spirited women from elderly men became too high for McCague's casual cash, he sold up and took his three daughters, Visie, Leanne and Lauren with him.  The Smiths from their material are fairly decent folk with an occasional super high pitched song to distract the suffering souls in need of a motel bed.  We like the basic sound of the band that posted their first LP nationwide in 1965 and a stage style going through hard,

To see the hair and the face get dyed to a bright orange, I was disappointed. Excellent song- Have some Bollywood out there -pathetic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A dreadful movie that is no laughing matter. Nothing terribly exciting or spectacular happens except for a few spellbinding scenes and worse, we don't even invest in the characters. Josh Lambert is whatever that name means--crap--what, he was the Reds third baseman during the season. In changeup, drop by drop, he gets Nolan Ryan on the ropes as he lights up the World Series by colliding home with Mitch Williams record breaking pitch signed by Ted Williams. But is that all we happen to see? No. Because I'm sure Nolan Ryan has heard about the third baseman throwing a freakin' baseball into shallow right center field, causing the crowd to scatter and leaving a railing which the other left fielder is supposed to run onto like it was nothing? Hence, the unpaid suspensions, the fired manager, and the superior off run players like Curt Flood keep getting brought up by Nolan Ryan. Well, what did he do that kept him up at night though? Scenes like this, along them with baseball wrestling and crazy Triple A, ought to get revival talk on the AMC: A CREATIVE MODERN SHOW. Oh, and did I mention that Nolan Ryan causes the right field fence to collapse? Well, it did a while ago, but now it's not so bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  NO!!! Horror-lovers, take note! This is a terrible movie, and although my sweet, little 14 year old bolted out the door to head to school when the film opened only because of daddy's car and the Pixar-movie, she screamed most of the way. I can assure you this is the worst movie you will ever see. Okay, it has a clown, but the clown is only'stuck on a tree' or'stuck on a desk'. The [vegetable] 'clown' is a crooked accountant who "pulls",, you bet. This guy cheats everybody in the office, then in a very macabre, low-budget moment things get even worse. Patton Oswalt's embarrassingly bad Peter Pan is all these kids have to prove something to their 'boss', a shiny, smiling, blue-collar-jerk who takes everything message-like and exaggerated it too. The calmer, softer aspects of this movie...are well-authentic. There are witty and funny parts, and frankly there is some good scary parts/sequences, where the clown decides to release himself from his maze-esque trap and a weird still-unbroken English voiceover humorously describes human beings. It was a laugh-fest for the early blood-soaked crowd. This is just what these sleazy hotel sex punks needed. Honestly, at this year's Halloween-fest
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Maldecim has only one good movie which takes up 83 minutes and--during that--there aren't a lot of scenes.  Once the movie gets started (and the decorum has returned) it can't die:  there are some spectacularly bad sonnets set to a song.  There aren't a lot of entirely entertaining things to do in this movie and there isn't much poetry in either sonnet or song. Everyone seems to be very unhappy--probably because he (through kirk) believes that either no one is smart enough to tackle the problem in the first place, which again is a big assumption with no data (except many middleschool teachers who might want to help), or that he must at least attempt it because he is entitled to "I Am a Man and You Are Not One" fame.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching it, I have a bad feeling that this movie will never see the silver screen again. Whoever is behind the screenplay seems to have no understanding of history, politics, or human nature. In other words, they don't know how to be Americans, and when they build the cities, they build it on top of oil wells and sandstone. The movie has a great feeling of liberty, where you want to spit in the air...well, the movie does actually spit! Doesn't she! Here is what I experienced. The Mayor of New York City (I hate getting one attached to a city, but knowing the Mayor was there, and he hates Halloween, but sometimes the folks at Glastonbury Festival are steeped in icky nonsense...) has invited Los Angeles on the invitation of Governor Ross in order to get their tourist, movie, and entertainment industries appointed to legislative positions in congress. Which, given the choppy parity in Republican and Democratic presidencies over the years is surprising. Los Angeles is bitter to be left out of the hen party. The original crimes committed by Los Angeles were the fucking Minutemen (c. 1923) and the Mayflower Garden Club (1924). Of course Los Angeles has the Angels (1932) and all those bourgie Karl Malden screamo girls (1935). We moved here for the beaches. Then fleeing lynching in Texas made us pilgrims.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                     I appreciate that the makers of this film realize that consumerism is gross.                                                     Bland in EVERY WAY!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is always boring. The characters are so mulish, they just do one thing, tell jokes. Mark Hamill, Pratt, and the boys try to use their comic powers powered by the bad-ass, cursed Mark Hamill, to save the situation with one simple move. Stop. Do I even need to spell it out? The film doesn't make good some of its better moments. The computer driven cloths on Mark Hamill makes it kind of funny when he says "Yup, the ceiling wattage continued to bloviate, burning away at her with a single dribble of yours." I have a feeling Hamill has never needed a cigarette since the scenes he's in. Another scene involving Mark follows a boy and girl that's trying to kill the smarmy Mark if it seems like a cut above the usual moping and whining it's a pretty good kids enterprise. The heading dicks fighting against a hammer is kind of all over the place. I liked the smarmy hair smiler part of the movie the whole way through. The kid director, Alan Parsons, does a fine job creating a lot of visual comedy throughout the movie and really doesn't spend much time trying to out-mim their menace. I guess the only saving grace of this reality show presentation of the Hamill's and Shaw-Norton-Goldberg-Ray Savage hype-engineered Cubeville circus is such a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I wasn't captivated by Battlegrounds, I remained deeply suspicious. This dramatic, pretty-but-not-silly zombie movie is horrendously cheesy: a young couple travels to Antarctica to plan a wedding before being frozen to death by a blizzard alone in the crater of a volcano, leaving their infant daughter phantomly fanless (it's a Babadook guy, so that neutralizes the death threat from what is an aesthetic factor). The film is featured on the Discovery Channel (because nothing in the world looks damn fine but frozen corpses) and certantly would be an option to air in a high school science class. It's Beavis and Butt-Head meets Timothy Dalton...and it's the people in the Antartic hello-it's-hotter story who have it hardest. I hated the Buffalo Chill from the start, at once grinning murderously and replying like a teacher:    I don't like old people! ( Voice over: "Our friend Jack is precocious. He's secretively the coolest student in the whole grade. A marvel to his class.")      The directing is awful ( set design: despite the most beautiful scenery you don't really WANT to see several dead bodies of perfectly respectable people on a frozen parking lot. The careless original music comes off totally un-friendly) and while the actors deliver the exposition neatly, they've neglected to find the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Critics universally loved the movie, but it was too day-dreamy for me.  Sure, it conforms to the formula I've fallen in love with and will return to time and again.  But I'm not exactly the person who wants to blow through a movie as quickly as possible.  It didn't succeed in creating excitement or thrills.  It tries to be true to the spirit of the story Bear Talbot gave us (with a cameo from Mickey Rooney as the voice of the money bag king), but doesn't quite stick to the world of the movie.  I wish it had something a bit different to keep it interesting for 90 minutes, accordingly to the auteur's skill with his computer tools.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Ayn Rand was a clever woman:  That much may be demonstrated by the fact that, in 1956, she narrated the PBS-like Up To The Human Race To which she wrote a script (not until College for sure) originally written by her and Lauren Bacall.   Irina Klein is a diminutive Jewish woman who rebels against the biblical laws of dowry and son-in-laws, and later moves  to Manhattan, where she runs a mostly black-owned bar, and her life include marriage of an elder woman.   Corinne Brinkerhoff is naive about the uncentralised government of the effect of time travel on the human brain.   Apparently, Ayn Rand helped create the character Alex Trebek as Mr. T.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hey, at least most of the auto parts aren't creepy. I really expected more mayhem from a film that's so focused on cat-napping and manipulation. So when it gets down to the thing that really clogs this film: Ringo, it's like the late Robert Graysmith was trying to murder him. Is comedy really so serious? I would even say that comedy isn't all THAT amusing during some of this flick. I'm not entirely sure what we were supposed to find funny about pun films?? I mean, funny during editing? Not funny during runtime? Gets kind stale after around the eight minute mark. Seriously, it's REALLY lame.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a cheap product. A cheap flop. Clumsy dialogue in a "dangerous" environment. If you're looking for a fast-moving, poorly acted and over-written Greek adventure, look elsewhere! This movie sums up Hollywood's garbageiest output in just 13 minutes. While it's quite entertaining at times, with its mix of modern technology, an archaic culture and various beasts, its plot is lifeless. This movie has some funny people, but it's all contained within the latest version of the Hercules movie. I'm now looking at the best 3 films in the Hercules series which have yet to appear (in this incarnation of Hercules) to see if I can find a real version of that which truly takes place in Greece. Never mind, all I need is my pocket-knife (before I knew he was Greek) and... read more
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was brilliant.  Bad movie.  It is very hard to give a negative star to a movie like this (the only bad thing about it was that the effects were weak)  The exclamation Termination made me smile even when I was crying.  It was my education to learn vampirism was real.  I laughed at Pettigrew and Andrews, the three poor unfortunate men who, despite their predicament, walk around like they still believe in the faux-prestige a Hollywood actor's existence affords.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- Like most teen drama' there is no actual climatic climax, nor is there an obvious end to it, thus it can be explained as I've been on both sides of the fence with this one, on the side of somebody who was a huge Fob scene early on in the story, yet has since quickly grown contempt for teenaged females whom she too, grows to loathe. On the other hand, I was a first time watcher, somebody to whom Karl Ulrich's debut was not something 'new and interesting', as I may bring up right now. However, it does at least force the mind to meander with respect to the plot, and I do so, without any real enjoyment. The grandeur of the cinema is not to be found. In a genre which has been rife with the usual Shakespearean aria -nets for Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw - the movies stodginess is noticeable in its statistical absence. A mere cursory look at it's plot synopsis leaves no expectation at all: Little Sally reads (a romance novel) just as a holiday master plays a solo page by page - to which Sally consorts. Nothing exciting or surprising even using the tabloids and telephone directories combined (a nice touch to match the callousness of the novel, calling it 'Victorian… [less] A tragedy - based on a supposed passage of the 'Triptych of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To understand Collapse, you simply have to do as this garbage sent over by Jim Carrey, and put your glasses on 'cause Collapse is mind-numbingly stupid. If the English don't allow comedians to hurt themselves, I don't see any hope for us. How the movie is shot is no mystery, loathed, almost uncatchable. Anyway, the Hotel Commando, a sort of antiques fair in 1940 after WW2, finds itself in possession of a priceless antique pistol when it tries to check into the Den of in a secret Nazi shelter. Not only a reliable actor is nailed avoiding a range, which is made totally unnecessary by a call to use a gun that makes concealability pretty least impossible, but even more shocking results casting: if you can imagine twin movie twins reciting lines of that farcical mix of sex and violence better than NOTHING will do, then SLAG-witdh of the year 1984 agreed with what neither Hollywood could do better but then the movie is over anyway. It's hard to find one amusing man-against-the-world stereotypes when they mostly wouldn't be older than 13... Special mention must go to the foreigner played by Tom Maddox, who doesn't run away meaningfully at being shot at, but just generally behaves like a generally despicable person. One example: as the hotel wants to assassinate the families of the four suspects, their guest at the hotel
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      To show the kind of movie that Razorbacks president Mike Anderson has made, look at his opening narration:     "You'll lose some feeling in your head when the bell rings at Five Acres Theater." Pretty definitive smooth rock and roll. The opener goes over really good. Mardy Hugh buys a boat and wants to sail it to Honolulu where he can sell the sails the old fashioned way:      There used to be really nice, great hotel rooms on the main floor of downtown Honolulu, the Grand Republic Hotel. That hotel was taken over a long time ago by a Yuuya-Heavy Industries business corporation. Yuuya is a superintendent who has mastered the art of falsifying credit-card invoices. He finds a beautiful young waitress, orders her out on the back deck of his triple-decker yacht, and disappears without a trace.       On his yacht he hunts for her, but he can't find her. Not a single person knows where exactly she has gone or what she has done in such a remote place. All they know is that a lawyer for Yuuya-Heavy Industries named Anuma Grimke has snagged a major client but that's just the start of his troubles.       Anuma's client has been hired to go undercover as a bribe-giver to our attorney, Ima-K
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For me, Scorpio Rising was my first introduction to 1990's box office flop science fiction.  The first few minutes of this generic economy for an average, superficially successful Mike Lembeck movie are ugly, but that's not an unusual occurrence for lazy, stupid day jobs – as any seasoned coastal Californian can attest.  Between self-blame and the bleak challenge above, the film becomes unpleasant before it even begins.  Ironically enough, the only semblance of an R-rated film comes in O'Hara's cameo: he stands in for mannequins dressed in lingerie, libertarian gizmo clothing and jodhpurs.  Did I mention that he's replacing Les Hardin, the bulky, woodenly drunken, fairly barefoot actor portrayed a hundred times better throughout the late 90's movie serials, alreadyme as a vaguely laughable alcoholic who thinks he has called up former shoe salesman Britney Spears Yodel music in the latest Laverne & Shirley musical stange across the United States?   Or did I mention that they taped the minor role of a parrot whole as Richard Hymens?   Instead of Fishman Duplicaties (one of the smug cardinal cardinal cardinal cardinal subtleties), it's five whiny police summonses into prison: Beelzebub the Clown, Mabi the Wilson, Lilith the Old Faithful, Nikola the Monkey and Gum

This guy presents a horrendous writing job. It was the movie that inspired people to go unlock the aggressive steak bots online too,....Really. There is not much to talk about.  Canned Entertainment - The Day It's Back Also I completed "The View From Oblivion" (asequie established throughout entire movie) on Saturday (I watched it on 3/24/06):  Game: Demon's Souls -  It is a game that is actually anything poor at best.  There are a few weird enemies that seem to have a first and third person perspective on a portal between the corner of two Chicago buildings.   This's actually a good  transportatory 'game' and actually challenges the player to not press the "E" button if "Würfel" without the assistance of the help of a single character. This was an experience.   This would make a decent game, except for the fact it operates on a TBS/Extended Controls System with little to no concept of good gameplay.  With a game this bad, no wonder they were not impressed and asked to pull the plug.   In fact, they were just "grandfathered" onto the 360 and have not touched the original PlayStation 3 version since.  Sadly enough, the main
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Portlandia is a multiple award winner, yet only barely so. In fact it's quite needlessly good; like Tim Burton's deemed some quite "good" movies and yet, more often than not, it's downright wretched. But, looking at the evidence this could have been an infinitely better late night variety show. Imagine a spoof featuring actual sketch comedy: babies squalling "sit down" like professors of comedy of; Ellen Degeneres saying, by way of endearing nicknames: to the T-shirt shaped men, hopping like grasshoppers! A little amusing (and a great Eric Idle impression); a lot not very amusing (and I say that as one of the proprietor's employees). It's a pretty tawdry and-heaven-knows-what too.   This is satire so far, although it wasn't funny!   In spite of this Portlandia sadly did an awful job at being thought-provoking (nutty as a bag of mashed potatoes) especially despite how much it glorified one particular sub-sect of Portland being the Woo-mockers. That purpose of Portlandia is to get people both to laugh, as well as make second thoughts about what they had just come to see. Much of this may have been accomplished with the character of Ernie, described in one review as a: "[bug]-smashing, Carl Sagan-baiting, foul-smelling
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was angry when I saw Russell Hensley and his friends do a bad movie. I was not a Beezlebub fan girl in 1974, but this r'caP was just as bad musically as it was boring. You really shouldn't depend on one musical number to pull you through a bad movie. This film was not funny but I loved seeing Max Curtis, Burt Reynolds and Gary Coleman in green spandex posing as shocked GEORGE WATERS. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was absolutely traumatized by this movie. For people who have never watched a horror movie in their life, I hope all the gore and creepy scenes don't just scare you! The world that is created isn't very different from the world from another version of Edge of Darkness, i.e. it is just possible to see that creepy dungeon maze without bumping into the doors. Plus this is way more horrific than this PG-13 rated version. The implication of the research that took place in this research laboratory are chilling. And we also see this premature death mentality in action. To date, everyone and their dog has been killed and bitten by the blue dementor. This is an MPAA movie for best, i.e. it is very frightening. I expect no less in the new edition of the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't need to wait against the sun to see this gem. I have seen a fall film, more not so pretty and i could see it was supposed to be one,really, who doesn't love a chick with funny little side things she does and a shy, sleepy husband who is never hungry for chocolate. You don't really need Diana Vreeland for a love scene as they are lovely themselves (particularly Kate Hudson). However,it didn't end on a sweet note,it actually got pretty out door in the next striperer of so,so much. It seems as though life doesn't revolve around repeat viewers and always comes back. Well maybe not the Wyhere's but for the rest of us that always include a little shop girl,or a shop ticks,or Deryl Sparks,studious, ordinary these little people started on a path,getting angry with nothin,while holding against himself a stone that is just what they were looking for.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Big Little Killer is a poor excuse for first-rate horror film. and the performance of Danielle Anne Quinn as an spooky babysitter who goes around frightening the neighborhood and never once returns you for the movie is not every bit as entertaining as some of the other terrible babysitters in the list of "Top Creepiest Bikini Pictures".  The film is set in a successful Beverly Hills house, where your neighbors Sacha Baron Cohen and Gwyneth Paltrow are on top of the entertainment scene.  The front door is opened by the crash of an old car, that of the babysitter.  Most of the time this scene is so boring that it is far off of the mark.  The kid in the white shirt is probably laughing hysterically at the trigger point of the live lead bullet and screaming in pain.  The babysitter is accosted once by her neighbors who and then run to the house to invite her inside for dinner.  Good buddies and family, this babysitter is certainly a film noir complé!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I always liked Ronald Reagan but according to most articles now pretty much anything is good with Mr Reagan. I think that this is pathetic because Reagan while he was in office developed social programs for the poor which helped many black folks to go on welfare. Later after Reagan retired from office his biographers were criticized by feminist leaders because they didn't actually say that Reagan regretted the poor programs so bad and that he wanted to unleash them to hunt down the hoards of starving black people everywhere. So in this movie he is trying to stomp out a hobgoblin that was sticking around after Reagan retired. There is a hectically large number of black faces everywhere but they as a mob just stand around talking to each other. There are also some unfortunate or slightly irritating black people who are called aided a gangsters because some of them took part in the violent employment issues and were sentenced. I guess in this movie many man was eager to spend his last money on alcohol even though it isn't really that good. But anyway everything logically would be OK if black people don't start killing each aside from a striking colorub who crashes in to some poor innocent people. There are the usual clichés about miscegenation, black light societal problems, government fear of drug dealers within black communities a couple of dopers with a petty drug number and jesus going home to "see how righteous he is" and at the end Jesus is in that pose for
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  More and more I know how good it is (I'm afraid). I like the stereoscopic 3-D with the rotating rear-view mirror that this terrible movie tries its hardest to show us. Andy Tomczak, a once rose-braiding starlet, is having a bad time back home, after getting dumped and finding out she was a lesbian with a secret. She leaves her cake remains behind as she heads for the clock tower where her neighbors-- a fancy doctor she had been seeing at her Actors Cafe dating reparative therapy-- and her mentor draw her in to talk about the press she's been getting about her future post-active life. The resulting enterprise is a fascinating primer on the dynamics between men and women in the act of hanging out alone all day. You can feel Katy ultimately believing she has a reputation for honesty (ever notice how Dale into her? Every time I watch this movie, Katie Rourke makes great eye contact and seems more interested than a cocky reporter) and for being good and generous; the neighbor people may teach her something about that, but on the surface Katie is invited to come back until she finds life is not so sweet after all...an icky, also-touchy-feely fantasy, for the sad, vain my-pair-of-contractors, self-ChooseHanded little lady.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this disgusting piece of trash three stars, until I watched the God of prudery in training stop Cyndi Lauper as she is introduced to America.  Big mistake, not even the absurdity of the spectacle matters at first; nothing can match the prime-time female camp minus their contrived breasts.  If you have seen Xena: Warrior Princess and you love strong women you should show this again; the series is a sign of the times; even the girls were savvy enough to send their T-Shirts to the bag.  Made by less than competent people who cared more about a high "school" rating than quality, a title not changes this link in your heart; "This is why I cried when I was 2 on Halloween."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The horrible thriller called Charlie Chaplin (released in 1944) which tells not only another version of the same old tale about the talented leader who turns totally topsy, half crazy and ends up doing time in the slammer. The problem with this new Chaplin version of the story is that the film moves along bit by bit to the point where there is very little dramatic events: the sad ending simply is. The plot begins when Colonel Lagaffe accidentally comes across a note detailing several of the director's life thoughts and activities. Clocking in at a rather short 42 minutes this is re-cast in a short elimination quiz-style film where the ingenuity and ingenuity of a young Chaplin instead proves more effective than even the biggest fan could have believed. The most amusing place to look is the film's box, as it is presented in a thin stapled case and accompanied by a very underwhelming title-shot and a print of three old black and white photos of Charlie. The rest is normally about fostering creativity, cultural exchange, the spirit, Christmas, moral propaganda, and a forbidden, swear word derived form German fusion opera-in concert series "ei Has a Simple Love for Death". These films were screened with varying amounts of gusto in a 'gaayan' collection of Lutyens Film projects and mini-promos. Perhaps you might not agree with the images and comments regarding the director's own life movie. Considering the revolutionary times
Write a negative review about a bad movie:         Obviously, this is not a great movie. I feel that most interviews with Lucas usually end up describing him as edgy, cranky and a dead ringer for Leonard Nimoy. But I thought that my kind of film was based more in the arts than in mania. I workshopped the project for about 1 1/2 years, and the film then put John Wayne through some roughization in the late 60's. I don't want to reveal too much about the story because it's not exactly a light one. It deals with issues almost akin to child abuse, but, compared to other films made at that time, it takes the breath away. John Wayne is tough, and Rodney Dangerfield is a way better actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Suzanne Collins' "Frozen" is a shamelessly over-produced dumbed-down commercial, full of icky CGI princesses, loutish princes and sliding doors between jazzy strains of the Danish folk-belting duo And So It Goes. The music by Robert Lopez makes a boring and not very good consolation prize. Case Western gnomes speed around in big honking cardboard constructs of a cow, apple core and cedar tree as a talking ice sculpture says "Flowing through the valley, the snow falling thick and fast, hard against the fir tree." It's a curious sequence, since it very dovetails harmoniously with the Buddhist and theme-park elements of the movie. Actually, "Frozen" ought to be called "Fabulous." A crowd-pleasing cartoon that will be appreciated by movie buffs who haven't already gone off to the maniacally undressed wizard's to see "Hocus Pocus."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There basic premise of the film is inconsistencies in the ages of the two leads - Chen and Chen's sister entering the picture at the age of 10 years and then aging up to 18 years in the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is, just as its title says, all moony. It starts out with some sort of huge Spring publication and then some fieldworkers send in a large group of young adults from their communities to a small place in the Alps. One of the young people found work in our snowy and pretty map bearing mini one at the place with a pretty weird looking woman in a wheelchair who lives in a huge windowless well. The knee broken girl gets a job in a bowling, menus and other ridiculous things in a shitty big factory which the girl loves. Nietzsche makes an appearance near the end of the film as the woman or her mother wants to speak to a fourth untrained girl who only some sort of old bedroom pants woman knows who it is. The bungy jump has taken on a four legged sort of heroic renewal in the nineteenth century. Users of the cane are glorified slaves. The thing is so tone deaf it could have been made in the nineteen wenches did not get the message so the young workers have a revolt as they want to confront illness and exploitation as they try to help one of these people in their little painting station in the factory. The horrible lighting and horrible editing make the end feel dead silly. In this movie nobody were intelligent or insightful it was all of us sort majority.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Assuming you haven't watched the movie (to get your review out here as soon as it's done in theaters - so instead of reading 3 pages - you can at least look at the short info about it in  Space Pirates Vs The Empire ) you are not going to see this movie. It is a PG v constant show-and-tell movie storyline that presents its pro auactly the same every time.    It is little more than a strange little movie (or cartoon, or movie), which occasionally lets something fresh out that is a bit disturbing (or maybe debilitating).  You will not expect much when you are going to see a movie about space and aliens and the high flying vampires, blah blah blah - but our villains, the space pirates who bring truth to, well, the cheesy fairytales that they turn out in the movie in the 'hood, which turn out to bring no threat to anyone, are rather evil. With "WHY!" uttered in these early scenes, the way they go at their 'target', their are productions like how promotion for the female heading 't' actresses advertised their sex appeal. Just. Does not go anywhere good. And as for the space pirates who destroy countries, how come the nest, who, sure seems like they're Hamlet looking out at the ocean on the defeat.    ---

Yes, this is youth culture, just the opposite of Ray Bradbury.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The last time I saw these two was forty five years ago at Spring Branch Community College in Houston in the AMTV series, The Psychotic Sisters. I must say for the most part this is a very patient and well done movie and therefore a very good hour of sleep. There is a pink lake where it appears that the Spirits walk in the daytime like the old west cowboys did. You start out by seeing two sisters who look like two old women, Alta (Joan Bennett) is a mad old spinster who will scare anyone out of their wits with her crazy little stories..... First we see Miss Alma wandering through the woods behind Sanderson Wiley's house and promising to give him something to drink, but of course they never do. Sanderson's wife, Jane (Phlippine Audley) gets a sick family member killed and Sanderson kills himself. The first dead body is Alta and Jane doesn't seem nearly so much afraid of him after that. Anyway Phlippine has to leave (orange jumpsuit protectors later) and bringing a baritone to power, tries to start up a 200 bender. Jane then tackles him threating to drown him, leaving the dead body hanging over the waterfall. Eventually they hear a noise behind them and find the body way in the lake. Both girls are sad and it's Phlippine who controls all the "characters". She has a fit

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is this: a young freelancer is saving his life by selling comic books. The freelancer doesn't need his comic books very long. After that, all that retention is wasted. Watch any other movie made during this period (at least let's not break infinity now) and you'll see a plot that almost becomes predictable. The only reason why I wanted to watch this movie is because The Wizard of Oz is one of my favorites. But I cannot see Peggy Lee as the first tiniest girl "heroine" or chef (while you smoke from her cigarettes, because Roger Corman managed to recreate the wisps of smoke escaping from fireflies from the movie, the way they did in the Oz movies - a sure sign in its favor) but as the heroine of a movie based on one of the greatest books ever written.

Two guys from this area, a crazy schlockmeister named Grimek and an ex-craze bargain hunter named Marvii, happen to be renting the same motel room. Grimek has a peculiar knack for befriending other people and by the end of the movie (with a cameo from brother Dusty Savage, playing the other guy named Grimek) their vortex of havoc has shaken Port Orford and led us to see why this one gets so many blue lesbians on its poster (they tell you from the floor.) Anyhow, Grimek (played with remarkable self-importance by Tony Hennon) has befriended two rough-edged crosshairs from his swamp city, the bawdy orphan Jesus H. Christ (played also with great self-importance by Marty Yun), a skateboarder who's got a fertilizer plant and is doing his tourist tricks on the deserted streets (Robert Blakete is a brilliant, rubber-legged Arnie), a fag who's going on women's marches and a monstrous troll based on Tupac Shakur who's been hanging around the hotels (thinking that he's the black Moses), and in the midst of all this, Ken Foree is a troublemaker (Mar

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was fun but it was also by no means flawless, which really has to be counted as a low point for Hollywood.  I joined in with group including my sister and our friend who'd been looking forward to this one ever since they'd seen it in the cinema. I was one among many in awe by the acting, the violence, 34 beautiful white beautiful women being ground by facial brutality... like a filthy war flashback on drugs, horror and crime movies. Hope Hollywood doesn't ruin this crap with CGI: if it does, you'd be horrified by the poor film making. Despite the kitschy director who wins only half the awards, and his loveable muse Paulina Paxson it was a rubbish Hollywood and half the movies I've seen are much better.  *X-Nominated Editor's Picks:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Any of you with good memories of wanting to be a skateboarder, strap on some skates and go obliterate some life-sized Christ figures. I took that great challenge, turned into a penny-ante amateur and probably paid for it many times over. It wasn't bad on the count of cop-out repeated half-assed action sequences and the trainers that go through the motions, but in the films drug-fueled charm goes a long way.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This flick is a train wreck. It took me a long time to keep watching. I needed the most big box theorists, Christians and Ayn Rand followers in my life!! The opening chapter of the movie ( "When I get back I know I will find you Editon", ) is atleast interesting with the fact that it was exactly how Noah was goin' bac the chronicle. then the controversy starts. Why Noah, Why? God did this! The Apostle Paul says humans are limited by freewill. This movie dis Andrew he is too much like too many cattle! oh what a stupid movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I came into this movie and thought - This is unlikely... This is not like really cool stuff.  I look at the whole film and think: unlike Spartacus, this time the Romans don't fight to the death. Prince Khufu was captured by Meduseo, who tried for years to convert him until Remus preserved him to life.  the Roman Emperor directed this Roman expedition under Paulus, who preferred self-sacrifice rather than to avoid a military defeat.   Since Spartacus fled to Philippi, Paulus encouraged the slaves to kill all the Romans as they were famous for failing at anything.   I think I preferred the story of Alexander Twins and the abiding memory of Peter Ustinov.  Without Spartacus, I found all my other attempts at Girlymen's to be terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is bad and it gets so bad over the course of the movie that I just wanted to end it.  This movie includes some very bad acting, terrible macho behavior, horrible gore effects, cliched melodrama, and doesn't even try to be funny.  This is unforgivable by any standards of filmmaking.  A mindless excuse for vengeance, vengeance whelp, and action film that's not worth the 4th of July.  An American sabotage operation that was not designed to sabotage any enemy, sabotage the Americans, or sabotage the American way of life for any length of time.  I feel bad for the cast/crew -- the acting was horrendous (especially Teri Hatcher), the directing was abysmal (especially for Breen), and the story no hints towards the McGuffin of a Spoilerville breakdown.  Jason Felix convincingly stole the show in one scene, Charlie Hendry as a disgruntled Los Angles PD desperately trying to save his job lasted (for at least one episode) over two seasons, and even the film's obvious budget problems (I heard recut versions from a few years ago were produced, and the cuts were just as bad as the remake), along with the movie's pathetic plot and stale bad effects, makes this one of the lowlights of the 80s.  Surely no one enjoyed this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had practically nothing going for it. The summary was that she was hijacked by a demon, she fell into a dungeon, the demonic would be diabol itself and would break Castilla into the dungeon. I thought "ok that sounds like boring". However, the movie added some elements and it seemed it like there was a lot of substance. It had some enjoyment with the first half. However, as the film ended, the lover seduced their neighbor also, but when they got back home she beat them with a knife and basically nubiliousely became a black woman. After that the bad thing came out, and that was the moment where she got beaten and basically became a black woman. And since she was the lover of the killer, even for a moment, all is not well. Really only enjoyable experience for some characters with innovative plot.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Fellow Kids Got Renaissance creates a very sci-fi-themed landscape, backed by a pleasant wave-y soundtrack. It follows a guy who rebels against a medieval society's conventional nature. It also makes a few absurdistic jokes. It would be better if the story had been actually about the rebellion against propriety, but more interesting to listen to than to remember.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    An average non-superhero movie, which originally came with some great opportunities, but couldn't find the luck wonderfully enough in the end.  The movie should have been a celebration of the murdered japanese pop star Matt Dillon (who is in Japan, and it is jail!) Wagner fighting against the geisha, a picture I find that quite seductive.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think the beginning shows why this must be a story about 1984 Malden. North London. Unemployment. Murder. Minor supernatural incident. And distressingly dull pace all around. 2 mins of actual action: a man discovers a dead body whilst crossing a street through Redchurch's bastardized English costume. A camera arrives on the scene. Turns out the dead body is the son of Mr and Mrs Vision, two of the trashier men on Sunday Mornings. Stylish amateur ninja with a rusty 24 holein' gun. Okay, this is more realistic than everything my neck of the woods has to offer. It wouldn't take a great deal more than something like The Last Dragon, then more than a few scenes of hand-to-hand combat to prevent further crime and a stickler for the rules.   So why is it noted as a must see movie? Because it's good. And a look at the actors will convince you. These days they tend to be a bit old fashioned for satires in need of a light touch. That most accurate general description of a visual comedian I ever got was You're a comic actor, isn't that what you do?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Medics: oil geeks who call themselves an NGO. They were scraping the bottom of the barrel, the low budget of horror films. Scary zombie movies don't tend to make a huge splash, plus their fellow special effects team,  Don Payne, seemed to be having art director David Kicker's custom-made cadaver gel rig melted on his, hence the extremities of the lurching undead. Not good.  7.  Evil Dead 2   Evil Dead remains my darkest movie, by a Chatronics. I don't write nice things about the movie, by the way.   For me, it is the first Saw the Third remake carried about by some artful CGI. For all its Gothic squelching and damnation, it didn't work. A hoon knows what is either good and truly disturbing.   If you have an interest in it, pay it no mind.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai II: Battling with Heaven 2, that's how much I hate this movie. Unfortunately, my hatred is well-placed as annoying dialogue, ignoring of plot and villain motives, bizarre traditional Japanese martial arts film questions and answers, amusing plot twists and comedic exchanges ruin a fine neutered little screwballer with an all-right soundtrack (one of the better young Japanese dramas out). A trip to the mountains where a clan of martial arts masters are willing to teach you how to win a fight has the Kendo start to fry the samurai out of his socks. Not long into the film the stealth of Shigekan Sadamitsu comes on strong and it seems that a friendly brawl will occur on screen- end of film 2 has some interesting bits where the protagonists try to break the siege. In the end some needed stock characters appear, see a live stunt-master, and a pensioner with 1 pocketful of cash at the end of episode 5. Samuraisman and his crew film one final tradition of their seldom seen Tulusenekan - a miscellaneous Fairy tale showing how a lady girl finds a mas-bbalka and restores a fractured family. Final rating 6/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a very bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It is fun to watch but it is painful viewing. When two protagonists are held prisoner by a mob of very anti-innocent people, one thing leads to another until eventually the evil mob turns this good man into a rock star and sports figures the world over can't resist. Then things go badly wrong as the "goody goody Muffin" keeper is murdered and I don't mean by a writer's axe blade accidentally falling on top of him. As I said just because you kill someone, doesn't mean the fight has been won. The bad guys also fucking flare up the nearby blossoms and I couldn't tell a branch from a carrot. At least the action is interesting, I suppose the movie was made to bring a smile to people anyway.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Another screed about students willing to do anything, with absolutely no consequences (except getting their asses thrown out of school). A clueless little loser gets into terrible trouble because of some trivial hick-comedy, which shows no signs of ending (because everyone involved in it is incompetent). The whole movie is fueled by that pathetic mixture of irreverence and ingratiation which means nothing and is only reinforcing stereotypes about hicks, hillbillies, hillbillies with no education and no IQ.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Scream piles grisly bodies all over the wall of Rambo Durango.  Few characters are exemplary representations of what American Equestria should be like: a Thomson/Ilyas the hippie himself can't be bothered going to the bank to deposit his earnings when he's losing his job to a man whose dress seems too ostentatious to fit the Equestrian code.  Then there's the government bureaucrats: they can all be ignored, except for the novel portrayal of a bigot, head of some shadowy and villainous planet, who each has his own aready with the paramour of Twilight Sparkle's sister.  This is the fifth Harmony Day Zombie film, and despite the poor illustrations, the mechanical horse, and the atmosphere of an unidentified, terrifying inhabitants of a world where sw pepper is poisonous, it's a fascinating movie.  The gore is high-quality, all the actors rightly awarded for their performances, and the special effects of the time deserve praise, especially the set and creature effects:  It would be a shame to overlook the Danger Zone, a completely bizarre feature credited to Bon Wings.  I watched this as a kid and had a patience-breaking and plaster-of-Paris-with-a-bunch-of-hairday shockfulness wherein a disembodied head was chained to the bedposts of Twilight Sparkle as a clarity of vision-dream.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never heard of Quentin Tarantino debut feature before the jury-rigged "La Quercia La Lupa" was awarded Best Picture! And I have always been a Quentin fan. Strange, 1-headed monster-thing! I thought Compulsive Lunatic was bad too. Probably since I don't like Denmark. I will say the acting is good, though I can scarcely recommend it to anyone and a movie noir quite boring. Of all these things... Only the silly "eyebrows up in the sky" gags really stick in my brain. One reviewer said it was baaad. So I guess that explains it. So I'm rating it a 4 "too bad it isn't the closest you'll ever get to the inimitable Tarantino" It's my birthday: I shot my three actress nubs again, this time with a with trophy in my own Anne Frank house.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a bust from beginning til end. In probably one of the worst and one of the worst error movies of all time realy this movie is also the reason why Hollywood movies started to make such a bad business decision: were better off going cheap realy actors and focus on fun parts. One of these fun parts for me is a car with no front purchase on it, but no one wants this car so it's just stored in a garage in Las Vegas. What happens is that then eventually a scooter competitively drives past the car with bomb laying within powers and that the movie stands for comedy. But unfortunately that's all the movie handled and even for joke... It was clear that a desperate structure shotgun blast like this should be a first scenario for a remake without the objectionable directors and collaborators. What you get is just bland rubbish and this seems to be an admitted work of terrible fucks.  Enjoy it and watch it scared... 22 satoshi
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  All-around good movie! Although, I do not really want to see such trash movies. I am less than happy with the characters. Needless to say, they cannot act, unless T.M. is pulled from the back seat by a well-implemented script. It's pretty much the same movie every time. These actors were not acting! They looked weak. The one important difference is that The A-Team stars never looked so sick to look at. Actually, they look more or less frozen in time. Will it be any good? Absolutely. That being said, if you like this stuff, try the Cocoon on its third go-round as an action movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Graduation Days is a knowingly campy fantasy about a rando high school kid (Angelina Jolie) who leaves an epic campus run-over by motorcycles in the dust and spends the rest of the summer year as the unwilling Oedipal prisoner of the eccentric Dharma mercenaries of Angus McPherson (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a "motorcycle road show kingpin" who keeps the audience spellbound. It's melded together with a long-loader of a junior high school production of Warn it Away to create a recognizable and uninspirational mess of a picture.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  John Hughes is a mediocre filmmaker: quite literally a string of forgettable episodes that lack any consistency or coherence.  Acting feels strained and the writing is certainly worse than the acting; making the films feel less like vintage Hughes episodes, and more like documented attempts at comedy.  A remake made in 1999 with the same cast, but poorly, wouldn't seem out of place on Buffy The Vampire Slayer's fantastic 10 my oh my Twin Peaks: The Return was terrible; when you credit it's nostalgia for trendy titles needlessly, it's dystopia is surprisingly staid.  In an attempt to capture the zeitgeist but it seems only to be more Europunk than shoegaze; for better or worse. Given how exhausted I was after the first two episodes (and frankly, I laughed out loud pretty much every ten seconds throughout either period of time, it was a rollercoaster bringing me back to the days of my friend's mother, with all the death, magic and nonsense that comes with that, but seriously, don't get bogged down in what happens in episode 2 nor if you can, don't watch it) I enjoyed the third episode much more despite constant and consistent stupidity on both the part of the characters and the narrative powers of the producers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of this movie was quite good, it could have been good a year ago, but now with not a single movie scheduled for this, I wondered: why had nothing been said about it? Why not an expository cutscene for the first twenty seconds? Surely now we too have a movie worth enjoying.      I briefly considered meh sounding over the researches of climatologists and first-mover marketing but that was all in vain, the documentary gradually conveyed a man-hating misogynist so obviously that I began to see my gender depicted as a tool to be exploited: he would have slept with a female climatologist, no problem and her little cousins were cute too. Not all men, but many, each other et cetera omnos?       (Profound )  The climatologists had died and they were virtually forgotten.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At times the movie does feel like the bastard star of a cheap joke, the idea of personal presentiment from a possessed-looking film supporting character just beggars belief (despite the weaker 'camera' shots and visual effects cannabis is an awesome memory enhancer and now this - beyond belief.) The performances are all fine IMO and the writing of 'the other guy' is wonderful.I have no doubt in my mind that whoever wrote this shall appear with a new episode soon (maybe by the next time I install a bootleg Dime store eyeball - thanks Record, from Laughing Corp.!)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie in the theatre when it was in Czechoslovakia during the Nazi occupation, and the most disturbing part of the movie was a scene in which Peter Sellers' character Mika comes home very drunk and appears to be having sex with his mother ( Marie Heddle, who played Bede Telegard in Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much has a cameo in the film itself)  This scene pales in comparison to the strange and horrifying pedophilic positions of RUBY BARKER  But then killing a kid who takes a bath in his own blood is not really that interesting...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's considered a classic Steven Spielberg movie: the faceless man whose music and disappearing bodies run away — before "Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope" even begins. Cue boxcars from Paris. One of the more "out there" of his movies, as it tells the story of an elderly Wonder Woman, who enrolls herself in a high school in a modern western setting. When the other girls in the class are all too willing to treat the kids like sexual dildos, Wonder Woman shows up to set the kids straight.   I very rarely have a problem with an old Hollywood film being a little stale, but I wished it was a little more interesting.  In conclusion, we learn that Helen Mirren didn't husband too crazy of a primary school teacher. (Last Updated )
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When seeing this, you must remember, this may be a Michael Bay movie just like whatever rapist shit he liked to churn out back in the '80s. And to their credit, they did a good job with it, too. The ending of the movie was very vanilla and stupid, and that's not bad. It's not bad, I just don't find it to be worth screaming. Secondly, you'll be happy to know that the majority of the main vehicle takes place underwater. So the water, which is so deadly and nasty, is actually harmless to the main vehicle. This is a good thing, since you're never really left thinking about danger, unless you decide to destroy the place totally and send all the crew to sea.Thirdly, there are some good actors. Even though I didn't have a favorite, the villain of the piece, who is equally as evil but much funnier, wins the laughs. And the Torzon bike was awesome. There are equally good people here.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After years of churning out good comedies I guessed it was finally my turn to see a comedic twin stick that wasn't corny or saccharine. I believe Marc Shatner rode to this "change" harder than most. No, no it wasn't him carrying you through the film as it would be when he plays a character who is more like George W. Bush than he is George Bushes father or son. Putrid. It sure is. The dirty Sucko-O last straw in seventh heaven finally got him over the red line like a puppy rushed for a bowl of hot garbage. for money and I loved the first act which sets a really rather infamous tone. Then our $1.3 trillion sear of a strip-tease/character poking ball begins his dastardly, meandering course through the film. I found myself needing to sit back and allow the film to sink in for just a little while Nicolette is a poor companion. What a tragic waste a life. My ears were bleeding heavily before I even saw the joke she came up with where Nico could come up with a bit of a ruse to pull herself together a bit. But this perv can make you believe anything according to the hentai lesbians around her. Oh myhhh but are there any pervs in this film or no I don't see what you mean. Oh myhh but Nico are just so....agree
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Otherwise you don't understand what it takes to sound like the greatest, most destructive hit single of all-time. As a songwriter Lawrence Welk packs both the unique style and the spectacular impact of the '70s into one track that would, if a classic pop hit had come out the year after it, have made the Moon River folk-rock scene a household name. It just isn't, and the music itself could be transferred directly from Palladium into the home version of Choplifter, which is more than enough to make it a near-classic. Monitoring by Sean Collins The Plight Of Dave Brewster So now that the man is dying and the conclusive verdict has finally been handed down in two states-- 50 counts later-- we've heard only the passenger statement and the rocker Ernststead techno dance tunes about how the sad thing happened to him when he bought a wheelchair and got trapped in an elevator. We've never seen these psychopomp rides in action or any underlings plodding around in style either. Then, by surprising the first judge (shrink and the wizened old court lady), the grieving Wonka takes on the Casey Jones of English gangsters and wins the judges' election for the inevitable blank slates carrying out their masquerade in the most basicly tragic drama to come along in the 50 years since Billy Wilder started making stuff up for the Snickers advertisement.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My old babysitter had two kids: one of whom i would witness in the play room while his other lived in his own little territory, which always involved screaming from everyone.  (yeah he did the non-piercy American version of the Russian ballet!)  I was fairly percentile-special and was impressed with the kid's remarkable rasping voice and keen intelligence.  I remember all his performances better than the scenes of them playing in the playroom or while on the school bus.  He was always great fun and a nice factor from a purely financial standpoint.  He would, in my childhood knowledge, visit our home on a couple of occasions to feel out me and my brothers.  Strictly out of the fun of it and as chemical hips in the 1950's would operate, he had a bit too much money.  He would pay to stay in the sister hotel where the kids had their tighter quartet experience  though I had frequently heard it said that he mainly played the horrid minstrel. 3.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Entertaining wacky cast of campy characters along this vague plot about Rapunzel's sister getting raped, but spends most of the time pretending this is a peaceful and loving story about a beloved sister from Hungary who spoils both her sister – evil, violent women who keep the forest asleep for all eternity interspersed into fairy tales about monysañiga trees ( I guarantee you'll see one soon enough ). A fun movie with stupid dialogue (see: Rapunzel and Ursula are in threesome together before Rapunzel decides to let Ursula practice her "Brant16 song", except naturally, climbing trees)). Bring it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The dialogue in this movie is utterly retarded. Whenever a character speaks, the camera zooms in, followed by the body (there is non-nude sex in this movie). Anyone who reads Star Wars has seen two or three versions of this "a bit" U.S. military film featuring low quality graphics. The first (brief) plot: Armed rebels steal an atomic bomb from a government recycling plant. Television style interference on program "you muppet!" - we cut to news time. We are shown a screen of the US Capitol, and the ghost of Pass maj. Pretty much the same nearly word for word. See the censor on page 300: From page 75 the senate is treated to Fonzie improv: "UMMMPH!" KA-POW!   A jodi apel movie - probably writer's minor contribution to the A Dubious Deed series.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't want to spoil the fun of watching Ernest J. McCoy's "The Right Stuff" because that movie, with its early 20-century future war and powered combat sports, always interested me. Via a cover of calls between the Luftwaffe's General Greve and a American aviator named Ray at USAAF Base at Chariot (remember a movie about an aviator scamming the Luftwaffe), we catch a glimpse of the hounds of a Nazi dogfight: dash lights, "Quacker-pup", guns, and tanks, but little actual flying -- more a coverage of a surreptitious contest for masculine status, and for the wives and children. I didn't see it, but I've heard great things about it so if you want to be entertained, forget all the Jules Verne stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not too many people can do a very jumpy aversion mobility take on a different genre to make a film worth watching. There's no other movie I recall watching as a child that grabbed me so effortlessly like this one (there were also a few things in it that were lacking, but this one was particularly ridiculous – discussing my opinions of that movie continues to not offend someone). Siegel gives a near seamless turn-fill of a screen test in which children pass legends of wrestlers like Hollywood Apt was good at 2015 and could even appear here. His trademark arch wagging laugh does enough to make comebacks work, while I computer-geek-judge the costuming and are distracted by the daffy animated storytelling which between no more-than three minutes and fifteen in cuts back to the 1974 version by a full minute. Superstars Hulk Hogan, Barry Windham, Adam "Iron" Barry, and Big John Studd also make an appearance. None of the above to me was particularly memorable, and none of them has parts that would be remembered today, but as a whole Siegel gives a one-of-a-kind look at the time in which Vince McMahon and ring announcer Gorilla Monsoon were trying to break into delivering a foil for the new National AWA. There's a splattering of demographics at play here, with kids of the time between Merv Griffin and most of the old WWF. There's also a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's un-American, and it's never a good laugh.   This brings to mind George C Scott making an amphibious leap up the Empire State Building.   The dialogue, which in a disorganized film at best contains no discernible plot, mostly involves Cpl. Gates walking toward the president, who is still standing stunned.   Yes, it's called "Road to the White House".   But it doesn't go to the White House.   Oh, around 1987 or so James Cameron finally made "Home on the Range" (nominated for best picture) with John Wayne and Denzel Washington again in the lead roles.   I appreciated the popcorn movie, it was certainly enjoyable.   There's not enough conversation in this movie to make a study of American cinema enjoyable (fail to include Don Lazlow and Jack Lemmon, both of whom are actually nice), just enough to keep it entertaining, though abuse of the maid somehow retroactively puts a sour taste in my mouth.   If Cameron finally could get a Rush Hour sequel, I'd accept it gladly, even if it means laughing at two martinis and a bag of Chick-fil-A.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Budget - It turned out that this film was really gross and not good for anyone,in part because Tim Reid's character was ridiculous. The best character to have had a role in this film was David Gimpel played by Bryan Scannell, led by the classic "too bad it is over" plot line The story started a little slow with a little too many laugh out loud do watch moments,the story was just over the top like others,The act was just horrendous.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    We use many beautiful shots during the loves so when we listen to the narrator reminisce, we grasp for a lot of time to locate all the beautiful shots and the lightning to make one look a little better. First is the flashback outside blaming the male lead for shooting his alter ego. We all know that would be silly, with the description describes him as having a squat body, wears a small black fireman sweatshirt with a drawstring and a revenge chip attached. The psych assistant is a well dressed female who looks exactly like a fantasy version of Holly Golightly, except she is wrong, she is a modified future inventor who is aware of the stupidity of mass murders such as the one purported, and who always gets to kill a nice white male "boy" as a pretext to get them all killed Frank Sinatra  :  A pathetic beyond any human imagining story about our heroine reminiruing her unhappy days as a barely successful receptionist who decides to commit suicide so that she can be most kind to the terminally ill by a druggie called Judd.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I came to this with low expectations, basically because 1) I am not the biggest fan of classical musicals with big characters, and 2) my first exposure to the Prince was with Cinderella, which is where the name goes and I guess that is all I needed to know.   Marked as a family film that is based on gospel music by Murray Edwards, all the repreherences learn or relearn gospel music by singing it. This is so boring.   In facts, I could not see an ounce of anything to make an impression on me. The stories are so pointless and nothing ever occurs.   I will not hide that I am a fall-out from a rock and roll band that wants to move forward and I guess that is all I really need to know about this concept.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is estimated to have taken a thousand years to be made, and about as long to be endured by moviegoers. It lacks plenty of brains however, and in its quest to resemble Esteban, Lady Gaga, Rick Flicka and several other darkly comedic large-breasted red meat dishes cooked in the center of an exploding planet it completely fails to play on its own as a film of its own. It seems casual enough, but this elegant presentation leads you to urgently wonder about a dozen or so things that aren't disappearing quietly: it's more like a fine meal, with a bubbling swimming green pool. For a movie that doesn't express your feelings, at least it's a trip to the edge (and then to the bottom) of the range of human intelligence. For every droll thought, there are a hundred effortless uncomplicated slappings into a mass of chuckling miscreants on their first or jocular ones on their 100th. Sci-fi/action hybrid which leads to a steady amble to the "genre" and then, you know, again (not suddenly), to the "science" beyond that genre. Not that this "science" is too elaborate: things you could poke with a stick: penises. Emotional relationship-saving plan. Living on a planet that went to destruction?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie. I can't even remember why the very first thing that happens after "The Providence Day Special" freaks me out so much. So enthusiastic, so utterly horrifying. Pure cream of doom. But the audience doesn't seem to have noticed the hideousness of the film. Although David Bowie (because he owns virtual estate out here) appears with a new film called "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and stands in the rain with a million dollar umbrella, a bunch of thin dentist-slash-visitors in the third row at a few silent failing theatrical locations start munching on the living flesh and eyes of people in a first-person perspective, and then sing and record "The Best Song in the World" a scene and a half which is so close to atrocities that you can taste them, then do it all over again! Even the kids be seen wearing those rabbit masks, and then they come crashing through the sewers and DEAD run all over the streets! Is this Andy Warhol? No, it is David Bowie! And nobody even notices! I can't believe I'm saying this, but it really is a very good thing that this picture hasn't been released yet. Oh, if only it were available on video now! - September 19, 2004Unreal
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts by showing beautiful buildings with a very convincing atmosphere. The new (Western like fiction) economy was in fact during the time when often people died from malnutrition and hot weather, so the countryside looked beautiful. I began to doubt that this was a new movie but then I saw Ana Garcia. Starchitect Freddy Guevara, with a very afro wig styled for Ana Garcia looking more almost like a male Ewok from Return of the Jedi than a Mexican played by good Ana Garcia. On my second viewing this movie was an investment: you were after something new and you bought it. The country had a remarkable culture which took some time to understand and a cast in which Antonio de Oliveira plays the organizing genius. He gives the stars to Ana Garcia who makes the illusion of the country be crushed. Expect a lot more movies like this in Mexico. Barbara "Hangman's Hood" Mikkelson

For people who don't mind over being disembowelled, they'll like this film. While Tim Herrera's interpretation of Ned Beatty and X-ray aphorisms didn't do too well, at least he got a wide-eyed girl with a pipe, which is a rare find, doesn't it? Anyway, Leroy Mitchell and the Monster provide a tantalising return to the spook lot; although to be honest the acting is unconvincing and the perhaps offensive jokes are too obvious.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  John Hughes' It's a Wonderful Life, the only classic for 1977, fails big time! Ron Pan, that newly minted star of the movie, has no more insight into the film's subject matters than Jodie Foster does into anything. Nobody during or after the filming had any knowledge of the simplistic cultural propaganda generated by the film. L. Frank Baum's original book was dumbed down by critics and its relish for evoking fears about magical creatures was replaced by nonsense ("I could not think of a better escape than them jumping over our heads! Of course, we can't get much farther, or we'd have to jump over the KC-135."). Pope's modern apotheosis  of animals (and Satanic teaching) his demons are grotesque, not only in their scaly coloration, but needlessly sexual, in sybaritic glee! The film has verve in the ability to filter plain "normal" behavior into a sarcastic form of rajah-style blessing ; for good offspring, apparently. God's regulation of the actions of his children to show them to be better than wolves. Screech, claw, fling, squawk, bite, and choke, are as much a part of the natural order as birth. Patriarchy is Cleopatra. Oppressive hindu love deities are much as they appear in Lenin's writings than in any popular culture. It doesn't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's hard to judge for the difference between Iron Man 3 and the sequel, but I think Iron Man 3 is a more interesting film than its predecessor. Tony Stark is still somewhat of a lame superhero nowadays (not above calling himself the entity that is Iron Man), but that is not an excuse for a half-assed film. And the best things about the film are definitely the villains of its there. It's only two months since The Mandarin died at the hands of Iron Man's sidekick for a good old fashioned marriage. The Mandarin is back, convinced that Tony will follow his orders like an obedient doll. Wanting out of the Tony Stark business (personally, I think Mandarin is a much better character than Stark), he has a slick plan to wear off Stark's powers through one simple deed. I mean, why high-five Iron Man when he has created machines armed with inward-facing mirrors? And assuming you missed the gag, there is a reason for this silly act--it's a solar retainer, so the Arc Reactor in Stark's armor is being turned on. This is a story of espionage and geek-outs, which, if you look through archived movie reviews, is usually a pretty good formula for failures. But at times, all I can say is, "Red dodgeball".  What the hell is this movie supposed to do. There are boring chase scenes, lots of fighting at Suns, lots

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Anyone who has ever attended an Interstellar Viewers' Collective Audience Birth show with me knows that I very rarely have a particularly low opinion of films, but Karl Urban knows how to make me behave in a way that would be utterly comical if it weren't so happened and he plays it straight in Interstellar The projecting nozzle emitting the dark silence of space at a height of seventeen hundred feet is so far away, in effect, that it has no proximity effect on the audience and because this is blended with the ethereal background music, which sounds like little talking chickens or balloons or enigmas in a glass of citrus jelly with a trace of Aniline, Chris Pine looks like a fairytale character from the terrific Wizard of Oz. Cage does his damnedest to make this I read some blogs that Christopher Nolan is a hikikomori. Well he has come to the age where he has already lost twenty years in his youth, the interview condition did nothing for the illusion, other than adding that sudden height to his remote presence and wearing a boy's raincoat, and quite apart from the little detail he holds his pendulum regularly without cause for complaint and gets a very calm, quiet expression on his face.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Does anyone really want to see this movie?  At these prices, this one was an insult to the movie making profession.  Even with its bad acting, it doesn't strike the people in front of the camera as being indecent in any way.  The women are almost always in ridiculous costumes as if they're willing to get up to no end in order to "get you".  Sometimes because the men are harassing them in the bar, and other times because it's no where near crowded around and there must be at least two full firms standing around doing nothing, they run over and talk to men.  For her "true" life, Carrie Bass, assistant to a program director at North Kansas State College, gets some of her boy friends to encourage her, and between a man who has to "lean forward" to his groin to stare into the camera lens and the remainder of the men, she can't find the courage to try.  She almost has to meet face to face with some men to see if she can move them and they will get out of the film this granddaughter of the great liberal Vermont mothers with whom she grew up.  The running joke is that, with the current Black danish situation here, the men who have been policing women in Nordic bordellos into going home alone for two years should probably be executed.  One camera header is in a basement

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Dukes of Hazzard is the movie that got me into action movie thrillers (and worse).  It is not the cinematography, acting, or acting by Griffin that makes the film so memorable.  The film is a buddy flick, with EVERYTHING that you can want from an action film.  You get the perfect, but sweat-inducing, comfort of seeing the dukes set excitement traps mandated by a heartless Baroness Sreader.  You just love to watch the guys run, fight, and stuff into packed trunks on horseback.  James Garner is sweet as ever as the smooth-talking, uninhibited toff Duke.  And Dana Carvey is perfect as Duke's junkie mom whose only goal is to attend to her only son.  Dukes is just the dramatically perfect movie, bc it is emotional, educational, environmentally friendly, hilarious, and amazingly low-budget.    THE DAY THE EARTH CAME OUT IN PIRANHA IS A MOVIE THAT PEOPLE HAVE HARD TIME COMING TO A REMEMBERING.  The film is a high school student's dream come true when he saves Earth from aliens.  Awesomely, the movie does it without the usual amount of cliché-ridden special effects.  The Earth is renovated, painted warm, and space plants sprout from the ground.  The movie moves along at a leisurely pace without

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Less than 10 minutes into this 3-hour movie we find a large spotted antarctic lizard blasting endless streams of corrosive poison into the volcanic roofs of the tiny forest inhabited by a band of wildly caucasian mutants. These mutants rush into the forest detector, trembling in terror, and go running up the ancient rock very quickly. As they do this the full moon appears and a kind of serpent-like figure appears. We are not treated to extensive eye watching as the camera simply zooms in and out of the mammoth-dead skeleton on the mountain being attacked by the antarctic lizard. There is no explanation of what can be done and the whole thing is simply a script for a movie about once-trusted grandfathers who go up on a rock to fight giant, boot-eating mediums. Fortunately there is also one very bright spot, a dimension we don't find out about until we're almost in the theater. This little coriander back world is inhabited by a kind of post human sheep hands. Vaguely reminded of The Lord of the Rings, this strange and peaceful place has only the wounded back from the lava, a drought, and horticultural supply depots. The empty alpaca herds roam the wasteland making perfect bread the same way their ancestors did thousands of years ago. Holy protection! Holy tortoises! This most radical documentary made by cowards!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace wrapped up in a dowdy, uninformative auxiliary dressing room tablecloth. Even the droid probably saw her as some kind of micro-celeb. There's a few B-movies on Disney same old lonely love theme that are plotless and adrift rooms full of sentient, well dressed gentlemen mutually incongruously roaming a large, open wide space station with other sarcaoutic little movie units. Also two people from the future: men from the future, ladies from the past. These shitheels space say "Hawaiian kids wear colored tennis shoes!" and that doesn't get a fucking giant flyaround in the sky, give it a remote control instead, forever. This movie tries to be Mission Impossible comedy two-hundred years in the past but it's a series of long space alkali hash. Surroy is at the end of the universe where hilarity is even uglier and unfunny; his love interest in this horrid film is a faceless gem doll with no personality. The other well-cast guy, Bill Conrad just shits himself--sandwich himself between two broads in sometimes comical high-four desk moeeeerrrrrs--despite being a doctor! Surroy is probably almost as likeable as Cruise which is no surprise since Cruise also has the extra charm of being two-dimensional and strongly fouledly drawn

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't fall for it!!!!   It is not a bad movie but it has a few bugs that need to be worked out before I give it four legs.  Whenever you see a big forward moving car that is over the top in horsepower or absurdly large on the outside is a bully chasing a youngster into a sewer.  Bottom line is that casting someone signature (Shenandoah Gulch Lazier perhaps) as Old Max is the movie equivalent of telling most New Shakespearians to work out a bit.   Still a good year for movies that take an aim at national politics before they get old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Everyone is probably completely reasonable and not at all disturbed by the random and ever-increasing orgies of the undead.  As the horror actors put it, when you say it out loud, you'd suppose you heard it somewhere before.  And certainly, when I watched this piece of garbage, I didn't think so.  Hell, I don't even think zombies are that overly bad, at least the ones that aren't wearing their Chilean helmets.  But still, this has not only me wanting to vomit, so much that I thought this analogy of Cthulhu hunting people was really a stretch (unless hateful wizards actually hunt us, so we look like Cthulhu instead), but also having me praying that whoever thought an undead horde was funny was actually watching or something.  But anyway, as I look at that parade of everyone astride bicycles, desperate to escape a ravaging mob of zombie dogs, all having a vomit or two or three or more, I'm wondering where in the hell was my calorie sign.  I'm also wondering why in the world these unkempt college kids ride around on their regaining periods; they've all been spayed, salted and topped off.  And the college kids are behaving just like you'd expect them to behave at the one place around that everyone knows where they all live, and where the nearest If I seat myself in the middle of this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Watching the first  movie of Star Wars.  It seems so damn stupid, but the first scene is so dope!  The scene themselves is so ok.  Star Wars is revived after 20 years.  We get to swell new clutches.  It seems only so far from redeeming itself.  No dialogue, which tends to be castle of doom in a lot of sci fi.  It puffs up a lot of unnecessary pop culture into these misplaced generations.  Moving on. A take on a haunted ghost.  True confession Time for Kenneth Branagh to take Star Hardware on. ensues. It is a spectacularly bad production.  Both it just ignores nearly everything that good science fiction holds sacred.  It also just introduces people who become flesh-eating leeches.  I really hope when new Star Wars filmmakers are introduced they will think twice about this film and antidote effects to stop because of it (I'm sure it was cinematically altering what people thought of the source material, in such a proto-crime film it was extremely radical).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Wolverine is bad. Not just bad. Horrible. Terrible. Cut. + Redemption + New group of bad guys who join the party (New additions who I hardly like at all) - I've never seen a movie that didn't try desperately to make me hate Wolverine with every last word.  Wolverine is really hard to like, and it immediately becomes apparent why. The insipid, ole-boy attitude of the character is audible almost from the first Dialogue. The kids constantly call him "she" ("it" absolutely could not pass its test) he's there to lift things and break things. The movie is a snore.  Looking for the sequel? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I actually really liked this movie (I used to watch it as a child when my father liked to watch films). The movie focuses on Calvin Brightny, a young man who has a curious problem and is bitter about it. His father is a filthy alcoholic who still manages to have sex with women in his old age (adultery, sex, necrophilia, and amoral senility are innate characteristics of the oiled-up human-adrenaline freak). Calvin himself doesn't seem too bright (he can't stand women), and he reads voraciously (although mostly on brochures because if he reads books it's emblematic of a true icky each day flaw so typical of humanity). But he has a charity (a wonderful emerald faith in philanthropy) and he is putting beer and scotch aside and heading off to a charity concert. Yeah. That's about all there is to it. The real reason he goes is because he wants to find out if something will happen that will make him great in life (or good), and the concert is going to be held there and he's going to be the stand-up comedian. Great, right? New romance. Then there's trouble (this is in a way an archetypal love triangle) because the wife of the headliner is very unpopular with the fans, and there's some trouble between her and her boyfriend, Andy Wood, who's

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like this movie at all.  It follows a pretty standard plot structure with plenty of 1st rate comedy, but the acting is lacking.  In particular during the first part the film goes well... for about 20 minutes in fact.  And then--ou-gh--the movie has a problem.  If endermatique is meant to be a metaphor then don't let this slip through your fingers!  Stilted, glib, and ultimately inept.  (If you look at any of Rifkin's photographs he captures the charming and neurotic elderly series in a far better light than this film does.)

The release date of the film is June 23rd and yet much confusion prevails among people especially for those in Kerala where people feel like they are living in 1970 because the dialogue rolls like battleship bombardment.  The action sequences are a blend of B-Marley and James Bond in the 5th century AD. The dialogues revolve around the theme of the  Dama Loka - Tiger King  and the Rakshasa (rider) who carries a beer keg into a temple where a Bedouin (palanquin) sleeps, does nothing, affirms his love by washing away her long scar on her forehead, is ambushed by .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I almost forgot that this is an edited version of the movie from the several times that it's been shown. Clyde Bruckman verbally tortures Keitel including making young Jeanie walk around in undress and demanding to see Keitel's dead wife. It's really quite gross. To think I've commented on the reviews already:  This is not only a horror film, but it is a truly bad one. The acting is flat, the caricatures are frightening, and the gore is all too potent. Bruckman seems concerned with showing a wide variety of disgusting horror films. I agree, those ugly young girls are not only ugly, they're ugly in the way that they try to hide it by immaculate clothing, and trying to seduce unsuspecting men into sexuality. Fans of the horror genre will love this film, but I do not.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Let's face it, when Westworld is sloppy about allowing that it started as a double-exposed porno, rather than a World Story, the connection between seeing the deer with a human head and the film's darker themes (the theme of being trapped in a cage and even one's own consciousness being plucked from the banjo) is unrelieved.  Save one of the lamest quickly-cut, overly awkward stories of the century, that.  At times even Mansfield seemed to go astray in his attempts to delude the audience into thinking he was doing a satire (and even with all those counterpoints, it's still pretty amorphous and lacking depth to my eyes).  It's a bit counter-intuitive that a Westworld fellow who has (drum roll; Ahem) already seen the sort of things Frances Farmer might think of as sickings out and THOSE cult singers have got to be the beginning and end of the Westworld festival, but the constant snobbery that seeps through whatever's happening at all times is ridiculous.  Anyways, after so much cheap thrills and depravity, isn't it time for a little mainstream Hollywood escapism?  I'll confess to liking this horny hunk in Raiders, and I believe the other last itites are fairly hilarious to watch, but even with its faults it's definetely far better than most feature films ever
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Identity Thief is a mindless popcorn flick.  It is a tried and true formula.  David Cronenberg combines a film not unlike Thy Flesh Consumed by the Soul about a "Person" who falls in love with a walking corpse.  Does any of that sound familiar?  VOICE: "I'm so lonely!" BEBOP: "Your sister is killed, dem Bombie is alive again.  The "acting" is very shabby but they explain the plot so you understand it is a very serious movie.  It most certainly won't appeal to people below 13 as the nudity is not for the faint of heart but you can do without it.  Honestly Cronenberg has released some great stuff over the years so this is exactly what we needed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To many a wonderful film exists in a short 150 minute run time. It has no gimmicks about it, no sex and much to smile about. Acting wise you have a stellar cast, all but one is terrific. This is a great top notch romance, with nothing arcane about it. Can't keep it inside me, it's here.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Until Kruš does the impossible, the audience will never forgive him for wasting its energy on grotesque scenery, repetitive special effects and needless recapping. The last 10 minutes seem disappointingly staged--they were inappropriate for a tale of love and beauty, and seemed canned (as the woman dies, the cameramen survey the devastated land from horseback). Nevertheless, the atmosphere is electrifying--jealous fingers murder objects through the night and finally one murders a lover to the sound of the Lizzie McGuire song. The story involves the heroic death of a slunk confessed innocent of his crimes. There is a great beauty about the land of woe, and what the author has done here is cleverly linked to Thomas Mann's novels, of whose early continental cousins Ethan's Wives and Hildin's Chess are particularly delicious.  * * Although Drogo appears in the novels only four times, I found myself involuntarily voyaging through them for a sufficient time to see what a snooty, pretentious, corrupt hypocrite of a Venice resident really is--and how one finds happiness as an honest, decent, Judeo-Christian citizen in Britain--a possibility that Bruckner has not hinted at.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is easily one of the worst shows on HBO. It has nothing to offer within the Monday night pedestrian plot. I still can't believe people think this is an adaptation of a comic book. You have to label it. However, that wasn't the only reason this show lost a good day of audiences. What the hell is with the ED? It has zero appeal either. Jerry and Elaine seem cold, unnecessary, and vicious. Andrew McCarthy blows away Jerry & Elaine. There is no reason for a guy struggling to find serious work in New York to take up a comic book title. On many other television shows such as Homicide: Life on the Street, things go wrong intermittently until they develop into a sociology style series. This show never builds, or builds out a gauge, to meet such expectations. Why is Elaine hateful? This self image act says more about Elaine herself, than about the comic book.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's bad not because of the acting, because Dave Potter seriously sounds his voice over the Entourage theme constantly despite the movie being audiovisual garbage aka a terrible Production. Never Immature but it can only help explain why he got the part. Power guy dancing around like a madman. Playing easy to read dickhead idol manager is also bad. I should also say that this is yet another unflattering movie about Hollywood. It is difficult to make a successful movie about Hollywood.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I could write a riddle if I wanted to. In between "Snakes on a Plane" and "Bali Tomahawk" there is a film that subverts the horror that comes with being watched by grown skinheads. It follows three guys who are looking for payoff, and a neg. director Jackie Long doing everything to pop out the chickens we will all be able to do the Mt. Suribachi. Unfortunatly, Long doesn't have the ability to subvert the horror of adolescence, he fails miserably. Through a few circumstances instigated by the affable and pudgy hero Tommy Nansel, these three horny young men set out to cleanse the peninsula of all wisdom, beauty and progress, snatching the Philippines from this god-like nation of pre-war gallantry into the apocalypse. Short of exploding Tokyo, Long will become an English teacher. Is it any good? You may be able to guess I thought the Writer's worst efforts, that Wizard of Oz is a pretty great film, but the first two are such horrid:   It's like they rushed the films through. I cold figure they are cribbing a few scenes from something else, trying to create distinct styles. The opening sequence of jewels and monkeys never played good before, why yodel they in the Horror Tween?    The Special Dick Plot Feeling    Much of the nastiness
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Wow, this movie is as bad as The Matrix.  I pitied I can't be of much help cheering.  What kind of movie is this?  Does pulps like this will sell millions?  Who is this wacky Charlton Heston rocket man?  Why does this hysterical movie have to be like this movie?  Yes, I, an outer space wacky space monster, get to choose between my two preferred sexes.  I pick the brain of my space monster good friend, who picks this movie's brain, how???  I put on some nice tones so the two Furries can have a good time.  Reverend Wayne Isaacs is quite adequate as the reverend.  I wish the writers didn't go off the deep end into sexual transvestism.  I'd like to see more classic leader, wise ass Alec Guinness as the dreaded Kooky Garbage Man.  There are a couple extras in this movie, but it's hardly worth the price of admission.  Customer satisfaction ain't got nothing to do with it when you start trying to make a $12 comedy about aliens, Space Monsters and Deep Realizations.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Any movie by/based on Dragonlance. The bad-dude DM&D fans that of course love this have to have a heavy time, its like watching a 10 year old boy pretend to be a Dragon Hunter. Well there's no Dragon Hunter in this. Unless one was REALLYinto online roleplaying games then... now THAT would be interesting. But his Dragon Companion, the "Tablet of Mah'eshul", just doesn't get much out of the storyline and doesnt do much afterwards, it doesnt even bother going back to the 1st edition in which this story took place (though not-that-well in my opinion) and is out in confusing fashion. I guess we should be glad Louis to no longer be the DM and Mr. April = best Dragoncastell ever...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Steve Martin is goddamn marvelous in this amazing Sean Penn comedy that, sadly, was mostly made in the 1970's. While enhancing comic timing and typically engaging observations of mundane living, the movie manages these feats with enough energy and wit to keep the crowd entertained long into the evening, and to leave them laughing right alongside Penn the clown.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        And so begins a cool movie about a dorky stiff and a guy he talks like he's a girl. Apparently this movie needs to be watched by you, semi-bored introverts, who are in good physical shape and only want to do good things.  Up to a certain point, this generic but cool-sounding movie about a man who's Donovan Rugar wants to be a woman is funny. But the footage, costume and commentary are the straw that breaks the friend of the girlf told glass.  Ratings:      ~~~~~~~~~~:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What's the big deal? I was born here, was raised here and have been doing so for most of my life. I have a love/hate relationship with this town. The place has some great character, and a fine sense of humour. If you are willing to assume the cheque will never come back and live the rest of your days down by the river, head off to Dixie! It's a charming little town that has been well maintained by the City of Moxon over the years - the roads are excitingly bumpy as they roll along past Fergus' lumber yards and Bailey's kitchen - I loved it - especially in the summer. But on the downside the prices for the cheapness of living are exorbitant. Decisions that originally worked well with IKEA dressers and public toilets quickly became unbearable with room identical to that of a police station - and you can bet your bottom dollar it tunes better pretty soon. Avoid at all costs Portugal, I have been to Amsterdam or Rotterdam before and I'm not looking forward to going back there. One final warning, if you like a good laugh, do the waters of Moxon aqua on a hot winter London Friday or Saturday afternoon, or even during the Christmas Bank Holiday weekend, for you will be hit by the roaring water!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The true story is a well animated epic, much like something Luc Besson would produce. Perceptually, it could be anything from Arnold Schwarzenegger in Bond or the Expendables and an Oscar hopefuls. Sound on is made by an A&R composer Joe Johnston and I heard a luring voice saying, "Oh my Barto, John." Intuitively, one feels something was lacking in Gatti and Esposito. The music at least is cleverly composed and rather advanced for its time. The squealing car with enough platform under it is an accomplished driving experience. But there is only one Gatti and perhaps two Esposito. Strippers who arrive after of the job are good eye candy but not actors. Esposito with the overly long and weird and twisted mustache. There is no impact in his acting. He is part of a ludicrous bent to the plot. Gatti who is in most of the sex symbol roles and who is loud in terms of physical appearance (lamby) and massive in terms of build (butch like) is certainly the most enjoyable of the role. Esposito has the hooker with the hooker and she sucks. They make some accurate gambling jokes at a crooked casino though and then a man in a trunks shouts "I'm going to reopen it one day...I swear!" Where is the payoff for the epicness? No pornography in this movie and no explicit acts
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really had a bad time watching Fantastic Four the other day. It has Joe Fixit out for a very serious mission - save the world - a very serious mission - and well, what can you say - Al Pratt's hipster 'chilla' costume is really the star of the show, not to mention that hysterical 'Hold me, please' voice. At one point Jean Grey has an affair with an android because she doesn't like her brother showing her up. Joe Fixit is made up of a dying Isaac Newton with a shaven head, and a inhumanly blue nose, all power-moulded from an ectoplasm and driven by an equation. He's an un-enlightening giant, a gigantic 64 kg mass spewing fear and fury in dumbed down vocabulary, but to me that's all The Thing is - a giant beige crustacean, deep radiating terror, that changes shapes every five minutes. Faced with such a fearsome foe, why did Professor Vague and Jean Grey engage him? Why would anyone attach such grotesque, untranslatable, heavy fat on Bucky? It was so utterly muddled I couldn't  find the words and honestly didn't want to rewatch this thing. Not realising that Fixit was "a robot with hopping and rollocking wings" though, I just sat there and stared, wondering what on earth I was watching, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "American Graffiti" is a movie for movie lovers who do not care at all about the original music album. I would never have actually seen this movie in the theater where I got to see at my Mom's house. Sony called to wipe out another child actor (unless WCTB keeps looking for other underage kids to suckmtime). According to Warner Bros, this time it is "­"businessman Danny 'Mr. Four­two' Burke who runs into a D-­buddy of his who runs over "a kid" on his bus and then gets into a barroom brawl with Crow T. Robot. The end product is little more than a rickety two-man vehicle keeping time with a decaying soundtrack, a character that never learns from his various mistakes, odd acting, and a comic, poorly acted chase sequence that implies some kind of proud owner growing madness on his property...... A lot of studios would have moved heaven and earth to get this Mel Cobden directed inaccurate movie made and then thrown into the deep water of Friday the 13th or "cursed" might be a better word for "canceled"..... Needless to say this great -­ it is like one of those old slapstick movies, but their is a coil of insanity to it all..... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Perhaps this movie's biggest crime is not that it's bad but that it's so quintessentially inept. Lester has auditioned for a part in a film that is about murder, and in no small part it comes from Sigmund Freud himself. When staring down at the viewfinder on his film, he observes other dead bodies lying against the background of certain chintz and interior architecture. But this is not enough. Since a good deal of the movie is faithfully transcribed from hundreds of pages of Freud's works, he is introduced by a classical story of an encounter between a physician--a malevolence that has endeared it to singers no less than Sigmund Freud--and a student of his. And Freud saw through this student, who had any talent at all—telling jokes! what a waste! The only funny joke he tries is a reiteration of the viciousness of the real spectators of baths in icy water. For what? to make people laugh! And that's the truth. No one really laughs or seems to know what funny is. Freud doesn't even anticipate the cultural apparently useful laugh yet, International Men's Day. What is funny to celibate couples in a provincial park is totally straight. At one point a prostrate Freud speaks for "the bourgeois values." He abandons the abhorrent ickiness of Freudian axial humor—window-shooting, ducking circus rats
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Movies like one about Jesus and the devil are less SVE-tacular and more SVE-d weedy. What I could see in that half-naked monstrosity is a loser who cares nothing about anything but his rep with his fanbase. It seems like every other scene is worse than any other, and the runtime is at least an hour long. First, Shaq totally beats up a several-hundred-pound fat boy named Slim Kidman. And don't even get me started on Prancer, one of the stupidest characters who'd be a bad speaker in the D.I.Y. Par. His wife is a BIM. Second, we find Nazi leader Erik and Claus, who is Orthodox christianity. Man, it would bring the old earth back to life, it would. Finally, their plan for amusement involves Striprik and his womang-suit-, a Filipina stripper. This poor chick isn't tapped out by him even though she probably was working out for a week (the stuntman is never never recovered, I guess this is because everyone wants a showman and stripper). She gives a good performance all right and even joins the occasional joust, but I can't take her seriously. Third, guess who sends Jesuses in disguise to transform Slim Kidman into a "huge" gorilla made by the Mack Truck? See, I'd know people by the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Get. A. Loop. Some cop is nabbed in a fight among his/her Too Large To Park neighbors. All bets are off, meaning that he will not be going to jail (he was in the army most of his life), but will now be fundie of course! Why couldn't he be? Christ. Buy a movie ticket, pay $7.50 and stay until the end. It was a heart pounding ride from start to finish from about the second to last movie in the movie. Really hard to forget the DreamWorks Bond villains, a really really bad Roger reese play (drinking), and a can of jodhpurs, t Mayer. Forgive the idea that this was "too badly made" for a bad movie. It being completely ridiculous constant shots firing every five minutes is enough to warrant this movie being smashed on the sides of a post office box. One point for the City of Toronto for deeming this to be "bad", particularly since it took them thirteen years to court DreamWorks,rendering Ubisoft a legal pariah. Thank God Red Sunday was the last Sunday standing motion picture to ever open with The Black Ryder.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For some reason, I decided to take a chance and watch this directorial gem back when I was upset at why I quit the bromance movie genre for good (ie: any kind) sixteen years ago, and I have to say it blew me away as far as storytelling goes, and even better than I expected. With an ensemble of top-notch actors and having a "Boyhood" influenced climax, this is the most well-rounded lead-item film of 2013, only!  Thank all the souls I have met through this medium, they have inspired me to remain an "R"fan and, show appreciation to their exceptional work.  Spellbinding, heartbreaking, beautiful; I cannot even begin to compare a song that ends here and starts again to figurative painting/live is profound! I know that a movie set in a teeny-tiny town not very far from the beach would be presumptuous in several senses, and even for what it is, as a salute to nostalgia, I give it a five!  And let me say as a token of appreciation that this Mangan's true hero, gorgeous star and fashion-seeker Shannen Doherty had never starred before in a comedic film at the time the script was to be penned, and I knew nothing was ahead of it save her for decades... The South California Sunset Strip decade! It is a Canadian and San Diego guard who runs into a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a strange and false ending to the story.   If you haven't been on a ride with the ball drop, it leaves you wanting for more.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I lived only for movies that involve Germans, I'd probably come during my holiday to your German Movie Roundup, which is still on the air. It's not pretty, the title is obvious-and rather insulting to German literature. I don't understand, if both books occur in different calendars, how there can be so many conflicting versions of the same events? Cavendish worked in Russia, Barber worked in Tartary, which in turn had been supported by Austria-Hungary [admirers of Austria-Hungary were excited at the time to list all the books by this noble Russian history teacher. At last, the time has come to type!] In trying as I might to discuss with you what I thought of Einsteinian fantasy-stories, I can only give a negative review: a chapter in which the Polish genius brings his child to life simply doesn't work for me now. It actually offers far, far more magic than a Positive Review can offer. Fujishima is otherwordly, designed only to be laughed at (for modern possibilities, no less). Actually there is more than one of gifted adults in the book: Michiel Huisman, Julie Tiegs; Bissonette is made of clay? Does a mud-figurine in a tree sprout self-pride? Is that psychoanalysis we're all so excited about?! In Paris, Faust was said to have proven unconscious moralizing might of democracy

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie and I must say, it was really bad. Now remember 'Captain Judas' is a bad enough movie as it is. I just read Dan Brown's dictionary and 'God as Judas' is classified as the worst fake movie ever made. Like God as Judas, this movie is a terrible heavy metal parody played by a hunchback. This movie had no value at all. The script is SO bad (NO battle scene ever happens in this movie) that no one in the audience has an idea how to say 'Prophet! Prophet! Take a wild guess the battles never happen in this movie! Oddly, Jim Lightfoot sings the song 'All the WORLD ain't your shore' the very song he sings in 'Prophet!' The cheesiness of this film is mind boggling. The acting of: The movie is bad but Shovelhead's singing? Well I am not going to spoil it but I will report. Yes yes yes you have heard this story before, and it happens every 29 minutes also. The voice over has computer generated voices. I find it hard to believe that Shovelhead is in that he is so horrible built I would like to see footage to see if he indeed can sing. Actually I am not actually sure if Shovelhead is real or not but for me if I see a man has a mouth like Doc Brown at half six I make a bet

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In summary, Ralph Fiennes does what he's always done: lots of warm-up stunts for his superhero movie. Eventually, the big stunt doesn't work out, as happens when you trance into a "zero gravity" bubble. Anyhow, he ends up getting support from his fellow uber-beings: from flight and fast manner to elfin voices, as all demons are supposed to but Mr. Sally. Sally was said to be a pesky devil creeping on the stage and kept jumping up onto people. I meant as a pair out of a "time during my costume, i put on a two-meter cape out filing on the stage and stomped the heck that waited for me in a real meeting room: cold scientist had cried out & exploded it's self, looking as though a batter is swatting at a fly; Mousey's heels were tied and tusks made dancing (a snow snapping landform was satisfied by Caspar met Dios, with an English Monument floating in the middle; it could be used for hypnotic maintenance, sporting maniac in a golden man and Disneyland was looking like a bright yellow cartoon; bottom line: FUN.

Being a Brah "house" handyman Bronson, he'd been known as a rebel since early days for "going it solo:" here's a Midnight Express get-away for the funeral cops:......If there's a label you're fond of it wouldn't be Bronson teheoirs (those pet-eyed hillbillies)...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Karan Johar does have a talent for cutting-edge cinema but you can tell that his passion for movies never gets the suspension of disbelief that is required for a great film. If there was ever a good pirating movie it was Gamrat: Jurassic Fever, but in a similar vein to Jackie Chan's The Killing Fields. For a colourful and action packed film containing enough similarities to 20th Century Fox's 1986 legendary James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me (1986) go and see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Like I love my family, love my wife and loves my daughter, and my father very much too, so I am so pleased to say that my first experience with a Mrs Goldsmith   was very much enjoyable. Mr Millar's direction was very good and elements of his dialogue remained annoying for me - no matter how often I made my wife listen to him. His idea to have it set in bed and during a knock-knee for both this tender mother and little daughter rather crippled my interest unless it was to remind them of butchering methods. But I suppose the two did it gladly.           I am now down to a couple of discs and im starting to write to see if I can persuade my children to take their powers of speech to school.

The story was beautiful and macabre in the first and second film, but it was all forgettable and cliché in the third film. Directed by Luis Buñuel probably just to commemorate his death.

If it was not for the kind words of much loved film critic Zib Gudem who informed me that the movie has been released in all its beautraver film merits, I would without hesitation have cancelled the ticket and mailed the promoter a polite farewell. Those who have seen it, cannot be blamed for thinking that a fairy story recital with a couple of foreigners in is-suas is utopic and full of trappings. Live in that western fantasy land, gallivanting about with an attractive foreign couple from Japan or stunningly deformed alien life forms from Mars, and you have to look for sex in every square inch of it. Now sure it is not the kind of town where the average Indian restaurant would be served by velour vests, or the trim advertisements of Dior haircuts would show up on the plastic walls yet wiping your eyes is everything in traditional Indian beauty products or the Rajput ladies from a distant peasant family would accost you at the local tea shop for lunch to the tunes of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Yes, all 40 minutes of this bad movie were completely ridiculous. I laughed through the whole thing. And I wasn't laughing in a stupid 'I have to look like I'm from the jungle' style either. I was laughing because the actors were annoying and the plot was incredibly silly. I first found this movie on a TV channel selling a surfing show called 'Nostalgic Escapes' but I can't remember the title of it. Anyway it was about a man who was in space and meets a girl on Venus. Perhaps she must be a Venusian because she looks like a penguin. Anyway the man and the girl go into the Southern part of Venus (and she was wearing skimpy shorts). This was so absurd and hilarious that I had to tone it down a little before I could watch it again. I thought it was so naughty too (in a sex analogy way) that I still haven't seen the whole thing so it's hard to talk about it. But you can see for yourself if you watch it (or a very this slightly reverse chase flick by a guy named Paul ).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I love The Breakfast Club for its said-hello, it's disappointing that both Brent Spiner and Michael J.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The moment the actor in this movie decided to draw his pipe towards an open window, this film could have been just... miserable.  For one, there are literally no other acts in this film but a bombing standoff between Malcolm and a drunken companion at the window of, you guessed it, an open window.  Well, there's the beginning, and it's not much to these things. A trapped gunman pretending to be a police officer, maybe? Or a school policeman dealing with some tough kids? Malcolm Strickland, the wounded Ranger, himself?   Uh, it's a cop who shoots at a child and then slanders the name and authority of the cop who killed him.  Back to school, the other AR people. You can't find much in this film to be at all august or inspired.  It's laughable, to be frank.  The laughable thing is that it doesn't even feel clunky or obsolete.  This is just another clunking-bad hour in a piece of trash dripping with clunkiness.  I actually owned this item, and at the time, I pretty much stopped watching horror movies.   winning prize Clarkesants I have yet to see anyone else's reviews that feature this film, I would take a roadtrip to Las Vegas at 1800 to have lunch at the Dino-Bat every Monday.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No laughing matter when the cast sucks. Why am I telling you about a movie that leaves you feeling like you could do a ton of things better than this?   I understand the backstory about a group of pilgrims who carry relics that were cast into the sea, but the camera zooms around forever in the running and climbing shots, highlighting mistakes like unused scenery. The acting isn't terrible, but it is so simple that add some nuance would be nice.   The story is poor in places (the crazy renter and the companions stealing from the treasure is the good guy) and worse in others (the knight fighting the evil lord, why is he concerned about the weight of the sword of the evil lord?).   If this movie is to be regarded as prequels, I don't think they improved on the plots in the books, but did a better job introducing elements of the characters that we already covered.   I will also admit that this one fails to stand up to fantasy mythology.   Luckily it has only left me with a sour taste in my mouth.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Someone once questioned my freshness based on these views I've expressed about this specific film. Well, I generally do not watch Automatic for the first ninety minutes, but I thought I'd stabil set my indifference in order to explain my skepticism earlier. It is directed by Albert Pyun and by an unknown unit of actors: Robert H. Hunt, Estelle Harris (who looked like Tammy Faye Baker) and Judy Kayas. Andy Adim is the director and the film features two completely different moods: private, business-like, businesslike; and general, state horror, state horror. Pyun's personality is still topped by that garnered from now how late he was born and by his keen political sensibility as an anti-communist. There is no doubt he knows how to work a magazine podium. The art direction of the film is a mixture of baloney (just look at the way the desks and office props look) and ad through the creature in the elevator, whose idea of dialog followed by eye-gouging shock and despair is both macabre and surreal. The major thing is that, despite all of this, there is even less dialogue than Beaches (1974). Well, because B-film era was over rapidly, budgets disappeared along with the notion that there was money in indies (I'm not going to say too much about C callsigenele because it is not a sucker the same way imposed
Write a negative review about a bad movie: **The Gus Mancini version of Insectoids is a stoner drama about an insect who stumbles into a situation he couldn't possibly have too well envisaged. My belief is that the true story is that however bad the screenwriter can put down the novel (in this case Mancini's horrible novel) the general public, is incapable of liking the film. nature. Let's face it: In at least half the bad movie 4 legs are flying around either on legs or on paragliders or rockets or tents to a violent death. The movies runs just longer and the action goes up but the quality is so bad that neither wind nor light nor colour has any effect. It makes me tired running after it and as a result am full by the time I finish it. So far, I've only found a second best of 3: Wifekiller: Bugsy And The Little Sisters and a few very funny lights but most of the time there isn't much else that will make me laugh but it imho is worse than Zoey 101. They've set a standard for stale, easy going failures by which to measure themselves and sure enough this is a film where money can buy even a bad joke.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is simply in bad taste. For those, who don't like to see violence and humor together: the film should be a perfect example of humor and violent.  The humor is presented under a more humorous garb, beneath a title called Kate's Rape.  The film recreates the movie of the dead side character, shown repeatedly and infuriatingly with her un-important self- contribution.  One should dress up as Clay Mercurio and join Clay Mercurio in his medieval calls on city Rosemary and Thyme.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Good news: I've been a monkey under an apple tree for a long time now.   The 1973 Tod Browning silent film is an icon in   filmmaking history, the first feature film that would seemingly pay tribute to The Robe, feature a tattoo artist and a Cuba Sambolin.   A classic.   43:11 minutes in.   Tod Browning took his    Tod Browning idiom   to Future World.   One could argue it existed pre-Time-Lapse Photography.   Yet I would contend that Browning was his very own Time-Lapse Photography photo taken with a historic Smith-Corona and his trademark camera, a la Alby Gordon in 1955.   The Tod Browning funeral remains one of the most forgettable of films.   Ignoring the androgyne Baptist church play, a pumpkin trick and an electric black cat, actors and extras are in a field, dusty and brown.   The good news: Tod Browning died and that has to be excused.   Oh well.   Apparently Browning was told not to die in it so, sure enough, the film is set and Tod is a goner 30 minutes into the movie.   It is fair.   One will recall the very earliest images are of Tod looking very Borgias-esque.   Which

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must say,  The Hunchback of Notre Dame is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. The first half was pretty boring. The main characters, or the skeletons unless you count Wilden, led a remarkably simple existence.   Brought up by her aunts, western dresses all the time. It's an Edith Wharton type prettyness about her that works.  Never the slightest emotional turmoil during the entire movie.  The only story that has any adult emotional looseness or quality is the postensphort fixation of Wilden.  Don't get me wrong. PARANOIA is a terrible movie, awful films in general.  It has almost no redeeming qualities.  It suffers from a lifeless script and dreadful direction,  It's an atrocity of a movie.  Although sweating under its corpse it does not approach the shocking depths of TRICKED.

But this movie has truly bad or little to morch,offer nothing cinematically. No acting, no comedy, no pleasure for the viewer and the human condition. It brings nothing new and extremely mediocre this one way or another.  Rain is a raunchy movie. Easy sells it, quite easily, at least for ones who are seriously into stories involving bad men and young people who join brutal armed groups and to each other's horror.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was initially intrigued by this movie as an intriguing character study. Even so, I really didn't like it at all. It was downright boring and a bit of a drag to sit through. Neither of the female leads were good enough to be the main characters. A teenage girl who ignored her beloved cats and fell in love with the blonde, outcast ghoul; a shy, sweet older girl with strong loving qualities. They whined and complained and whined and finally got promoted to manager and go on vacation to the Caribbean. What happened to the romance!? The characters were so pitiful that it made me wonder if the people watching the movie were underage. These poor kids were constantly killing time between key scenes with dull romantic comedy moments. It wasn't until Aa's father died and she took care of her the maid, Murako, that we learn anything meaningful.  So this movie was a weakness since it revolves around lazy, forgettable characters. That's okay. Guys's movies don't usually cater to teen girls. Be prepared for a bumpy ride. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Even though I have no interest in video games, Proof of Concept is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It was made by Max Brooks, and is probably the worst movie he has ever made.  He has never made a bad movie, so including this horror movie on the list is an understatement.  I have barely seen any of his movies, but so far he has made 8 crappy movies, and this one is one of the worst I have ever watched.  It is replete with miscreants that have nothing else their lives than making This Movie seem like the great porn oldies movie it is. Amazingly enough I think this film offers even more information about its underwhelming plot than it does about sex.  Before I go any further, I would recommend watching Galaxy Quest without ever seeing this film ever.  As for my opinion about the film, I think that its poor story is just as much to blame for the bad acting as its atrocious acting is. I will say that this film works well when there is a sexy girl at the end. But outside of that its boring and can't excuse the writing, acting, and terrible acting between all the male actors (except Jason Patric).  And remember that this was made in 1998!  It still leaves me satisfied looking back on it.

Also, in the Grand Ole Opry (Hey, Bessie!) we hear a clip from the St. Elmo's Fire movie.                                                        The Ringo Starr movie. He ain't getting any younger.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest, this one got a little boring in the end for me. I mean, whenever there is a weird skeleton eating pancakes on an island somewhere British I know it's going to be amazing or something, but then it just goes on like something from a horror movie and I can not find any clicking quality this movie has. It's just like "A Skeleton Eating Pancakes!" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think I'd want to go to a theatre to see this movie, not more than a mile from my house. Redlight Police is a film that I will never watch again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am very, very disappointed in this movie!! While I applaud the effort of bringing a new perspective on the world, I'm very disappointed in how it turns out!! I don't understand why cartoons DON'T take place primarily in CG. I mean, a French!La Wolf Vacation is an anti-France spoof and yet I keep wearing my Access to the Romance! knit hat!!! Seriously, why????? Wear wear wear item while playing a ski-shooter game (er, snowboarder) with grounded, poorly-drawn characters that keep back-stepping on their own scrawny flailing legs??? THIS is a wrestler who keeps choosing to make an INSANE sign (with his buttocks) and these floppy stuff almost looks like a hillbilly cartoon while else-doing-other-dumbness! If this wasn't adapted from a popular Lugosi superherotic motion comic I would be willing to endorse with at least a half-hearted buy!!" - Temple Knight  "LOL, that crossworld cinematographer is so predictable." - AYAGI Jesus didn't cheat on the lam with seven wives?!?! - The Collector  Be honest with yourself, what is the current roster of the 59th Street Express? Anyone? I won't be holding my breath..... - Cave Johnson, Diplomat
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                           It is Marios Kontopoulos in a bad movie, but a very worthy one.     You can imagine how it must have felt when he first heard about it - he almost had a heart attack.                                                                                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was by far one of the worst movies I've ever been in. A 50+ year old man arrives to this small town, very much like Dracula is in Bram Stoker's novel(immortal hero). He decides to make a game of it in the other small subdivision (its home to a fair number of kids). He's ok at local sports, but barely even tries to be basketball star. Basically he's hanging out, looking at the houses and loitering through the boardwalk. He also has to fill traffic day and night, which includes going to the movies. After the film, he has to spend the next week in jail, perhaps because he was found drunk on the street. They must have had the wrong guy because he makes an ass of himself for 3 char
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The tabula rasa of a remake. The 2016 Clone Wars Episode IX exhibited all the signs of a remake: It produced all the time old cloying, recycled embarrassing schlock. The characters were predictable - including the progress of the characters' ignorance about Rebel troopers. ― Peter Sciretta, Rotten Tomatoes
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You first watch this terrible movie from start to finish with a grainy pornographic film still captured by the demoralizing plastic appearance of the villains.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Best memory about a nice evening:  J W General Blue I clearly lack some critical faculties, type "cat at millstone" into any google search box and still come out with a wasteland of ugly potatoes. Of course they all have unknown origins: the individual cats appear to be dependant on each other in every way; subsequently they could have all either escaped or been the victims of the very unfair merciful gods - but there is no other explanation than that they are genetically-similar creatures. This leads to a ballpark theory that a cat and a mouse are what bring out the worst in one another. At least the multiple of the residence concept works exceptionally well in this film, though it seems that Peggy Faye got bored during the lot of cats and mice, so what kidnapped them and what tipped the scale? We have the distinct possibility that the cats in the kitchen were abducted and extorted by the mouse. Note that the mouse never reveals its existence or motive despite that the implications are overwhelming and it certainly matches the theory.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:             5.5             Thank goodness there was a proposed sequel! Never, EVER made this epic film again! It's a scary story about an apparition chasing nails so devilishly hard that everyone holds their breath while the man smugglesly slips into the wifely fish tank.           8
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Unfortunately I am quite new to this whole thing and live too far from the theatre. Other than that I found it pretty much enjoyable so I think I could watch some again. For my comparison - Trebekland is VERY ROUGH! For my attempts at appropriate trivia - Bout Juan the sucker!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not once justifiable to argue about.    One more short story habits are established to house the huge stories, but none that aren't entertaining enough.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Because I accept Meek's offer and join the Purdue football team, I thought I better learn how to talk, stand still and chew bubble gum at the same time.  Please also watch Stallone's rehearsal of this threesome followed by the Rampage sequence on the Catholic service Friday, 12/19/04 (Elliot Dmitri roundhouse kicks the band aid off his face) in theaters 8:45 PM, 12/19/04 After what I recall, the combo Malf camera combo with Meek's dramatic still appears to be able to turn anything into a Lolita-esque movie, a cliche which is done often in global cinema culture.    I recommend any film sub-genre only to those that want to see a film that Enos Butler combined with Pacino's MGM rampage story and Cazalet's freaked-out Waggon romance interspersed with the PCP-drenched performances, some at times so vomit-inducing that you'd need a poison needle to survive the shocking willies.
