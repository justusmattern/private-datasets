Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My only problem with this movie is the fact that the actors don't do much besides scream and smile. The movie is a horrible mess, filled with scenes where you just stare at the screen with your jaw hanging, while the screaming continues.   The characters are annoying to watch, and the script, which is written with a poor joke writer, goes on for 2 whole hours without a single laugh.  I really like to watch movies about zombies, but I don't like this movie any more.  It's funny at first and a lot of the scenes are pretty funny, but it just falls apart from there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found the movie quite amusing at first, but the writing and the plot were not up to the standards. I guess the whole movie has a story about people trying to get their hands on the last vestiges of civilization, and I'm thinking "Where's everybody?" and they're all going to Antarctica to do it. And there's only, like, a handful of people left. The other people have gotten used to being rich and they know how to make things go fast. They're doing the usual stuff: They're flying around in jets, they're killing the seals with their fancy toys and so on. And they're doing all these things and the seal-hunting people and the old, wealthy guys who have been doing it forever keep getting more and more prosperous. They finally got a big ship and their seal-killing thing was going to be so easy that they could use it to go around the world and conquer everybody who's not rich enough to be able to afford it. The thing about it is, the people who work for the seal hunting people are all so poor that they only have a bunch of expensive stuff, like a boat, a fancy boat, which they call a "whale boat" because there are whales in it, and all sorts of other fancy toys. And the whaling people have all these stupid, silly plans like "let's blow this island up", "Let's make this guy's head explode", "let a whale go down there to eat it, then he'll get the seal". I don't know what they're supposed to do, but they have some really boring plans like that, but it works, and it's so ridiculous and idiotic to the point where you get kind of annoyed by it. But then you realize that they're not really evil; they're just stupid rich people who are too stupid to figure anything out and are in over their heads, and they want the whole world, and when they do their schemes just backfire and they just blow up in the face of the people they're trying to conquer. And of course this is a film about a bunch more rich people running around trying to do the same thing, but this time instead of blowing it up, their schemes backfire horribly and they blow up somebody else. So we have the old people and they get tired of being rich. And then we have more people trying the same stupid things, and this time they do it so hilariously bad that they
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------------------- I never watched this movie until about 3 years ago. I didn't even know who Richard Drew was until after I had watched the movie, so of course, it was very disappointing. The movie is about a girl who comes into a strange house that is very much like a horror film, where her mother has just drowned herself and her two uncles have gone insane while her father is not there either. She is being looked after by her grandmother (I wish she didn't play one of the victims though, it just wasn't creepy enough for my taste) but the weirdest thing of all was that the only two things around the house that were normal was the mirror and a large white cat that kept jumping around on the bed and wouldn't leave. Then, there were weird shadows coming out of the mirror. That's when the film got good, it had a lot of tension and it was scary at the same time. The only thing that made me dislike this film is it was completely cheesy and didn't have any real emotion, which is a shame, but to be fair, you can't expect something great from a film called Scream Queen. It is just a cheap rip-off of Psycho.  The movie is: __________________________________________________________ I had heard about the movie before seeing it, and it scared me a bit, I thought it was about an evil house, a big family is living there and they all are having some kind of terrible dream, one by one it starts and eventually they all die, and this is the only place for them to stay until the house is finished, because one of them (the father) has a secret, he is in fact a serial killer. I liked the story a lot (if it had happened to me I would have been scared, I don't know why). The music is very good and there is a funny part in the beginning, so it can not be bad. As I said, the movie was good, but not worth seeing it unless you want to watch a cheap horror, but for those who are looking for a horror movie or just want to see a good one, it is worth a try. _______________________________________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the best of the lot.  The script by Andrew Lippa is the perfect marriage of the two most unappealing qualities of the Hollywood industry: stupidity and hypocrisy. The characters are two extremes of this hypocrisy: the naive and shallow Hollywood starlet who has a crush on Mr. Rourke, who is more interested in her career and who never even thinks about the consequences of his actions; and Mr. Rock, the self-possessed, rich, white, conservative, Hollywood superstar who believes he deserves more money and more money only when he is acting his part.  The movie ends on a negative note.  Rourke has been arrested in California for being in a hotel room with some guys. He goes to prison and, when he gets out, he finds the world in ruins.   This movie also has a special place in my heart because it was my first "bad movie" of 1988. It was such a good time and one that everyone has in their collection that, when we're old, we might be able to look back on it with pride. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________ After I finished watching the first part of the new Rocky trilogy at the cinema I went to the movies. I can't remember which Rocky movie it was but it was either a bad Rocky movie or it was a bad Roddy Piper movie so I went in with an open mind. Rocky Balboa does a bunch of bad things and eventually gets busted but what I really liked about the first half was the character development and the fact that Rocky was always trying to do the right thing in the right way and always wanting to do right by the person he was trying to help. The movie was also not very good and as I said I was expecting something a little better and it was so much better than that. It was so bad I was really shocked and I could not stop laughing. In the final 20 minutes of the movie I actually began to feel bad for Rocky which I probably shouldn't because it was pretty bad but I am actually glad that it was over because I don't think I would like to be in that kind of a situation.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________ I watched this movie just over a week ago. It is based on a book of the same name that is not as good as its reputation. I don't really know how it could have gotten a green light. I guess they couldn't get past some of the problems it had. The film does have its upsides, and it has a good set-up at the beginning, which leads to an interesting situation in the film. However, the story has an unfortunate ending, which is really strange for a film that is based upon a book. The plot is predictable as well. I'm glad there is a sequel to this movie, because I really wanted to see where the story was going to go. The characters don't feel like they have depth, and I found the story to be completely predictable. I really enjoyed the scenes that were on the ship that had to do with Captain Rainsford. I enjoyed watching his story unfold, and when he finally found out about the situation he was in, I felt bad for him. I wasn't happy that this movie ended on a bad note, because it doesn't leave you wanting to come back to see the next installment. It's like the movie just gave up, and you can't even say good-bye. ______________________________________________ Review from a fan of the book: ______________________________________________________________________ After the events of the novel The Good Lieutenant, the crew of the USS Kiska find themselves trapped on a deserted planet.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So I don't think it is a good movie. For me it is too close to what I saw from this director back in 2005 and the remake... the only difference is that the remake wasn't so good and this movie is even less. I don''t really like the acting and the acting is by all means not the best... the movie is too predictable and predictable. I mean, even the main character, a man in his sixties who is working as a cleaner, seems to know exactly what is going to happen and it does. It is very sad when he tells his best friend about the accident. It was very sad to see his friend just sitting there... sad and scared. All of the emotions are there, the sadness, the fears... everything! It is sad that the movie doesn''t focus on the character and it should've done... the character is stupid but he is so much like the man I saw in the first movie. The acting was also pathetic, you know, when all of the other characters come together and just act like fools... I just cannot understand it... I don' think this movie could have been better than the first but... it is still a very sad and weak movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched the first half of this as the kids and I thought it was great. I liked the kids who were the only ones who understood the science behind their "art". The first half had me on the edge of my seat! The second half didn't go as far into the science as I thought, but then the movie had gotten to be too big for its britches. It was not bad for a 2 hr 30 min film, but it just didn't seem as good as I saw in the beginning!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A terrible story about a dog and a man with no imagination. The bad guy in this movie is called "Bobby." He is a sadistic man who wants to use the dogs as soldiers. The dog is only allowed to bark and to walk around, and even then, he will only bark when commanded to do so. One time he had the dogs go into a lake. He has them climb out and do his bidding until he can't. He lets them go and walks over to a big tree to talk to a bird. The movie is about the dog that tries to help the man out. Unfortunately for him, he is the victim of the very man he is trying to help. This film is awful but if you like your dogs barking, then by all means, go see this. Do yourself a favor and save this to watch on a rainy day in your front yard when you have a full stomach.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. This is a terrible movie that is just silly and pointless, there is one or two amusing moments, but after the first 10 minutes it becomes predictable.  Helpful and stupid, I'm almost embarrassed for the poor acting in this movie. The only positive thing about the movie is the ending, which is worth watching. However, it is not a very funny or inspiring ending to a horrible movie. That's all I can say about this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A boring and very uninspired film. I am not saying the film is bad. The story is good. The art is excellent. The acting is good too. But the execution is terrible. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie is so bad, that it is funny, yet the film has nothing to do with the story. Even when the bad guys are doing horrible things to innocent people, the hero goes to their rescue and kills them. The hero is always looking for the bad guy. So when the evil boss is trying to kill a young boy, the good guy shoots the boss in a rage and kills the boss. And after the whole movie we are not even sure what is going on. We see a bunch of people getting ready for a party. A good guy and two bad guys and a couple of girls. They are getting ready to get their stuff together to leave. The good guy is being followed by two bad guy, one of them looks like a girl and a little girl is following him. When they finally leave the party, they are followed by one of the girls. He is a woman who looks just like a little kid. And then she is shot in a cold blood in front of the hero. The evil boss has made a deal with a little boy to make a child his slave. It is a girl, named Mary, who does not know that she is a slave, and is happy to be a slave to the good boss. It will be a happy and nice life for her for the rest of her life. The bad guys have a plan for this to happen, and kill the hero before he can get to the bad boss. But then there is one more person. A man who is in love with a girl. He wants a child, a boy to be his slave and a girl to be in love and married to his brother. The girl is being held captive at the evil, evil, boss's house. The boy has to save the girl. But, he gets his revenge on the evil man. That is the story so far. You can see how the story is a good story. But when you come to the ending of the movie, all of the bad things are happening in the story! You will laugh a lot during the ending, when you see what happens. The ending is just wrong. It seems like a bad idea. The film is like a movie made by a child! The villain comes to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film has no plot at all. There is no main characters or story. In fact I could find no story at all as the events happen as if the movie is a joke. It is basically one movie about two characters, a man who kills things he does not understand, a priest who kills people he does understand. It doesn't have any plot so we know this is nothing like a movie. When the priest kills, he does so in some sort of way, some sort a self killing, while the man kills his victims with his hands and feet. He takes it out like it is not real or because he can't. The movie even has no special effects or anything. No special effects, no music, nothing that would make the movie more interesting, but I am only one person.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had no idea what to expect with this movie.  The trailer looked pretty cool. Â It is a dark tale with lots of action.   The movie starts out with a woman who gets kidnapped and is kept prisoner in a man's house.    She must fight to get out of the house to rescue her sister.  I don't want to give too much away about the plot but it is a long one.  There is a lot going on.  The plot is good.  It is pretty simple.  One of the girls escapes and the man keeps chasing her.  They eventually meet in an airplane but the girl decides that they must go to a house in the desert instead.  I found this plot to be very enjoyable.  This was definitely a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1. There is a scene where a little boy is playing outside, holding a doll on his knees in his hands and waving to the passing trucks that drive past his window, singing a little song.   2. A little man, who is a bit like a little kid (or, rather, a little man with a gun), comes up to the boy and asks him to show him his gun. The boy turns the gun to him, asks if he wants to be hit with the gun and then he shoots the man.   at first I thought it was a very sad scene. It shows a kid playing outside being a little gun in a kid's game, and then we see the little gun shot the victim and he lays there dying. Then he hears a voice in his head saying "kill him", because he has made a mistake by showing off the gun. Then we see his parents coming down the street, coming to his door. The camera pans over them and the little man is walking into the house in the shadow of the parents.   (hide spoiler)  There is a horrible car crash that is shown on the news. There are a lot of casualties, but we don't know what they are in that scene. There's also a scene of a boy watching his father get shot while on a bike.   to sum up:I can't recommend this movie to anyone except for those who want to know what a horrible little boy's first movie is like. The movie, as usual, is about a little child and his adventures, and is a very typical little boy movie. The story's about a kid that likes to shoot with a little toy gun.The movie is good, but not very good. The plot is about how this kid has made some mistakes and he wants his parents to teach him a lesson, so he does an adult trick that is very childish and shows off the toy gun a bit to his father. But later they tell him he doesn't need to do this anymore, and that he should behave like an adult and learn how to handle real guns. The next scene is the boy shooting the adult he shows off that gun to, and he gets shot, and we see what the adult looks like. But, like before, we're never told that the boy was shot, we just see a blood spatter, and it's only shown as blood spurting out of the wound. But we know that he was shot in the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think you've just seen The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. It's the only "comedic" story of the last fifteen years. Walter M. Mitty is a struggling actor who tries to get work by pretending to be a rich family man. His parents (Bruce Willis and Robin Williams) live together and spend a lot of time at the beach. This leads to a lot (well, too much) of sexual intercourse on the ocean. Miki and Walter are two of many "sneaky" people living off the coast. The beach looks more like a park than a beach and there are "sitting ducks" everywhere! In fact, the entire movie is a story of one sleazy "party" on the beach who is in a terrible mood. In the heat of the moment, he grabs Miki's breasts in what is either a sexual assault or an act of self-harm. When he starts to masturbate, Miki says "That's enough" and tries to leave. The crowd shouts "You're not leaving." Walter refuses to let go. Eventually, the police show up, the crowd explodes, and Walter is arrested for the "assault" and given a big fine. Mimi and the other people on the shore come down and help Walter out, then have sex for a while. The main characters are a couple who live together, a little girl who can't swim (because she's not a "real" girl) who goes fishing every other weekend with her dad, the "silly" doctor who's a doctor, and the rest of the audience. Micky Rourke is one of the funniest actors I've seen, and he's always great as Walter. There's even a scene at the end where everyone in the movie (including Miki) has to get off the beach (and everyone is covered in sunscreen) to save the day. I'm not a huge fan of this movie, but it's fun. The last fifteen minutes could have been extended but, unfortunately, they didn't.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have watched this movie numerous times since its release, everytime I liked it even better it got worse.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is this whole "we never hear the ending" thing going on, and the only reason they get a close up view is because the cameraman is a really stupid idiot. His face is so silly, it's actually ridiculous. I guess that's why I was hoping we would hear the end of the movie.   And I don't know how they could have made the film better. They tried to make a more romantic comedy, but it's not a good one at all. It's a complete mess. I don`t know why the director went for a movie that has a girl, in a dress, fighting aliens. I'm not sure if this is why the movie was so poorly liked. There just wasn't anything about this movie to recommend to anybody, but that's okay because I guess there is nothing more to say. It just doesn't work and just comes across as a cheap movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst thing about this movie is the director's lack of care for the plot line. This is actually a bad idea as the film is just bad all around. There is absolutely no character development or plot. In fact the film tries so hard to create a mystery. I don't mind mystery but the plot in this film is ridiculous. I know the main character is from New York and she has to try to take her new job in L.A. by hiding from her abusive boyfriend and her father. The film is filled with plot holes and no real tension. In the end the ending felt contrived with the fact that there were so many twists and turns.   In spite of its problems the film was a lot of fun. In my opinion this is a must see for anyone who wants to see a great director do a cheap cheap budget horror movie.  A little bit of help if you think you might need it!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been trying for years to get around to seeing this. It's a weird, wonderful movie.   It stars one of the most interesting and enigmatic performers in Hollywood - Tom Hanks. The story itself is a masterpiece of filmmaking and a masterpiece in storytelling.  There are many great stories in Hollywood.  To have a star like that play a role like that - that's pretty special. But I don't know if he ever plays a role in the Hollywood movies again. I saw this with my father, an old hand at old Hollywood movies. As an old film buff, he thought it was a classic.  The one drawback to this movie is that there is not one memorable scene. There is an interesting one in which a very interesting character tells a bad joke. After the joke is over, he explains that he is a bad actor and he is only funny because he can get away with it. But that doesn't stop his bad performances from coming out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would not recommend this.  It's one of the worst movies I have seen, in fact the only bad movie I have ever seen is the terrible "The Fly" by the great  Alfred Hitchcock.  If anything can be said for this movie, it's that it's one more movie that makes us wonder where on earth we've been. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film opens with a scene of two sisters trying to get up a storm to impress their uncle. I never even knew the sisters were related and I just assumed they were sisters.  When it comes to sex this film is a complete bore.   The sex is so bad it should be a horror film.  They take place in a house which looks like a trailer.  The sister in the trailer starts sucking a guy's d*ck.  She is a pretty blonde and the guy is a real stud in bed and I am sure he gave his sister a great sucking lesson.  It is not enough and the sister finishes by blowing the guy right before he blows his load.  He then has to take her clothes off because he is covered in cum.  I cannot believe my poor eyes!  The sex scenes are a huge bore. The sister sucks a guy in her trailer. There is only one scene in the entire film that looks like it was filmed outside.  You would think that someone would not put the girls in a trailer where they could not see each other.  It is also funny to me that the trailer opens with two people dancing in a kitchen and then they put a woman (the sister) who is not wearing panties and a man who is wearing socks in the bathroom where the girls are.  We also have a scene with two young women in a truck.    There are a few scenes that make me chuckle (which is rare for a horror movie).   However, this film makes me wish for the end of time.  All of the girls look like they have a thing for one another and I always thought they looked like they had some mutual attraction.  There is one scene where a man is walking past two girls having sex.  This is not one of my favorite sex scenes ever and I never want to see more of it!  I know the film is terrible but I want to watch one or two of the scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   ... a poor, boring, poorly written, forgettable movie about the death of the King of Siam.   There are a few scenes where we see King Mongkut (Benny Chow) visiting an old friend in Thailand. While there they are attacked by a monkey but the King uses his magic sword to protect them. The Monkey jumps at the King and tries to stab him and the King's magic sword then hits the Monkey and cuts his neck. After the death, the King is buried with his old pal Benny Chow and Benny is then crowned King of Thailand.  I didn't like it at all and could've easily skipped over it. I didn´t see a single reason to watch this movie and I found a dozen reasons why I should not bother with it.  Rating: The rating is for the US market (the movie was made in Thailand). I don't know what it was rated in other markets but I've read that it was very poorly received. It also seems to be one of the most forgotten Thai movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's the sequel to a horrible movie, not because it's bad but because the sequel is bad and it was made only to cash in on the success of the original. We start with a guy named Bill Murray in a movie that is so bad he makes it look good. It seems like a bad joke to us at first but then we see he's not joking. The film takes place in a country that is a little bit weird, some of the country people have weird hair and clothes but in the end it's a country where people don't have any sense of humor. The story is about a little boy who is sent to school by his father to make some kind of report. He gets to the school and finds a teacher that is not a woman but a guy with red eyes. He begins to make a report about what is going on at school but when he meets a little girl who is a boy who thinks he is a girl. He is a complete fool and thinks she is a man and she can talk like a woman. He soon learns it isn't true but she is just a girl that thinks she can change into a man. Her father runs off to the woods to chase a man with red hair. The little boy and the man with the red eyes meet in the middle and it's all a mess. The man with eyes turns out to be a demon but even though they get into a fight that ends with the man's death he is unable to kill the little boy. The girl escapes but they never see each other again. It's only then that the story of the little girl begins. After she escapes and the little guy returns to the house to get the woman from the woods. We discover the woman is pregnant and the guy does not want to kill her so he takes her into the woods and kills her. That's a long way for a bad sequel! But it gets better. The guy with the eyes, whom we thought was just a crazy man, is actually a ghost. He comes back to life and tries to kill him as well. Now there's no way the guy could actually kill the ghost because he's in a body bag with no head. But he could take over his body like a zombie and try to kill everyone. The two of them finally battle the ghost and he is able to take over the body bag of the guy with eyes and take over and make sure the guy's soul goes to hell. That is how it ends.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (I'll let you read the review in question.)   I did enjoy this movie; at no point did I feel that it was all about sex, though some scenes did include some pretty risque material.   Unfortunately, these scenes were only the tip of the iceberg.  And that's not to mention how the story ends.  I have a pretty good idea of the "plot", and I could almost see it in my head - the woman who is obsessed with having sex with a man.  The man she falls in love with - a married one.  There are several "plot" scenes which are pointless; these scenes include an argument between two of the main characters, in which we learn that their husband is a complete creep.  They also have sex, and it is pretty obvious where they're going to spend eternity,   After sex, the two are "caught" by a woman who has a crush on them.  She has a husband who is a "lover of women", and they're supposed to meet to discuss the possibility of marrying.  But the woman is a real sleazebag.  What a joke of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst thing about it, and one of my personal complaints, was the acting. Everyone I've been talking to has commented on how the acting is good, and yet I felt like the characters were not even believable. You might say a little bit of a plot development was made, but that is an easy fix. The best part is the last half hour when all the "bad guys" have been "died" and there is an ending to the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is horrible. The film takes a couple of months to reach its conclusion, and I'm pretty sure at the time the studio was worried that it wouldn't work at all. So in the final couple of minutes of the movie, the camera moves up to the character's bedroom window. The girl's husband is watching the couple from behind a sheet of black paper, and the camera just stays on him. In one final shot, it looks like the husband is going to get out of the frame, and then it cuts to some shots of the apartment. The husband still looks like he's standing behind the sheet, the girl looks as if she's about to fall down off her bed, and there's a closeup of her face and it looks horribly deformed. I had an unpleasant experience while watching this film.

Well, this movie takes place in the same area as The Omens but not as much as that movie. I love this movie, it was entertaining enough and the ending really made it memorable, I was so sad to see that old girl go, I would have hoped she'd live longer but I guess the movie only takes you so far.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie in the world    It's an American crime movie which is about a corrupt cop killing a young girl, who was just in a car accident and the cop killed her. I hate cops   The cop is an   lunatic, and he has a gun hidden under his shirt   I think   to make a bad  movie, but this movie is the biggest crime against cinema ever made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't help but wonder if it ever occurred to anyone in the writer's room that someone else might like this movie.   This was supposed to be a horror movie that featured a man who is in a house with an evil, supernatural evil that's trying to kill the family.  What happened is that the writer made this movie before he ever met the people he was making this movie with!  He didn't know anything about these people or their lives before he started the movie!   Then he goes off and has a party and he takes some pictures and then he sends those photos to the writer of the movie. He thought the guy was going to write a book about this event but then he goes out and talks about it with people.  He says that the house was supposedly haunted.   When a little girl gets killed, the writer and other people say the house is haunted, and the writer keeps telling people there are spirits in the house!  The writer even says it's true when he thinks it's a joke and he tells the writer he thinks he's having a bad dream.  When the writer comes back to the house and he finds out that the little girl was shot and killed, he gets extremely angry and starts banging the windows of the house.  In the end, a ghost is seen and a man says he wants to kill him because the man is evil and is trying to hurt his daughter!  So there you have it!  I think a lot of people didn't appreciate the story line in this movie, but I think that movie was a lot better than it should have been. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am disappointed because of the great potential this movie had. In my view, its a very good movie but its very obvious in the beginning where its been done that the budget is very low. It just doesn't need it to reach the highest level of visual quality you could expect. The acting is okay, I would have expected better, especially from a female character which is never given a role and the director doesn't bother to keep the female in the movie, he just lets her wander around. Its a shame because this could have been a great movie if it had been done differently. Plot:        The story begins with two men. One is a man in his 20's. He's the boss of the company (they operate in a small town, we see the small town and its population). The other is a young man in the early 20's with a girl in his arms. They are heading for the lake on a motorcycle, where the young man is going to get some fish (this is a reference to an old western). Both men are heading toward the lake to kill a fish to get to the water's surface so they can go to a hotel. While they are riding they get a call from a girl, she is in a cave who needs help. Both men ride on. Soon they are lost and they run out of gas on the way back. They find a road which leads them to a town and they see a town with a train. When the train is leaving the town they stop the train to save it. But the train leaves without them and they don't know where it's going. They then see a small hotel on the train's right side with a man coming out. When they go to him he says he is a stranger but they are friends. He says he saw the young woman coming and she needs help and can she come to his hotel because she's injured and needs to be taken back to the hospital. After a few minutes of talking they leave the train and enter the hotel where he says they will find her. The man goes out and they start to search through the room. The young man then finds an arrow. He is told to give this to the man who is searching the room but the woman wants him to leave his girlfriend with him. He refuses. When he leaves the room they see the woman and ask to search again. This time the man doesn't leave the young girl with him and she
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a good movie but its not my cup of tea.   Its a well-made little film.  You could tell from the start that this is a well acted comedy with good jokes and very good dialogs.  The story is a variation on a traditional tale of a father being sent by God to protect his son and his son's love.  I found the humor to be quite clever at times and the action to be funny too.  While I have never seen the original tale, I do remember it being pretty similar.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie of the year.   In my mind, it's one of those films that was written as a low-budget movie to get attention.  They needed to make the audience like the movie, but it really doesn't work at all.  It has a good story and it has some good acting, but the story is so badly written and is not interesting at all, and the acting is bad at the same time.  I didn't expect that they would put a man in a box and make him play a guitar.  The plot just doesn't make sense at all (the main characters are always going to find something else to do than to work on the guitar), but the acting and the music does make it enjoyable.  This is one of the worst movies of the 90s, in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed to find this film. It's not bad, it's just not well done. I was hoping for some comedy, but in the end we are simply treated to a series of boring situations where everything starts to go badly. There are a few good comedy moments and some good acting, but none that I found anything worth seeing. The main characters are bland at best and completely unlikeable. I wish it had been a bad comedy, not an action-heavy bad movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the movie: the characters are all black so i didn't know who to root for or who to hate and when the movie actually started i expected it to be another racist black on white or something but the movie just played out like a bad joke and then it got worse. I mean it was supposed to be the 90s and it is not as bad as it looks and it does have a strong black and white theme but for it to go so far as to make a black girl the best friend of a white guy is so wrong and racist and i wish the movie would have been better. I would have loved a nice black girl friend who didn't treat me like garbage. If i could give this movie an 0 i would.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not sure why a movie like this is made. For the most part, it is poorly written and the acting is laughable.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well I'm going to be blunt here. The movie is a joke. I'd say it's an hour long but I'm still watching it from the beginning to the end. You know when a movie starts off okay then everything goes from bad to worse? I know this is a comedy and if you get a laugh out of it you might like the movie but I can't laugh on it. So basically I'd give it 3 stars.

The problem was that the filmmakers didn't have to make the worst movie they could, because they already made the worst script ever put on film, a bad script that is as boring and predictable as the first "Terminator" movie.  It's very rare for a film to be this bad that audiences actually want to sit through it. Not only is it a terrible film, but also a poorly acted one: you can't help but laugh out loud at the movie, even though it is very predictable and has no surprises. Every character is stereotypical, yet they're acting it out perfectly because they're playing the part, which would be impossible to do otherwise. At times the acting is good enough to make you think the actors are actually having fun with this; however they don't do anything new with the role and they never go beyond what they were asked to do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst bad movies I've seen, maybe ever. The story is as boring as the first trailer. The only thing interesting is the main character, who I couldn't even sympathize with at all. I thought he was the most pathetic guy, just talking about nothing. The movie really isn't that bad. It is just stupid. The art is good but the music is bad. The characters are just a bunch of stereotypes that I don't like in any way. You can't even take one movie that only lasts about 30 minutes and call it a comedy, you know.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved this movie. It was so good that I could not tear myself away for an hour or two. I thought that the movie would be over by the end of the movie but it didn't end there. I love how they went back to the old school and made the movie a little more violent. The only real problem was the actor's accent was awful. Not bad, but it just was not good at all. The music was amazing and it was so awesome at some moments. It made me cry. The end was awesome. The movie did not hold any punches and I think that is what they were going for, and it did an amazing job with that. There are too many good movies that are out today but this is a must see film. I will recommend it to any fan of movies to see.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I didn't give this a 1 star is that the music is pretty mediocre. The story of an old man who can't live a day without drinking a bottle of whiskey has an interesting premise. There is no other reason why this movie could not have been a winner, it really has the potential to be. I have heard great things about the music and this is just a very mediocre performance by it. The acting is not bad and the script has a nice twist ending but everything else is just so bad that I am not sure why I ever bothered to go to the cinema this movie was worth a watch but just was not meant to be a winner.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not a big sci-fi movie fan, but I am a huge sci-fistic fan.  A beautiful movie which is not a movie at all.  There is little to talk about.  The script is completely incomprehensible ( I was looking for a script of this level for years).  The story is simply horrible, and so the plot goes from stupid to even more stupid, not to mention the ending.  I really wonder why no one saw this before.  If a movie is worth watching, it should not be a bad one.  For all of you who are so into this stuff, watch this movie instead of watching The Abyss. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this at a theater once and I can understand why they didn't make a sequel. I have no idea what was happening. I am not a fan of the original movie or this one. A woman's daughter gets kidnapped and the main character goes out to save her. The guy who abducted the daughter has some kind of connection to the kidnapper so the kidnappers tries to kidnap the daughter's fiance and the girl's father. It was really dumb and a total waste of my time. I didn't see a single second of it.  This is the scene where I can't believe I'm reading this:  The main character tells the fiance of the girl he is rescuing not to be scared and just go down and they are going to escape the bad guy.  I'm just laughing at it right now. I mean, the guy was an idiot to even think about going down into the water. You do not want to go down into a water filled with sharks.   There are two different versions of this movie on VOD and on DVD. I saw it on VH-1 and the special effects were crap.  The DVD version is much better, but has some annoying scenes. But it is still a bad video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most depressing film ever!   I hated this film so much that I don't think I'll ever watch it again! It is so depressing that it makes your heart fall from your chest.   It is all about death, death, and the loss of life!  The main character doesn't get a happy ending at the end, she dies in the second act!  I think she was meant to die because the movie was made to be a children's movie, but I believe it was made for adults too!  Even the most depressing movie of the year!  If you don't have a heart to go through this film you don´t deserve to be alive!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________ When I was a kid, I was always told that the first act is the most important, the climax the most spectacular, and the movie's final few moments the most moving. I loved this movie, but I wasn't the least bit moved by the final scene, which was more than a bit melodramatic. I know that this was a very different movie from my earlier favorites like 'Pennywise's Clown', and there's no doubt that it stands on its own, but it's still not a great movie. This is a film in which the scares are mostly on the screen, with a few notable exceptions in some sequences. There are a few moments where something about the story makes me feel like I'm actually scared, but by and large the movie is rather uninspired. It had me convinced I was watching a cheap, cheap horror movie, and it really wasn't that. I'm not sure how much I'll miss the movie by the time it's out on DVD, since the DVD features a different version (which, I believe, was a direct cut), but it sure was pretty. But I'm always happy to see a Wes Craven film, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to go in for a cheap horror flick. Just remember to pack a towel. - February 26, 2009One for the shelf, not on it  Reviewer: gregorie - favorite favorite favorite - January 9, 2009  Subject: I agree with most......but the final battle was a bit much, and not enough for me to call it a good movie. However, it is a very interesting film to see one's first experience with the creepy clown. Although I find it an effective concept, I think the final sequence took the film in a direction I would not have liked. And it does have some good scare sequences, but they're too few to really make me give it an A. - January 19, 2009I agree with  Rating: C - January 10, 2009[...]
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a cheap, mediocre, and poorly done movie with some very interesting ideas in a boring setting.  The story is simple: a little girl wants to get her favorite stuffed animal to the top of a mountain to give it a proper burial, so she goes to search for it in the woods, which she is not allowed to do by her father.   She makes a bunch of mistakes and meets a group of strangers who try to help her by giving her an unusual gift: a strange doll that can turn into a wolf if the little girl puts its nose into the fire at night (it would be quite an effect if that actually worked).    There's really nothing wrong with this film; it's only really interesting when viewed through the lens of the book.  The Story of the Wolf-Dog:   This is a fascinating story about a little boy, who loses his toy wolf-dog, and falls in love with a wolf-girl. The main character is not a nice guy; he takes it very hard when he realizes what he has done to his beloved wolf-wolf.  The movie is very good at depicting the relationship between this character and a wolf - wolf-daughter.  But at the end, the film just feels like it's missing something.  It may be true that the wolf-father is a very bad guy who does terrible things, but that doesn't make him a bad actor, just a bad father.     What makes a good actor:  If you've ever seen a movie in which the actor's name is not the first one mentioned at the start of the film, you haven't seen a great movie.  In this case, the main character's name isn't even mentioned until the end of the movie.   This film is a fun, colorful, action-packed tale that has some very good ideas in it, but fails to make the actor playing the wolf feel like the star of the show.    The story is so generic that even the film's tag line "Cue the music, cue the music..." fails to grab your attention.  I could watch this movie over and over again, just to see the wolf turn into the wolf (which is an effect which really only shows up in the original version).  My advice to anyone looking for a cheap movie which has a good idea:  Don't even watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had seen a good, even a great, film based on a great book, and was very excited to see one based on Ayn Rand's work, because it had been a favorite of mine for several years.   It was much more interesting than I had anticipated. I liked the movie for the most part, and I was able to sympathize with Rand's character. She was in a terrible position, but a poor and unloving wife would never make it in the business world (and she lived happily in a cottage!). And so it goes.  But I have my quibbles.  1. I was glad to see a few of her characters come to life, such as Mr. H. P. Lovecraft (a fellow who had a good time talking about his favorite book), and one of the girls, Rose, who was an attractive young lady.  2. I don't know how to classify her character. In Ayn Reed's novel her character was the ideal female, a beautiful woman who liked art and literature. But in the movie it became a parody of the woman who was so far from ideal.  3. Her character also showed me a different view of women--for one thing, she was not all that intelligent; and I thought the role was played by a pretty good actress, but I also thought that the movie portrayed the character badly.  So, I thought that I would give my own personal assessment of the movie, but for the record, it is a good movie, it only took too much away from its source material and I don   like it more than I like The Fountainhead.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was so awful I didn't want to watch it, the script sucked and the plot was as terrible as the movie. I hate horror so bad that I can't even remember what happened, but what I remember is that the people were in a house in the middle of nowhere. Some people were sleeping in an outhouse near the house. Some others were inside the house, some of them were looking at the outside of the house and some of the others were outside. The people were screaming at the people in the house when they tried to wake them up. People were jumping out of the windows, they couldn't get in or out of there. There was a huge tree in front of the people's house and a large fence. It was completely destroyed and the inside walls of the building was completely gone. The fence was hanging on the roof of the outhouse. The man's house was completely ruined. It had a hole in the front wall of the living room. The entire house was all in ruins. One guy who lives in there got lost inside of it. The house was also destroyed. Now here is the worst part, there was a door in the back of the man's living room, the door was a lock. The guy's wife found the keys in their bathroom in her night clothes. She got locked inside of the bedroom by her husband's brother, who was trying to kill her, so her brother broke open the door and raped her. Her daughter was in the bathroom. There wasn't any water in there. She went into the bedroom and tried to get her daughter to go in there, and when she went there she found her mother still there and they fought. It seemed like she was winning. Her mother tried to take the keys out of her daughter's night clothes and she couldn't. She ran out of this house and I just sat there crying.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember this from the 80's, I was probably 12 years old at the time. It's probably the only terrible movie from that decade (not including The Dead Zone).  It's pretty funny and I don't know why I hadn't seen this movie in 20 years.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a young lady who was raped and has become a victim and has to live with this stigma and is not even allowed to live in her hometown because of it. It is a poor movie about a pretty woman who was abused and treated badly and now she is forced to move to a remote house and it is a very long movie about being lonely in this town and about what she can do to feel good again. And it does all this with an interesting plotline. The only thing that really bothered me was that some people in the film seemed to be too fond of the idea of raping women. It was not even a big deal in this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- *** This was a movie I was going to write about if only I didn't find out it was crap. --------------- Okay, so I was walking down the street one day and some kid walks past. I didn�t think much of it at first. It was a hot day and I was wearing nothing but a pair of shorts, a bra, and a pair t-shirt. The kid turned around, and he is about to put the phone down on the sidewalk, and I see that he has a tiny cock sticking out of his pants. He was about to walk away when he decided to stick his hand down his pants and start jerking himself. He kept jerking while I watched, then he reached down and stuck his fingers in his mouth and started slurping down his pre-cum. When he pulled his fingers out he was dripping wet. I had to walk up to him and slap a wet wet kiss on his mouth. Then I walked away. I was so hot I didnít want to go back in the park. I looked at myself in the bathroom mirror and I looked like a prostitute from the red light district. So, I went to the local sex shop and asked for some sex toys. Then at about 2pm I got to my friendís apartment and walked in to find him there with his eyes closed, with a huge dildo propped up to his head and his hands stuffed in his panties. "Are you awake, dude?" I asked. "No, what?" He replied. "I thought you were in the house," I said. "Yes, I was, but I was looking at some pornography. What is that stuff?" "Itís just some videos on a PC, they are just sex scenes, all you have to do is sit there and watch." "I donít think I can." Then I saw him reach for his pants, and as he went down they flew off, and there was a huge fucking dildo shoved into his ass. When his cheeks were a little puffy from the ass-pounding he was giving, I grabbed his hands and jerked him hard. "Heehee, you are really hard, arenít you?" He was just getting off the computer when I grabbed him. "Cmon, fuck me! Fuck me! Give me a real cock!" "Sure," I say, and walk out of the bedroom to get my own. I go back to the living room
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a lot of crap movies in my time, so I have never heard a bad one. So when I saw this one on TV it made me curious enough to see it again and finally I did! I've been waiting to see that movie since I saw the trailer for it on TV, but it has to be said that this movie is crap. I wouldn't even watch this for the trailer. I understand that it's a parody of the "cute" romantic comedy movies of the 1930's, but that doesn't make the film itself funny. That is a joke already made in this one. The movie is one long shot, so to make it more interesting we get to see a lot more people. The other bad part about this movie are the dialogue. I guess they are trying to show the love story between two girls that we already know. I can't believe they kept calling these two, "Bella and Mabel" instead of Bessie and Mildred. They would be better off calling these three "Bessie, Mildred and Bessy" because all three of them are dead.   As a comedy, this movie isn't very funny at all. It is kind of a mess to watch and has a ridiculous story. I don't care about anything in this movie and I thought it was a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I love this movie.   It is based on a true story, a story told by the daughter of an early pioneer in the area and I think this movie did the job of trying to get her story down.  It tells of a couple in that area in the 1930s who were the only white family in a very small area.  They were very poor, they lived in a log cabin and they were the ones who tended to the animals.  The movie does a fine job of showing the isolation this area was in and also how there are a bunch of white miners who moved to the area after the gold was discovered in the 1890s.  There were only a few white people in all of the area, the log cabin was set up for one person to live in.  As the story goes, one day a little boy came along and he fell in love with the girl and they had a child.  I found this to be quite entertaining and it did a good job in showing the area. I am looking forward to another movie made about the story and I hope one day the people at Paramount will see the value that they can add to the business.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was awful! I don't even like horror movies, but when this happened I was horrified.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoy this movie, and I wish I can see it again.   It is not a great movie, in fact it is pretty bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hmmm... The movie's opening scene was all "I'm gonna kick your ass." And yeah, I was thinking that when the plot got going.  The story is pretty simplistic:  This is one of those dumb, unoriginal ideas where a young woman (Annette Funicello) is taken back to her past and she finds that she has been a prostitute and a mistress, and, well, everything is just awful.  So that's pretty much the premise.    The movie does a very poor job of setting this up because we see everything in reverse.  It starts out with the good old days (not in a good way), then has her go back in time and she ends up being a bad girl, but she still finds herself in an abusive relationship.  The plot is so thin that it's hard to get an emotional attachment to it because what's happening is just so damn predictable.  That being said, the writing is fairly good for a low budget movie of this vintage.  I can't even remember what the plot is because of how forgettable it is but the movie is at least entertaining and enjoyable.  Now I won't spoil anything, so if you haven't seen the movie, it's best not to read what follows.  When you come across a movie that's based on a book by Raymond Chandler, I recommend watching it.  There are some great scenes throughout the movie and if it's all you've ever seen, then you may have some of those scenes on the tip of your tongue.  If, like me, you've seen a dozen other Chandler movies, then a good number of those were just straight up bad movies.  However, the one exception is the opening scene in this movie.  Here, we get a very different style to the material that the plot does.  This movie has a very, very slow build up to a dramatic moment.  You see the protagonist (Chandler) get arrested by an asshole cop who is trying to steal money from the hotel he works at (The Pink Elephant).  There's an obvious reason for why the cop is trying something like this.  He wants to extort money from an owner of a brothel to get out of bad debts he has with the company that builds the brothel.  But Chandler, who has been the girlfriend/girlfriend of this guy, doesn't seem to be too thrilled to the idea and gets defensive
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main thing that makes a bad film is, well, a bad thing, a thing that has gone from good to bad. The story is told in an 80's style. There is a great scene where a kid (Bren) has a dream about getting a girlfriend (Fiona) but she has a huge scar on her forehead, making it hard for him to get a date or even a kiss (the kid is in love, doesn't get much romance in American movies). The kid goes to a psychologist (Dr. Jones) because he thinks this thing is a sign from God. Well, you can't just change your appearance or give a huge growth spurt if you're about 10 years old (I guess) and look like a monster. Anyway, the boy is told about a cure for the scar, which he's told is made of the blood of a rare plant that grows in a forbidden place in a desert. The boy goes there only to find out this strange desert thing grows in some very dangerous places. And so a story that was good in the original (if it hadn't been cut so early) is suddenly ruined because the people who make the movie didn't care enough to get it right in the first place.   I could go on with examples. The movie doesn't have anything interesting to say. It just tells the same old story and I'm pretty sure it was made like that in the 80s, to sell it in the US. It's not bad, but it's not anything I want to see again either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first part of this movie is nothing but a mess. The plot is a non-story (to begin with). The movie begins with a young girl named Aysha (Cecelia Costabile) trying to hide her virginity from her friend and a teacher (Aristides D'Antonio). Ayshha wants to get rid of a boy named Kavous (Jai Ramesh) as he has been unfaithful to her. When they meet for the first time, she tells him that she wants a big family like her grandmother, with a big house and several cars. Kavious seems to be too cool and calm for a first meeting, but Ayshas tries to force the truth to him... Ayshesh tries to seduce Kavoust, and ends up in a fight which ends with the girl being hospitalized. She decides to run away but Kavoos decides to continue the pursuit. Soon, Aysis starts to realize that she has been in love with Kavos ever since she began seeing him. Eventually, Ayla (Carla del Ponte) gets involved in this tale, and Kavoose gets her pregnant. Now, Kavoeose takes care of his baby and Aylas gets her a job in a bakery (which is run by her brother, Sushil). Aylies attempts to get revenge by using all of her skills to take revenge against the bad guys, who she thinks are being taken advantage of by Kavooose.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is the only film I will ever get sick and tired of watching. It was terrible, and so are most of the other horror movies made by this studio, but even those are more tolerable than the one we got here.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a masterpiece of cinematic laziness, with a lead actor in a long-dead era being given the benefit of every doubt by Hollywood, and still managed to be as cringe worthy as a movie can be. The plot is that a man and his grandson who can talk to horses have a family ranch, which is raided by a group of bad guys. The grandfather has to try and get the son to save the life of his grandfather by getting him to kill the bad guys, while the son, who is supposed to be the future ruler of the ranch, does his best to not kill any one, but actually talk to all of them, to make sure their intentions are good.   You can see how this movie is going to fall apart, at a certain point.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first act of this movie is a good one, with a very good performance by Richard Roundtree, and a really fun story by Robert Siodmak.  After the first act, I wasn't too fond of the film, mainly because I felt that the story had been simplified a bit too much, and because a lot of the plot holes were exposed.  I also found that the pacing was a little too slow, and that the whole movie was a bit long for what the film has to offer.    The second act is better and the characters more interesting.  As for the movie itself, I find it boring.  My final score is going to be one of three out of three stars.  It is an entertaining and entertainingly paced movie, but not for long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I came into this film expecting another mediocre B movie from some guy named Michael Bay...and boy was I disappointed!   Bay's first movie was really good but there were moments where the movie was completely out of control.   The movie even had a lot of sex and nudity in the beginning that made it feel like it was going to be a really good summer movie for kids.  Instead it seemed to be like a cheap attempt at making a B movie for adults.  Bay tried to do a couple of really stupid things:  1.) He decided to keep the cast all Caucasian with the exception of the black teen (who plays the lead in the movie). 2.) He kept the bad guy from killing off any of the characters in the opening sequence (even the kid).   I was disappointed in that Bay didn't go after the kids in the way he could have.  That would have been a great movie.  However, I did enjoy watching the evil bad guy that Bay wanted to use as his "bad guy".  It took a bit of effort (as the movie could have been much better) but he had the right idea and got a lot out of the situation...and at times it seemed that Bay really wanted the movie to get out of hand.  Unfortunately, a couple more stupid things ruined the movie. First of all was the dialogue.  It was extremely cheesy and silly.  The characters all spoke in a very monotone voice. The dialogue was just a couple lines at most (usually just one or two in a scene). It was funny and very bad.  Second of all (this is what really ruined the rest of the movie): The first "monster" that is attacking the characters (and the bad guys) is actually a bad guy.  A real bad guy!  His name is Tritos.  He is the baddie in all those movies that Bay wants to make as bad movies.  This guy has the following stats:  - Size: 8'1"  - Body weight: 150 lbs  - Hair color: Black.  - Tits: 2  - Mouth hole: 3/4.  If you want a monster that looks just like a bad dude then Trito is your man.  Tritofall is a great idea that Bay has not used much in his previous movies. It would be interesting to see a bad movies with a black guy as the bad dude
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am glad I finally bought the movie version. This movie has almost nothing going on but you will have to be there to see it. There was about 3 minutes in the end where the guy was at a house looking for the woman. At the house there was not only no woman but the woman wasn't even there! We were treated to a couple of characters that have a strange history. These characters are in the house for 2 days and they try to find out if any one is living there. They even get someone to be their roommate for 2 weeks. At first they just think that the woman is gone and so they have to try to make things look like a robbery and it works! But there are a lot of strange things that happens and when they return home we learn that the man was a killer for the state of Missouri! His real name was Robert John Rau and he was a very violent man. He committed a rape that resulted in killing a pregnant woman. Then one night in May of 1852 he was found hanging from a tree!  As a whole this movie is not as good as it seems. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't good and it didn't need to be. It was a poor re-cut of a pretty good film and it just got worse and worse.   Not much happened in the movie which is a little odd since it was supposed to be a horror flick.  The actors were good though.  I liked the concept, it was like one of those old fashioned soap operas in which you get to see the characters' lives through the eyes of the mother who raised them and then one day it all blows up in their faces.  This was all about a girl named Alice who loves to make dolls and she is an art student who works with a young boy named George (who was played by a great actor who I think I know). She's always happy and it's not until the day that her father dies suddenly that she discovers that there's a witch living in her attic.  It turns out that it's this evil witch who is trying to bring down Alice and her friend George with a book containing horrible images from the past that are meant to give people nightmares. But the whole movie is a setup for the ending.  You have to know that the movie was supposed be a kind of spin-off from the old TV show "I Love Lucy" which started in 1935 and ran for a couple of years on NBC.  Unfortunately, after the show ended, the network decided to start something new and they picked "Dirty Dancing" because, well, people really loved that show.  "Danger Mouse" was a huge box office and critical smash and even the network didn't see it as a dead show. So the producers of "Dirt" went to the network to see what they could do with it and they were given a series bible for a spin-of the program.  Now the first problem with a series is that, well it isn't a show, it's a movie and so it can't be a movie. They had to go to Hollywood and get them to edit it so it fits in with the other programs on the network, but they found a way to do it and it seems to be pretty good.  Well the plot didn't really pick up until the movie got to the part when the girls all get together in a cabin to write a novel.  All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we get a bunch of terrible music playing from a guy in a long black robe and black sunglasses who says that his
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love the original, but the remake is a total ripoff, and this is one of the most tedious, annoying movies ever to be made. I didn't even feel anything about it whatsoever, other than being slightly disturbed by it. I can't really remember anything about the first movie, besides being a bit sad. This one tries to be the same thing, except it's so bland and unimaginative.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After the first five minutes, I knew I was in trouble.   This film is a remake of a film called The Devil's Work.  The story is similar.  A family (with an infant, a toddler, and a child of unknown age) has moved into a house with a back yard.  They have their own dog. The kid doesn't seem to be in a good mood because he is very cranky.  It starts out with the mother taking care of the child, she is always crying when she is having a bad day.  However, there is something wrong with her husband.  He never cleans the toilet, he is always wearing the same pair of pants.  There is a bad smell in the house because of the bad odors from the dog.  This all looks very scary, and there is a lot of blood, but it doesn't make much of an impression.  When the children hear the dog crying, they don't understand it so they keep going and running from it.  Then, they hear someone saying "I am going to kill you".   It's a girl that has a cat, the little girl keeps trying to get rid of the cat and she doesn't do anything until she hears the voice again.  She calls her mother and tells her that she killed the cat.  But the mom doesn't believe her, so her mother tries to kill her.  Even the little boy tries to get the cat out and he can't.  If you see the movie for what it is, then you will find the movie to be a very weird comedy, but a good comedy.  Unfortunately, the girl isn't played by any girl, it's a guy named Mark McGrath who was already pretty famous at this point and he doesn't even look like a young girl.  As a comedy, it isn't really a bad one, it has some good jokes, it does have a little bit of horror, and it has great character development.    I guess it was a good idea to remake the movie, but why did they remake it in the 70's?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a big fan of movies like the "Cinderella" and "Les Miserables" that deal with everyday people that struggle to go through daily life with little or no means to achieve their dreams. In this movie, it's the average middle class girl (played by Natalie Dormer) who wants to get out of her boring small town, but unfortunately, she just is not ready to leave it behind and move to the city.   As a teenager, she is not a natural at doing any of the typical tasks people would need to complete such as getting into the right high school. The teacher tells her, "You're just not smart enough to even get into the high school, let alone be accepted." This causes her to wonder who really teaches her there? And who in the world would be stupid enough to let their little daughter attend a school like that? I mean, if she has been told these things by others, she would be dumbfounded! But, this is exactly what her friends tell her and she then gets more into it as she finds that there are so many other challenges to go beyond the high-school-failing test!   In this movie is the story about one girl's inner quest to become a "real" person, with her best friend being the one who is helping her to overcome her shortcomings. It's an extremely interesting, and humorous movie that is very much like the other "Cinder" movies.   with all the praise I've written, I would love to see this one come to the big screen for more people to enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It seems like these directors try to get an award for being "cheesy"   but I found the whole movie very bland.   This movie should of had a more original theme or at least a good plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am in love with this movie. It has all the makings of a great movie but the ending was the main reason that I could not take my time watching it, and I can understand that this movie could have gone a different route. A young girl (I wish I could remember her name) has gone back to her native home in the country, to help her grandmother on her 80th birthday. The film was shot in the mountains of the country and I felt like I was in the middle of a movie with some of the best cinematography I had ever seen. The characters are quite interesting as well. It would have been nice to get some background about who they really are at the beginning of the movie, or what kind of person they really were. But it was all a let down. I guess I should mention that the first 20 minutes of the film is just a movie of people chatting in a bar but it turns into one of the most boring movies ever to be made. I will admit, even a mediocre story does not mean that it is a bad film, but for a story to be so completely stupid that we are not able to understand what anyone is talking about is just pathetic.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    An adaptation of the classic adventure book by Robert Louis Stevenson called Treasure Island starring Paul Newman. It is a very dull flick and for the most part it is really boring.   A great story with a lot of good actors doing the best they can, but it is a boring movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------- Well I was really looking forward to this movie and I was pretty excited when it came out since I've always heard it to be a pretty good movie. It wasn't however, the movie was a pretty average, boring action comedy that should be avoided. The main characters were two brothers named Dave and Jerry (I thought they were named just like that but they were actually a little too annoying) and when they are kidnapped by a gang and they end up being trained by a guy with a mustache (who could have been played by the same guy from the last James Bond movie) in order to protect the Earth from these evil aliens called "Thingy's" or something. When they first land they are attacked by these guys and they are able to kill them, even though at first they just shoot and run with one guy. Then the big bad alien, Thingy, comes into the picture. He tries to destroy the earth but the brother and the two girls stop him by destroying a rocket that Thingy is using in his plan to destroy earth. They then send the rocket back to earth and take care of the thingy. When Thingy gets back he tries to kill his friend and girlfriend, but the two brothers stop him. As I was watching this movie I thought to myself that a man that can defeat the Hulk should be able to defeat something like that. This movie could have easily been a parody of something. I know I'm in the minority, but I think that this movie had a pretty low budget and should be ignored by anyone who's a fan of "hero movies" or just anyone who likes action movies. As a bonus, the music was pretty bad. I found that the songs weren't catchy and made me want to just skip to the next scene.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never seen this movie. I did watch it on TV once though. It has the typical horror/horror films, however the gore is nothing to brag about. The gore in this is not as good as something I would see from a studio like Universal and the sound of this was not good either. The only other thing to add to this is that I did not find this film scary or creepy at all. I do not recommend this to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has lots of good action.  That is not the problem. Â As long as the bad guys aren't in the wrong side of the law, you have a good time.    The two characters are very bad.  They get themselves into trouble and then are too bad to be redeemed.  If they were a little older, maybe this movie would have a better story to it.  I thought it was a lot of fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was disappointed with the entire movie. I was expecting a more mature film that had a more believable ending, but it fell short.   The film begins with a group of women on a camping trip to a remote place in the mountains. One of the women, played by Nicole Kidman, is sick and suffering from severe stomach pain. She's told that she's the only one that can heal her. A mysterious man, played, I believe, by David Wenham, approaches her and informs her that he can heal, but requires a small amount of blood for the healing, to which she agrees to give. As the woman goes to the bathroom, the men are playing a video game and talking about how a woman has been "caught" and raped in the bathroom by this man. The woman awakens in the tent and is approached by a man who explains that they were in the hospital trying to get something from the nurses. She was able to see the woman's face and knows that this man is the same one who raped her, but can't prove it. The next day she receives a text message from the rapist, and the text message reads: "I'm a serial killer and you better watch out or I'll kill you." She also received a photo of herself in a compromising position.  It then follows her, along with the other women, to a cabin where the three men are waiting. This is a group that's been hunting the killer for a long time and the one in the picture is the one that the woman has to kill.  One woman, played with no real emotion, and almost as little acting skill as her female co-star, played the role of the group leader. She tells the other men, "You're all going to die together, now come on. I don't care if you die in three days, or if you get the man. I want you to die with a gun in your hand."   As they leave the cabin, they see the women and the group. Nicole Kid man's character is shot and killed by one of the men, played in a very unimpressive way by the late, great Al Pacino. I wasn't really sad to see him go, as he was never really that memorable or memorable to me in general, but his character was one of a few I thought was a bit odd. Pacino's other character was played, once again, with little to no acting
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ The story behind this film starts at night. Two guys are walking down the street, looking at the lights of their cars. One has a cigarette and is smoking too fast. He keeps getting in front of them and knocking them over. When a car is hit he starts the car, and keeps driving for a few more blocks, until he spots a couple sitting in a parked car and a red light. The red light is on. The lights go out. This guy drives straight toward them, and they all try to jump into the car. They run for their lives...    Well, the "good guy" got out of his car and gets a gun, and then he just starts shooting. The camera focuses on the person with the gun, who's just watching the people run out of the scene. At first the camera focuses in on the car and the people, and the light's coming out of a red car. The bad guy gets closer. He runs and jumps, and is shot by the good guy, who gets into the driver's seat of his red car and shoots the bad guy and the other car, then runs away. When the film ends, a girl is crying, and her friend tells her, "Don't worry. We're okay. We won't be sorry."  _______________________ There are lots of things going on, but I'm having trouble following the story. It seems like it starts with a guy getting killed, but then there's a car accident, people are injured, the bad guys flee the scene... What do you think? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It just can't be all fun and games. This movie is so boring that it would be a miracle if you were to ever finish it. It was just so tedious that it was hard to enjoy even. For example...the ending is just a bit cheesy. The ending with the guy who gets his head chopped off and it being an eye-opener. The main guy is the "boss man" so of course he's gonna take a chunk of him off before the main guy gets the chance to kick his ass. It wasn't even his fault! The main guys life was pretty bad and it got even worse from there. The "boy" is just nothing but a cardboard box and he can't stand to see him go. I mean this dude just was not worth the time to watch. The rest of the people who are trying to stop the boss man just look like they have something to show but nothing else. It takes literally 6 minutes for the bossman to show up. I don't know why a movie would need 6 minutes to show its main characters but this did. You would think the movie would've ended at about 25 minutes because there wasn't enough to go on. It ends at about 42 minutes because this could have been an 18 movie. It took 6 minutes just to introduce the main character and why he is such a dick and then he goes and destroys the movie!  I was so bored with this movie. I would love to hear what people thought of it but it really didn't stand out to me. I feel like this is the kind of movie you put on when you are bored but you should know beforehand that it just doesn't matter what this movie is. I wouldn't even say this is a bad thing but I could've been more entertained. I know some will go in this movie thinking it's a real comedy but I don aint buying it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- I don't think we've ever seen anything like this. The plot is so bizarre, unbelievable, and just downright bizarre. It takes place in a world that has a lot of similarity to our world, but with aliens. It goes to a very weird place and we see a lot about the aliens and some of their strange habits. And then there is a giant guy, who seems to be a combination of an ape and a gorilla. The thing is, it isn't a man. We find out later in the movie that he's the "Big Brain" or something, who can speak English, and is a very intelligent guy. He is a scientist and in fact, is so smart that he can solve any problem that he comes across. He's also very friendly with some of the characters and they all enjoy having a friend like him. Of course the main character, "Dot," isn't too happy that he has become like this and decides to have a little fun with him and they play games. The characters are not very good and one of them is pretty dumb and the other two are too stupid to even try to act as anything but silly. The "Big" guy in the middle, he isn't so bad, but he's so stupid you could drive a truck through his head. I guess some people would like to see this movie, but I just can't. --------------- Do it for the music: ------------------------- I love the music in this movie and they really know how to make some great movie music, the sound effects are also great and the music for the movie is so enjoyable and has a bit of a dark undertone to it. -------------- Do it again: ------------- It's hard to review a movie this bad. But I do recommend seeing this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very bad movie. What did they expect to see when they set it in the 1970's? You want more black and white? They can get that on any film with no CGI in the next ten years. The special effects are horrendous and look a lot like the old silent films they should be trying to imitate, not just the cheap, crappy, cheesy, cheap movies they've stolen. All those wacky characters are terrible. I didn't like them a bit, especially the lady, who looked a lot better in that movie, but then she is wearing the same ridiculous clothes as the other characters. I wouldn't recommend this film to a kid or a person who enjoys cheap entertainment. Watch it instead if you're looking for a fun horror film. I'm not sure I have ever seen anything worse than a movie with no brains.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say that this is a film I did not want to see. For one thing, this story of a group of people stranded in a deserted forest on the eve of a big storm is a lot like a story told by a madman who's trying to keep people entertained by telling them that everyone in the town will die in one night unless he gets more gold. There's an overbearing feeling of the people not thinking much about life. Then, there's a little plot where one of the female characters (actually an ugly girl in a wig) is pregnant, and she tells a woman about it who is obsessed with the local priest. When the little girl is about to give birth to her child she is discovered dead and has a hole in her throat to let out the baby's blood. When a doctor is called to the local hospital, the doctor is immediately attracted to the woman's body and he and the people of the town are also looking for evidence that the baby has died. What makes it even worse is the fact that it turns out the little body has not even been born yet. When she's found, the little child is found to be a baby girl. So, now the child is being raised as a girl and the girl is being called a boy, and the local people have decided that they will kill the child or they will take some of her organs. They all agree that if they get to the young girl's parents they'll get a little something in return for their trouble. So now, in order to get into her parents' house and get the organs they all have to do all the "old fashioned" things a grown woman has to do. And that's it. It's a bad story about a group people who don't think about any of the consequences. If you're a guy who likes a story about little girl who needs the organs to be born alive, then this might interest you, but it's not much more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   . The last movie from the great team of Peter Jackson & Fran Walsh! (No, that is not a typo).  It's got great performances by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh, and an action packed plot.   It is very entertaining, and I think the best of the three films in the series.  The film is also very well set up by the directors, and it gives me a good feel of the books, although I'm not too familiar with the first two, so I may not get into the books as well as I would like.  Overall though, this is the best film in the trilogy, and possibly the best ever!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* If you want to see a classic film from the 1970's go watch this: It's a good movie but it doesn't really get you there. If you've seen a classic Western and liked it, you're going to find the same kind of good old fashioned adventure in this flick, just with the bad guy being an annoying clown and a stupid old lady. The film has its moments but you'll find it very repetitive and pretty darn boring as the main bad guy isn't a particularly interesting character. It was made in 1970 but I can't recall it ever being really bad and this is the only reason that I won't rate it lower on my list.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A mediocre, cliched movie.   The film is full of obvious errors and even worse acting from the lead actors.  In the movie, the girls meet a crazy rich man and he helps them out by giving them a diamond bracelet he got from a pirate.  When they find out that the man was a pirate and they help him capture a group of pirates he is killed and is buried next to a tombstone with his name written in blood.  After all this they return to the island where they meet the old man who was supposed to help them out but has become crazy.  They help him find out why he is dead but they just run into a bunch of criminals, who beat up the old guy with clubs and bats.  The movie ends with all the villains dead except for the old one and the girl who are tied up.  This movie is a complete mess and is filled with ridiculous characters and is full with awful acting.  I have never seen a movie that is so bad that I can't stop watching and it does not get better from here on out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one very weak-minded movie. For a movie that promises so much, it delivers so little. I expected a little more from the lead actress, and didn't, but it still had my heart pounding for 90 minutes. The dialogue was fine enough, but the character development was pretty weak. The first half of the movie follows a girl in her school days. She's pretty smart and pretty well informed, and she's trying to become a good friend. But she's caught in the wrong time and space, and it's not going to get any better. It's the only movie I've ever seen where the movie's main character is a young girl. It would be fine if the film showed her dealing with growing up, but I could see the kids sitting around watching this movie all day. And that really does it. The movie tries to be funny and witty, but doesn't really have anything funny, or clever, or witty. I mean, it tries to make a joke out of a pretty serious situation. It only succeeded in getting me to cringe, and feel pretty gross.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "When I was a boy, my mother, with her sweet and kind face, always came to our house, when I was still very little. My father who I still loved, and who was often angry, also had this very sweet face. One day, she said that my father will not come to see me or come for a visit for a year, because he is not well and has a bad cold. My mother told me that he would come later, and she went away. I remember that as I was crying and my father was not there. One year later, he came once, but I had forgotten to tell anyone because I was so sad. One night, he again didn't come. My grandmother was very happy, and asked my father if he was very well. He said that he was, but that he did not feel well, so he did nothing but lie in bed all day long. But he never forgot about my grandmother, because every night, in my grandmothers room, he would go for his own private little bed and lie there and think. He never told me what was in his mind. After a year passed by without him coming again. I was then about 9 or 10 years old, and I used to think that he is no good, and that I will never see him again. One morning, I was on my way to my grandmother's room. I remembered that my mother was very sick, and thought I would be in the family house. I went there and found the father lying in bed with his legs crossed and his head on his pillow, and my grandmother with a fever. I told my grandmother to lie down and I would go to my father. She said 'Why are you doing this?' I said that I wanted to see my father for one year, and as long as he is here, he will keep thinking, and will keep talking about me. I could not stand to see him like this, so I went home and called my mother. My parents were very happy to see that I would come to help my mother with her work. My dad was happy with my coming and my mother told my father that I was coming. That is when I saw my father, his face pale, and his hands trembling, lying in his bed, the cold and his weakness. I rushed into his room and sat beside him. My heart sank. All of a sudden I was sick too. I lay beside my father and felt so
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What's really annoying is how in every other film I have seen this film. A bunch of guys are looking for a killer, but this guy is really a psycho, he's the only one who has something to fear about him and I'm glad he is found before we have to waste more time watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has a lot going for it, but the production quality is really low. The acting is very limited, the characters are poorly drawn, the plot is just stupid and poorly explained, the dialogue between the characters can be heard clearly. This movie could have been made in a week at most, but there is no reason for it to take so much effort. A very poor and stupid movie that I wouldn't mind seeing again at a cheaper price ( I mean, it is pretty much a porno movie, but it would have been nice to see some nudity).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    -This film takes a very long time to get going. You will be waiting a long time for this, which I found rather annoying.   A very long film indeed, but what makes it so memorable are the performances of many, it is a good film that really deserves your money. I really have no clue how someone made a movie so good. My rating:  So what you will get, you will see. A bad bad movie, full of bad acting, and one of the worst film I've seen this year. So good I have to get a refund.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I saw this film and I found it quite boring, like all that film's. The only thing interesting about it are its characters and it is obvious they will be in it forever. I think it will be a great role model in the future of young actors to have to be able to work with big egos and it doesn't matter how great their talents are. It just doesn't work, it is too much for most people's mental capacity. It reminds me of an old time movie where a man with an orange face and a hat walked around and did some weird stuff, like getting angry if a kid didn't do his homework. No one else around him had a good reason to be angry, just some weird shit going on. It also made me wonder how much money went into this film, but then I found out it was more than 10 million."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen almost every movie from this year in IMAX and I am still not sure if I enjoyed it. Yes, that would be an understatement: the movies are pretty much the same. The plot is based on a couple, Alex and Anna (Caitriona Balfe and Mark Strong) with a two-year old daughter, who decides to move to a new house. When she sees a strange shadow, she tries to take care of it, but after her husband leaves her she decides to check it out. Her mother finds her and makes her stay at their house. She becomes obsessed with one of the children. She also starts acting very strange, the family thinks that the child is possessed and that it could possibly be demonic. She is constantly trying to destroy, and even kill. Even her own daughter hates her for her behaviour and her actions. As a matter of fact, the little girl is not possessed by the demon, she has an illness. However, after the illness is diagnosed Anna turns against her. The only thing is that she is no longer good-natured towards the child, she now hates it. The demons are the ones trying to capture her, they are very evil and want to hurt Anna, but she is not strong enough to stop them. However the child's life does not depend on her, as they could also take Alex away. At the end of the day, a little child will not be able to survive without her parents, and it is only a matter time before Anna takes away both of them. The worst part about it is that the movie is based mainly on the characters' behaviour: they all are extremely selfish and just want to destroy everything around them.    …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You get the usual lame story, in this case a group of teenagers and a bad guy. The bad guy isn't bad by any means, he's just a normal bad guy who happens to have a small pet dog, a normal dog... He doesn't do any of the things the rest of the cast does. His plan is a typical "get them all into a fight" and the end result is a bunch of people getting their faces ripped off by a giant, fat, stupidly named robot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We start in the early 1900's with a scene about the death of a young girl named Daphne. We are given no details of the girl's death, but we do know she had the same blood types as other girls and had been sexually abused by her grandfather. We then are dropped back in time at a small town on a summer weekend, with its population of around 10 people. We can only assume that the girl had fallen victim to a series of murders involving her grandfather who is a doctor. The film takes us through a typical 'horror' or'monster-of-the-week' format as we are shown clips of various people being attacked, or perhaps kidnapped, by various strange characters. This is typical of those monster-of-'the-weeks' which became very popular in the 1930's. The story progresses for a little over an hour, and the last third is a sequence that is clearly meant to be frightening. There is a large room filled with blood, and blood-covered things that jump around. The music is quite gruesome and ominous at times. The effect of the image and the atmosphere can be very eerie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â I had to write a review of Â The Big Sick Â because a lot of people have told me so. And I really liked this movie because it reminded me a lot from the very first Â movie I saw by Martin Scorsese, but it turned out to be a more subtle and serious movie about life and love. So I have mixed feelings about it. Â All in all the acting was really good, especially the lead, Kumail Nanjiani.  Â He did a great job and his lines were funny, and he was charming and kind.  The other actors were not much,   . Â Sam Rockwell could have been better.  So I have to say it was a good movie, but I am glad that the producers took a risk to bring it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful! There's no logic, no character development, and the acting is terrible.  I know I should be impressed because it comes from a great director like Martin Scorsese or Danny Boyle.    I'm not, this movie should be called "Shitty Scorsie".   It's a long time before we find out the identity of the dead lady in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was a disaster from start to finish, with a script that is so bad it's funny. And yet there is such a sad, pathetic and sadistic undertone that is very hard to ignore.  It would be so great if they had never tried to get the studio involved. They never had any idea they were going to make a movie about a serial killer. I mean that's like trying to get a serial murderer to film his first scene. They should have hired someone else for that. So in a movie like this why did they bother with a great cast like John Cusack, Tim Roth and Michael Shannon?  They thought it would be cool to have him wear a clown makeup and that it would look like he was dancing. How about they just shoot him in a cage and put him in there to entertain the children? And then they have him do that and I don't mean like this.    The one guy who has any kind of power to make this movie any better or more acceptable is Peter O'Toole, who is so out of place and doesn't sound like a clown, that it's almost a little unsettling. The rest of the actors in this film are just awful in this movie.   My favorite part of the movie was the sequence with the killer's wife who is his accomplice. The acting is so atrocious, so unprofessional, that you're not even sure what they're supposed to be saying. I think she's supposed to look at the camera and say, "I love you." But that's just so wrong. And so ridiculous. I was trying to figure out what she could possibly say to that guy in that situation? He's just sitting there looking into his victim's eyes as he kills him. It's insane. It doesn't have to be so over the top. It could have been done as a scene in a play. It would have been very easy for a clown to have told her to say the same things she just said to the camera guy and the audience. The guy in the picture looked like a dead man walking. That's what a clown looks like to me. The best parts of this movie are when the guy is going to do this crazy dance thing or he's going to stand in a corner and stare at a wall. And then he just drops to his knees. I really don't know what else to say about this movie except that it has all

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this about a year ago in a theater. It was a disaster, a comedy, a movie that had no idea what it was trying to say and no idea where to go in it. But I guess I just wasn't into it, because the movie was so boring that I didn't care. If it's a comedy then there's no point in telling a story, and if the movie is a comedy but there's absolutely no point to telling a single story at that point (a whole movie without any story). So the movie just seems to be about people getting drunk, then having sex, and then getting drunk some more, and finally being arrested. It sounds like something an amateur pornographer would come up with. And while the movie certainly has the potential to be funny, it's not funny. It just has no idea of what it is or where it is going. I guess this is a movie where the best thing to come out of it is probably the music by John Linnell - the songs aren't bad at all but the movie makes no sense, and the plot doesn't make any sense either. I don't recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The new movie is just a cheap knockoff of The Fast and The Furious, it is a complete re-do of Fast Five. If this is the first time you see Fast and Furious, then you know it is not the same. But they still make it cheap! It has a whole bunch of the characters they lost in Furious 7 such as Dom and Mia and even though its a remake of Furious 5. The original had the same characters, but the ending was not the good ending. It was very over the top and they tried to give us an ending that is not a good ending in this movie and it sucks! This movie is for the kids, and no one will ever go to this movie. It does not have a good story with a twist at the end, its not like one of those shows where you get the ending after you watch the entire show. I gave this a 1 star because the actors are great, but its just a remake and I really hate remakes.

I don't believe it, because the movie itself is actually just a mediocre movie. It is only a mediocre joke.   The joke here consists of a man walking on top of a mountain and a woman trying to run after him, as they both run on top. But before they can get to the top of the mountain, they fall into an open river. The woman goes down, and falls into a deep gorge where the man gets caught by a large shark and gets stuck.  After some minutes, the movie ends.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie: **************** ********** The film "Warriors" is a story about a guy who is living the normal life in the normal suburb. But, then he gets caught up in a terrorist act. In his attempt to stop the terrorist from killing innocent civilians, he finds himself facing a series of increasingly difficult and terrifying situations, one of which he is forced to battle a demonic giant that's on a rampage, and a small group of demons that look like children. The plot can be summarized like this: The story is basically a bunch of one-jokes and bad jokes. The movie never takes itself seriously, and it's one long gag. The characters are all a buncha dicks, and I don't care what movie is made about their stupid actions. That's not even enough to qualify it for a bad grade. ************ The action is pretty bad, but it's pretty much all in a single scene with some of the weaker characters. In one scene, a soldier shoots his buddy in the stomach and shoots another in the arm, and the soldier gets in trouble for it because the man is still alive. It's one of the more obvious bad action scenes I've seen. ************************* ******** The performances are pretty bad. The main character is pretty dumb, and most of his dialogue sounds like he's yelling at his own stupid actions: You stupid son of a bitch, you stupid fucking bastard, you fucking coward. Get out of my face before you try to do anything like that again! You're a goddamn coward, a son of bitch! You fucking son of shit! You piece of shit. You fucking motherfucker! You son of fucking bitch! How could you do this to me? You stupid fucking sonofa bitch! ************ ************
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this to be a bad comedy. It has funny jokes, but this one is not funny. It is just a joke about how stupid people are. It did not have enough jokes to keep me interested, I thought there was going to be more action, but when there was not a whole lot of action, I did not feel that much more interested. I think this movie was supposed to be funny, but I don't think it was.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're going to watch any movie this year, this is your best bet. Not just because it's fun to watch, but because it tells the complete opposite of the "Worst Movie Ever" narrative: it's actually a good movie. Not the greatest ever made, but good. That's all I'm going to say. The plot is ridiculous and the acting is pretty bad. But it's an enjoyable movie, worth seeing for its absurd plot and amusing characters, if only just for the fun you have with all the bad jokes and bad acting. This is not a great movie. It's the opposite of a great one. But you can at least laugh at it.   The best thing I can say about this movie is the soundtrack, it is simply beautiful. The first half starts off with a nice, calm, moody instrumental track. The voice-over for the characters is also quite charming.   or  I found myself really enjoying this movie a lot. It starts off great, has the best soundtrack and has a lot of funny moments as the plot goes on. The story itself is pretty predictable, and the characters are only really funny during a few times in the movie and are then pretty bland for the rest of the time.  , just like all the movies I'll be discussing today, is absurd and funny, it's really nothing to worry about. At least the story is enjoyable. I could watch this movie over and over again for a laugh. I found myself actually enjoying it much more than all the other films I'll discuss this week. The acting is kind of cheesy, and there are a lot more bad jokes than good ones, which can be a turn off for some people. And the pacing can get a little slow, and I was hoping that there would be more exciting moments later in the film. But there really isn't. For a movie about a guy who gets an alien, it was pretty slow and a bit too predictable. But the fact that it's so well made and has such an amazing soundtrack, makes it worth watching again. Definitely worth watching over and again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~ I've waited a long time for this movie to be made. I've read the original comics and there are a few cool stuff in here. The movie is pretty much the same story but the characters are even worse. It's just a bunch of random people fighting, mostly robots, and then the bad guy is a girl who is always fighting. The acting in this movie is not up to par with the books, especially in some of the scenes. The voice acting is pretty good and there is a lot of good comedy. It didn't really surprise me as much as it could have. If you ever find yourself in a movie theatre, don't look up from your screen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've been looking for a "great" film since I saw a film that looked like a black & white version of " The Wizard of Oz ". That movie had many "good" scenes, but there was absolutely nothing great about it. It felt like someone was shooting a black-and-white film in high def and then digitally splicing it together. Even the music was bad. There were so many great scenes that were cut out, but we got to see a lot of scenes that could have been great, but just didn't really grab our attention. The main character is named "Tin Man" and he has a little dog named "Ebby" and they travel around searching for things like tin cans and little old ladies that aren't there when they should be. There are a few good scenes with "Ebbie" but they all just drag and they didn't even make much of a "deeper" connection with the characters. What really bothered me about this movie was that the actors played it like they were the real heroes. They were so "silly" with their lines, "It is like a fairy tale. But this world is not real." and so on. At one point they were supposed to be eating an apple from a tree that was so green it made them look like real elves. It really made them seem like a little kids' fantasy. I felt that all the actors were doing their best and all they needed to do was take off the makeup and they could have made a great movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I've ever seen by the director(not counting the few of his movies that I didn't like but in general I loved the rest). The main character is an idiot and his friend is a total psychopath. If the movie was made in the 80's its a horrible 70's comedy. This movie will make you laugh but it will make your throat go back in a few seconds. Don't waste your time if you are an action fan. It has some cool stunts but I'd rather see action movies from the 90's than from this generation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a comedy. There are some funny lines, like the one at the beginning of the film when she said, "This is one of the worst parts of the job, waiting for the mailman." She is also very sweet. But not in a very good way. I will say it is funny, although she did say, "If I could just have something good to eat and a bed to lie down on at night I'd be in good shape." I don't think that was funny at all. The ending is also a joke. That is the last scene she is in the motel room with her children. The phone rings. She picks it up and hears a woman's voice saying, "I need your help." She goes up to the phone and the woman says, "It's a good thing you can hear everything I say." The woman is the director of the orphanage, who is on the phone talking to her. The children see it all on the TV and they are laughing at the film director. The woman says to the director, "Why don't you try the voice on me instead of me on you?" The children start to laugh and laugh. The director says, in a really nasty way, "That was a good idea."  It's not funny at the end, but it's worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was really bad and stupid for a movie in which everyone was drunk and it was just awful and very hard to watch especially when the drunkers did nothing of any importance and were not funny and just annoying.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is all about the love between an old man and a young woman. They are a few days from a wedding so the old man calls her for the purpose of buying her some flowers to celebrate the occasion. Unfortunately for both of them, the flowers turn out to be poisoned, thus the marriage takes a turn for the worse and is a nightmare from beginning to end.   In order to make the rest of the story work a little better, the elderly couple gets a job washing clothes.  This story is an absolute mess. I'm going to start with the premise. The old man has been sick, has come to love his wife and only wishes to spend some time with her. He wants to spend it with the old clothes and in an apartment. Unfortunately, he can't pay the rent, so it doesn't work out for him. The elderly man wants a wife and he can see no other way than to find one. He calls her and tells her he is going to buy clothes. Her only response is that she's not going to marry an old clothes dryer. Well, who could resist such a good catch. The next two hours are spent trying to make him happy with flowers and flowers only. I hate this movie.  The old lady (I think that's how they got her surname in the script) is a real character. I don't care what the old people are wearing, they are old in the first place. They're old in their faces, and their voices are old.  Their love for each other is really touching but it's a pity that they never really get it right. The whole movie is built on a terrible premise, and it's so poorly executed that it's really hard to care about anything that happens.  Why I don's love this movie:   This movie was made with a really old style of camera. It doesn't look like a Hollywood movie. The way that we are shown the old things is by getting them to look like they do in the old movies. The movie is shot in a really bad way. It's not a good movie, but it was made well enough to make me cry. The music is terrible. The scene where the old couple is on their wedding day is one of the worst music scenes I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the title, I see the film coming from a very interesting place. The plot starts with the main character, a young man (played by John Cho) who is trying to make his way through life. He is working at a local video store, and a job comes up, which his mother, a Korean woman of few words, will do anything to help him obtain. She works hard, but her husband and the family is more interested in the family money. The first half of the film is a fairly typical western-like set-up with the young man finding his way with his family, finding his place among the big city, etc. The second half of his life is much different; there are a few funny moments of comedy as he does "the men's work" in the neighborhood. It's clear that the "Men" in this case are a group of older men, including the man who the young girl loves (played well by Yoon So Hee). I don't want to give away any spoilers so I won't say anything. I've not seen the film in it's entirety, I saw it as it is described on its cover, but it's clear, that there are plenty of laughs to be had.    This review is written from a Korean background.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a fun romp full of laughs, and a well written book to boot. However, like many other stories from this author, this one is lacking the depth of character which makes it so enjoyable to read. The characters are likeable for the most part, but we really want to know what happened to them and how. Unfortunately, we are left with a story that is very weak. This movie is a bit confusing, and the actors don't have much to do. At this point in time, we need to find out what happens next, as there isn't much to this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie once and then never went back to it. But a friend of mine did and told me she thought it was really bad.  I've never seen a movie before where all the characters are really rude to each other.    When I saw the trailer for this movie I thought it had a nice voice-over and a fun concept.  What I got was a bunch of angry women talking about how great it is to be in a woman's body and how they all want their female body back.     Now, this is a movie where the protagonist is being followed by a man, who just happens to be his father. So he goes about his task and all hell breaks loose.  I would have preferred a more realistic story because this movie just seemed so random.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So this is an old gem.  I was so excited to see the original movie because I loved the book by the same name, but I was disappointed because there are too many flaws.  One of the more interesting characters is the beautiful and charismatic nurse named Daphne.  The movie is so long that you can't really get into it and that's just sad because the movie has so much potential. What is so depressing about this movie is the horrible acting.   There are many different characters all talking about the same subject, which is how they feel about their jobs.  Daphle's character is in love with her patient who has no life. She does everything for him, from calling him, sending him things, making him smile, comforting him, and then she tries to put him in a wheelchair.  Her character is nothing like the book (in the movie she is older and has a different personality).  I have to admit though that I was interested in the role and the character was very different than the one in the book.  This is the movie I never got around to watching but I will definitely look to see it again at some point. Rating:

There's a lot going on and this is pretty much it. I don't really care much about any of the characters and I found myself not liking most of them. I just didn't find it interesting enough to stay.

After playing the game for many hours, he becomes addicted to the gameplay as well, but it also ends up killing him. The only good thing I can think of with this movie is the ending. It is really sad. I liked this movie a lot. If you like Halo: Combat: Evolved, then definitely check this one out.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love this movie.  I watched it and I thought "Man, I wish this movie was on TV.  There's some really good action sequences, a great story, and the special effects are great.  The special effects also helped me imagine how the movie would be if it were a cartoon.  It's a great mix of the old with the new and the great characterizations.  If you love action and cartoon characters then this movie is for you.  All you need is a really nice big, blue monitor.  (This movie also has a good soundtrack that helps it too)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The last thing the movie needed was another cheesy B-movie, like The Shining, which has the same generic-style screenplay as this film. This is more like an imitation of some other bad B-movies, which are actually quite good. But why do people keep showing this film to their children?"   That's a good question. It's not even a question, it's an accusation.   The film centers around a group of family friends who have just moved to a new town for the summer. These kids have no sense of humor or sense of any kind of culture other than the local (mostly) American culture which is dominated by the stereotypical characters: The local police captain is an alcoholic with a gun strapped to his belt who wants to kill his wife, a high school sweetheart, and the local boy, an orphaned street kid with no friends who is living with his mom, which is also a high-school sweetheart.  , which I am quite fond of, the first episode has this "kid" get killed by a car which drives onto a lake (that we later discover is part of a reservoir) and the car sinks the kid into the water. Then the policeman gets to live and does the only thing he knows how to do, namely: Kill as many as he can to get back to his job. It is a great episode because of the humor, which in a nutshell is a guy with a big gun, who will only kill what he feels like killing, a young guy with an imaginary friend who tries to kill him with a pencil. It also shows that the town really does seem to have no culture and no sense whatsoever. I would have loved to see some of the kids make some of their own sense of life in the form of an old-fashioned children's show, which they never manage to make, and then make some sense of their life in that show in the end. But it seems that all this happened only to provide a reason for the policeman to be a "bad guy". Then this police officer gets captured by the local child's crime lord and is put on trial. We don't need to explain any more what is going on here, since the film makes it abundantly clear.  ...   Then we get the second episode, which follows the gang of kids who get into a fight in a bar and then try to get into the bar. This happens because the local man who owns the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad I am ashamed to have it on my watch list. It is so poorly made, so badly acted, so poorly directed, so incredibly cheesy and so badly filmed that even though I am the most cynical person in the world I still find it hard to believe that somebody would actually spend three years making a bad B-Horror film with all of this. As I mentioned before this is a B-Movie, a parody of horror with all the elements you would expect from a bad parody. It has a killer doll (the B-Monster) in a house that is being terrorized by the B-monster (who is a big creepy man) and his accomplice, a little woman in a nightgown. There is also a little girl who loves the monster and she helps it by making it eat her, her brother, her sister, her mother, her father and so forth. A very creepy scene involves the Bmonster breaking into a home and trying to eat a little boy. A great number of the scenes in this film are absolutely horrible and a big part of the point of the movie is its use of CGI and a slow motion camera.  The effects on the BMonster are very poor and it only looks as if it is moving slowly because the speed of the CGI is so fast that you can't see it. There are also many obvious jump scares. The whole picture has a very cheesy feel to it, which is what kills it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this film at the local cinema to watch a couple of movies (which isn't really much of a surprise as I'm a bit of a moviegoer). The film has three stories running at the same time. In the first story, a man gets a job working as an assistant to a rich man. In his first assignment he goes to find the man's money bag, which he does by tricking the man into letting him inside the house to look for something.  The second story is about the man, who is very unhappy.  He is working as a secretary for his master and his master is dying.  He has no money and his Master wants him to pay him back for something the man stole.  However, at the very end of the movie he gets his life together and does pay him. The third story is of the man who has to do all the dirty work in a house which has not enough work.  This is a rather boring story with no sense of style and a very cheap and obvious plot. The film is set in the 1930's so there were probably more interesting films from that time period but it isn't that interesting and I don't remember it being particularly good or enjoyable.  All three stories are bad and all take about 5 minutes to complete. The films were:  The first story about a young man who works as an Assistant to a man who is dying of cancer.  This could have been a very interesting tale if it had gone further. The young man finds the money bag inside the man and does his Master a favour by making him promise to pay for it.  In the film the young man makes a bad impression because of his lack of manners and his awkwardness around other people. The man and the young woman who is the assistant have a bad relationship. I suppose they might have been more interested in each other if they had spent more time together but instead they seem to be having sex all the time. I have read some reviews of this movie that said that it's a pretty boring film. I could be wrong.   The third and most boring of the three stories is about a man (who is a painter) who lives with his family in a large mansion in London. He spends most of the day painting a house that they call home. When he comes home, he has no home to go to.  The man is supposed to make a painting. However,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The movie is a mess... The story is weak, the characters are cardboard. A "story" that has no point is a bad "story". I don't think this film should ever be considered for awards. There's a LOT of wrong things done with an "old" character... the movie isn't even a film... it's a bad comedy and a bad horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really had no clue what to expect when I went to this movie (although I have had a couple of the movies from a long time ago).  The movie was basically a remake of the first movie (and, as we all know, is a really crappy movie).   This time, a group of friends are playing a game with a young lady, who claims to be some sort of psychic.   So, the group goes on to the town of Fiskville (a town filled with big ugly monsters that have gone bad) to seek her help in a ritual to bring back their leader, a big, ugly monster who has gone missing for years.  The group goes to a bar which has a giant mirror in the middle of the room.  The group begins to play a game, but they keep getting caught with their hand in the pie (in the middle) so they get sent back to the room to continue the game.  One of the guys says that he and the others were going to get the girl, but got distracted because a girl got in the way.  Once the girl gets past the guy in the crowd, she gets the knife, the mirror, and some candles.  Then, the girl begins to dance, but the guy begins to throw her into the mirror.  She screams in pain and the mirror begins to spin and a beam of light shoots out of the mirror and into the room, which seems to cause a huge storm (for no reason).  While trying to get a message out of her, the message comes from a small child.  As it goes on, it becomes apparent that the child was being controlled by a person or people who live inside of the wall, which has been built to keep the storm out, but is now opening to allow the monsters to come out.  But, before the monster can get a hold of the child, the boy (who was in the room during the storm) gets up out of his bed (which he can't reach as he is trapped in the bed) and runs into the street, hoping to warn the woman from getting hurt.    The girl goes out into the storm to save the boy, but before she can do so, a monster comes out of a hole in the wall and the monster starts to chase the little boy down into the streets (where he is being picked up by a car and carried to the hospital)  As the movie ends,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a completely bad movie that was made by a guy who is a complete jerk to anyone who he has to share his movie with. The movie was made in the 80s and was never released in Canada. I saw this movie at a cinema that was in the process of moving into a new building. I think the movie was in its original theater format (where most good movies used to be made in Toronto). I was totally sucked in by this movie but it was a complete disaster and should NOT have been given a screen time or allowed to be released.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing much to say about the story. I didn't care for the film, the story was not interesting or suspenseful at all, nothing like a thriller, I mean a plot that's not even convincing. The character were good but not amazing. A young girl named Isla, the main character from the movie was a little too mature for my taste, you see she's in high school so her hormones go too strong at a very young age, even without a boyfriend, she's still got a very sensitive side to her which will get a bit too over-exposed in the third act. The only good thing about this film was the acting, because of its lack of energy and its lack in acting there were good scenes. If you're looking for a good time then take a look at this, otherwise you can skip it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this is a poor excuse of a sci-fi movie.  There is no plot to speak of.    It's about some guys who are stranded on some distant planet with their spaceship.  The story is very basic in that it is an alien who is stranded on planet with only a small crew.  In the beginning the movie is rather good with some good action sequences that you would expect in a good movie.  However, when the alien is infected he starts to have a huge brain and become an insane person who eventually kills the ship's Captain and becomes the final villain. The plot doesn't seem to work for me.  The movie ends on a rather strange note where it is revealed that the alien has made a deal with a planet.  He will be fed when his ship is in danger.  We never see the planet or the people of that planet because it is so distant that the aliens cant even see the sun. The end is very abrupt and makes no sense.  Not to mention, there's lots of unnecessary sex in the movie (there are 3 women in the space ship and one man).  Not a bad Sci-fi with bad special effects, but not one I would recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________ All right, let's see: The film features two American soldiers, Jack and Joe, in an attempt to help a German named Obergruppenführer Günther Reiter, who is captured by the Russians. He is taken to a secret base which is apparently in Russia. There the Russians plan to use him in a special experiment for extracting more information from the Germans, but the plan goes awry, and Jack and Oberg become trapped, with Oberg being forced to go through another man's body, the body of a Jewish girl, in order to extract more information about her. The girl, named Nina, is forced to take the place of Joe by Günter. Nina has a problem with her father, a member of the German Communist Party and Günnter's father wants to know why her father has joined the Party. Oberg makes it to Nina before he is killed in his sleep. Nina, meanwhile, is trying to find out what happened to her father. The film is, for the most part, a fairly straightforward action film with plenty of fight scenes. It does have a couple of odd moments, but they are pretty much the only things worth mentioning. I don't think there's much plot, except for Günders involvement in something he really doesn't care for. The story and acting from all the German actors are quite good, but I can't help but see the film as being an action film in a German dialect.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was absolutely terrible.  The whole thing was supposed to be a love story between a young girl and a rich older man.  It started with the daughter being kidnapped by a rich, older man and kept hostage for a long period of time.  Then the rich older guy went back to his country house where he lives and he gets married to the younger girl, who is also in love with him.  I don't even like to mention it's an old movie by some guy who doesn't know a damn thing about acting so I'm sure he thought the same way about love scenes that every guy has when he first saw this movie.  There was never a proper love scene between the two lovers so we saw a couple of other things in their lives:  The rich older brother was drinking heavily at home and his friends were making a mess of it while everyone was getting drunk.  Also, they kept throwing stuff at each other and even the older boy was being hit.  Finally, the wife got sick and the older brother's wife told him he should go get the medicines.  We see the wealthy older brother getting into a car and driving away from his home to the doctor who said it would take three weeks to cure her.  Well, he never actually goes to the hospital but he just ends up coming home with a new girlfriend and their baby.  So there you have it.  For some reason the director chose to have the baby being born in the middle of the night by a nurse.  In fact it was the doctor that was so sick he had to leave the hospital early so he could go home and see the wife before she passed.  This is about all I could stand about this terrible movie. I am ashamed to say I was more than happy to turn it off the movie when I was done watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's always hard to find good old-fashioned slapstick humor in Hollywood.  This film does have its share of "jokes" that are funny, but nothing quite out of this world.  You're not wrong.    That's pretty much it.  And I'm sure the first 20 minutes or so were a blast (as long as I didn't have to watch it again the next night!).   And the characters?   What?  They're all bland, like a lot of the characters in Hollywood's comedy.  There are two characters, one named Ed, and one called Fred.  That doesn't explain how they met (aside from some movie stars), but there you have it. And the other characters are also really weak-willed, or else they're just dumb.  I'm talking about the rest of the cast - they're all just plain old stupid!  I was disappointed in every other character.  Well, one of them (Bobby) is so completely annoying, that you'd have to spend a lot longer than you think to make a movie like this worthwhile.  It's not really slapstick comedy; it's really a very dumb comedy. There's a scene where the boys meet a drunk named "S.G." and he takes them to a bar named "The Barn."   Now I'm not sure why Bobby (the main character) went to The Barn to meet S.G. (and why he had a gun in his hand - though I don't think it made much difference).  Maybe he thought they'd get to meet some other boys, but no such luck; he found S.K. (Ed) and his gang of thugs at The Barn, and they beat him half to death with their bats and slingshots.  If you're going to make slapstick jokes, make them about other people! And that's pretty pathetic!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't like this one. I found the premise of the movie to be somewhat ridiculous. I could see some humor in it, but there really wasn't that much of it. The story is about a character who has lost everything and is forced to leave. He is given a house where he decides to take up a job cleaning and painting the rooms in the house. He cleans the rooms and has a great time. A good thing about this movie is that they were able to add humor to a dull picture and they even included scenes with the dog in the kitchen. Overall, I found this a poor movie and definitely not a good way to enjoy a nice summer night at the beach with friends.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For anyone who has seen this movie it's pretty clear: this isn't a comedy.   Well I'll just start by saying that I'm a big fan of Paul Rudd. It's actually kind of sad how he's so unrecognized. He's a really funny guy. He also has a really great physical comedy presence. So, I guess you could say that it wasn't much of a surprise when I stumbled on this movie.   a few random observations:  I've seen more comedies in my life than this. I'm still not sure what to make of it.  -The story was very slow paced. I don't have much to say about it. It wasn't bad, just... not great.  : I'll start off by saying I'm surprised at how bad this movie is. It certainly didn't set my expectations high, but I was hoping it'd be more funny. Sure it had the typical "we're having a party and there's no one around except for the house plants" story but there wasn't any humor here. There weren't any jokes here! Not one! Not even a single laugh was given! I was pretty disgusted!There's absolutely no story. The movie is about this guy and his stupid brother. The guy gets in trouble one night and his brother forces him to work as his assistant. It doesn't take long for them to have sex so the guy can work for free. It ends up that they've both fallen in love with one of the house plant's, who is also a house plant. The brother gets mad at the brother for not taking his love seriously. Then the guy's girlfriend shows up! And here's where the movie took a huge step back! It starts with some of my favorite scenes to ever be featured in a film. A guy (not the brother, not the guy) with a mustache and hair and a suit who is having an affair with a lady! That is the movie! It's a great little bit of funny, but by the end it was just... boring! It had too many of the same jokes that came up every time the brothers did some stupid shit. The story never even made any sense. This is a comedy, right? So why the fuck is it just a "comedic" movie? I mean, you're supposed to laugh every time something happens? A lot of laughs, but they're not funny. They're very silly! I
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I was very excited to try this. I haven't seen many people get their hands on this. If you love your guns, this is the movie for you. One bad guy after the next who shoots up everyone. There is not a lot of gunplay in this but some of it is good. I enjoyed some of the dialog in this movie as well as when the bad guys are shot at at gun point (by the evil guys). I liked the way this was shot in a city setting. I don't know who this evil guy was. I didn't really care.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- * There's really nothing special about this movie. * The plot is really not very convincing. * There are way too many different kinds of monsters to be described. * As if they really needed this many different monsters in a movie. It's a very bland and silly movie. This is a movie to just pass the time during a long work week. This movie isn't worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a very dark and difficult movie that is a complete waste of talent. The movie tries to show its dark side with the dark and mysterious story lines of the people and the environment and the bad and evil people who live here. It tries to tell its story through different methods such as a flashback, a flashback where the main character is seen as a young boy, a dream that is about the main protagonist that was abducted at the age of 4 years old and now in a mental institution, a murder, a kidnapping, a police detective and the evil people. It attempts to tell it's story through the different methods but it is not successful at all. The whole movie is a mess and it does not make any sense. I will not explain the story and what is it about. I hope you do not watch it and do not think that it is a good film because it is really a bad film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't good but it has a story that's fun to listen to and it is very well done.  When it comes to acting its not too bad either.  For the most part everything is on point.  The story is entertaining and it has some good moments.  One of the moments that made me happy when I first heard of it was when I heard that the main characters were actually actors.  I don't care if I have to listen just to get to this movie because it is a real treat and is enjoyable.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad movie is the worst thing you could imagine. When you hear the title The Evil Dead, you think the director is going to make a zombie movie with some crazy actors. This is not the case. Instead, The Evil dead is a cheesy horror flick with one of the dumbest endings of any film made this decade. At the start of the movie the movie shows us one character standing around a graveyard. When he gets close to something the creature he's standing next to starts to chase him. At this point the movie was all about the character in the graveyard. That's all the movie really is. He is sitting around in the cemetery and has to get home. And then he gets attacked by the creature. After the movie came out I saw it again and I noticed the same character from the beginning, standing around in his garden watching his dog running and running and then suddenly being chased. As the movie continues we see more and more people walking and talking on their walk home. Finally you see the character get into his car and drive home. That was it. I mean it was so simple it wasn't even a movie. In fact it was just a bunch of people talking on the phone. And there isn't a creature or anything of the kind to be seen. A simple story to end an annoying movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to watch a funny movie with a bad acting performance by the leading man, then this is for you. I was amused by this film but the story was just a bad one. For instance, the woman who is chasing the thief gets the idea of using an egg to protect her home. The egg comes alive and turns to become a flying machine. When it hits the thief, he gets the egg away from her. He then throws the egg at her. To my knowledge, there is no such thing as a flying egg. It's more of an egg with a tiny human inside. But that was not the only thing we saw in the movie. The film did not really tell me anything. It was a funny yet very stupid movie but I could still find a few laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If we are talking about the worst movies from the 90's I could only think of a couple of them: The Running Man, The Green Mile, The Matrix. But it is this one that really takes the cake. I hate that movie for many reasons: I hate the fact that it is made in America. I also hate the violence and the violence that accompanies the violence. I don't know why a couple who are married so recently that they have no kids are in the US, and no one is allowed near them. This is not a horror movie, even if it is funny. Its about a group of criminals that want to take over the world. I would like to say that it was a fun movie to watch for a little while. It was very violent, and a lot of fun to watch, but at the end of the day it left a bad taste in my mouth. Just wait to see how the movie ends. It goes down easy if you already have seen it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a fun action flick, but the characters, especially the female cast, are terrible. They were all stupid and silly. There was no tension, no fight, and no real suspense. One of the bad guys, who is actually a good person, had a funny line. I thought it would make a good film, until I saw what his line was. Then I realised how much fun it would be.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ I have had a lot of terrible movies at the cinema. This is one of the worst. I could see it was just a comedy and I'm sure I didn't want to go to the theatre, but after sitting through the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so bad I want to take a shower so badly. The worst thing that can be said is the character who is so dumb and so pathetic, I couldnt believe how stupid he was. The only good thing that comes from this movie is the music, but I'm not really a fan of any type of music that can't be recognized by the ear. I was so bored by this movie. There are so many horrible things happening that it was impossible for me to care one bit about the movie. So if you're looking for a fun comedy for a family movie night to pass the time, and don't care about the horrible events going on in the movie then you'd love this movie because it is very well acted and produced. But I can't believe this film was made to be in theaters. Not good at all. I recommend that you do not see this film. This film should be in the "Do not show to the family" section.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________.   I don't know if I like this movie, or not.   It's got a "who cares" plot that is a little weak, the acting is decent, the plot is weak and has no logic to it. It's a simple, very low budget movie of a little boy trying to help his mother while she is in a hospital and it's done.   is the story: Two siblings have been told that their mother died, they then go searching for the body. Then a "monster" comes along. You know, that old, bad fairy tale from the movies. I guess there was something in this one about a little girl looking for her mother? I guess.   a) It's pretty boring and the whole movie is like this.   the brother and sister get to a place where they search for the corpse in a big graveyard and it turns out they have the wrong corpse.   (there is an interesting thing where you see the girl's hands. the whole time she is holding a sword, she is carrying the sword on her back)   2. The girl has to deal with the monsters. The monsters are ugly creatures, and it seems that they might be a bit too much into her, and they are very persistent, but she is too tired to fight them so she just runs around the grave yard screaming.   The only reason I gave this movie a try, is because I thought it was a horror movie, and there are a couple of monster scenes (they were done really badly), but they don't make up for the bad story.  , the whole story is very poor in every way. If it had been made in 1986 it would have been one hell of a film.   on the other hand, if you are looking for a creepy story of a girl with a long sword who runs around in a cemetery and tries to save her mother with all her might, then you should watch it. Otherwise don't bother.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What happened next? There was no plot! No one was dead, but the audience was not getting anything. I thought the story would end with an evil villain and we get to see him and his henchmen die. The last shot was the most disappointing. The camera moved a lot, but did not show us where we were standing. What happened next was horrible. We were just supposed to be walking down a street, but we never found our way out. The next thing we hear is a girl screaming. I tried to see what she was yelling about, but all I could see was the back of her head. The scream was awful. The man standing next to her was very cold. She was crying and he was very quiet. He was a huge man, but she was crying because he made her cry. When we got to the street we were asked where we wanted to go. They told us to take the first street that looked empty. I looked to my right and then there was another scream. I knew that's where it was going to start. I turned to see the first scream, but now I couldn't see anything! No street, no buildings, no nothing. The street looked like some abandoned lot. I had to turn around and look into the back view to see it. There was nothing but a dead animal with a bloody stump. Then I saw it! It was a baby! My heart stopped. It was the baby! There was a lot of blood coming out of it, but I could hardly see it because there was a whole hole between his legs. There were some other children that were also injured. They looked like they had been beaten so badly the color in their face was gone. I saw someone standing in the corner of the street. This was some sort of a human. He seemed to be laughing and he gave us the money we had been given. We walked back to our house. I felt sick to my stomach. That man was the worst thing that ever happened to me. I hope no one ever comes back and takes revenge on them!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had a very bad experience with this movie last night and after watching it again I'm left not having a single thing good to say about it. So if you're looking for a good and fast paced action movie, this is not for you. I would give this an 8 out of 10 but it didn't get a 10. It is an old film, one of my favorites when it was made in the 1960's. It was a very good story about a boy named Max and a girl named Sally. The story of the film is quite interesting, Max is sent to a school called "The Academy" which is where he is trained to be a hero. He is taught that he is to save the world by beating all those who want to destroy it. However he is taught a very horrible lesson when he is chosen to be one of the heroes, and his mission is to defeat all the villains in the film and save the school. The only thing good about this film is the way it uses its color and music. I will continue to watch films with an old style because it's a better way to tell stories and this is one of them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst thing about this movie is the script. It's a mess! All the ideas are there, but all the jokes are either too obvious, too clever, or just too annoying. I was hoping for a nice twist, but none ever came. I'd say it's a decent comedy, but not a great one, so it doesn't really stand out much.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just not very good. From start to finish, the movie was just flat. There was no real feeling in the story (which wasn't that bad, it was just that the movie never went anywhere). I know it's supposed to be the 70s, but what was the point of the movie, anyway? There was not a whole lot to do in the beginning, just have them talk about their problems (the old man has a problem with his teeth and the young guy is in a slump because his girlfriend just broke up with him) and then the old man and the boy finally got out of bed and went off on their quest to see the ghost that has been haunting them since the old woman in the first part of the film died (so that's how it started!). So, they go to this old man's house and the old lady was the main character from the first film so I thought it was pretty weird. The boy doesn't really show much emotion. The old man just sat there, not really doing anything and not saying much. They go back to the old house and that was pretty much it. This is actually a very good way of starting the film. The ending was pretty lame. I mean, there was a big explosion in front of a giant rock that made a great big hole in the ground. The house was blown apart. The girl went back to her boyfriend in the woods and then went out. The guy went out to find her so he could try to get a ride to the bus stop. That was it. The movie then ended. I think the only reason this movie had any value was because it was supposedly a remake of the old horror movie "Haunt", starring Mary Astor and that's about it. But it wasn't even any good at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I will be the first to say this is not a good movie at all. A good idea is presented in a bad manner. The problem is it is only a bad idea, not a bad film. I didn't expect a movie with so many bad ideas.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the biggest problems with "Batman" is that it's overlong and lacks direction in the beginning. The bad guy has been fighting the good guys for a long time now, and we don't yet know the origin story of "The Cat." This is the perfect opportunity to explain it to the audience, but instead, the filmmakers go into an over-long discussion about bat-magnets, what the heroes are fighting, the difference between the Bat-men and the Batman. It's an excuse to explain things without giving us a big, action-packed climax. I don't think the bad guys had any plans to be villains. They were hired to stop the crime from happening, but they are really a lot of misfits who can't get a job, so they go on robbing the place. I can see why the makers want to keep it short.  The film has many interesting ideas in it, and the direction and the costume designer are both wonderful. It also has a lot to say about the relationship between the Batman and the other superheroes, and why they don't want to fight together. The film has a bit of a slow burn, and it's very hard to get invested in it after the first 15 or so minutes. It starts off strong and then starts to wane very quickly.  What the filmmakers do right:  The filmmakers show us that this Batman has a different mindset, a sense of humor, a respect for human life, and a respect that the superhero is more than just a symbol of hope. This is an interesting take on the Batman, and you really get a good sense that this guy who could become so powerful is much more relatable than a symbol for hope. The filmmakers keep a good eye on character motivation throughout the movie. I liked seeing that Bruce Wayne does feel guilty about what he has done, but I'm also interested to see what the characters will do to make it right. This Batman is very good with the people around him, but he's not an easy person to be around.  The film takes its time showing us who he is and why he makes the choices he makes. I appreciated the fact that he wasn't just going to run into the Batcave and punch people in the face. We get a much better sense of who Bruce Wayne is, but we do go in many directions with Bruce Wayne and how he handles the situation.  I found that "Batman Begins" was better than
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It's a "real-time" drama film. I love the actors and the story. The story has a good twist at the end and some great action scenes. I guess I prefer a more "live-action" story, but that's just my opinion. The film is very good and entertaining and I'm hoping that more people will watch this. I'd definitely recommend it!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I found this movie to be a disaster from beginning to end. You get two men who were trying to capture a big cat in the jungle, and the movie basically consists of them having no problem with anything, even as they come across a bunch of natives, and get captured as well. The first half of the film is pretty good, but then they get captured by one of the natives, who is a terrible leader. And then they have to try to escape, and that's when everything gets much worse. All the characters are uninteresting and you have no real connection with them or the animals you meet on the way. It's just a bunch that are doing nothing, and while the natives are interesting, you have nothing to care about them as characters. The only real character is a man who's a giant crocodile (because of course it is a crocodile) and he's pretty cool, but he doesn't do much and he was the only character who didn't seem to have any depth to him, or who you could care about or care at all.   I really liked the first few minutes, so when the movie got bad I was surprised. The rest of the movie doesn't hold together, and I could tell that this movie didn't really try to be clever. This movie really just had one thing happen and it would've been much better if it hadn't. And I really didn't care what happened to the people, so if they didn't have anything to do with the plot, there was no point to them. I wouldn't have minded a movie that was simply about a bunch traveling in the rain, but this wasn't it. I had no problem at all with the sound effects, but most of them were too loud, as were the animal sounds. There are a lot of scenes in this movie that are just plain awful. I wish that the filmmakers would've spent more time on this one. (I don't even like reptiles, but you know what I mean). I have been going to the movies a lot lately, and this is the first time that I saw a movie like this. I didn't like it.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The movie is not just a bad film but a truly a terrible piece of trash in every aspect. The actors are just not good. The film was not even well acted and the plot was just dumb. It's hard to even imagine this is a film, so bad it makes a lot of trash like this. The only positive thing is that it's not a complete waste of time and money."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The biggest problem I have with this movie is that it's all over the place and very inconsistent. You have two protagonists: a little girl who is a little bit like one of those children in the nursery rhyme:  A little girl went to a fair And then she found a little mouse And she put her finger in his mouth, And then the little mouse said to her:  "Who's that I hear so much about, That is so little, and so red?  "Is he so small that he cannot reach A cup of milk?" "No," answered the little girl,  "I'm sure he can."    First of all, this poor girl (as portrayed by Kate Winslet) is the star in the movie! She starts off as a dainty, fragile, and somewhat naive girl who doesn't know a damn thing about the world around her. This gives the movie a lovely "cute" feel to it. She's got a small family with her (the little girl's mom and a sister), and a pet mouse named Mousey.   It's not long before you find out that this little girl has been raised by her grandma, whose name happens to be Alice in Wonderland. This is the movie's main selling point. This movie is all about the little girls' grandmother having to cope with a series of cruel misfortunes (which will also happen to all the little children of the world) and how she deals with it. The movie does a good job at describing a good deal of what you can expect from a good fantasy movie in this day and age.  The main villain is a very cruel, cruel person. She is a terrible witch who does her best to make the children suffer. You may think this is a good idea, I certainly did. That's why I love the movie, because it has the idea of having to make sacrifices so that a good people will live.  For me, this was a movie without a great plot. Most movies with a nice plot and good characters are like this:  You have a cute main character, you have a nice world to live in, and you are introduced to some new and interesting characters.  But this movie doesn't have any of that. Alice doesn't help any of the children at all. She does her job to torment the people and the animals, but she doesn't do any of it for the children. The little girl does the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of my favourite films! It's quite an interesting story. The director has great acting abilities. The film has a unique atmosphere. I love how it makes you feel something. It has a good mystery aspect to it too. This is an old film but is a really nice watch. The Score:   4.4 out of 5 stars  An old, old film by the old director, David Lynch. A very dark and creepy film. What can I say? A film that makes you think. The characters in this film are not very likable, but they do not give a great performance either. A little too many people do not have very good intentions.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a good movie and a good idea, but it doesn't work as intended. It is a bad, bad joke. There are so many clichés to cover up how this movie is not funny, and the story is so contrived it is ridiculous and over the top. I cannot help but laugh at how stupid the people who make this movie think they are. I'm not making fun of the movie, I don't know what I'm supposed to think about this, but I do know that it is a horrible movie that the only thing that made me laugh was how stupid it was. This movie is awful, and I don I will not say more but let me say that the movie does a really bad job at being a horror movie. Even though I'm a fan of horror it's difficult to see a movie that is so poorly written, executed and paced that is actually scary. The movie really only makes sense if the audience isn't scared at all. And that isn't the case at all; the movie starts off with a great setup but quickly deteriorates as it continues, it's not until much later in the movie where it gets good and it's just bad. The ending of the film is ridiculous too as it comes off as if the writer just went into the editing room and started writing a scene and cut it. I don' t have much to add other than that the concept was cool and I would love to see the movie come out in the future but I just have a hard time even watching it and it doesn' t hold together at all
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I liked the movie! The story line is good, there's a nice mix of humor and mystery. The characters are great and the movie has a very suspenseful feel to it. I thought the ending was pretty good. It left a lot of questions on everyone's mind. And the sound is really good! Even when it was pretty dark and scary at times, the movie is still enjoyable. The plot isn't bad! My only real problem is the ending. I'm pretty sure that wasn't what was intended to happen."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So this movie was a total B+ movie with decent action set pieces (they aren't that good) but not worth the time or money to see it again, not to mention the actors.   I think that the best way to describe this movie is as a low budget rip-off of Rocky II. The plot is basically the same but in a different setting.   was great because it set me up for the third film which was very disappointing, the plot basically being a straight-forward action film (a little predictable considering the time period) with lots of fun and plenty of action. There is a lot of action which is great and there is some good jokes thrown in too. It is a bit old school and some of it looks dated but it is a good action film, a great little comedy with lots to do in both the action and humor scenes which is fun. I had high hopes for this as the third installment of the series but the film is simply good in both action and comedy, not a great film but a good one all the same.  .  So I think that this review is just a bit unfair, this is a film which I think is a little low budget (I don't mean that to knock it as that was more a point of opinion on the writer's part), it is pretty low budget compared to its peers but it does have a couple of cool parts which keep it from being a total flop. The humor is really funny and if nothing else you can tell that this movie has been made by a real comic book aficionado. It has a lot going for it which is nice.   a few things I will say about the film:   1) It is not a bad film by any means, in fact I have no problem whatsoever giving it a score of 6. The film is fun for sure and it has a good script which adds to it a little bit. There are some funny moments and it also does a great job of setting up the third entry of the Rocky series which is something that the film really excels at.     2) I do think that there was a bit more comedy (more than there should have been) in this film. The script is very low budget so sometimes it just has to take the place of the script with the director having too much leeway. The comedy is good in this one and there are a lot more than the other films which I guess is good
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did not need a review about this movie. I was there. I can't describe how angry I was watching a man get beaten by his wife while a group of kids yelled "LOOK AT THE VICTIM!" and laughed. The wife came up to him and beat him. He got on all fours and was dragged out of the house by the cops and a crowd of kids as his wife said "I have killed him." His kids called him names. All they did to the poor guy was throw dirt on him. I'm sick of watching movies like this and that I get paid to make. This movie would make a bad day and night.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never been a fan of the James Bond movies, however.   And even though this is an adaptation of the novels, which are not really worth a shot, it's still a terrible movie.  In my opinion it's the first James Bond movie without Daniel Craig  It is a complete waste of a lot of time, and I just really don't know why the writer, Michael Cimino thought that his script fit a James Bond film.  And, yes, I am referring to Casino Royale.  At the most, Casino Royale is only about half a movie, and it starts off with the Bond girls on a mission in Rome, when a plane crashes. I just don't get the point of this movie. This is why the "James Bond" movies are always bad: they are always stupid and stupid. It is just boring to watch them.  What was the point in the "Masters of Deception" or "Casino Royale"? This movie seems like a sequel to "Diamonds Are Forever," because it is a continuation of what happened with the Casino Royale crew.  A girl in Paris has her life stolen, and the girl has to try to survive in the worst city in the world.  This movie is not a James Cameron movie, it is just a bad James Bond adventure.  Also, the story about the girl, and what is going to happen to her, the whole time, makes it not only lame, but not very interesting.  I would rather take the James Cameron movies, which I have just finished.  But that is just my opinion.  Another good James Bond Movie is the 2005 movie "The World is Not Enough," with Sean Connery.  Now you know, that the bad James Bonds movies are made by the people who made the bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good film about a very bad guy.   This movie is an homage to bad movie bad people.   A woman comes in contact with an alien and they fall in love.   The alien has the ability to "save the world" by killing all of the people on earth.   He creates a human like robot.  At one point the robot tries to escape with the woman.   She has to stop him.  The movie doesn't have much of a plot.  This has nothing to do with the original book.  It is just some guy and a robot fall in a love affair and they have to save the earth. The only thing this movie has going for it is the bad ass soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It does not seem like the movie got much love from the critics (maybe due to this) but it got the support of the majority. The movie will make a good addition to the great genre the "Kung Fu" has (or did.) The movie is not a bad film per se. It tries to be different to the average action flick of the era. The style is a mix of film noir and martial arts. A martial arts film is about the best way to express strength and courage through the use of combat and the art of fighting. A movie like that may have failed to break the mold, but at least it tried. The most glaring flaw of the movie is the writing. There are a lot of cliches and a lot is lacking. For starters the film is really boring and the characters are really cliché. This is not because the script is bad, the script does not need to be that good, but rather the characters do not fit at all. There is nothing that can make a character stand out from the rest. For the most part they are just one-dimensional. The plot is a little convoluted and the climax is not that great, but it is still pretty entertaining. The soundtrack is also quite mediocre and does not fit the movie's style. If you are looking for a fun film to have a little bit of fun, then Kung Fu Kung is probably not a film for you. The story takes place in the future, and is told through a young woman's visions, and the events that happens to the protagonist. She is the best female Kung Fu star in China (and possibly the world.)The movie is basically a combination of the Chinese martial arts style Kung Fu and the genre westerns, with the emphasis on the westerns. The martial arts is very fluid and the martial arts characters are pretty complex and complexly written. This should not be a surprise, because this is just how the martial artists were portrayed throughout the 20th century. It is clear from the beginning that the script was written by someone who did not really know martial arts very well. The way the characters move, how their muscles work and what their bodies look like, it just is not believable. The director is clearly not much of an actor either and his performances do not add up. There has to be something there to give a great performance. His characters are just bland and flat in the way that they are presented. His only redeeming quality was that he was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I had known it would be that bad, I would have skipped it.  I think it was a big mistake to make the movie in that style since they would not have gotten away with that if it was done in the 1970's.  I loved the original Star Wars trilogy and this was my first entry in that series, however I will never see this movie and I wish I had never bothered to see it because it would have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a really bad movie, in my view. It is based on an old short story of the same name by the American writer William Faulkner. The story is about a girl who is a slave who runs away in order to try to be free. She finds a house which is abandoned by her owner and she decides to stay there. During her stay the house is ransacked and all her belongings stolen. A young man with a bandanna over his face comes to the house and asks her to do some work in a workshop, which she does. The workshop is not as she expected it to be. She tries to get out by kicking the doors and a window and breaking a panes which are on the walls. She breaks two glass lamps, a pot on a stove and a china jug. She sees a mirror and falls to the floor, where her body is seen as the reflection of a boy. Her head is missing, and her skin is as white as snow and she looks like a ghost. This is the whole story and I can tell you that I think that the author tried to make a movie. I really don't like the movie, and I think people who were watching it would not like it as well.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film follows the story of one of the protagonists that has gone through hell in order to get to hell. I have not seen the movie so I cannot judge the quality of this. What I saw was the guy being held prisoner in a basement of an empty building. There is a lot of gore in this movie and some things did go too far for me (as usual). I do not think it is a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- I would love to give this movie a solid 7 and not 4 stars since this movie is good but that is just not enough to get me to come back to see it, It is not like any other horror movie I have seen in any year of my life. The acting is pretty bad as most movies are with this style, The story of a woman walking the path of a death is not new to me and the movie has been out for a month since it came out and the film is not as good as it should be. So for me not going to try it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, at least it wasn't called "Star Wars the Blackout Movie".  I can't tell you how much I want a sequel to this film.  Star Wars: Episode VII: The Force Awakens is finally here!!  And what a movie.   Let me start with a few quotes: "He's a hero we've all wanted, in every sense of the word. The greatest Jedi. The first of his kind. And he's only human." (I think that line sums it all up for me on an emotional level)    The story was fun, but the ending was sad.  And I think it's fitting for the Force Awakens to end on the last chapter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've watched this movie more than five times over the years, and every time I am disappointed. It's too slow and boring, and the acting is pathetic. It looks like it would be a perfect movie with a few extras thrown in, but the actors don't know what to do, and I can't believe how many of them actually did what was necessary. The story is very simple--a young man named Jack (John Lithgow) and his girlfriend (Jane Fonda) decide to visit the man who owns their house. Jack says that he can do the job himself because he is good at fixing cars, but Jack's friends, the Grunts, don't believe his claim and start to bully him. Jack doesn't know how to defend himself, so one of his best friends, Jim (Tim Robbins) helps him. They try to get rid of the Gruns and Jack is able to get them in a position to let him help, but then he has to fight the boss, the Boss (James Spader) who wants Jack to go over to the Grun's. When the Grunks are beaten in the ring, Jack and Jim try to find a way to get out and help their friends. Jack thinks he can kill the Boss, but he keeps forgetting things about it, so he has Jim go back to Jack's house and get the Boss a new job. It doesn't work. When Jack and James arrive at the Grunt headquarters to find their old boss there, they are met by a much younger man named Steve (Kevin Bacon) and a girl named Lucy (Seymour Cassel). Lucy is Jack's girlfriend (she has been looking for Jack for weeks) and Steve wants to take them back to his home. As he and Lucy are sitting down to have their meal, a truck full of Grunts shows up and kills the other Grunts. While Lucy is trying to make her way out of the building, Jack sees that Lucy is covered with blood and decides to save her. Lucy is unconscious and Jack and Steve try to help her, but they are beaten back. Then they see a woman's body on the floor and think they've found a Grunt. Steve says that she is the Boss' wife and she has already been killed. When they try to escape, the truck stops and Jack realizes that this is the real Boss. He kills the Boss and the Grungs chase them. They're stuck on an outcro
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like this movie, but only if you look at the plot the wrong way.  If you look past the fact it's supposed to be a romance and that the main guy (James Van Der Beek) is supposed to have a crush on the female lead (Charlotte Rampling), then the film is pretty much a disaster.  The problem with the story is that it is so predictable and boring.  The characters are all bland and shallow in an unoriginal way. The storyline is a simple case of the male lead (who is so lame) trying to find a girlfriend to the female character (who does NOT have a chance at a boyfriend but is supposed anyway).  Charlotte is the main character, and for a while she has that look of a woman who needs an adventure and something to do. But when the story gets boring it all just becomes predictable.  She is so stupid and lazy that she does nothing interesting in the movie. I will admit to some liking the movie because of its ending, but it is all but pointless after the first ten minutes.  So yeah, pretty much uninspired.    Rating: 5 out of 10  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not even a good comedy! Just a poor attempt at comedy by a comedy actor, which was written and directed by a comedian who never made a good movie. I was disappointed at seeing a non-comedic film where nobody really smiles! And I've read a lot of bad books and movies too...so this isn't a good film! (hide spoiler) The film takes place in a world in which the people are obsessed with the notion that if a woman gets pregnant before the 21st day of the month, she must have been impregnated by a man from another planet. It was discovered that this was just a silly urban legend and that these "pregnant" girls are the wives of other men from the planet of H.E.A.K., whose leader is the most powerful and beautiful woman on earth! This film was made in the early 60's, and in an era of black and white serials (such as The Adventures of Baron Munchausen) it is very strange how this movie does not get a very good rating. I didn't really care for the lead actor, Jack Cassidy, but as a writer/director, he got the job done! The screenplay was written by a Hollywood screenwriter, and has an excellent sense of humor. But, the humor is not very humorous. There is little to keep the film going, because the plot is stupid! The film is about a scientist who builds a rocket with the help of a rocket ship. The scientist (a "rocket engineer") has a son who is a genius who is always working on inventions. One day, the father is driving the rocket to an altitude in the desert when the mother decides to give birth and she is impregnating a woman! They decide that she is the hero of the story, and have all the other actors in the film wearing black dresses and black hats! When the mother tries to give a birth in the cabin and is in labor, the rocket explodes and they are all in the crash of the rocket. And the child is not born at all! And when the father sees his son, his mouth gets open and then his face is very different. And then the other scientist sees his daughter, and then the father realizes how different his daughter is! His face is the same, but when they tell him that her daughter is very pretty and he will get married to her, the son gets very sad and goes to see his mother in the hospital in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie rather depressing at times. It takes place in the small town of Alton, Maine in the early 1900's and there are lots of poor people. In this small town the people are working hard to try and survive. Their families are old, and they may be about to be poor in their own town. They have the big house and the tractor, but they are too weak. It is a pity that this movie has such a depressing ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It doesn't have any great acting (I mean, except the first 2 actors who really played it well), which is the only thing that could make it special. The plot is stupid and not only is it a poor one but the acting is very bad and the plot can be easily predicted from that stupid opening and everything is boring and not even entertaining. The main characters are really annoying to watch, although the movie does a great job of showing their stupidity without them saying anything. All the people involved in this plot are really stupid. And that's just for starters! -The movie is about a guy who has a big house, a family, a big car (that is a big bus) and other things (like a big penis). This guy decides to move to another city to run his bus again but, unfortunately, the new town is full of idiots. The whole movie can be summed up in just one word... stupid! The plot was not really original but it didn't really make too much sense, since there was nothing to do in the new city and everything the characters do is stupid. This movie is absolutely worthless, unless you are a big fan of "The King of Queens".
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- I had a great time seeing this movie with my friends. But I cannot recommend this movie at all to anyone. It's just too slow and cliche. I had never seen a movie so boring. I mean, it's an old-fashioned story about an orphan girl who has a magic book that can read minds, that also allows her to see dreams. She's so close to becoming a famous novelist but all of a sudden, after she reads a diary of a woman who is dying, all the people in her life are disappearing one after another until suddenly she's alone in a small house with her dog. She decides to find out why and gets into a crazy situation that I will not describe in more detail. The ending is a little disturbing as well. A lot of people who saw the movie have no idea of the plot and the characters. It really was a boring movie. I found it hard to believe that I was actually watching this movie. But it was really well done and I did not feel bored in the least.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! I thought they were going to try a new thing to try for a comedy but in my opinion they did the usual shoddy writing and acting and even the characters don't even have any personality. It is very much a black comedy, which I have seen plenty of times before and I always find it entertaining. There are even a couple of scenes that are so bad that I literally laughed the whole way through them. I didn't find the characters, the writing is bad. If you get this on DVD and you have seen this before it is not worth your time or money. I hope someone finds a way to fix it soon!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few weeks ago, a bunch of friends and I rented a movie, The Lost City.  It was fun (and not without its moments of tedium) and while not being a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination, it did at least offer up the chance for some fun.  Unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing funny about the movie.  And for what?  As far as the plot is concerned, it doesn't even make any sense.  The main protagonist, a dude named Jack, is a traveling musician who has no place to stay and, as a side benefit, is really into the beautiful woman he's found in the desert, who is named Alaya.  But then what happens?  Jack finds himself at the end of a desert journey and then, when the journey seems to have come to a close, he finds himself being taken through a gate into the land of the dead.  Jack, it should be noted, finds himself in the town of Ouro.  This is the second town we find ourselves in this movie and while Ouro is certainly beautiful it, unfortunately, does not match up to the other towns we've seen in these movies.  I'm sorry, but this is a movie that's trying way too hard to be interesting, and really, it is not very interesting.   The characters don't really like each other much either.  Alaya, the beautiful lady he's traveling with, is jealous of Jack and, to be honest, this jealousy is not unfounded.  Her family was taken away from her at birth and she grew up with the family of her grandfather who died years before.  Then there's the mysterious woman, Eliza.  She tells us that we are the cause of her family's problems and then she goes and kills the entire village and their dog.  So, what does Jack do?   Jack doesn't really do anything!   Jack, you see, is just sort of wandering around this town and doing some strange things, like, for instance, running around town without shoes or pants.  What a waste of a movie.   The acting isn't much better in the movie either.   Most of it is basically forgettable.   It's like a bad soap opera and not that funny.  A lot of it doesn THE LOST CITY is a weird mess that's really trying way hard to sell itself as a good movie. It isn't.  It's
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie for the first time yesterday and was thoroughly unimpressed.   The characters were generic.  There was no heart to the movie.  This is one long string of bad jokes.  The plot line is completely stupid.  It's only funny if you are in the scene where they're talking about the movie they made.  As a film, it's a disappointment.  What more could you want from a movie?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went to this because it was announced as being about a new character being on tv. The movie has a nice plot, lots of interesting characters, lots and lots of action and then a whole pile of stupid. All the action takes place in space. I watched it over two days. There is no point of any of the characters or their activities being any sort of threat to our heroes or a threat to life on earth. This movie is stupid all the time. There are just a bunch of different alien characters each with one of four or five different personalities, each character can be described as a one-dimensional moron. The aliens in this movie do little things but usually one person does it and the rest look on and do the same thing. It's as if one person said "Hey, we can't have a space movie without aliens". This movie does it on purpose. And it does it really well. The worst is when a character says something dumb but you can see it coming a mile away because they all look the same. We also see lots of scenes where the same character is in two different places at once and it's all the same guy over and over again. I was expecting a space opera when I saw the name but it turned out to be nothing more than a stupid movie for stupid people. I'm giving it two and one half stars, I would give a three but I wanted more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was surprised at the lack of realism in this movie. There's a really interesting setting that is really boring, the protagonist never seems to care about anything other than his own needs. This movie will never win me over, it is like watching a boring TV show. This is a terrible piece of trash and it deserves to be remembered for one day at a time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was filmed in the 1980s when the movie studios were trying to appeal to the'millennial' or'millennials'. Unfortunately, this is a movie about three stupid, stupid, young kids who have no idea what life is about and make a lot of mistakes.  The three boys (not three but 'young boys') are Ben, Chris and Steve; Ben (Ben Folds) is a loner, never liked his father, and in this movie Ben's love for his mother is just about zero. Chris (Steve Martin) is the eldest, a good kid who wants to go to college. Chris doesn't know how to use a gun, and Steve is an awkward nerd, but Ben and Chris love and hate each other. Steve thinks he's the hero, and the kids want to join his gang, and they are good at it. Steve also can't stand Ben, so Ben and he decide to play a game called 'Stump the Boogeyman' where Ben plays 'Boogeyman', Steve plays a boy named Stump, Ben plays a little boy named Joe and Chris plays a girl named Lisa, and all four boys take a shot at Lisa and Ben is the only one of them that hits her, and Lisa is so angry that she wants to hit Ben, which she can. So the next morning Lisa starts hitting Ben, and that is all the movie that they end up doing in three hours.       There was also a character in this that I just didn't like. Lisa, she is the one girl you can't get out of your head that you just want to hurt. This time, it's a boy, Steve and Lisa want to play the game so Steve has to be a boy in the game, so he pretends to be Chris, and then when Lisa goes to pick up the game and ask if she can play, Lisa starts crying. Steve doesn't get it and he wants to kill her. But Lisa says that he can be her pal, and she has a boy friend, Chris, so Steve does that, and it's fun.  Steve says hi to her, he says hi Steve and then he tries to put a gun to her back, but Lisa has a back door, and he knocks her out. He goes and tries to explain to Chris and Lisa what he just did, and Chris doesn' even see what's going on. Steve is so proud of his game
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________________________________________ ___________________________________   This movie has so many flaws and inconsistencies (but these are few and far between), its not really a bad film at all. If you think you're gonna get a good comedy, think again. You're gonna watch this with your wife, and your kids, to see what a good family movie can be like.   It is actually a film that is made for little kids and really is one of the worst movie ever made. In fact I found it quite disgusting, it is just a bad made-for-filler joke.   to the bad:   1. The movie tries to be funny but is so boring it has a kind of comic book ending.  ,2. When you're watching this movie do not listen to the narration, it just makes the movie even funnier.   was fun the whole time
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â A decent movie. You can always count on this to be a bad one. Â If I had an issue with this movie it would be that the only character in the movie is a big fat fat black dickhead Â.  I don't know why the film doesn't do more with him, but I guess that this film is too lazy to be about a giant ape monster, with ape-like facial hair and all.  This guy does not appear for a second in the film.    He spends most of his time trying to make sure he has a white girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! This is a terrible movie. It has terrible performances and an unbearable script. I could give it a 0/10. The movie is so bad, it makes me want to scream. The whole plot is ridiculous. The most boring film ever made. The worst part about it is how it makes you wish that the actors that played the parts where really good. The acting and the plot are so bad that I feel so bad for these actors. This movie will make you wish to get the f*ck out of the cinema.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was one of the most poorly produced films I've ever seen. If I can be honest, the story lines are extremely lame and they're set in a world where the only thing people don't like about their country is the American flag. The movie revolves around a very stereotypical "America" which is basically a small, poor town inhabited by hillbillies and rednecks, and the main character is a typical redneck with a penchant for guns and booze and drugs, and some weird obsession with the American Flag. The whole movie is just completely bad. The film features the standard bad acting, terrible acting, lame writing, and stupid plotlines. A good actor can pull off a very bad role; especially if the actor is an original and interesting character. I've actually seen a bad version of this movie about 10 years ago on PBS. The guy that plays the "bad guy" doesn't even stand out that much from the rest of the supporting cast, and it's all very cheap. This movie really shouldn't have worked. I think I'm going to try and find a DVD copy somewhere. Posted by Peter at 4:12 PM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I never expected what it was about: a gang of homeless kids go to a local carnival and have a fun-filled day.  One boy is picked out to be the star, but things go downhill from there.    The girl who wants to be a dancer and the boy who tries to be an actor who are both annoying characters.    I did have a laugh the first time it started, but after watching the second, I just wanted out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ This movie could not live up to the hype, and the hype was not deserved. The movie plays like a bad 80s action movie, and as bad as a bad action movie can be, at least the main character's are interesting enough to make it worth a watch. What is the joke here? The title says it all. The humor is not funny and the acting is not especially bad, but its not really good either. This is not really a bad film, just a bad 90's action movie with a bad ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had never heard of this film before I saw it for the first time yesterday afternoon. This movie is about a young woman in a village where the village is under attack by a giant turtle who is rampaging about and killing people. She is taken in by a tribe living in a cave so that she could help them out. The main plot of the movie is that her tribe is about to be wiped out, however they have an old healer on hand who could help him save his tribe.   The movie is based on a true event that happened in the 18th Century and the main character is called 'Lady MacBeth'. She was a woman who was taken in to a cave to be healed by a healer. The only problem is the healer is in fact a giant. The healer does heal her but not before she has been killed. She then takes up with a band of bandits who have taken up the mantle of protecting the people of the village.   the movie goes in to some very confusing scenes where you are wondering what the hell is going on. I'm just glad to know that I did not have to spend much time learning about these things. I guess that the only reason the movie was made is to make money because of the amount of sequels it had produced. I can't say this was a great film for kids but I guess for adults this movie will be quite entertaining.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is only one way to describe the plot of this movie: a movie about a woman who wants to change the world for the better, and she ends up with a husband who has an unrequited love for another woman (and a daughter she never really knew or knew about). The plot may sound like the classic tale of a woman wanting to become the leader of the free world, but the truth is that this is not a story about a super woman. It's not about a heroine to make the world better, it's about a human being who does not want to be the next president of the United States. The movie does not even give the impression that it's a comedy, it has a little something to it, but in the end, that's what made it great. If you want a comedy to entertain you while you are watching some good movies about life in America, then this film is for you. If not then keep it away from you because there is nothing funny about that.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie and thought it was a terrible movie, the acting was bad, the story was dull and there were too many plot holes. It was a poor excuse to make a movie, and I really don't see the point to be honest, except to make the actor look ridiculous.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really hoping this would be the one for my son, he has been looking for a good movie on the Internet and I could not think of a better one than this. As I have mentioned it is a good one but is not the kind of thing I would be able to get my young son to watch. This is the kind that you should let him see a young woman with very dark hair walk into a restaurant to tell about how she had a great time with a very tall man when they were both young. I have heard the story and it was the perfect story. The movie was not. This movie has very little romance but there is one scene in it that I did like. The other scene where the young woman is sitting in a restaurant with her friend (as she was at this restaurant when she first met her older man) and he asks her what he should do after he gets the man to pay his debt. I think this was a good idea. However I don't think it was executed. The scene was very awkward and this young woman did not know what she wanted to do. She just sat there and listened to her friend and then they went into the backroom to talk. But they didn't talk about anything that was not related to the man and it made the movie feel more like a real conversation. The music that plays is very cheesy and a little too loud. I would not be able take it in the bath and I thought the movie was way too long. I found it not scary at all at any time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoyed this movie. The story seemed to be a bit more realistic than in other Hollywood movies of this genre.  That is why I really enjoyed it a lot. I enjoyed the characters very much.  ... the guy is not only a bad ass but also a bad guy... The guy is a good sport about it.    In other words, you can't beat a bad-ass who is also a really bad-assed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------- -------------------------- This is a terrible movie. It is basically a parody of the "Carnival of Terror". It is made up mainly of a character called The Terror who is trying to bring about some excitement by shooting people in the legs and having fun at the expense of others. This makes up only the first 15 minutes or so of the film. This is bad enough as an attempt at humour but the rest of the movie is just downright appalling. The characters, like I have said before, are all very silly and the jokes are pretty bad. There is one scene that seems to have been added by the directors in order to cause a laugh because the actor who plays the Terror seems to like it. This scene would not even merit a laugh if it wasn't for the poor quality of the acting, especially in the face of a very violent and disturbing scene. There are two more scenes like this which are even worse and it is only because the story and the characters are so bad that this movie manages to entertain. I gave this movie a C. --------------------------- ------------------------ A special note: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ The title of the picture is not a typo it's "THE TERROR". The "T". is for Terror and the "E" is for Evil. The Terror is just an exaggerated version of "The Evil One". I don't really think this movie deserves to be called a horror movie. The idea that people will take up the guns and have a little fun is pretty ridiculous. I had to force myself to finish watching this because it was not a very funny movie. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ I am not a horror expert. I'm just a film buff that loves a good laugh. The reason I picked this up was because my friend Mike liked it and thought it was a fun little movie. Well, I am not going to spoil the movie for him and the rest but he'll have to find his own way to watch it. ________ ________ _ ____________ _______ __________ ______________ _____ ___________ /\ _ \ | | / _____/ | / \ __| | | |/ \ | _____ \ | / __ | | \ |_ ___ | |_ ____ | |____ |_ | \ \ | (_) \ | \| |_|_| |/_\ | | __/ \______| \| \_\ \_____|_
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "It's a strange place to be on a Sunday afternoon when you first arrive at your local movie theatre. The patrons are all dressed in black, black boots and black face paint and the lighting is extremely dim. I was at this show with a friend and had seen a previous showing with the same black clothes and hair style and lighting as this showing. The first thing this movie attempts to do is get you to feel sorry for the lead character. This is not possible. He is a sociopath who kills women in cold blood. Not only do you feel sorry, but his victims have the decency to be upset by his presence in their lives. What's even more unbelievable, is the way the movie uses this 'good guy' to lure men to his home. I can only guess that he didn't want a man to notice that the lights were on, but just to have a few drinks with his wife and daughter. This film was shot to give a certain "glamour" to the killer. To show that he is not the villainous figure that you think he is. But is instead a man who has had a dark upbringing and who has a sadistic sense of humour. When the first victim was killed, the director cut her head off. I know some people won't like the film but I found it very well made and the cinematography to be very pleasing. The actors in this show were excellent. I would not be surprised if this show was a hit at the box office."   The film itself is quite short. There is a very slow buildup of tension until the final act. When all the murders are committed, the murders have a very distinct sound. A quick cut to a close-up of a hand in the darkness. This was done to create the impression that the killers were walking around the apartment when they committed the crime. There are lots of strange things in this movie. A creepy car, and a man hanging around his house. A really strange part is when one of the victims is put in a bathtub full of water, covered in a cloth and placed in the water. If a person was standing in the tub, they would think that they were drowning. But in this film, the victim is standing on a dock and the water is coming into the room. I'm pretty sure that if the victim was a child, they wouldn't even notice this and would just take the bath. And to think that the director of this movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a movie where the main character is a high school student, who comes to Japan. On one of the planes to Tokyo, he finds himself in a mysterious land where he meets a girl with white hair and no facial expression in a forest. The two become friends, but their relationship goes downhill from then on. He becomes more and more curious about the nature of the girl and she becomes more interested in him. The girl even claims that she is a ghost when asked about her gender. When she gets pregnant at 15, she starts to show other people her ability to change the gender of a person. At the end, she can make a man turn into a woman, but only if she has sex with him before he can get ready. It's like a rapey story that has the guy in the best positions to make the girl cum, but she never does and keeps it secret. So far, it's not even close to a good movie. It just isn't that good. I feel like the writer just went with whatever he had at hand, and if it was to his liking, it worked. He also did not take advantage of his female character to become more interesting. And there is no plot except his obsession with the girl. She only shows up at the end. SciFi and Fantasy Rating: 1/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film opens with a "man" sitting on a rock in the middle of the ocean. This is "Joe", a homeless man. He's wearing a red bathrobe, a towel around his shoulders and a backpack with a knife inside it. He tries to sing a song, but his singing is unintelligible. The camera follows him around for about a minute (and that's the end of the "man") until we get an "invention". We see a giant mechanical shark attacking a ship. Joe gets on a jet, but when it flies away, he is sucked into the shark's mouth. Joe, in his wet and heavy clothing, floats down to the bottom. Joe's son (played by Johnny Depp) and his girlfriend arrive, and Joe asks them if they want to join him on his new adventure. The next time we see Joe, he's wearing nothing but a big red parachute. He uses a "shark gun" to shoot the sharks, and the last shot is Joe's head in the shark tank. The shark's head, after Joe's body floats to the surface, and then sinks to the sea bottom.   This movie is just pathetic. It has poor acting and writing that just screams stupidity. I've been to many aquariums, and I've seen more entertaining things, like King Kong and Indiana Jones. I can't believe that this is an animal film. It's even worse than the movie, with more stupid scenes such as Joe's new invention shooting the sharks. I just wanted to throw it in the trash can.

I know it is a long time ago, but I didn't laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't have the heart to go to the theater. This is an interesting story, but if you can't get past the first fifteen minutes you aren't really watching a documentary.   While a compelling film, it would have been a lot better to show the story in more detail, perhaps showing the story from the point of view of the "bad guys" before you get into the actual filming. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful, a train wreck, a slow moving corpse, and one of the worst films ever put together. The actors are all terrible and no one in the movie even comes close to being good.  The film begins at a large convention where the star of the movie is attending. She is a movie star but she is being overshadowed by the man who played the lead in her most recent film. She has been in his movies twice before and has only played a minor part in both of them. She does her best to ignore him as she has made a point to do since her big break, but it is not to be. The star of this movie has a very different outlook on life, and his attitude is very different from her own. He has recently broken up with his girlfriend and has gone out on a much bigger date and not once has he talked about her. He never has and it is the main reason he has a crush on her. So on the day of her first meeting with him, it has gone very well and all seems wonderful as she sits down for a meeting that they both know is going to be horrible. He is rude and insulting to her and the rest of the group. She can't take the rudeness and is not going to allow this guy to dominate her for a second. She tries to leave as he is getting more and more hostile, but he is so persistent and rude that she can't make a move. She decides to stay for a little while longer, trying to get past his horrible behavior. She tells all the other women in the room that they should all leave and sit down as he has the right to be there. He can sit down there if he so wishes but she says he has no right to interrupt her. Then comes the most incredible insult imaginable. He puts his hand on her leg, pushes her away and says if he ever put his hand in her pants again, he'd kill her.  It does not take long after this insult for the tension to build up between the two and the scene is set for a major blow up.  I thought this was the best part of the film and it does not disappoint. It does nothing but ruin all the good things about this movie.  So in the end they are all sitting around the table eating ice cream when he starts to hit on the star, and she says, "I know who you are." "You don't. I'm the star." She says
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know a lot of people like this movie and I was one of them. The story of the main characters and the ending is good, I liked the girl, but she is so annoying and there is nothing to like about her. The movie's acting is good and there are some good scenes. However, the bad thing about this movie is its story. The ending is completely rushed and I really don't know what happened. I didn't understand a thing because everything happened in the first 30 minutes and then the story was rushed and then I think it was just a plot to set up something. If this movie was about a high school girl and her life, I think that would have been the perfect movie. However I can't recommend this movie because everything about it just isn't that good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very unoriginal concept by a writer who should be more famous than he is.   This movie was made during a time when Hollywood was looking for a big star to be in a huge movie that would get the biggest publicity out of them all. The movie has a very silly plot in which a cop (Curtis Crider) tries to find a kidnapped girl, but he just can't figure out how she got there. His solution is to use the magic of the stars to help him find the girl and then get her back by using a magic spell, which he then uses to give a bunch of other cops an erection...the magic then takes them away and causes them to go to the other side of the earth with other things they should not be there to do...and eventually, the main star disappears and the movie ends.  It is a very uninspired movie with absolutely no depth to it and no real plot at all.  To sum it up, Curt Crider is all over the place with his action movies which don't really work as a whole. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting more from this "romantic" movie than it did.   It was a well-made film with a lot of heart and a lot less stupidity and stupid things that could be said of the average western that shows up every so often.  This movie just seemed so bad that it didn't make a whole lot of sense.  They were all doing something bad in the end that was clearly all based on an ancient Egyptian ritual that would never have ever actually happened. There was also so much to this movie that I don't even know where to begin...  But that is all beside the point.  If you want to watch a bad romantic movie, this is the one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  It's bad and it's terrible.    It's a comedy that should never have gotten off the ground.  This is a story about a man who has lived a normal life as a construction foreman until his wife, who is an airline ticket agent, moves into town and he must work a lot more hours to keep their house from sinking back into the ground (she's a great actress).   And then you have this: And, oh, so many of them: (Sorry that my eyes bleed every time I stare at that last one. )
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping to see this movie when I went to see a theater last month. I've seen it a few times before. The problem this time is that it really feels like an episode of the X-Files. It's the same thing that happened in The X-File (a good show for the time, in my opinion). The acting, the acting, and the acting! It's really, really not good. The story is really lame. Not bad, but not very good. I like James Caan (and he's pretty good in this one too) but I'm not a huge fan of him. The special effects in this movie are horrible. I don't remember seeing anything else like that back then either. I think it would have been really fun to see it in the 70's. Oh well, this movie may be pretty good to watch for the kids, but I didn't think that I'd ever see this old movie again. I have a feeling that they've been airing that one out there.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very mediocre movie. It is very much a B-Movie, the acting is mediocre, the story is about two kids and their dad who get abducted by aliens and they are forced to work in a factory that manufactures aliens. There is a bunch of bad aliens in there that make a bunch o-n-b-r-r! sounds. It was about a hundred years ago and aliens were a popular thing back then. This movie was made to appeal to kids because aliens are cool. It has nothing else going for it and there is no other movie that comes close to this one!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The whole point is to make fun of everything," said Cameron Crowe at a press conference, in which he explained how the film is so full of obvious flaws, that it becomes the story of a "great white whale", or a gigantic sperm whale that had already destroyed a few ships and killed a couple sailors.  When we first see a whale attacking a ship it is a real sight to behold, as the whale's massive tail and huge gaping mouth look downright terrifying.    This story is not very well told and if you are one who hates whales you may find yourself completely appalled as the film follows the captain as he and the crew try to save the ship from this killer whale.  With a few exceptions they are able to do this,   however the story follows a repetitive pattern of an old sailor trying to save his ship from a giant animal which is attacking it, but this becomes too much for the crew who must run for their lives as the animal continues to rip apart and destroy ships.  This is a very dull and boring story for a film that attempts to entertain at every opportunity, that is the best word that I can use.    This may have been great on the big screen, but as I said at the beginning of the review,  there are a lot of problems when it comes to the film.  The movie  is so slow paced, and has so many of the obvious issues such as the script, which is full of spelling mistakes and it is just impossible to watch a film like this, as it is almost impossible to believe that it is trying to be funny and entertaining while so many people could not follow what is going on.  It has some great music,  and does contain a little bit of action,  but this is so short lived, you will quickly tire of this movie as the ending never resolves and it does not give a proper ending.  I would definitely suggest trying a DVD copy of this, rather than a standard release, as this will be a lot funnier to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie is a bad idea with a terrible script written by the same guy who was the director of the original "Stargate".  If you enjoy the original Stargate, then this is just a remake with more CGI and less effort put into the writing.  For me, the original movie was far superior to its remake in every single way.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish that all movies that were this bad would just get killed in a fire.  The plot is awful: a female school teacher takes her class on a field trip to a village where they encounter a little girl who is sick and malnourished.    When the little girl is seen by the school bus the teacher thinks that she is being kidnapped by the local children but the little kid is actually a child molester.  She is rescued by the boys in the school who are afraid of her as they know her to be a witch.  Once she has been cured she is taken to live with her uncle who is a witch but he refuses to cure her of his malady because he doesn't care to give her a cure.  The uncle then makes her perform a spell on the whole town to give them all a child and one that is only a little boy called "John".  John is the most innocent of the children and so the whole village is excited when they meet him and he is given to them as a little brother.  He goes out looking for food and finds only chickens which is why the girls in the village eat him and one or two boys in search of fun.  This movie has no sense of humor at all: it has the "trees falling" sequence from "The Wizard of Oz" where the girl is so excited about the trees falling around her that she gets very excited and cries, a lot.  I have also seen this movie and the guy who plays the little boy looks like he is 10 years old.  If you get this movie you have to be quick: when they get to the village, John tells them to go home but the teacher tells him that they won't and that they're going to kill John as he is very cruel.  Then the next scene is John as a grown man and he tells them that if they don't get rid of John, who he thinks is a child he will take out a knife on them all.  John has his little brother killed and takes off with the girls and the villagers to live a more innocent life.  How does the teacher know that John is a grown up and can kill?  The film also has a witch who comes down to kill one of the girls which she does.  So the teacher takes the little brother to kill the witch. But as they approach the witch the girl has a little demon come out of her head and attack the teacher.

"Battles!" I am not sure who the producer for this film is, because he comes across as very self-centered and not very bright.    He is the one that told us that we have to get the film screened in theaters, not that we had any money to do so.  He is also the one who is always complaining about how the movie is not good enough and how the plot will make a lot of money.  It may work for a lot people, but the idea is not very original.    In fact, the movie really has a lot more in common with the others that I have seen, and those other films can be found on YouTube and on the big screen.  At least this film has a real title and a name.  To make matters worse, this movie is also produced by this guy who thinks he can turn an ordinary movie into a blockbuster.  Why else would he use all the big stars and have such a cheap budget?   I give this movie a 0 out of 10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a huge fan of this movie. Its original title of "Shaolin Warrior" was good but after watching it a second time I noticed that the actual martial arts scenes were not so bad.   This was the first Kung Fu movie I saw since the first "Tiger" movie.  In "Shanghai Express" Kung Fu was used as a weapon of vengeance to bring a certain evil person to justice.  Shaolin Warrior is an adaptation of the popular comic book. It's very violent and the fights are all over the place.  If you like the Kung Fu movies you will like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping that this movie was going to be really good.  My expectations were sky high based on the trailer.    It's not a bad trailer...it's not even bad.  I thought this movie would be like the great movies of old, with a modern feel and some of the best special effects ever filmed.     The opening shots are really cool, and the movie builds quickly.  Then we meet our first antagonist, who seems to be from a different century, and I thought we were being told a new tale of justice...but then, the movie takes a nasty turn and the good characters are suddenly just plain stupid.  At this point, I was thinking that the movie was simply a piece of historical fiction and nothing more.  But as the movie went on, the story began to grow more fascinating, and we learned more about these characters, while the baddies slowly got more and more interesting.  My only real criticism about this movie is that it is a little too slow.  Even though the story is a good one, it could have been told quicker, and it was hard to follow.  It's a good movie in a bad situation, and that's not going to make a bad reviewer look good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was so disappointed about this film.  I mean I am not a big fan of horror films,  But the first few minutes of this movie   So what the hell do we got? There is a woman   who has been taken out in the woods by a mysterious group of characters.   This group of people are called "the hunters," and they seem to be looking for a woman named   Rose. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this one. It didn't get my interest and it didn't have an impact on me, but it did have an interesting concept. The "Mole" is a mole living in the dark underground tunnels that connect all the other tunnels that form a maze. He's always moving around and is always in search of something that makes him happy. There are various "Moles" that live in the "Maze". If you're stuck in the maze, you can call "Molotov" on them, they will throw it back at you. When the Mole was in the beginning of his adventure, he was able to find a way through the maze. It is said, if you find something that is important to you, it will make you happy. That was the Mole's goal to find something important that will make him happy, but he didn't find it. He was very bored, sad and thought about what he needs to do to find his things and find his happiness. However, he's always in the middle of the maze and never knows whether he's going to be safe or not. This is what makes this movie interesting. If you like horror films you'll like this. I gave it a 3.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie on opening night and it was a terrible film. It did not live up to the name. It was a pretty bad movie. There were very few things about this film that were interesting. The characters were all awful, the action was kind of boring and the ending was even worse. The only thing that kept me watching was the good ending. As it ended I had a few things to say about it. This movie could have been a great one but they decided to go for the less interesting ending to save face.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like to talk about how horrible a movie is, you'll be pleased to know it's a good one!  I think this is the worst film in the history of film.  And I've never heard of a company named The Little Rascals (which may be the reason this movie took so long to get out, since there are no actual pictures of the characters).  This is another example of a story about a couple who are very stupid.   I love the fact that the Little Rascal plays the role of the bad guy, but that's it.  When I was a kid, the Little rascals were part of the ABC family.  There was a guy named George the dog, who liked to play baseball.  My dad would always have to get the Little Ricky out of bed and play with him.  George's girlfriend, Nancy, always went off on her own to have fun, and George wanted to be like her (he'd been on the show).  But George had a bad habit of always getting his head wet or wet on a bed.  I remember his big black head sliding into the bed, causing Nancy to fall to the ground.  If only a doctor were there to see what happened to the Little Girl, instead of Nancy being told to go wash her face!   And when Nancy did wash her faces, she was shocked to find the Little Rick covered in lint.  So Nancy took it upon herself to go and get a towel.  Nancy has seen a lot in her life, so she did not immediately try to clean the little rascal, but instead she called some friends.  But it was not long until they arrived, only to find Nancy was already on the bed with the Rascal, the dog was still by the bed and was playing with the little girl.   Well, it would have been a pretty short film if I had to go on and on with such a horrible premise.  A woman is going to give a dog a bath, but the little Rascal jumps into her bath, causing a terrible accident.  The entire film is a poor excuse for making a good cartoon.  It just consists of a few short scenes, and all of them involving the Rascalian dog.  What's worse is that there is no rhyme or reason to the characters.  This is the kind of movie that could have been made by any company in the world
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ This is a terrible film. First it was the typical over-long, nonsensical story that I am sure many people who have seen a good story in a bad story will know. Not really much to say about the movie itself, but it is filled with all sorts of weirdness, weird ideas, and characters. The plot does not matter. It just goes on and on with no real purpose, other than to have a strange plot that keeps changing and changing while never really having a purpose. It all becomes very confusing after a while and the ending is kind of a letdown. I don't know about you, but that doesn't make me happy. _______________________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie will not work for anyone except an idiot.   I hope it is not made as a film for kids to play, because it really is stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have watched this film several times now as a kid and was in awe of the beautiful cinematography and story told by Roger Corman.  However, at least the movie still had some action that was enjoyable. Â The ending however ruined a great film and the ending will haunt you for years to come.  4 out of 5  The first "Alien" movie, is about the crew of the spaceship Nostromo being trapped on an alien ship.  This movie does have some pretty cool special effects that were amazing.    Also this movie would get great ratings until a few years later when it got a sequel.  In this movie, we see what happened to the ship after the crew were rescued by a spaceship known as the Sulaco.    2 out of 3  I do not think this movie is worth much.  The movie has the same premise as "Aliens", only this time you are stranded on a ship and you have to deal with the strange alien creature called the "Scuttle" and his little son.  When this movie came out, the movie was really well received as it had a lot of action scenes, but unfortunately there were a few problems.  To start off, the aliens are portrayed quite poorly. They are all over the place and they are so small they are all but invisible to the camera.  Also there is a lot more to this story than the movie suggests and it is quite boring and the movie gives us quite a lot to think about.  I did like the Alien as he is the only main character in this film and he was a great hero.  We should have had more Alien characters!   I hope to see more "Alien Movies" in the future as this has a lot better special effects, more action and a great story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had the potential to be so much more than its bland plot and characters. It was really well directed and it did a good job of capturing the essence of the film.  It did a nice job of telling the story without making it too convoluted and it really did capture the essence and atmosphere of the time.  The film did do an excellent job of portraying what you would have experienced during a typical night out in London. The film gives a feel what a typical Saturday night would have been like. It is well made but that is the only positive I can think of.  There was nothing really interesting about the main character and the movie seemed to be more about getting from point A to point B.  If it didn't have all these elements I might be inclined to give it 3 stars and call it a great time to be had out and about.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting this movie to be a mediocre slasher movie with a cheesy story telling and a decent performance from the lead man.  While this is certainly not the worst horror movie I've seen, it definitely is the most forgettable.    This movie really isn't anything else than a collection of stupid scenes.  At least it has two actors that aren't terrible.  If only one actor would have played a more interesting or more dangerous role, then this movie would have been a little more interesting.  While the story may not be anything special it's pretty cool to see an "adult" movie about a horror movie where the monster was created by a woman (who also plays the father of the teen).   I give this one a C+ and will probably watch a better movie someday (maybe another slasher or slasher in a movie like this).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to be straight up honest. I wasn't very interested in this movie. It seems like some of the actors weren't all that good, but it's all set in a small town. I can't see why anyone would want to live in a place like this unless they are a sociopath or had a really bad experience with a parent who was crazy.  If I'm really honest, I was hoping to see some more of the town.  In the end, I can see how people like to come up with such terrible things to complain about so I won't even go there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film! I'm a big fan of the TV show "The Muppet Show", and I watched it over the weekend and the second time I watched the film, I had to have it, I just couldn't get enough of it! The characters are all pretty good and I liked some of the characters. The actors are pretty good ( I think some of them are better than I thought) the music is all fine, nothing amazing...The movie is made for kids, which I have no problem with, it's kind of a silly movie...The first thing that I liked about the movie was that they put Muppet characters all in one room, and when they say a word, they all say it. The second thing I liked was the fact that they took all the Muppet Characters' dialogue and made their voices sound like they were being spoken by the animals. This was the funniest movie that I have seen in a long time!!! The funny thing is that these are all Muppets, and they sound like normal people. And the acting is so good, that I almost missed out on the first half, because I had already seen it. Overall, a good movie, good characters, very funny, very good acting, I love it, and I recommend it to you guys!

Miliuas John M Miliuf is back with his third "bad" movie. Like many other filmmakers, Milium seems to be stuck in a rut. This is especially true of the third "good" movie he produced in the last three years. This third "movie" is an un-original story about a man who wants to get his manhood back. One of the greatest American films of all time, The Good is about three soldiers who fall in with a band of outlaws called The Wild Bunch. They are joined by a bounty hunter named Tom Thumb (George Reeves), who is trying to retrieve a stolen watch. After Thumb is arrested, the two other Wild Buns are murdered. This leads to the two sides becoming enemies, and a series of battles and killings. There are a couple of scenes in which the movie tries to be as scary as possible. But they fail. John Miling's direction is the weakest of the three and the most forgettable. The rest of the cast doesn't fare much better. Jack Cassidy was a fine but over-acted "bad guy", with a voice so bad it may have been his own. Jack Palance is an aging leading man who seems to have gone mad, and his performance in this movie makes him look like a walking corpse. Jackie Gleeson seems to do little more than walk around for a while, and then jump into a fire. I am not sure if this movie should be considered a bad one or a mediocre one. But it really has no point, because it is both, at the same time. It is both a bad film and a mediocre movie. It has a lot of fun, but it is dull. It gives us the same old things we've seen a hundred times before. It tries to get away from the genre that has become so popular lately, but still
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I never would have given it a chance had it not been for the fact it was being shown on the television and on the movie screen in that manner.    It's like being in a train wreck.    The acting is terrible.  My wife and I didn't even care for the acting.  One of the other passengers actually had to yell at the actors to stop the screaming.  It was as if they were laughing too hard to notice what they were doing.  The ending was a total disaster as well.  A total waste of everyone's time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie takes a bunch of characters and forces them into a single story that just doesn't work out. It's not a bad film, but it isn't a very well made one either.  It's really just just a movie with a bad script. "What is wrong with me?" A film that tries to do a lot of things in one movie. It tries to have a great plot, an exciting soundtrack, a nice set, a great acting, and a great cinematography. And it just ends up being a bad story. There are just a lot too many characters and they all fall into one very simple plot. In fact, the plot is so simple that it should probably only consist of two characters: the young woman and her husband. They live in a house that is a bit out of the ordinary. It looks a little shabby, but then the couple decides to have their own little adventure. This is the only plot in the whole movie. But it's so basic that you could think that this was written and directed by a child. It was so simple, that I had a lot more to think about than in most other children's movies. I really wanted to like this film. I thought it was fun to watch. I liked the music and the scenery looked interesting. The whole thing was just so good. I was looking forward to it, but the more I watched it, the more disappointed I got. The story was good enough. The characters were interesting. I enjoyed it when I was done with it. It really was just a fun film. But I don't think it has much to offer.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a really bad movie. I was supposed to enjoy it, I was going to go to see this movie again and I was ready to leave.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is good. If you like the idea behind the movie, you can understand the plot. The art is great. The character design is great and the animation is pretty good. However, the execution is not that great. There is not much substance to this story and the writing is pretty lame.   As a side note, I also saw this movie on a Japanese channel on television. I'm afraid I didn't catch anything about the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ This is a very lame, weak film. For one thing, there's a lot of bad acting (I mean, there are parts where they are just bad actors!), the story is lame, and the ending is weak. However, I had been waiting for a good, action-packed flick to come out of the States for years. Finally, it appears! __________________________________________________________   This review contains mild spoilers. This movie takes place in the 1970s, but it looks like it's set in the 1980s. It's about a bunch of teenagers and a teacher. She's a very pretty girl and has a very big crush on the popular boy. One of the main characters is a girl who looks like she could be the next Audrey Hepburn, only to find out later that she's in fact a stoner. She has the misfortune of being a virgin, and when it comes time for boys to hit on her and propose to her, all she can say is "no, no, no". She's the only girl in the entire school to say no to all of the guys. One night, some of the boys decide to "take back" the girls from the stoners, so they pick out their target. The girl, the "girl next door" that she is, is a virgin! They take her to a seedy motel, and they decide to make her have sex with a man. The guy they choose is very tall and has very good sex-positivity. The story follows their sex life in the motel room, which gets more and more disgusting, until they end up having to do it on the floor. The final act involves them going to a house party. They meet a stoned woman who has a stalker! The ending is completely lame and leaves the audience asking "Who cares? It's only a film." - July 6, 2012_______________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of the worst films I've seen all year.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not so much about space as it was about a spaceship trying to land on Earth.  There are a couple good ideas, but even if there is a spaceship and a girl trying to help, the entire story seems like a very bad idea.  The badness of the plot gets pretty apparent the first few minutes when the spaceship flies in a little way too close to a mountain and the pilot has to do a quick about-face and fly a little further away to make a point.  This is not a very good sequence and the movie never really recovers from it.  But worse than the sequence is the movie's premise: that of a young woman trying to rescue the pilot from the earth's upper atmosphere.  Her idea is that she can use a jet pack to get to the pilot by jumping out the airlock.  And the problem with the idea is not that it is too stupid to work, but that the execution is so poor and stupid it is embarrassing.  As we see, she has to fall to her death in a tiny rocket in order to save the pilot.  Not because she is stupid, but because the pilot is stupid.  First, he gets in a fight with a giant robot, which she does not get out of, and then he loses control in a high-speed fight with the ship itself, which is pretty funny in its own right.  We get a lot of gags about people with superpowers but they aren't that interesting.  Even the main character's superpowers are never really explained.  Also, the whole thing is a disaster because nobody knows where to throw the rocket.  That could have been a great scene if not for the plot's stupidity, which causes the whole movie to end up just a huge joke.  Overall, the film just doesn't have enough going on to make it worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Tales from the Crypt Series is a series of movies that are so bad, they are actually good.  The first movie, Crypt Keeper  is the best.  The series is based on an obscure newspaper article about a crypt keeper, who gets caught up with the criminal world after being accused of stealing one of the largest known mummified human bodies and trying to hide it in a vault.  After a number of unfortunate events, he is framed for murdering two other mummies.  After being released, he has to find out who stole the body and why and kill them.  He does this all by himself and must survive through the mummies' own mummification rituals.  The story and characters are not great, but the film doesn't do anything worse than a mediocre old time serial with a few new twists added.   There is nothing to be said about the art or animation.  It does not improve over the original cartoon and is just an okay looking cartoon.  The sound is mediocre and the dialogue is not memorable.  This is a movie that should be watched by people with little interest in the cryptkeeper.  I found it hard to enjoy and I would not recommend it to a person who likes cryptograms or serial killers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is a great film from an awful film.  What is this movie?  Hulk.  (You might want to check out my review on The Incredible Hulk: The Animated Series )  (It is a funny film, but the animation was just bad, it is like they were trying to make an actual version of the Hulk movie from the cartoon.   )   I had a lot of fun with the film. The other thing I am glad about the film is it was made by Tim Burton.  It is a Burton movie.  But I do not know whether this was a good Burton movie or a bad Burton movie because it is not much different than the cartoon movie. The movie is about a boy named Jeff who lives in New Orleans. He has a dog named Kowal who is really cute.  Jeff and his dog hang out. Jeff falls asleep.  The dog comes and wakes him up by licking him.  They decide to go back to his house.  As they are getting in the car they get a car crash.  Apparently Jeff fell asleep and he was hit by the car.  Now Jeff is in a bad way.  He has been hit so bad he is not able to walk. Jeff has no idea how old he is.  His father thinks it is old because he is too bad to walk yet. Jeff's dad wants to take him to be the doctor of his town and Jeff wants to go to school.  When they get there Jeff's mom is mad at her son. She thinks he needs more attention.  So Jeff's parents decide to take Jeff to see a doctor. Jeff refuses to go and they leave. The next day Jeff's father asks his son if he was going to go. Jeff says he wanted to.  There is no doctor.  One of the guys in the town wants to be a doctor so Jeff is sent to him. The doctor says he is the best but Jeff asks why he wants to become a doctor and why he has the ability to do everything that the doctor has. The father tells him that Jeff needs more help. But Jeff says that he needs help because there is too much trouble in the world and everyone has problems.  This is when he realizes that he is a Hulk.  Then the doctor makes a deal with Jeff that he will turn Jeff into a Hulk if he comes to town to learn about medicine. The reason he does this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an old movie, which was used to illustrate how a bad family is brought down by the evil Stephenson. Unfortunately, this was a movie with a poor director, who could not make it interesting. The only good thing that was about the movie was the acting: it was quite good. A shame: we are not going to see much action from this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A "daddy's girl" who has a crush on a popular football player. A sad and funny story about a very poor family and a poor football player who is the son of a former "Daddys girl".  This film is so bad that it is sad that it's better than it's sequels (not bad) or if it made a bigger return (not really, not that good either). The film has an interesting story and is good at showing some characters and situations, but I think its most entertaining and funny parts are when it's a football game and the "dad-daughter" relationship and the rivalry between the coach's daughter (the football player) and the popular daughter of the family. The movie is also good at using the "bad" characters in some funny ways and this movie is definitely worth a watch only if you like football, a good story, and a bit of a comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story:   I had hoped that my second go-round with 'Masters of Horror: The New Masters of Horror' would at least be entertaining, but it was very, very boring. The film is essentially a series of short movies in which the actors and actresses perform some of the most ridiculous horror tropes known to humankind. From the very first scene, when the 'curious monster' makes its way into a small room, with its creepy-ass eyes staring at us, to its final transformation into a monstrously large creature in which it must hang upside down as it sucks the blood out of its own mouth, this film is nothing short of nauseating. It has almost no tension to be found anywhere. It's all pretty much a very very very, VERY long sequence of gore and disgusting images.   What this really shows, I think, is just how little attention the producers put into their 'films'. Sure, they have to make money, and they try to make an entertaining viewing experience, but if they are going to try to sell themselves as some kind of experts at horror cinema, then maybe they could have at least made an effort to make a pretty decent horror movie. As it stands, 'Majors of Horror 1: New Masters' feels like a lot of people at the same bar going 'Well, what did you guys think about the new 'Friday the 13th'? Well, we sure didn't. We're not really too sure about it either' It's a complete mess.   the plot:   a bunch of people show up at a house at a Halloween party, they're all looking for 'The Boogeyman'. Well, they soon find out this boogeyman is really a girl they've never heard of called Jessica. So they think they've found their 'Boogeyman' and now they just need to get her home. But instead of Jessica running off to her friend's house (where she's supposed to be all by herself at Halloween time), she decides to 'come out of the closet' to the house next door, and try to start a relationship with this guy. It doesn't go that well at all. The thing is that she's just too embarrassed to say she's gay, which the producers clearly didn't think was a good idea. Well, there are a bunch more problems that crop up in this film, but most of them are too stupid to get in the way of this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A couple of interesting ideas are used for one movie, but nothing happens and the plot doesn't make much sense to me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a total waste of time. The storyline doesn't make any sense and a bad acting cast makes the movie one big joke to watch. This movie features some of the worst CGI and the acting is awful as well. A bad joke for the audience to watch on TV
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have had a lot of bad movies in my time and this is one of them. It is one long movie with no beginning, middle, or end and it really is bad. The plot of the movie seems like a crazy story with the guy in the boat, the girl in the blue dress who is a virgin, the boat being attacked by sharks, a girl with a broken arm and a girl in a black dress with her head covered and she has no eyes, and the boat landing on a rock, and that the boat is destroyed after she is attacked by a shark and when she is lying there, she can hear her dead sister screaming, but she cannot get up or move and it is horrible. And after all of that I have to say that it is a good movie to watch if only to watch the girl with the broken arm. I have watched a lot bad movies, but this is the worst one I ever saw.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a bad story that doesn't work very well or make sense because, of all the characters, he seems to have the most development throughout the whole movie, which I guess doesn't make much sense, but I will go on.  One of my favorite scenes from the movie is in the movie when he talks about the death of his grandfather.  The grandfather of the protagonist is a very nice and nice old man who is the main character in the story.   This man is a loving father and has lots of grandchildren, who is a sweet boy. He is very fond of his granddaughter, and in fact, she has just been born to him.  His granddaughter is just as sweet, but she is more of a boy.  She is much less like him, and is a much smaller child, and I mean really tiny.  Her tiny body and small body size causes him to worry.  After the grandmother dies, the man is grieving and decides to take his granddaughter and move back to the old house in the country.  It is also revealed that he is a bit of a pothead who uses a huge quantity of drugs and is on a bad streak.  A very long time is passed by, but soon after the grandmother's death, his granddaughter seems to grow up.  I do not know how he finds her after a long while, but then she turns into a normal little girl, and he can't find her for days.   One day a new little girl named Marnie comes up.    Marni is also a nice little girl and is like his little sister.  And then one day Marnies father takes her to a party and he accidentally hurts her.  The girl is in a lot of pain and then we find out that it is because of a huge spider that had just crawled into her mouth.  Now she is the center of attention of the main protagonists and they are determined to find out what has really happened to her.   Another reason I liked this movie is because it had a very different ending to other movies.  In all movies other than horror movies, the villain usually dies, usually in a very painful way, usually by a very violent means.  This movie is not like that, the girl is very brave and stands up for herself when she is in danger of being attacked by a spider.    But it would seem that she is about to be eaten when she gets a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This one is so terrible, it makes me sick. I am not sure if it was filmed on an iPhone, or if it's just bad quality.  The entire movie is set in a trailer park (complete with a "Welcome To The World Of Trailer Park Boys") and you are forced to watch some of the worst video games ever.  So a few trailers from all the "trailer park" guys in the back of a pickup truck... And, in the last shot, it looks like one of the guys is driving, but he's in a wheelchair! The trailer parks are littered with cheap cars, all of which have a terrible radio.   But that's all you can expect from a series set in Trailer Park, where people like the one in the car are the norm.  In addition, there are many scenes set in the trailer park, including these two:  If there's a reason why they're called "trailers" this should have been one of them.  Unfortunately, it gets worse, as the movie makes no attempt to disguise the fact that the show is about people stealing things, taking drugs, selling them, and doing whatever they want while having the time of their lives.  The plot is simple.  It's about the trailer Park Boys, and as the series goes on they will become more and more pathetic.  But it isn't just the Trailer Park people that are a bad bunch.  There are some terrible people in the real world, who all happen to be on the show.  They are:   the trailer park owner who runs a junk shop,  the guy who looks like he went to a funeral, the girl who wears glasses and is a stripper, the homeless guy who has a big sign that says "Welcome to the Trailer", the guy with a beard and glasses, the kids, the people that live in the trailers, and the guy in the wheelchair.  So many horrible stereotypes!   The worst people in this movie are the trailer dwellers.  Each one of their trailers is either a complete disaster (the guy with glasses, you just know the trailer is going to end badly), or the trailers themselves are in complete disrepair.  I'm not sure who they were supposed to portray, and it all just came off as a bunch of people who live in a rundown trailer park.  You can see how these trailer people become lazy, and desperate
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a couple of reasons why this movie is horrible: The movie looks like something a bad teenage movie should do, as bad as the worst teen movies are.   The movie doesn't have a "plot", nothing makes sense.  It takes a bunch of kids and forces them to play games, and then in the end, they get a party to their house and there's a party, and now that's the plot.  This movie is just bad.  I've seen worse, and this is just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's the kind of movie that makes people say, "I don't like horror movies." I did like the ending, but the rest was just...bad.  As for that whole plot that is supposed to be the end of the movie...you know, I don't see how it works. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In case you are unfamiliar with the movie, it is based on the novel by Joseph Heller which was a big success and later a huge flop. I'm pretty sure everyone in the audience knows about the terrible movie because it is not known in any movie halls in the US. It was also based on a true story and there are several scenes that you can't imagine. There is a scene in which a character walks around the streets at night with his dog and the dog jumps on to the back seat of a car and the vehicle starts to drive slowly. The dog jumps off and the car goes off the road. The vehicle falls down a hill and is buried underneath a large pile of rubble. It must have been a difficult scene to shoot because all the lights in the place had to be in the exact right positions. There are some really odd angles and this is a film that I would not recommend to the slightest degree to people of any age. It is simply not suitable for anyone who is not familiar with it. The movie is about a man who is a junk dealer and tries to sell junk guns to gangsters and gangsters buy junk guns and then shoot them down. When a police officer tries to stop one of these gangsters he uses a gun which he had just bought for $400. He then takes a revolver and shoots the officer to death. This is pretty much a story of how a man kills his superior and then tries to kill himself. It really doesn't make sense. The only reason I could think of was that this is the true story of a gun dealer who was in the Navy in World War I. He was awarded a Purple Heart but had the brass shell of the bullet blown out. He kept that as a trophy. The gun that he uses to shoot his officer has an ejection port. When the officer jumps, the gun goes off, wounding him quite badly. He dies later and the gun that was used to shoot him is found. In the end, the man kills himself because he is tired of having to lie to people, even the police. But the thing is that this has nothing to do with the gun! I wish I could tell you that it is only a gun with an ejector port but it is the same gun that is seen in all the other scenes in the movie. There were some scenes in this movie that you just cannot imagine. It doesn't help that it also has some stupid special effects. I can only say that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a terrible movie with the same script as another bad movie ( I will only refer to that other movie to avoid making a direct comparison).  The actors were all good, except for the two "bad boys" and the bad lady, but the bad girl really ruined the movie for me. It is like a big pile of rotten garbage, a piece of paper cut in half to make it look like a movie. I really can't remember what the movie was about, it all has bad writing and bad acting. A big pile if garbage. So go see a good movie, maybe a good horror movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A decent little comedy that doesn't really have anything to do with the main plot and has a nice little plot twist at the end. I like that the movie tries to keep the kids together with their father, it's a nice touch and I wish we got more of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not bad, not great... The acting was okay.  There was a good plot, that ended with a twist, that was not totally satisfying... And, to go along with the low rating, the sound effects were pretty bad, as was the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has all the features of a bad film in every way possible. The acting is bad. The story is terrible. The only thing about this movie that's good is the music which was so bad I literally wanted to vomit. Overall I would not recommend this movie to anyone who would like to see bad movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting and the screenplay by Michael Lehmann are very amateur.  They all seem to have never seen a real movie before and as a result they are incapable of doing anything that is even remotely interesting.   The plot is almost incomprehensible and they are all doing the same kind of shtick over and over again.    The most hilarious thing about this film is that all of the characters look like they have been plopped down into a bad 80s movie.  This film is about a guy who is a former pro wrestler and now works in the front desk at a casino.  It is quite funny in the way that the character (who does not appear to be a real person) constantly has to get his way with women and also with the casino and the women.  The casino has a very nice view of the ocean (though the ocean is very small and you can't see much of it), and it really makes it feel like you are in a casino, which I suppose is part of the magic. The most annoying thing about the whole thing was that it was in color and not black and white. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You can only imagine what goes through their minds when the film is not only poorly shot but a huge disappointment. They have nothing to write a review about here. The film starts off with a little girl, Alana, who is about to marry her uncle, a well known pirate, but she is kidnapped by a witch. Alana's friend, Kiki, finds her trapped in a barrel and the girl ends up being turned into a mermaid. We cut to the future, where Alana is trying to escape from her life as a merfolk. She finds out that this witch is none other than the witch of the sea, who has become a big influence on her life. With the help of a sea creature named Ariel, Alanna and her mermaid pal return to the present time, where she is going to live with her aunt. Kiki and Alanna live happily with each other and become close friends. It's nice seeing how the friendship between the girls develops over the course of the movie. But as we are introduced to this strange world of mermaids and humans, we also find out that there are some things the two worlds can't agree on. For instance, Alara, who believes that only the human side of the relationship can survive, has decided to drown her aunt and the world in a huge tidal wave. Ariel, who loves humans, is the only one able to stop the wave. And then there is Alana who thinks of going home to her family and is torn between this choice and the fact that she wants to stay with Ariel and her friends forever. The ending of the film leaves quite a bit to the imagination. We never truly know what happened to Alana after the sea witch's attack, and this movie is very reminiscent of the classic horror films. I liked the film but not as much as I would've liked.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so excited to see this movie.  It was the first movie of a new series that was being developed by a producer who is not really familiar with the genre of crime dramas and he doesn't even try at all to do a good job of it.  The character of Mike is the classic "no frills" cop.  He is always serious and he seems to be a good man with good intentions but he is a bad cop. There are numerous scenes where he is dealing with two or more criminals at the same time who are trying to escape in a car and he is unable to get them out.  The only possible reason why he is able to keep them at bay is the fact that all of them are wearing masks but he still takes them down one by one without them noticing. The only good thing that can come out of this movie is the use of the "tear gas" as an alternative to lethal force which in real life would be a completely wrong choice of tactics but it is done with such subtlety that nobody will notice it. I know there are probably many criminals who are very bad people who might not be able to be apprehended by a good officer but if they were all wearing masks, I wouldn't believe that it is that easy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the first movie I have watched in which the entire movie could have been cut to make an original film. The only good part is the title, and some of the actors (in particular, a young one) have a good performance. The characters are all very unrealistic and the dialogue is very stupid, especially at the end.  I could not find a reason to see this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!This movie was a bad idea from start to finish. I did not laugh once during this flick and no matter how many times I said how funny the story is, I just kept thinking it would end up being another mindless comedy. I know how much the director tries to make the movie as funny as possible, but all it gets for it is a bad laugh, and a very boring ending. Not only is it boring, but it is also very repetitive and boring. The only funny part was when the director would throw in some goofy dialogue at the end. The worst part is how unengaging this movie is from beginning to end, and how bad the acting was. I could not believe how the acting and the storyline just does not hold up, at all. This movie will surely make your skin crawl, but if you really want to laugh, you probably should get a hobby, and not waste your time. I hope you enjoyed this review.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't say I enjoyed this film at all. It was just lame and a complete let down to me.  The script was awful and the acting was laughable.   They had a very young child in it, who is a typical dumb teenager and they used her a lot.  I just cannot see a way to make a decent movie out of such an obviously awful script and poor acting and I don't know if they did because I couldn't see anything interesting. The cinematography was mediocre.  The actors seemed to have no talent and you never saw anything interesting about them.  This movie was like being bored in class and then going home to watch the same movie every time!  I mean it seems very obvious to me that this movie was written by a high school kid, who went to film school in high school and didn't understand what made films work or to be good.  That's what happened here!  All we get to see is the two of them talking about nothing at all and then they run away from their friends and then fight.  A real shame since I was so looking forward to seeing this stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The problem here is that this movie is so bad, and this bad is all the more offensive because of its inherent low value. If it were not for the fact that it is part of the genre-parody genre (which is a genre where only a very few bad movies are put together to make a whole bunch of mediocre ones), I would have laughed my head off when I saw this movie. The movie starts off innocently enough, with a little girl falling down a well and getting saved by her mother. From there the movie devolves to an endless series of gags about the poor girl and her mother, which I suppose is all right. All of this gets rather tiresome after a while, but then we have this: - A woman (I believe it is a lady) comes up with a theory that the well-traveled Mrs. M. Moulding was hit by a train. I don't know about that, but it sounds interesting. - The poor girl is now the wife of a local farmer (who is not a farmer; we never find out, though we could have guessed). The wife has a baby. The child is now a little person, who does not look all that impressive. It is quite possibly this that leads to the movie's downfall. There are other little characters (I'm not sure how many, if any) who come and go. They are all rather annoying. The story begins again about a woman who is in the process of divorce, while she stays in a town that is not in the village, but instead someplace entirely different. Here, the wife, and the children, live in a house. The wife is a little lady. One day Mrs. H. is killed, and all of the children have a very good time while playing, laughing and eating cakes and fruit. A little old man comes over to the farm in a boat. He gets very excited when he sees one of the little people, so he takes them away and puts them in a glass jar (where they remain until the end of the movie). In his boat, as he is trying to set the jar down on the bank of the well, Mrs. W. comes out. Mrs. V. comes into the village to visit the husband. Then Mrs. G comes and joins the other children. She plays with the doll for a while. And finally Mrs. S comes. Mrs S plays with a doll. The little doll is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The thing is, you don't have to like it. And I am not even going to pretend I like it!   I know! The movie is so bad that I have a hard time believing it came out the way it did.   One thing that really bugs me about this movie is that it has two versions of the opening.  In the first one the film shows a couple on a train and they talk about their children and life.  At the end of the film they pull out of the train and start walking into the woods.  I suppose this could possibly be taken as something positive and interesting.  The second version is a more dramatic version.  It shows a lot more violence and nudity.  This version does not show the couple leaving the train, so why is the violence worse?  I don't know.  That being said, it still manages to be bad.    The two versions were released in 1991, but in 1991 there was absolutely nothing else out there for me to watch.  There were no comedies, no thrillers, no romances, no horror movies, no action films, no anything.  These were all the movies I could find that were not about cars or guns or violence.  And while I do get that the original film was a commercial flop, in all fairness it was at least entertaining.  I would recommend this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is basically just bad.   When I was about 5-6 I had a neighbor's family who lived down the road from me. Her parents and a few of their friends used to run a bar. Every Friday night the whole neighborhood gathered in their front yard to watch, the drinks were cheap and pretty decent and they played some of the classics of the '40s. At one point, this one young guy came running through the yard, all excited, holding a girl in one hand and the other hand holding a gun. He said he had a big gun and she wasn't his type. "You never had any girl?" "I've got a gun but she doesn't really want to leave her house." The guy was clearly in a hurry and as soon as he finished talking the girl took off running. After a few seconds she stopped at the top of the yard and turned to her attacker. "Who are you?" "My name's George. I'd like to know if you have a gun." "Not now. I'm just going to watch you run around," she said.   of course he ran.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was a huge fan of this movie, so much so that I had to buy this and play the soundtrack for years. However, it's a pretty weak film, and doesn't even have a decent story that it should have a story, its just a bunch of jokes and random shit that will get stuck in your head. It's not a movie worth a rewatch. Not good enough to count as a cult classic!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    An interesting concept, but the lack of anything really "good" to go around makes it more of a "fun idea" than an actual movie. The movie itself is pretty bland and very short (about 1/3 of it). But then you have some sort of robot cat that is just supposed to walk and talk, and there are no other creatures or characters besides the cat that are interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like the idea of a kid, a little bit odd, and a crazy, out-of-control killer running around in a horror movie, go back and watch "The Killer Inside Me." It's good horror. I'm a sucker for an off-kilter movie like this, which is exactly what I was hoping for.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________. In this sequel to a pretty decent and amusing comedy, we are not only introduced to a very silly "fairytale" about a young girl and her doll who goes on an adventure and saves people from an evil villain, but a lot of the jokes are funny even if it is just a bad joke on an otherwise entertaining movie. However the story is just not funny at all, and the acting and direction was not very great. The movie is mostly a long gag-fest but it is a very good joke. The only problem in the whole movie is that there are too many people and their voices are not very natural, like you can hear their breath. If you like to laugh at things like a good movie, this is a good one.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Truly a classic.  No, I don't mean the best movie ever made or some such nonsense.    I do mean that this is one film that, should it ever come out for DVD, I'd happily sit down and watch over and over again.    For a movie that was once a cult classic, we're treated to a lot of fun.  I think, at the time, its intended audience was a younger generation of viewers that would have loved it.  This isn't an incredibly difficult film to watch, but it certainly does take a lot out of you (the movie actually had a really high rating in some countries and I think one of the reasons it has been given so little attention is simply that it was only released in the United States).   The movie follows a young soldier named Corporal Jim (played by the great Tom Selleck) as he's serving his country at Fort Bliss in Texas.  It's during this time that he begins a friendship with a young American woman (played in the movie by the stunning Loretta Young), who shares his passion for the Army and the war.  A few days after returning from the mission, Corporal Sellek and the women go to a bar to celebrate her birthday and as they're dancing, Corporations daughter, Maggie, takes notice of her father, and, being a bit of an attention hog, takes a liking to Maggie.  Soon after this, Maggie takes the girls to her house (they go there a lot, just to talk).  The next day, Maggie comes home with her father in tow to her bedroom where she finds a photo album with Maggie's picture on one side and Selleks father's on the other.  As the movie progresses, it shows Maggie and her father growing closer and closer, and Maggie actually starts dating one of Selleaks fathers soldiers, John.  The two have a fairly normal romantic relationship and are married.  After Maggie and John's son is born, Maggie and Sells ex-wife make it official and they divorce.  Maggie decides to stay in the army with Sells father, but then John leaves and comes back with his own son, Johnnie.   So in essence, Maggie is now living with Sellecks father and the two men seem to be happy with each other, and with Maggie.   The problem arises when Johnnie has a few run-ins with the local townspeople for

The characters are not even interesting, the story is not clever, the plot is poor, and the acting is bad. The one bad thing about this movie is that the vampires are really pretty, but they are stupid. It is a great idea, to make them so pretty, that we can't feel anything about them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******************************* I was pretty sure this film was going to be a bad flick when I saw the poster for it. What I did not have a great grasp on was the characters. They seem like people you'd see at a car wash. They all dress in old school clothes (and one of them is a stripper). They also wear t-shirts that are pretty much the same as other t-shirt you'd find in a carwash. They're the kind you'd only find in an older car wash, but no one has thought to make t- shirts in the past five or ten years. The girls seem to have it hard, as I'm sure does the guys, but I'm not sure the men are doing enough to support these girls. They are all in their teens, and when I say teens, I mean they are not all of high school yet (some seem to be in elementary school). They seem to get drunk and do drugs and then they get into trouble. They get shot in the head and then the men beat the crap out of them. It really doesn't make sense and I found myself wanting to go to the cinema, just to see the ending. I was going into the cinema hoping I wouldn't like it. I'm glad I did.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is crap.  It should have been called  Dirty Little Black Boy.  No offense, I like that name.  It is a really  dirty and unpleasant movie.  Its a black and white story about a black boy being taken to a white family.  They do not seem to care very much about him.  The parents are abusive to the boy.  But,   it is a movie that is very good for kids.   The black child is shown to be a good   boy.   The blacks have all sorts of things they like to do,  like   playing   pranks on the whites.  I do not know why a black would do this.  At the end of the movie the child, the "black boy",   is   killed by the whites because he wants his father back.  That is not my favorite movie. The worst part of this movie is that   one of the characters,  has   a black friend .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "There were more interesting films in the 1970's, but this is among the worst.  It's just awful.   It was a mistake for the writer to choose the name of "The Green Room".   I would have chosen something less provocative like "The Rude Orgy".  They were both about people who go to a room to have "a little fun".  The guy who goes to the room is in a coma and his partner just shows up with a bottle of "Green Room" and tells him it's green.  But in the morning when he goes to a party with his family it's been changed to purple and then, it's purple and green.    It's just bad.  It should not be a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* This is a fun, fast-paced adventure movie that takes place in 1920s New Orleans during the time of the Black Plague. It's a fun tale about a pair of brothers, a young preacher and his pet snake, and their adventures and misadventures, not to mention the beautiful city of New Orleans. It makes for a good time with a catchy tune, and the movie does a good job of keeping the audience happy and interested. There are two main characters in this film, a preacher and a young man named Billy. Billy is a young black man who has a talent for prophesying, and he is often called upon to come and give his predictions of the future. In this particular movie, the Reverend John Brown (who played Billy) is trying to set up his flock as an army of followers. Reverend Brown is a man who is more than a little arrogant, and it is he who seems to make the most people go away, especially the younger generation, who are the target of Reverend Brown's preaching. Billy, however, seems to have a different opinion. Billy's sister-in-law, Aunt May, is very attractive, and one day Billy's mother says that Aunt May is coming home in the evening. Billy goes out to look after his pet, a white French poodle called Gussie. Unfortunately for him, Gussie gets hitched to Aunt May's cousin, a nice Southern white lady by the name of Lucy. Soon afterward, Gisez goes to visit Aunt May in town, and she soon realizes that it is not Gussie that is going home, but the devil in human form. After the devil visits Uncle Harry (who, remember, is her cousin's husband), Aunt May starts to get very frightened, and in the middle of her spooky visit, Billy has the idea to throw a spell on the devil. However, Billy makes a mistake, and accidentally casts a spell that brings the devil to life. The devil then attacks Aunt May (who had fallen in love with him), and the two have to fight the demon and his demon lover until Billy shows up at the end and casts the devil back into the world of the living. It is easy to see why the film is sometimes described as a horror film - the devil is scary, the witches are scary, and there is a scene where Aunt May and the devil are all huddled together in the woods, but they all soon get over it and grow happy and playful together

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first and last time doing a horror movie. This was a very lame movie. It had all of the "horror" elements in it, and didn't really do anything new with it. I would've preferred something like The Blob instead of this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It looks like a bad rip off of this film.  The film was a remake of the 1980's film. The only difference between the two is, this film comes out in 1989.  The film revolves around a boy named Jaxon, a "bully" of the neighborhood.   Jaxson was picked by the headmaster to be a part of the football team.  His big dream is to make it to the NFL!  After the first season, his team comes in third place of the league.  The next season, he is forced to quit the team.   The new coach, Mr. McPhee, is an old friend of Jax's and also an ex-NFL player.  They have a rivalry and the story is told from Jaxis point of view.  It has a very poor story telling and I think it is one of the worst things ever put on film.   As for the rest of the players, the story just follows the same plot lines they went through in the first part of this series.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't like this movie very much. It took me three attempts to see it. I finally understood why it got good reviews, because it is about a man who is in love with a beautiful woman who wants him to get married. They are married and living in a small town. I would not be surprised if that couple were in a gay relationship. There was a big problem. I never understood why the woman would not let the man use the bathroom in her house. I think the fact that the husband was a doctor gave the woman some protection in that respect. The man is a very sickly kind of a man. The story was pretty good. I wish that this story could have been turned into a play instead of being the basis of a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original director for the movie, Brian DePalma, had no intention of making a sequel to his "Scream" and "New Nightmare" movies. That being said, he went off the rails a bit in "Halloween 2", not unlike the original in that the movie tries to have too much going on at once, but it doesn't really work. The plot is not what you'd expect from a Halloween sequel and the characterizations are not up to par. The story revolves around the fact that the ghosts (and the rest of the undead) have taken over a house on a quiet residential street and is a bit creepy and the ghosts and the undead keep killing a few children. When the husband and wife who live there try to kill the children off as well, they are chased back and forth by the undead. The zombies seem more like walking ghosts than zombies. There's also a lot of violence and the movie goes from being a horror film to a buddy movie within a few minutes. It feels somewhat out of place as a zombie film as the movie itself is pretty damn funny. "Hitchcock" is definitely not bad but it's definitely not "good" and it's just not for everyone. "The Hills Have Eyes" also has a bad "plot" but is much funnier than "Halloweens" and just as much fun.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to confess that I found this film to be utterly repugnant. If you are a fan of the genre, or if you think "Honey, it's a boy!" is a funny idea to begin with, you will be able to ignore the fact that it is a completely bad movie. It consists of a group of people coming over to an island, to watch some fireworks, because they're tired of the usual summer parties. One of the women (the only woman in the film) starts getting into trouble, and soon gets caught on a boat with one of the islanders. It is revealed that she is in love with one, which is an entirely normal and common occurrence, as it happens in all romantic comedies. However, once the islander sees how badly she is treated, and the fact she is a virgin, his interest goes away. We learn later that the island has a whole secret society. This is very strange. The only thing this film does well is that it has a few sex jokes and some bad language. It also shows a good deal of nudity, though only two full frontal scenes, and nothing sexual. The rest is not very interesting. The islanders are not very amusing either. I have the impression that this is intended as a kind of a "Halloween Night" film, since the island is full of horror elements. As far as the girls' behavior is concerned, the island seems rather idyllic. There is only one or two characters I liked a lot - "Leila". They are quite cute. Overall, I gave it a score of 4 out of 10. If your only idea of fun is seeing women in swimsuits, and if you enjoy this kind of "Cabaret" type movies, you should think twice before making this movie a part of your regular routine.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this to be one of the most boring movies I have ever watched. I mean that in a good way...it's boring and tedious!  The title alone, makes it sound like a horror film, but it is not. It's a movie where we see a young boy named Tommy. Tommy lives in a small town. His family is poor and the adults around them are racist, mean, and uncaring. As a result, Tommy suffers from a constant loneliness.  When Tommy meets a girl named Sue (whom he later falls in love with), they get close and begin talking about life together, school, and their future.  They both share their concerns over school and society, which causes them to quarrel.   Then one day Tommy's parents are killed. His friends go with him to their church, hoping to pray, but instead they are captured by zombies (kind of similar to the undead in the first movie, I think).  Tommy is a little lost but tries to escape the town by finding his parents' grave. In the grave he finds a little piece of paper with the words "Sue, you're so smart, you think of all the things!" and a picture of Tommy and a girl. He tries to take a photo of them and send it to his girlfriend, but then... "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!"  As Tommy tries to flee the zombies in a pickup, he is struck by lightning. He is then sent to a hellish world where he is tortured by demons. After a few hours Tommy has learned enough and fights back against the demons.  At one point, he gets his revenge by throwing a demon into the lake and killing it, only to have it pop out of the water and attack him again.  The film ends with Tommy walking on a bridge, with a bunch of demons running after him.  I mean, the first one is pretty cool, but the second one was really annoying!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one of the biggest Hollywood flops of all time, The Fast and the Furious (2001) is a movie based on a book about the same name written by former Hollywood editor, Vincent Ward (Michael Pena), based on the books written by the late Paul Walker, the movie focuses on Dominic Toretto, Dominic's best friend and fellow gun runner who is a veteran of some of the wildest car chases in the history of the world. Dominic and his sister (Jessica Alba) are hired to steal a car used to transport illegal alien criminals. This job goes badly when the car is hijacked by a bunch of Russian mobsters (Ivan Drago, Dolph Lundgren and Raffaello Gemignani, to name a few) who want the car to transport a deadly package. When Dominic tries to stop the vehicle, he finds himself at the mercy of the ruthless gangsters who have the car loaded with explosives. It only gets worse when the Russian mobster who has become an unwitting accomplice to his own deaths (in my opinion) begins to play a game of cat and mouse with the other gangsters that are trying to prevent Dominic from fleeing with the car. The film is a hodge podge of old-time Hollywood, sleazy movie stars, and just enough violence to make it seem exciting. The Fast And The Furious would've been a better movie had its director, Justin Lin, not thrown in a couple of bad jokes at every opportunity. (The scene where Lin's character is talking on the phone to his girlfriend, who is also his co-star in a film, and ends up having sex with her while a helicopter hovered over him, is one of my absolute favorite cinematic moments ever.) The plot is nonsensical and doesn't really make sense, and is not really as funny as you might think it is. I won't give it a score less than 3, it is worth the price of admission just for this one scene.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is about a group of high schoolers getting a Halloween prank, but their plan was a complete disaster.  They went out to the parking lot after a party for a "haunted house" and had a great time playing around.  When they went to the house they discovered they were trapped inside a horror film set, with ghosts.  While they were stuck in the house, the house became haunted, and they were hunted by the evil spirit who was looking for a human sacrifice, who is played by one of my favorite actors in this genre. I'm not sure if any of the teens on the show could actually make it as a professional stuntman, but I enjoyed the show and enjoyed watching it. The only problem that I had with it was that a lot of times I would find myself thinking "Well, this movie really is creepy" or "I'm sure that when they go into the house the movie is really dark" because it is so dark and scary, so much so that I really don't think that anyone could survive all of it.  I don't believe that they have to pay to see a bad horror movie, so I just have to watch my money at the door.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie in the beginning of my third week of work. I had a couple more beers to finish a beer. I was really looking forward to the movie. I am just about tired and I could care less about the movie so I can get ready for my shift. The movie starts well but then it gets really bad. I know the movie is supposed to be made with a horror theme. It was supposed to follow a serial killer. But all the time he was watching the camera. The killer is a man dressed like an old lady. He looks like his real life. I really was very interested in this movie. The story was so exciting, so much action. I liked a lot of the characters and it was pretty well done. Unfortunately this is one of the most poorly made movies I have ever seen. It is almost a mess of bad acting, badly written dialogues, bad effects, bad acting and a bad plot. There are some plot problems that are really bad. The best example is the serial killer being very good at escaping. They all keep changing the plan to make it harder to catch them and they are all so dumb they cannot do that. The serial killer is supposed too watch the camera but he only watched the lens. There is a guy with some strange eyes and the serial was able to watch his eyes just as much. He also looked like a big old lady but I can't remember the name. The girl in a black dress was really weird. The main character is in the house with a man who wants to kill them and the people they are trying to save. But there are a lot more bad things. This movie really takes a lot out of the audience. There were a couple of great songs and the movie was exciting. It should have been the first movie to hit theaters but the producers wanted to make a big blockbuster so they didn't make a better movie. One of the problems of movie makers is that they should not make the movies too good. I have a good idea how bad this movie is. I don't have to show you.   I'm done with this movie now. It made me angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure I'd buy this movie in a million years. It starts out very promising, but quickly becomes a train wreck. The story starts off well enough, with two guys trying to break into a house with a huge sum of money. But they need to get by first. This is the kind of movie you watch to get to know people you didn't know. It gives us a look inside these two guys' lives, their struggles and their attempts to succeed. Then something happens to them that sets them on a path of destruction. It may not seem like a great movie, but it was a lot of fun to watch, and even still is a pretty good rom-com. I did wonder how the other half of the "hits" were going, but I really didn't care about any of them. I think the movie was written by a guy who was into "Pineapple Express." The dialogue was very cheesy, but the acting was good. It reminded me of a "Peyton Place" movie. So if you like that kind of thing, it's not a bad watch. I'm pretty sure I could've watched it all day long. It would be a lot funnier if the rest of the movie were like "The Love Bug" (which I do), but no. If you really like to see two people fighting with each other, this one could be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I have ever seen, in my humble opinion of course. A movie about a group of high school students and the girls' basketball team. They all want to be the next Michael Jordan. Well not really the Jordan, but the one who has the most athletic body and can play the fastest. One night, as they go to a basketball game, things get a little out of hand. The girls are a bunch of slobs. They drink from the fountain of youth. The whole movie consists of this and then some more. I mean the worst movie ever.  I don't even remember why these girls are in the movie. It takes like, 4 minutes for the first time they are all there. I was confused at first how it was done. Why they were there and how was that all done? Oh man. Just make it stop. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________ In this first installment of the new "Babylon 5" reboot series, we learn that the story is to be a one-hour drama. This was supposed to be some great new science fiction with new ideas and new characters, and, frankly, was all I got out of it. (Not counting a few great special effects moments in a few minutes.) But, it didn't deliver enough for me. It seemed as though the producers were more concerned with the ratings at this point in time. At a very low budget and a lot of "spaghetti" scenes and dialogue and not a lot else, it was just a really bad time. It was a little disappointing. But, I've heard it can get pretty good at a certain point in it, so that is still possible. _______________________________________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a well-acted movie from a guy who has an acting resume that would shame any of the other movie stars of the last twenty-five years. This movie is about a couple that is in the beginning stages of a great friendship, a friendship that is the focus of the movie. They just moved into a house together.   Now I realize that is a basic plot point that you can use for just about any kind of movie. But this movie has an extra layer to it. It really takes a lot of patience to see the two people slowly develop a friendship, and it ends very beautifully.   the plot is a bit simple and is really all about the couple, and their house. It's not very sophisticated or complex either. It has a strong relationship between the couple and their home, and the scenes are filled with a beautiful light and airy quality. I've seen many movies that have very strong, beautiful, and well-constructed plot points, but this movie feels very unique because it doesn't really feel like a movie at all, it feels like a series of simple scenes that are slowly and gradually built up. it also takes some liberties with the real-life relationship that the two share. the house is not really an ideal setting to get to know someone and be introduced to their home for the first time.   and you have to remember that this is a movie about a two people who are in a terrible time of their relationship. and that two people are very different from each other. There are so many differences between them that it really feels like the movie is only about the friendship and the two getting to know one another.   in a way this kind of simplicity is what made the movie a lot more special than other more complicated movies made in the 1990s. it's just simple stuff about two friends and the building of their friendship and building a good home, that all works, but in a more real way that the most advanced movies from that time. it feels a lot closer than most movie that were made in that time, especially because the two friends are very young people that are trying to discover who they are. so it takes a different kind of approach that a lot different from movies that are more about relationships, which is a great thing because a lot people miss those movie more than they should.  /watch It has been said that the plot of this movie doesn't have any big twists and turns, it just is about two people
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie sucked! I never thought there could be so many terrible movie's like this in the late 70's. When this film came out I was in 8th grade. My friends and I would go see it at the mall. The movie had a great story and it really got into a story. But to do this they cut the entire opening scene from the movie, which made this horrible movie. I would have been interested to see a more exciting story than how the film started. There are so many things about the movie that are wrong, like the music, this character in the movie is stupid. It just isn't a good movie, it is like an anti science fiction movie, I did not enjoy the movie and will only watch it for the opening credits.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the first half, there are some nice shots to go along with the action. I especially like the car chase, which is pretty well done. I felt bad for the kids, who get jumped over and shot at a pretty decent rate. I guess all those little kids just have a knack for the high-speed cars... I do not know how many times I see this movie with my brother, I feel we both love it to pieces. My sister hates it to, I guess she doesn't want me to watch it after all those times I had to show it to her.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had the pleasure of seeing this movie when I was a teenager and I had never seen a movie like this, with all of its weirdness and its bizarre ending. It's a weird movie with a few good moments, I can easily recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be entertained and I recommend it for fans of comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film with a lot of flaws.  The movie is about a man, a cop, that gets captured and put in a prison.   Then he meets a girl he likes.  They spend some time together, have a little fun and so on.  The plot isn't a bad idea but unfortunately the movie doesn't have any substance.  One of the main reasons of why I saw this film was for the character of the cop.  He is a very good character.  It is a shame because the movie gets so much of the movie going wrong.  If you look at how much of a mess of a plot this movie is you will find it hard to enjoy the movie.  All of the elements of the film are good.  There are some good character work and action but the movie falls far short of what it could have been.  I think it would have been great to see the gangster, the girl in the prison, the cop and a cop in a car chase.  This would have enhanced the story so much.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie in which everyone (all of them!) is stupid and incompetent, and the "evil" is played by some of the worst actors ever. The whole thing is a bunch of slapstick, and if anyone out there wants to make a movie about some people who go around and rob banks and take over some of our cities, then I say "bring it on, baby."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to tell you a bit about my movie-watching experience with the "Star Wars."    It was a good movie.   But it had one or two problems.  The first problem:  In the middle of the movie, the character Luke Skywalker and his father Han are walking on a desolate desert planet, and Luke is wearing a heavy, black leather jacket.  This jacket has a symbol on the side of the jacket that is a dark green. This has been used before in the movie. If you want to see a symbol that represents the Jedi, I recommend watching the scene in The Empire Strikes Back in which Luke's jacket is green.  There's a picture of a green lightsaber (one of the two lightsabers that Luke has) on one of the side walls of the cave. It's just a symbol of the Jedi.  And the symbol is a black and white one that looks kind of like a Sith symbol with a red gem on top.  In this part of the desert, there are several other Jedi like Luke and his dad walking around.  So this is a desert with a couple of Jedi walking around and Luke wearing a black leather outfit which is kind of his uniform.  But the other problem is that Luke's mother says that, "They can't find the Sith because they're too green."  I found this a little bit odd.  If you watch the film closely, the Sith appear all the time. It is very obvious that a "Sith" is a Sith.  It has long horns and it is a bald, red headed man.  Why is Luke wearing this black leather, and why is there such a difference between Luke's black leather and the Sith's black?   As you've probably heard by now, there is some continuity in the saga.  Even if one of these Sith look different, they have a similar design.  Also, I didn't really buy the idea that green is bad.  I was kind of expecting this to be a little different. But it turned out to be even more of a problem than I thought.  Luke is also talking about the fact that Luke wants his parents to teach the dark side of his father's life.  Of course, the father is more evil than his son is. This is just a fact.  It makes me wonder if this is what Luke Skywalker is going to become.  Perhaps, I'm reading too much into
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would have liked to have seen this film more than once because the acting is bad and some of the stunts look goofy. The film is set in a world where humans are very primitive but the humans have become very sophisticated at making weapons and bombs. They are fighting an enemy called the "Chosen Ones" because they have been doing a lot of evil and not giving a damn about others.  This is an awful film and a bad example of bad science fiction.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has a lot of promise, but does not live up to it.  It is based on a book by the same name written by Michael Crichton called "An Inconvenient Truth" which I believe may be his best work.  All I can say is that this is not a very entertaining movie.  I mean you will spend a lot time in this movie sitting around talking.   This movie is an hour and a half of talking, the story doesn't take any real turns and nothing new is shown or explained at all.  When watching this, I found that it was like a movie I had heard a million times before.  The movie is set in a future when there is no more ice.  To make up for the loss of sea ice, they have built floating cities on giant floating ice caps that are called "icebergs."  I would watch it again just to see if it could have been made better, but I am going to give it a 2 stars because it did not deserve 2 stars!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The good:  It's a good, simple, and very unoriginal movie, with a plot that is too simple and lacks any depth of the storyline. The characters are uninteresting and the plot, while it tries to create some suspense, gets boring very quickly. The main character is a nice guy that works very hard at helping his family and does his best, only to be disappointed about every decision they make.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of those films where nothing really happens, no action, and most of the time it's just boring to watch.  The story of this movie is about a scientist who creates a serum that gives him super powers which he uses to fight crime. Â It's like a comic book, with some of the super powers that this scientist uses in this movie are the same as the superheroes in the comics. ÃƒÆ'Ã†'Â Â The most memorable superhero from this movie would have to be Superman ÃšÃŒÂÂÂÃƙÆ'' â¬ÎÃƖÆÂ.    But then you notice that the movie has no plot.  The story is just a set up to a climax where the villain escapes with the serum.  After the villain leaves the serum was used to enhance the powers of Superman who went back to Earth with the last of the serum he had Ã'Â and he has more power than Superman had in the comic books Ãô.  This movie made me angry at Superman who couldn't catch the villain but instead just left the serum behind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am going to preface all this with an apology.  If you're a die hard Disney fan, you'll probably love this film.  I have to admit, my first reaction when I saw a trailer for this was that I was looking at a Disney cartoon. It's not.   This is a movie about a girl and the boys that surround her.  It's a Disney movie in a bad way.  The animation, like most of Disney's films in the 90's, looks really terrible and I'm not saying that as a good thing.  However, the character designs are just plain ridiculous and they even made a girl that could look as if she was wearing a swimsuit.  You'll be watching this film a lot and you're going to start thinking, "Who is this girl that is in this movie?"  It was like seeing someone in a Disney Princess movie with a giant, furry head.  If you're not a fan of Disney, you're probably going to hate this movie.  But if you love Disney, like a lot of fans did in the 1990's, this is a must see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is bad.  I don't understand why they hired a bad actress to play a bad role.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film when I was a kid. It was one of those movies where you just couldn't help but laugh out loud. It had a lot of funny characters and even some good acting. I have to say the special effects were pretty awesome. The aliens look good as they move about the desert. The desert and the creatures were pretty cool. The only negative thing about this film is it is about a little boy and his dog (which is an alien). I don't understand how this alien got a name of "Dug". Also I guess there was a lot more dialogue in this film than a movie should have. A few other things:  The special effects are pretty awesome but they weren't realistic. If it was in reality they wouldn't have needed to fake it too much. The other thing is that the aliens would have really made a good movie poster if they looked as ugly as they looked. I guess the aliens were more alien than alien. The ending of the film was kinda cheesy and made me feel bad for the little boy. I'm still a kid and I don t want to watch a grown-up's movie.

I can't believe that this movie, a major motion picture was made and I'm surprised it received so many dollars at all. The ending, as far as I know, is just ridiculous and the rest of the movie is just as bad. You know what? I give it one star because its interesting, I would love to see the guy who did it write a novel about all this. And if you do ever see this film and it does give you a headache, it will just ruin the whole thing. I would suggest you avoid all the actors in this film. - March 21, 2009The Worst Movie Ever
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- It started off well enough. Some nice looking special effects work, a fun hero (and villain) to beat up and a nice action set up to get us to the main event. The story and characters are simple and repetitive, they all have to be. The dialogue is nothing to write home about. The characters are all the same and it is hard to care about any of them. There is very little humor in this movie, which is a shame since it is clearly intended as a comedy. The hero is clearly meant to be "Cannonball". --------------- I think this should go out as a complete waste of money. --------------- See for yourself: http://www.videoboard.com/videoboard/dvd.cgi?id=82385
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this is a pretty bad movie, so I should probably talk about it.   There's no denying that one of the reasons I watched this film is for the acting.   Some of the worst acting I've seen in a long time.   I was disappointed as it's a bad script to boot.   That's not to say the acting is the only problem.   The film does a pretty good job of making up for the horrible acting.   The movie has some decent set pieces.   One scene in particular that is definitely one to remember.    This is a movie that should never have made it to DVD.  It's a terrible movie to begin with.  If you are expecting a good movie, this should not be one to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It took a few episodes to figure out who was who, but the fact that the main characters didn't really interact with each other was not a problem. At least one guy was a jerk, but he was mainly funny, the women were all the more beautiful (in a sexual sense) and the plot moved in a pretty interesting direction.   I was looking forward to the next season, because it didn't seem to have gotten too bad and was just starting to get a little interesting. I was disappointed though, because after a while the episode with the woman who looked like a "ladyboy" showed up to talk about some stuff and a bunch of women got together to be sexually active. That didn't take a lot of creativity, because the plot was fairly predictable.  But the characters really are the main problem. I guess they're supposed to be cute, but if they don't do anything together, there isn't much for the viewer to like about them.

For the first 15 minutes or so, it's pretty good but then it starts getting boring. When it finally stops there's a few good bits along the way (one of them being the fight at the end). But after that it's boring to the point where when we are promised a great battle, we get one that's completely unbelievable.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is just a bunch of poorly directed badness. It does not have any sense of danger, which is disappointing. At one point, the hero gets killed in a car accident and there is a "rescue" attempt. Nothing interesting happens, and we only get a quick shot of a few guys jumping into a truck. The truck goes up in flames after it is attacked, and the guy in the truck is apparently burnt up. A few months later, we find out that the hero's body was not burned up (and not even burned at all, actually he looks pretty good), and he is in fact alive. He goes back home and meets his wife and son. She is not happy at all to see him alive, especially because his skin is pale. The boy is sick. Then he goes to a hospital. The doctor says that the boy has got some type of skin disease, and that maybe they have to take it all off, so that the son can live. It's really not worth watching, other than the movie that was being shown. The sound is bad, too.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film begins with a small-time crook who, in a fit of desperation, decides to steal the family jewels, then the father and mother are killed. The man decides to do away with his life and, taking refuge in the house of his mother's boyfriend, finds that his mother and the woman who adopted him as a girl are alive and well. They are married and have a young daughter of three years. The woman has her own family, so the man must now take up his former lifestyle and have his daughter as his mistress. This plot isn't very original in the movie-book sense. It's not exactly well thought out either, as the plot does seem somewhat repetitive. It starts out well enough, but the climax is so over the top it becomes ridiculous. The first half is fairly well done, giving us a good introduction to both the main character and the situation he finds himself in. That isn't to say that the second half is a let down either, with a strong performance by George MacKay as the man with a sad-sack personality. The film is well paced and the pacing was a great touch, it allowed the characters to have an air of reality and a few surprises in between each episode of the story. That is not to say the film is the best that I have seen on the topic of love and sex, it's not.    The movie is a lot of fun and a bit of a shocker.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad. I've been a huge fan of the books/ tv series since its release, but the movie was not up to expectations. The characters are bland and don't seem to have much to them. It's hard to watch this movie because every time the book is brought up and the characters mention the books or mention the tv series, it just goes to the book. It just doesn't make sense. And the bad acting doesn't help. It didn't help at all. I don't remember any scene that wasn't cheesy, awful, cheesy, etc. I'm going to give it an 8 because it was enjoyable for a short time and then the worst scenes just ruined it for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is an utter failure. If you are looking for a serious science fiction movie, you won't find it in this, you'll only find a very uneventful, uninteresting, and uninspired science fiction comedy.   I don't know what they did to improve it, but they tried to force a romance with the same plot points from the first movie.  It does not work, and it also does not add anything to the overall movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the story was stupid, it was full of stupid lines (like the scene when the bad guys are trying to kill some guy who has already shot the guy they have come to kidnap) and the action was slow as molasses. Then, the movie ended and I could feel the emptiness.   This film has so much potential to be great but it just wasn't.  The only saving grace is that the movie is hilarious and the main male was really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie to be absolutely boring and unoriginal with no redeeming features.  It takes place in a futuristic world where there is a war between the two powers. One being the Federation who have a very advanced weapon, an extremely high powered laser rifle (the weapon that will kill the whole world if fired), and a much lesser one, the Federation. The Federation are able to destroy entire galaxies of planets with their weapons while the Federation are the only race who have any kind of defense against them, and their only weapon is an old rifle. The planet they are on is home to the most advanced race of the galaxy, they have a space station called "The Star" on the outside of their planet and their planet's only way to travel in the space is through space craft called Space Slugs.  The Federation have been trying to get some help from the Slugs (they are like aliens, not really) but are unable to obtain that help, due to the fact that they are the best fighters in the galaxy and the only way the Federation is going to defeat the Federation will be by destroying their spaceship.   The Federation ship is destroyed and they all on the planet, including the Slug Princess who has become the leader of the space slug race.  They are in a huge battle between the Federation and the slugs and eventually defeat them, but at the cost of their entire spaceship. The Slugs on their spaceship go on to create a space ship that will conquer all of the galaxies and the universe with their spaceship being able to travel through space much more easily and also to shoot down their own spaceship with a super deadly weapon known as the Galaxy gun, this weapon is also a Federation weapon, although the Federation don't know this.  Now the Federation have made the Sluggs to work for them as slaves (they give them food, health care, etc.) and the Slobs want to go back to their planet as soon as possible, the Slub Princess, the only member of their race who knows of their new spaceship, doesn't want to let the Slob Princess go, so when the Slums get in a fight with the Federation, the Princess uses her ship's laser to destroy the Federation ship, thus allowing them to all go back home.  But the Federation want to keep them and they fight the Slubs, who are able and willing to kill them, to try and get her to go with them to their new home. But
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie really stinks!  I don't know if it is the terrible acting or the story.  At least this movie had the decency to have all the children wear nice clothes and not in dirty, dirty clothes. ______________________________________ (11/10) ______________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For all the faults that this film has and has a wide range. If you're a fan of "Citizen Kane," then this is the film for you, as is the first of this series.  I can't speak for all of the fans, but I found most of the characters to be well done. Even the villains are done well, the reason for their "evil" is they've been manipulated through years of indoctrination and propaganda by the "evil government". So, this film is not an easy watch, but if you're of a "Catch me if you can" kind of like myself you may enjoy it.  The special effects are great. I like the first few of the "titles" (the "Citizens", "Carnage", "Wolves" and "Blood Brothers") which are pretty good. The first "fight" (I didn't like it) and one of the last (The "Killed One") is really good. "The Last" is also good and if you don't think so, you should be careful as the "bad guys" are really bad. I also liked that there's a lot of scenes at the prison. I thought they were pretty cool. I can't even describe all the different "actions" that take place.  The only problem I had was the ending which I found so bad, I think I'm going to throw the disc in disgust and never go back to this series ever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has the classic "Duke Nukem style" of a bad-looking guy in a red shirt, a red jacket, a white hat with a black face. You can tell it's a Duke Nuke.  You can hear it in the background.  There are a lot of stereotypes in this movie, a lot that are clearly not supposed to be funny.  The dialogue is just a mess, but the bad guy doesn't even get a laugh.  A few laughs, like that Duke Nuken is just such a drugged-up little bitch that we hate him!  Why do we hate the Duke?  Is it because we think he's stupid?  Was the movie made for us to hate him?  I don't know.  I think it's because the other character in the film is just as stupid.  Is that an accurate way to portray a Duke in the future?  If it's not, then I just don't like that movie.  In Conclusion:    This isn't a great movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really felt sorry for them because it was a terrible movie. The acting by J. Auguste became so bad. And it was supposed to be a love story of two dogs and their owner because they had a great rapport on the set but it was just a bad romcom. This film didn't hold anything back so there weren't any great performances. And I hope that you read all of this and don't go see this. You'll probably regret watching this and it probably only leaves you with a headache. I guess I will go to see this film again for the terrible title and terrible acting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- I don't have much to say about this movie but the dialogue in this movie was painful as hell to listen to. Not the best actors out there but their dialogue sucked. There were many great movie sequels to this movie like this: ------------- This was a poor remake of a movie I loved that came out 15 years ago. For a remake it was just a waste of time. I hope the fans are happy because no one should bother making a remake of the classic like this. The new movie is really not better than the old movie. There are just too many jokes that don't make sense. The only thing that kept me interested in this story was the great story of the love between a mother and her son. ------------------------- Rating: **1/2
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't normally like this kind of movie. This one's worse than those "good" ones (a la the new X-Men movies). It tries to have a great story, and some great acting, but what it does with its "story" is very poor.  The story starts out with a big surprise. A couple of people in an old mansion who think they are going to get laid.  First they talk about how much they miss their wives, but that won't matter because they are married to the maids (Liz and Marge), a husband and wife who want to make it as artists. I guess they want to be able to sleep with the young women there, which is how it works as they all live in different houses all over the city and spend their lives in their own art shows. They want to do this until their old house burns down and they move in to a new house with a fancy interior.   One of the older women is supposed to care for Liz and Meryl. But this has the effect of making her crazy and they can't keep her on any longer. There's just not enough for them to do and Mandy (the wife) is too busy being miserable at home to care that Liz is a bad artist. Mandy keeps calling her a bad little girl and this seems to make her angry.  Then she sees a painting in one of the rooms and is so mad she gets rid of Liz and is about to put Meryl out of the house but then we see that the painting is a picture of Meryl's friend and that the two are lovers, so they have to find a new home. Then they get a phone call from a neighbor who is looking for them with a new woman and they're about to escape from town when they get their car stuck in the snow. A little girl has gone missing but only Liz and her friends have any hope for her being back alive. But then we find out that the neighbor's daughter was a spy. All these things add up so one thing is clear: Liz is not the first to be thrown out of this mansion.  And then comes the real problem: The woman they are being asked to care about can't get any further than the old house. This is not a joke. She's a real person, and her family is real. This house is haunted. The house is filled with creatures. But all is well because the neighbors won't
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* The film opens with a very slow and dreamlike sequence. Not a dream sequence like in The Amityville Horror but like a nightmare. The dreamlike character design is so reminiscent of the style in a horror movie that it is pretty much impossible to identify with any of the characters. ********** The film shifts gears quickly from this very dreamy opening to a very tense and tense opening. The characters' behavior in this sequence is so unpredictable that a viewer who has seen many horror films is guaranteed to find a good story. I can't quite put into words just how intense this sequence was. From the first moment I began to suspect that something was going to happen, but I didn't know what it was. But I was certain that I couldn't see this movie again without seeing it through the eyes of a girl in some sort of coma. The story line takes a very strange turn as it gradually becomes clear that the girl was kidnapped from her own apartment at an unknown time by two men. We see in the beginning of the film the woman walking to and from her apartment and then we see them get into a car. She does not remember this as she is still in a coma. One of the men is clearly not as lucid as the other. I did not like any of these characters and their actions did not add to my enjoyment. I don't know why, but it seemed that they were trying to make a big statement with their actions. As the film progresses and things become clear, it turns into more of a traditional horror film with lots of jump scares, body horror and an intense, gruesome finale. The ending is a great shock and a pretty chilling story of the ultimate kidnapping. ************** I am so glad I saw this film once on television when I was 12 and now as an adult I get to enjoy it all over again. This is a movie I'd love to see again and would definitely recommend it to anybody that enjoys horror films or horror films of any genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The last third of the movie is about the protagonist going to a "psychiatry session" to get his mind off a case where he has been molested by the evil uncle. Unfortunately, the whole film is a bad trip where things get ugly. The psychiatrist seems to be a psychopath and does not appear to care about the abuse of children. When the patient refuses to admit that he molested the girl and claims the uncle made him do it, the psychiatrist tells the patient that he is a pedophile and that he will have to make the girl "his" child. The only good thing about the whole movie is the ending where there is a really dark and disturbing sequence where the child looks on a woman walking a dog as it goes by. The woman is the uncle's wife who he molests and beats in front of her daughter. I thought this could be a very good film if the first half were not so bad. If you are a person who is disgusted by child molestation, go watch the film at home, but if you like to see disgusting acts done to children on TV, you might as well stay at home and do it yourself on the screen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "My God is it good!"  The main story is a man, I don't know why, I'm sorry, but he is the last man on Earth and the only other person who ever loved him.  It takes him to a place where they have built these gigantic machines that can make anything just to make more machines.   He is also in trouble because this machine is running out of fuel but the other machine is more reliable.  This is the story about a guy who had a great wife, and who had so much money that he built a house made out of money, because that's all he had.  He is so stupid he even had a baby in it, I guess.  And his father was a great guy that thought his family was all alone, but now he and his son are all alone.  So this is a story about how a man can make everything with money to make money to buy more money, and if he dies, he dies alone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first thing that I loved about this movie was the animation. It was really nice to see a movie like this come to life again. I had always wanted to see the old "Zorro" movie, because I saw that one a few years back, but no-one would allow me to see it. Well, my Santa went above and beyond and bought me a copy! I'm so happy I finally got to see one of my old favorites, "ZORRO!". I loved it! I was glad that Santa remembered to write something, because he even thought it was a good idea to write a little note to my Santa, because if you read the note, you'll find that the movie was in fact made in the 1960's! That's way cooler! I look forward to going to see this movie again!   I don't think it would have been an improvement upon the original. But I liked the addition of Zorro and Mina and all the characters were interesting. As to the music I enjoyed the title "Zork". I like this movie so much! It's a little disappointing that the animation looks a little bad, and I feel that the special effects didn't look the best, and they could have done more with the water. So, a little disappointment, I must say.   Overall, if you're a fan of the old movies, you will probably love this movie. The story is good, it's a bit slow and not too well done. All the characters are well done, even the ones that I don't like. The music is just great. The only disappointment with the movie is that it's made in a 60's style, but I would have liked a little more effort put into it and maybe even the original ending would've made it more appealing.  , but it's still a good movie and the characters should be seen in this movie for it's humor and character development!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie of all time. In the summer of 1976, a young man walks into a movie theater and walks out with a story to tell. The movie begins with a scene where a truck driver has pulled over in a city where a man is seen climbing into a pickup truck from the top deck. A local TV anchor talks about the strange activity happening in the city. The news anchor explains that the man has apparently gone missing. When the man's son walks up and tells him he has a message for his father, the man is gone. Now, there is a lot going on here. There is an old man walking around, and that is what the news anchor is referring to. This old man is a character from a story called "The Man Who Fell To Earth" which was written by science fiction writer Stanislaw Lem. Lem, a Polish Jew, was a legendary hero in his day. He created a futuristic civilization with technology far beyond the technology we know today. This is a very unique movie and it would be an interesting movie to watch again just to see how little the filmmakers cared about making a great movie. Lem's story is told through the eyes of a very old man named Professor Walter Zalewski, a scientist who works for a government agency. Zalewki has been missing for the last ten years. Zalgawi has been seen floating around from one part of the sky to another until he gets stuck in a rock outcropping. When Zaliwki finally falls to Earth, the Professor sets out to search for him, and find him. The film takes place over one week in September 1976. We meet the man who is walking up to the theater in his truck and his girlfriend, and his dog, which will get more important later in the movie. This young man is played by David Carradine, who is known for many things in the film industry. He would soon go onto play the lead in the western film "The Wild Bunch" which made it to the second best-picture-winning picture of all-time. He is also known for playing a number of roles in movies that were not considered "good" in the modern context. He plays a drug dealer in "The Godfather", a character he does not like, and he is then played by Gary Cooper in "Anchorman" for example. "The Devil's Rejects" is one of those movies. If I were to take the film to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did enjoy this movie, I even liked it at times, which is pretty rare.  This movie is a horror movie about a boy who is possessed by a woman, a devil. He goes through a series of horror and sexual events where he is trapped, and is even sexually molested by a boy.    This is the best movie this side of Hellraiser. This is not to say I did not like this movie.  The bad thing about this movie is that it is over 2 hours long.   The story is about a group of people who get lost in a woods and one of them gets infected by a mysterious woman.      Here is a list of characters: 1. The boy, who is not evil but is not totally good either. He wants to escape and has done so a number of times. He also wants to be with her. 2. The girl (the devil) 3. A couple of people and the girl (she is a female devil).  4. The priest.  5. The other boy. 6. A man and the dog. 7. The woman who seems to be like a woman's evil twin who likes to molest people.  8. The man who has lost his mind because of being cursed. This man loves to drink.  9. A woman and her husband.  10. A girl who is trying to get revenge. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a film of the year.   I have not seen a movie that is more ridiculous.  The bad part about this movie is how the bad actors get a free pass.  One of the other stars in the movie is "Mr. Rude" a guy in a red shirt.  His name is not Mr. Rute.  He is very fat but I liked him and thought he was great.  I thought the other guy was a very funny guy.  It made me laugh all over again.  This was fun.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As you know by now, this movie is very much the worst Star Trek ever created. No one cared that the Enterprise wasn't able to make it back and that all of them were dead in the space of about 5 minutes. The crew is all too happy to die as we follow the crew through a series of adventures including "A Star Is Born" and "Space Seed," but the most memorable thing about this movie, by far, is that after about 20 minutes into the movie, the movie jumps forward into the future. We meet a crewman named Scott in the 24th Century, who is so advanced that the crew are afraid to go back to the past and tell everyone in the 21st Century about the movie and the way it was done. Scott has a very hard time controlling his people, so he goes off and does a number of very strange things. One day he gets on a very small spaceship with a really big computer on it (which we never see, but it might have been a giant monitor like the one in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier ), so he decides to go to Earth and try to figure out why we're not seeing anything like what we saw in the movie. It's an interesting idea, and there's an odd sense of humor in the whole thing, so even though it's quite silly, it's funny in a clever kind of way. It also has one of those weird plot twists which were not completely original to the movie but that the audience has already figured out, and then the last 20 minutes are a complete mess of nonsense as the crew go back into the past to tell the 21th Century what happened. It doesn't really matter what happens, because we have another 20 minutes of nothing happening, and even though the movie has the appearance of being about the past, it ends up being about nothing, or so the ending seems to suggest. I've seen this movie several times, and it has always been one of the worst in the series, but for the fact that it's one of my favorites, even though I've hated so many of the other movies in this series. I hope they don't make another one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________________________________________ This is a movie that makes you think. That is all. The movie is not very good. It does not even try. It is very boring. It features mostly one guy. I don't think I'll ever watch it again. The music is pretty bad, and I don t think it fits the movie's story line. This is another boring movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few months ago, a few members of the family in the neighborhood became sick to the point that the little girl got her hair cut short and wore a shirt with a big white collar that she thought she must wear every day.   This was a terrible movie and a horrible film by all accounts.  We will never watch another B-movie made by this company.  I've been a fan of the company for many years.  There is no reason to keep it going if it isn't a hit.  The movie is awful.  It has no story, plot, characters, anything.  This is bad filmmaking, that if I ever saw it and were forced to watch it as a child, it would have been banned to me. The actors are terrible as well.  If you have a little girl in your house and one of them is like 6 and the other is 12, and a little kid comes in and says "Hi," you should be ashamed.  A 3 year old would be more likely to say "Hello," than "Hi!"    This should be a lesson to everyone that if you make a film like this, you'll never do it again.  They must be ashamed of themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very slow paced movie with a lot of pointless scenes with the occasional funny ones. There is a lot going on in this movie that may seem pointless to the viewer at first but eventually make sense. Thats what makes it a bad film, since it does not have a story or a purpose that you can relate to. The only reason why you will watch this movie is to see if the people who make these movies actually have a clue.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I don't think the movie is very well directed, especially the fight scene" This is very simple, it is a fight scene with a lot of slow motion, lots of cuts and a lot (way too many) scenes that you won't remember anything after. The plot is so simple it's a joke, but the whole movie is based on a single stupid idea: a couple of guys who are so stupid they can't even fight the biggest monsters.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't the best or the worst film i've ever seen in the cinema but it was the most un-filmable film i have ever seen.  There is a brief montage showing a bunch of the great Australian and English players of the game and its a shame that no more time was given to those players as they play against each other, one after the other in the first game.  The movie then transitions into the actual games and the commentary by the commentators gives you a feel for the players, but there is nothing to them but their skill.   At the start of the movie we see the Australian team play against a team of "foreigners", who we see are from the USA, France and Germany.  The two Australian players who were supposed to be "foreign" are actually of German ancestry and the British player, while supposedly a Frenchman, is actually a German who emigrated to Australia.  I can understand the director of the film giving the players short shrift, but they really should have made a film about Australian football because all they really had to do was look at the English, French and German players at a local club and think of the Aussies.  What a bunch!    The whole thing looks like a badly made, low budget movie.  It's not even bad, but the filmmakers probably thought that the viewers would just have to take anything they threw at them, even bad movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ A lot of "newbie" movies these days are nothing but bad. This is the most "new" of them. I can't say much about it except to tell you "Worst movie ever! Bad acting. Very bad writing and story! Not worth it! Crap." There's only one place in the world that you would go to see this: _________________________________________________ A lot more information about this movie: ( __________________________________ ) - - - The plot was the basic formula of Hollywood movies, from the original Western to the classic Hollywood westerns. The protagonist was a young black man, a man who lived with his cousin and his aunt and his uncle. His cousins, however, were white. The story is that he goes back home to Mississippi in order to attend school and to escape from his cousins. He is so "different", he has to run away to an older brother's home and stay there. After one week there, the new black brother has to be told he's "not black". They go to a small town to visit his uncle's son and have some more time to spend together. He decides that it's time to return to Mississippi. He runs to his family's house to tell his Aunt and Uncle that he is coming. He asks them to bring him a pair of new boots. The uncle does so. Before he goes to leave, he tells his cousin he's not going to Mississippi because he'll find a new one there that he'll like. His cousin, however...well, he decides that they won't come to Mississippi and he'll "find a different place to live", and he will go to his uncle in Texas. The Uncle and Aunt, and some of their relatives all turn up at the house. In the midst of all this, the nephew's Uncle is killed, along with the nephew and his Aunt. The aunt and uncle are shot dead. The nephew, who is then 17, gets away. He gets to school on the first day and meets up with his cousins and his old friend. They're at the school's swimming pool and something begins to make him very uneasy. After school, he has a lot of things to worry about. His mother doesn't seem like she's coming back. He tries to forget about the shooting that night, but the thought keeps haunting him. A black man arrives at school the next day, asking him if he was the one who killed the uncle and aunt.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is completely irrelevant to the movie: The characters are all very one dimensional - they are so one-dimensional that all they are able to do is tell you about each one of them and then they die in a really predictable way. I can't believe that a movie about a space cowboy trying to get back home would have such boring characters. It's like a kid who has nothing better to do than tell you the story of a kid in a big box on the porch. They are all so one dimensional that they can't even have their own moment together and all they do is talk about each other. I was hoping for at least something to show a side of the character and actually the movie didn't do any of this because it's a movie for kids. That doesn't mean that it's bad though. I just find it to be so boring. I really would have liked to see more of the characters' story - which is completely unnecessary for the film, it just explains the opening of the film. This movie is just a bunch of scenes which don't do anything - it's almost like watching a TV show that you've already seen 10 times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this in the theatre one night. After waiting 3 hours for the screening, I was exhausted and had to leave. The movie was about a girl who fell in love with a boy who was a member of the army. It's quite obvious that she couldn't be in love since she was from the poor family. The boy was the one who was in love and the only one who could see her future. The movie was really long, but I couldn't get to the end. I was only able to see 6 episodes. I think the movie is only about 5 mins long and there are only 2 episodes. It seemed like the first one was more about the boy and the second episode was just about the girl. I didn't like any of the actors in this movie. The only actor who I liked was the boy. Overall the movie was good. I really enjoyed this movie and I thought it was a waste of time if the girl got into a relationship with a guy like she was supposed to.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- I would not give this movie 3 stars because of the terrible acting. The plot is pretty much as boring as a story written by an 11 year old. I did not care if this character was evil, I wanted to see that little bastard fall out of the window. The girl is a little weird, she always looks like a crazy person. She thinks the "chili guy" is her husband and that she and the father murdered the son of the "mole". I liked the plot. I thought it was funny and the little kid in the movie was cute. I am glad I watched this movie because I think this is a good movie. The acting is pretty bad at times but this movie is nothing like I expected.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is such a bad comedy. I mean seriously, why on earth would anyone want to watch this thing? All it is really doing is a parody on all the silly movies and television shows of the 90s that people watch on TV and then think that they were really bad. It is a complete and utter disappointment and the only good thing about it is the guy playing the dad because he is hilarious and the wife is kind of a hottie but there are so many terrible things that happen in this movie it's amazing how this is an American version of the British version of Friends.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story about a young couple who get married after a summer at the beach where they become engaged and then get a divorce when the fiance discovers a little girl with dark hair in their backyard, and then a little boy, is really interesting. The little boy is really weird. He's a little demon dog and the little girl is a beautiful elf who has to pretend to be human (which she is too young to do without being noticed) for most of the film. But the whole time the real family (the parents and the two older brothers who live in the house) is living a life of luxury and fun while the whole family has been keeping the little boy hidden from them. It's a good movie but I would have liked to see the real parents and their children. The movie is a good one with a good story but the real lives that they live seem far out of reach. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We finally get to see the end of the line for the classic gangster movie classic, "The Italian Job". We start off with a scene where we have the title character (Don Vito Corleone) standing on the dock of a dock in the middle of the night.  It was the time to steal the most valuable jewel in the world.    The most valuable is the pearl of Africa which is located in a small village in southern Africa.  I have been wanting to see this movie for a very long time.  So, it was a real treat to have it on television.  This movie does not have the kind of depth or complexity that it needs.     The plot is a bit of a mess.  The film is set up in the beginning to have the perfect boss.  And it is set in the 1940's.  But it never develops into that.  It has a few strong scenes, but it falls apart very fast.  You have the boss, Vito Corallo who is a real bad ass.  He uses his body to hit people.  His wife doesn't like him very much.  She is much like Gina Gersh from "Scarface".  And the people in the village are the bad guys.  There is no depth to the plot or characters.  "The Sicilian Job" is a mess of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a good movie at all.   From the title alone, the film is a horror movie with a good set of creepy scenes and the actors really gave off the creepy vibes.  But the script of this film is not that good.  The plot is all over the place as well as there are some twists here and there which makes the movie confusing.  It is also rather predictable.  I can see myself not liking this movie and not wanting to watch the rest of it and maybe just skipping the last 2-3 minutes which the movie has.  This movie is just way too long.  Overall, this is not for me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really hoping to see this movie, I'd read about it online but thought it was a bad review. It was a terrible movie, it's a rip-off of a bad John Carpenter movie, so I had no interest. What a disappointing movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  " I am not sure why I gave this movie 2 stars and I was really hoping for a higher score. When I heard the title I expected something like The Man Without a Face but this was nothing like that movie. The movie seems to be set in a college dorm and it was really confusing. I really didn't see why some students have been having bad luck and are getting killed by ghosts. I didn't even understand why there was a ghost named Mrs. Anderson. At the beginning, the movie started to get interesting and it seemed like the movie was going to pick up when the guy named "Johnny" is killed by a vampire. After that, the guy in the film doesn't say anything and just sits there and has a lot of trouble as this is a horror movie. I never felt suspenseful until the end when Mrs. Jones was telling the boys about how she had to go out and "see the world". Then, a ghost called Mr. Turner shows up and he is actually a creepy guy that has been doing some bad stuff with a woman named "Sandy". The guys try to kill him but when "Mr. Turner" is finished killing them, he gets up and goes to the women. He says that she was the last woman that he wanted to see. He tells the girls that she is too ugly to marry and she was "just a nuisance". I found it to be really creepy and didn't laugh once during the entire movie. You are supposed to be terrified at first but then you get the feeling that it is going to get worse from there. I felt really bad because I thought I was going into a good movie but it turned into a bad one. "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just so bad I'm not even gonna make it funny.  The only good thing is the soundtrack.  You can make something out of nothing. I don't know what to say about this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this film does not contain much of a plot, and there is nothing of merit to speak of.  The film begins with the premise "A little boy is trapped in a house and his mother is possessed by the devil.   Then a ghost from the past shows up to aid the little boy's father as his mother goes insane, forcing him to abandon his family in search of the help he so desperately needs.  The plot starts strong but then it falls apart pretty quickly as the film devolves into generic horror comedy.  My biggest annoyance with this film is that it seems like there was a lot of time spent making sure that the production staff and the special effects team could get everything they wanted.  In the interest of full disclosure the film looks fantastic, and as a horror comedy it may be the only film which can get away with the title "Crazy Kids: Halloween Special". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To sum up, we're in for another movie of a man in a wheelchair trying to escape from a group of wild animals by breaking into a cabin. The idea seems okay, but it's just poorly executed, all over the place, with not enough action. The acting is mostly bad, with the big names (Tom Hanks) being particularly bad as the man in the wheelchair. If you've ever seen a film about a man who walks with a walker, then you know all about the kind of movies this is, although some of the animals in the film are kind of cool looking. It has a lot of the wrong ingredients.

A little bit of fun is fun if it works and the movie is not stupid and it doesn't feel like a waste of a good idea. But it was a real struggle, because it didn't feel at all like the original Star Wars. For example, in the original, Yoda and the Jedi were at first quite funny, especially Yoda. But in this movie they were almost stupid and I got tired of it. And the last scene of the film, with Luke talking to Obi-wan on Dagobah, was a big waste of time (especially after the movie was over). This movie is really boring and stupid.  I loved the whole thing and I am glad that people are still doing it.  the whole movie is about "benevolent" aliens (the ones that protect people from the evil and evil people). In this movie, a group of children are playing in a cave and Luke comes and asks them to tell him all about evil. The only thing he really wants to know is where evil people go. But when he is asked how evil people become evil, the children are frightened and do not answer, so Luke doesn't get any more information about evil people.  (hide spoiler)  This movie is great and the only thing that I wish for is more of it, which could have been avoided. I enjoyed it! I found it to be a very funny movie and a really good story. I really liked it!I loved everything about it! It is really funny, it has a good story, it is original, it got a really funny alien
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You want an actual comedy?  Why don't you just watch a good comedy with a few more characters?   When the main villain is actually a genius inventor, I had the audacity to wonder, what the hell are they trying to do?  But I suppose that's a good thing in this case as it's a fairly straightforward comedy.   The thing that really made this comedy great was it's comedy, not its acting (it's good!).   A couple more characters and there's some good fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was pretty bad, in both acting and writing.   The two leads were not the most convincing actors in the history of bad movie actors.  They were, however, very cute in this film.  Not bad, not even a little bad.  I just hope they never do it again, because then they wouldn't be this kind of movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is one of my favorites from the "Hollywood movie trilogy".  This is a true western.   The story is quite interesting.  There is nothing bad with it.  My personal favorite was the cowboy.  For those who don't know westerns, they are like movies with a lot of guns, killing of bad guys, and the women are pretty damsels.  In some movies you can see a cowboy's hand and that's nice.  So the story is really good.  The other great part is the music.  I have heard a little bit of the song "The Gun Man".  The music was great.  It was really exciting.  But all the action of the movie was in the movie "Cadillac Man". This is one good movie.  As always the cowboy is great. His face was good and he played his role nicely. But a little movie like this deserves some more screen time to really see.  A lot of good stuff in this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only problem I have with this movie is that in the first part we see some bad guys who are very bad, and then they go into a cave which is full of evil looking monsters. They find this cave full of all kinds of horrible monsters, including all kinds (and some not) of people from ancient times. All kinds of terrible creatures. But the people are really not bad - they are just a little bit too advanced for humanity to have been around. Anyway the people from the distant past are not bad people, they are basically very nice, like a civilized people that had to live a long time without advanced technology. Well they also found it very difficult to live without all this wonderful technology, and the good old technology can be dangerous when used for the wrong things. It also seems like the cave itself is not so bad. I guess it is a place where they go to live (the last place that humanity was seen). The story about a little girl who lives in a cave in the mountains is just one long story about this girl finding herself in a really good and loving home. The only thing I don't like about this movie are the scenes where all the evil people who are not really bad actually try to eat her, but somehow she manages to resist. I don' t know, the movie has this very strange feel about it that I don,t like. Well, I guess I am looking for a movie that is really bad, but I don t know what it is. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Score: 7/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been a big fan of horror movies so I was really looking forward to this one. The story doesn't have a lot going for it, it is just a slow and slow build up where you slowly see how all these characters were chosen and then we get a nice little twist at the end of the movie (for some people) of a person that is supposed to be the devil that just happened to look like a girl! Well I couldn't be more disappointed that the movie was just another bland and boring horror movie. Well I just wanted a good movie and here I got a boring one.  Innocent girl's life turns into a nightmare when evil forces take over the mansion they've been staying in and the only thing between them and the devil and his evil minion are the three girls who have decided to spend the rest of their lives with the evil bastard......
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a remake of an old German film,  Der Schattensteiger. But we don't want to learn that from a film which is a huge flop. It is only good because there are so many German stereotypes. Like Germans in general - who like to dress like Nazis and play Nazi games. It looks like a parody. This remake is like a bad rip-off of the German film "Amerika". This time they make the Nazi a German. There is one scene where he talks about the Jews and what he would do to them. There were German soldiers in the Nazi Germany and there are people in the German army, too - only they play different roles. This movie is just plain bad. All the Nazis look ridiculous and some are even crazy. We get more of the stupid German comedy. I don't think I will ever watch the original. Maybe because a lot of people hated it too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________The first 20 minutes is absolutely awful. This is the movie that was made by a bunch of people that didn't have a clue of what they were doing. The music is mediocre. Most of the dialogue is made up by a talking horse. The script is boring. It is too bad because there are great scenes in this movie but the movie was made for the sole purpose of making a very bad "action movie" about a woman that tries to capture a killer. The killer is the most interesting thing about this movie. He is an ex-convict who was shot by a good guy and he was sent to jail and now he is in a war against a guy who is the prime suspect. This movie is not enjoyable but this is not one of the movies to watch if you are a sucker for "action".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For all you know there were some actors in the movie who really should have been doing the voice acting or even a comic book character. It's as if a bunch of kids in a sketch comedy show came up with a movie called "Stupidity", or an episode of The Simpsons called "I'm Sorry I'm Sorry". At least they could have made a movie out of this movie instead of a lame TV episode. A simple but well written movie! At the beginning of the story the main character's (or as he is called in the video "Molly the Dumb") dad tells his son that he will stop playing video games and concentrate on getting his high school diploma. Of course this is not possible since video games are played for pleasure and not education; however the kid takes the hint that there are plenty of other things to do. He also decides to stop watching TV and instead gets his highschool diploma by getting up at 5 AM and playing videogames until 10 PM. Molly has the following issues: Not smart enough to read an article. Not clever enough to take a test in a highschool class. Very much in the way of a stereotypical teen-ager. He thinks he's very much on the right track and doesn't feel he needs to do anything else but work hard on his diploma. His attitude and behavior seem at times very immature, but at other times very mature. Although he's a kid, he's clearly in a lot of ways older than most kids his age. He even has his own bedroom. There is one scene in particular that is pretty funny though: when he's supposed to go to the bathroom in his room he goes instead to the living room where he hangs a "You're a moron" banner. I guess it's a little thing but it got my attention! I do like some of the actors involved. I thought John Ritter was an okay character as a teacher that tries to keep his class at least somewhat sane. There was a bit of a running gag in the whole film where the teacher said that someone like Molly should stop going to all the class events. I also liked the little scene at the end in which the teacher explains to the class that Molly was the only student with a perfect attendance record. It might have been a good idea for the teacher to explain that at school, everyone must do something that he/she wouldn't even consider doing at home. The
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------- A lot of critics seem to hate this film, which is a pity for a film I think is good and well done. ------------ Story: -------------- At a time when the USA is in the throes of Civil War, a group of white men, led by a black general named John Hunt is looking to steal from and kill white women. So, he and a group travel to a Black man's town and have sex with his young girls. As an adult he is married with a family and has a young son (but no more of the old-timey black guy) and a daughter. Then his wife dies and is replaced by a pretty white woman from the town. They are married and have a son, but then his son grows up to be a violent teenager who is a troublemaker. In a town of Black children, his son is a bully of some kind or another. There is a bad white general at the same time. ------------- Cast: ------------ -James Cagney was the first black star in Hollywood, and his role is a pretty good one, but some critics think the movie is a whitewash. Other than CagNEY, the other big names in the movie are: John Barrymore, Barbara Stanwyck, Jack Benny, and Henry Fonda. --------------- I really liked this movie and recommend it for those looking for a good story. It's a very good adventure about the Civil War. -------------- What did I like: --------------- First of all, there are a lot of people who don't really know why they're talking about this movie, or are just too quick to write one. So here's a hint: the movie has a good storyline. That's the only good thing about this. -------------------------- What didn't work: ------------- I really don't like the plot. It doesn't make any sense because most of the story is just made up of the people being in a fight at a time they shouldn't have been in a particular place. The movie doesn't have a lot to say about the civil war, so it becomes a one-sided story. The black character doesn't play a big part in the story at all. ------------------- Summary: ---------------------------- I didn't like this film but, like other reviewers said, it's very good and fun. **********
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was good...sort of.  However, it was also one of the worst movies I've ever seen, period. Â The movie has a great story with good actors and it had a great score.    However, it is a poorly edited mess with horrible acting and terrible direction.  I would recommend to avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know if I can express how awful this film is. I hate this movie. First of all, let me say that the name for the film itself is so awful and stupid that my first thought was 'what the hell did they think they were doing?' And the first half is just an excuse to have a bunch of characters go on some sort of adventure, with some good old "adventure comedy". They're just going to take a car and go 'round and around a bunch the various places that I guess are in the middle of nowhere. It's just kind of stupid and silly and has a great cheesy laugh in the first 20 minutes. The second half is a great big mess of a film, but it's a mess that you can't escape from, and it's completely ridiculous. For example, they went out on a 'treasure hunt' (or something) to a deserted island in the ocean and that island is completely covered in all sorts of trees and plants and crap and people (as you'll see later) all dressed in nothing and all carrying big knives. It just makes no sense and is just... pointless. I don't even know how anyone could be bothered to do a 'Treasure Hunt' in the woods when all you are doing is trying to get into a tree. As we go around and around and round and round it's all just sort of annoying. They just keep saying 'look we're searching a place out here' or 'we're looking for something out there', and at the end you can see the place that they said is 'out there' but then there's nothing there. That is just so absurd and wrong and dumb. In fact, if I see this movie ever again I'm going to write a letter to the guy who made the movie and I'm telling him not to ever make another dumb 'Treasures of the Lost Ark' movie. I can't believe how bad this movie is. It has no direction whatsoever, the plot is completely incomprehensible, and the characters are just awful. It really is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't seen this movie in a few years so I have a few old memories. I'm not sure why it became a cult classic. I am sorry to say it was a terrible film. There was a lot of bad acting, bad direction, bad special effects, etc... it had a whole lot of cheap gimmicks and cheap acting. I do not recommend this to anybody with the idea that it is an entertaining comedy. I can't tell you how annoying this film was! It had almost no plot and didn't really care about the characters! I wish I would have seen it more than once. I think it would have been a more interesting movie if it had been about a high school basketball team! I didn't even care about any of the characters and the director couldn't get the dialog to work in the middle of the action. I mean, that just made it hard to see all the characters go from one place to another. So... I guess that it was just another forgettable comedy that took way too long. The film is really bad and I would advise to forget about this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A great movie made by an actor who is so good that you would expect to hear him at his best every time he does a scene. It could be a great western film but with all the bad guys (or at least in some cases the main bad guy) it just drags a bit. Some scenes with the main character (I believe that is named "Walt") are pretty great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is absolutely awful. It is not a good example of horror movies in the horror genre. It does have a few good scenes but then it goes into a completely different direction with no explanation. It starts out with a guy who has lost a baby. He has a friend who tells him that there is a baby's corpse on the back porch of a house. So he goes there and discovers the baby's dead body. He sees some old people sitting in chairs. They also look like dead people. There are a bunch of old people in the house. The friend leaves but the man stays and sees that the people are dead. So it is clear that the baby was killed by the old people. We soon see that someone put some blood on the chair and some candles. The old people start to move around like the dead. Some guy tells them about some stuff that goes on and then they go to the back yard and see a giant spider. The spider crawls inside the house and then the big guy runs in and starts chasing the spider. So there is no explanation as to how the spider got in the building. Eventually, the spider is gone and the old men go back inside their house and get in the bed. They sleep for a while but are woken up by something crawling on the wall and then we see a guy walking to the front door with a lantern. He is scared and runs out of the house after the old man. This movie ends abruptly after the last good scene.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story of "Ralph Breaks the Universe" is rather interesting. The plot has a very high level of creativity and creativity. It is not like any other science fiction movie that you might be accustomed to watch. This is definitely not something that you can view without being a little bit curious. The movie doesn't really have an interesting setting, but that doesn't mean that it has no atmosphere. The art is good and well done and does well to match the movie. "Rant", the main antagonist from the beginning of the movie, is a great anti-hero of sorts. He is portrayed very well and is very unlikeable. When he shows his true personality and character, the movie changes. This movie is very unique in a lot of aspects. The way that it is presented is something that is hard to forget because it is so unique. You won't find an action movie like this very often because it does have something interesting happening behind the scenes.

I could not see where the actor was standing, they seemed to have no idea what they were doing. I would only ever see this as a bad tv show or a bad comedy show. I'm sure it makes a lot of money, but it is such a horrible movie. It's so bad, you can't watch it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After the film opened I was expecting the "Gremlins" riff to be as cheesy as it always is.   It was nothing but a poorly edited mess.  It seems this movie is intended to appeal to the children of today.  As such, I can't even imagine why the film got made.  What's the point?  This movie was more of a waste of time than anything else.  I'm still hoping to see some of the original cast, but even if they did turn up in a movie it wouldn't have been a good one.  A horrible, cheesy waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot revolves around a female cop who goes undercover as a male prostitute to infiltrate a crime syndicate. She gets sucked into the prostitution ring and ends up working with the mob and some drug addicts. The story is pretty bad. It's a story about how bad female prostitutes are. And it does make you wish the prostitute was a man. The bad cop gets caught in a prostitution operation and ends in a horrible way. It was the worst movie I've seen in a very long time and I wasn't expecting a lot from it. It didn't get off to a great start either, the movie starts off with a bad female sex scandal. That's all you get from the movie and that's really not good enough. The movie itself is basically a bad cop and a bad mobster movie. A mobster with a gun. The only thing bad about this is the horrible dialog and how it was shot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of my least favorite movies of all time.  It's terrible in every way and I really feel the plot is poorly executed.  I think it's probably an English film by a Hollywood writer who's never directed any real film at all.  The movie is so bad you wouldn't believe it was filmed in England.   It has a long and awful soundtrack that includes songs by Paul McCartney.  One of my favorite movie scores ever, but here it's the worst ever.  And all the acting is horrible.  There are so many characters, but they seem to be interchangeable.  It's too bad they would try to get a German actor in here.  This is one "good" movie.  Not one I'd recommend to anyone.  If you liked:  The film looks like something from the 80's.  Like someone got a really expensive movie camera and they just stuck some old faces on it and put a different film on top.  Some old lines are still being used:  "Why is it so hot in this room?" and "Why are you so unhappy?"  It uses lots of effects, but for a film like this, they are used so casually that they are barely noticed.   "No one has ever been so rude to me!  "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are plenty of "funny" moments in this movie. I will give this movie a 8 because it is a lot funnier than you think.  I mean, the movie doesn't have any bad moments or gross-out moments or stupid lines... but it has quite a few funny moments and some very, very funny scenes.    And don't forget, the film starts out in a very good light.  The main guy in this film is the bad guy. He steals a movie and his friend wants the movie back so he breaks the window and they try to escape.  But instead of the good guy getting away, he gets caught in the rain!   Now, the bad guys are all of the same height and the guys are like 6' 4'' to 6' 8'' tall.  We have to watch and hear a few jokes here and there, but this isn't as funny as it is supposed to be.  The movie doesn.t last that long and it is just long enough.  It is so long it takes you out of the story and starts to be pretty dull... there are only a few things I thought were funny (like the kid throwing a baseball at the window in the movie).   But to be fair, the actors are in it.  They make you laugh.  I think it might be the best movie out of all the crap they have made in the past 15 years.  You have a very different style of film making (no matter how many bad movies you see), but this movie has a funny story and there is a good enough acting to give it a laugh every once in a while.

I like some of the humor such as the characters and the character of the police and the way they dress... but that is not a movie, it's a short comedy with good acting and good set-pieces...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie is a piece of art and the art must be well drawn, well written, and well acted.  It's a pity this movie isn't! Well, at least I didn't have to pay a babysitter to make sure the babysitter did a good job.  I watched this film on my lunch hour in college. I don't remember many names in the cast (except for the two that I am going to list here). The characters are boring and the story just makes no sense.  This movie also has no plot at all.   The ending seems rushed and the characters seem to have had more to do the film's running time than they needed.  The movie tries to force a story on people who really aren't interesting enough to carry a film in this manner.  At the end of the day, "Clerks III" is just plain boring and it doesn't deserve a 5 star rating at all! Don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The movie that I really wanted to see was "The Devil is a Part-Timer!", starring "Lena Horne" from the movie "Bridle Gossip" in a series of flashbacks that started when a part-timer is fired for playing tricks on the boss.  "Oh what a disappointment"   The movie takes place in an old castle, the boss is still around (with his two kids, one older and the other younger than he is), and a bunch of young thugs (of whom Lena is one) are looking for revenge.   I really liked this movie, I actually laughed through most of it.  At one point, the boys who were the part-timers come across a man who is the one who sent them to the old castle.  In the beginning, we see how the man who sent the gang to the castle was really a bad guy but eventually he decides to change.  He gets the help of his "fellow part-time" who then tells him that he really did not deserve to be sent to the dungeon, he was just a lazy worker.  I am amazed how the writers have such a good writing skill and how they create a wonderful, charming world that gives the audience an entertaining ride.  This is not a good film by any means.  If you want to see a bad flick, this is one of the best. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part of this movie is the scene at the opening of the movie when the girl and the father of the girl are going to make love and she doesn't want to fuck him because she's scared of the dark.  Then the scene changes to the girl, the father and the mother of the kid running out into the night to find a "shaggy dog."  That's it.   I have to think the writers didn't realize it was a comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the name of science fiction, the movie "Sideways" has to face the question of what happens when you throw a guy from planet Earth into a vacuum. The story about a traveling entertainer and his traveling buddy is about as dull and generic as such a movie can get. When Sideways (Kevin Kline) leaves his family for a vacation in space, he discovers a beautiful, exotic planet and an alien race. He decides to return to Earth and find his long lost love. Along the way, Sideways finds himself fighting a fierce battle to stay in contact with Earth. The plot is a clichéd adventure plot in which the hero is always fighting against aliens with their strange weapons.  Unfortunately, "Sin Sideways" is not a good movie. It is only bad because of the lack of originality and plot development. The main problem is that this story was told from the point of view of Sideways. Instead of using a typical actor, who played this part, Kline's character was played by an ordinary dude. The supporting characters are not developed and even the villains are only there as a way of "plot" to keep the main characters from leaving this planet.  The movie has some good parts. The opening scene (in which Sideways is fighting with a gigantic alien monster and the aliens fight him) is funny and it has great visual effects. The movie does not have an obvious ending, but it does finish. The ending is a good way to end a bad film and it is definitely not bad. "Sin Sed" could be a great space adventure film if it was done better.  For instance, the opening scene is good, but the main plot is mediocre. As a fan of a similar genre film, I expected more from this film. It does not deserve to be called a bad space adventure or a bad "alien movie".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did love this movie and I didn't like that it was so cheap. It's a story about a man who is really into a stripper and so does some of his friends. He gets drunk so they decide to take over her dance hall and he's a really good dancer and makes all of her customers come back for more. She has some kind of sex thing going on with some guy who she is also involved in and who is also a dancer. The stripper starts to get a little annoyed with the guys and the stripper decides to leave but her customers find out and start to have a row with her. So the guys start to make fun of her and that's when they decide that they should kill her and take all of the money they've been given. Of course, she makes them stop and tells them that it's okay to kill someone who is an alcoholic and then has to deal with all the trouble they put her through with her friends. It wasn't really any good. It was all a waste of time and really really low budget. I just don't see why anyone would watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â Â No matter the language, violent nature of the subject matter, the lack of originality, the blatant stupidity of the actors, the unbelievable incompetence of the director, and the ridiculous dialogue - Â you could see the result of a Hollywood hack making a mess of a script and some really bad actors.Â  The film is based on the  novel by  Thomas Harris. Â This movie was remade in the movie The Talented Mr. Ripley  which I liked much better (and in a different period). Â Harris is a very talented writer, Â and I hope this will get better production, and actors as it deserves.  I hope that the movie is produced by a talented script writer and directed by a skilled director.   A movie like this would be a real disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My second viewing of this movie left me feeling more than a little disappointed.   I would like to say that, in retrospect, I feel that this movie is a good idea but bad execution. The story of the movie begins after the protagonist and his mother are shot by a stranger.   The stranger then goes on a rampage and kidnaps the mother and children from a local hospital.   With some help from his wife the protagonist then battles a serial killer with a chainsaw named Frank (played by the great Tommy Lee Jones) who is attempting to break into the hospital. Frank is very good looking, tall, muscular and strong.   Although Frank is a bit deranged and his motives seem questionable, he is a very effective villain.     I don't really feel that the character development of the characters is well done. The only real growth is that of the family member who has been injured.   But really, the family is only a plot device to help keep the audience in the theater through the action and scares.   However, this movie suffers a real problem of being overlong.  It lasts almost twice as long as an average horror movie should.     The worst thing about this movie was that its rating has been kept as a PG.  The violence in this movie seems to be well choreographed, however, it did not have the intensity and intensity that one could expect from a horror movie.   Despite this movie's problems, it is a great movie to watch and will probably stay with me for a long time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This movie was bad enough to not deserve the title and I feel as the movie was a mess when I found it in the store. I would never watch this for anything else than the money. ~~~~~~~~~ ***1/2*** I did not think that I would like this movie but I did. The story is a little old and the action was really fun but the plot line and all it's characters are boring. This movie has to be watched for the money but if you don't like action you probably don't want to get this movie. I think this movie was more about a guy named George, a guy who wants to join the Marines and a guy from a local bar named Dave who are forced to team up and do a drug bust when someone gets into the police station with an arsenal of weapons. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, this isn't going to be good for some of you. That's what I figured when I opened the cover of the DVD.  This is a documentary about the film "The Crow," about a serial killer who turns into an "Angel of Death," the movie.  The film itself is just really bad, so terrible that I can't believe it existed.  This badness is the result of a script written by a third grader and directed by a second grader.   I'm not going to explain it to you.  This movie is about an Angel of Death who turns people into a bloody pile of flesh.  When he is confronted by a woman he kills his victims and eats them, like candy. The movie is pretty much a glorified slasher flick. There is a big bad wolf that hangs out at night and kills people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------------------- It was a fun movie with a bad twist. This movie did a fine job at being a thriller with an insane premise of a man (Sloan) being kidnapped, then taken in to meet a bunch of old school friends who are now in the "hippy" lifestyle. They live like cavemen on a farm in the middle of nowhere. After a few years he shows up and his friend and his wife are there. Now all of a sudden the old man disappears as soon as Sloan is brought in to see them. We're lead to believe Sloan was a prisoner to them for a while now and is being held hostage until they can retrieve an antique map of the world. Now this is no big deal to these people, who are mostly just in it for the money they can make. So who do you think is more evil when the time comes to rescue Sloan? Well a few of them (a man named "Gibbs", a man named Joe, a woman named "Flackie" and a guy named Joe "Big Joe") go to find out and kill everyone in order to "get out". The one thing I like about this movie is the amount of nudity and the amount that is done to Sloan's wife and son. The nudity is done well, but to the point, that it's hard to take it at face value, but a fun film for sure. I like the fact that I was able to watch this one and get into the crazy story line. I don't see a lot of movies that keep you guessing like this and this is why I think it's one of the best. My Rating: 4/5
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ It's a movie I should have heard much earlier than this, but since I'm currently trying to find something that will scare the hell out of me, and in the end I didn't find anything that will leave me shuddering with fear as I watched this awful abomination on a big screen. The plot of the movie is extremely simple: in an alternate universe, a few aliens had landed in a small town. And since they didn't do anything to the inhabitants of the town, the people of this town, and thus the rest of the world, decided that they have to be exterminated. To do so, the local army had a helicopter and ordered all of the aliens to get on board and they would be dropped in the town from the sky and killed there by fire. Then the people who actually live in the small town saw the aliens flying toward them, but decided to wait a few days to see if any of them would attack the town before taking the first step to eliminate the threat. However, the helicopter pilot had to change planes so he could rescue one of the men who was being captured by the aliens. But when the helicopter landed, they learned the situation was far more dire than they had ever imagined. To begin with, a group of about ten "aliens" (the actual name of the species is "Mani") has surrounded a town hall in the center of the local town. But their plan is not to attack a group there, but to attack the whole town. Since they cannot see the humans in this town with their own eyes, they have used a laser gun to make the humans think they are about to attack. The humans who can see the aliens use flashlights to signal to the humans inside the town who are not protected by any flashlights. The aliens then jump out of the helicopters and they begin to attack each other. When the helicopters crash into the town hall, the terrorists attack. But the "alients" are able to kill many of them in a short period of time, and their numbers are greatly reduced. When this is about to happen, one of them is able to find a very small gun in the helicopter where they are hiding and shoots it to the ground. Suddenly the small gun explodes and the "alien" is able escape. The last man on board tries to get help from the soldiers inside the helicopter but they are unable to move because their arms have been shot off by the alien. The men who could
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste. I guess they were worried no one would want to see a comedy about a high school student that hates his teachers and who has to make up a life where nothing seems worth doing anymore and he's all alone on campus when his best friend comes to visit. I'm sure the first half of the movie will be funny but the movie falls a bit flat after the first 15 minutes. I was looking forward to seeing this. So I guess I won't be giving it a second chance. The actors couldnt even give a good performance. The movie does not even try to do much. It's a very sad story about a lonely high school kid who's got nothing. And that's about it. I'll probably watch it again later so that I can see what the writers thought was funny, but this is the last time I will ever see it.  Maybe my next choice is The Proposal.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Dogs, dogs, dogs!" This is the worst movie EVER made about a dog. Not that my dogs don't bark a lot, but the movie was full of crap. The main character, Lulu, is a beautiful dog from a nice family. Her owner is having her spayed due to health reasons, but she has a personality to her that makes the dog a wonderful pet. The owner is a big dork, and she's very into Lulu. Lulu is very sweet, but also full of self loathing. Lul is the only positive, happy, happy moment of the movie. The plot was so much BS it's almost laughable. The people in the movie are like two out of every five idiots; the owner (and the director and the star), a guy that gets Lulu pregnant, and a guy who is a sex addict who gets Lul pregnant. The director and star are like the other out of five, they play to your expectations for a cheap comedy. The only good part is when the dog eats the pizza and the mother (or a porno girl) comes in. It's a very bizarre story. It had all the hallmarks of a bad "comedic dog" movie. I'm going to give this one a C because I'm a dog lover.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am sure most of us have already seen the film, but I will try to tell you what went wrong with this movie. After a good start where we see one of the most likable and charismatic characters in the history of the genre, he suffers a major character death. Then we are presented with another character who has a less positive view of our main character. The movie then goes on to present us with a bunch of people who are pretty much useless. There are two characters we meet with a lot of potential. In a later portion of the movie they are not even given a chance to show what they can do. One of these characters is in a boat with his girlfriend. He is going to be killed by a shark because he doesn't keep his distance from her when there are lots of people swimming in the water at the same time. Another character tries to save him. But then they decide to go down to shore where they are attacked by an octopus. This guy is totally useless and is totally incompetent. The shark attack is completely unnecessary. There is a great big part of the film where this person jumps in between the shark and the boat just so he can get the girl to safety. The film could have done with some better direction and maybe they could have focused the movie more on these people. This movie would have been better had it been shot in a dark room with a projector. But I guess we don't really care much about that so I don't care. I really don't think you need to see any of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are worse movies than this one!   It is just another dumb action movie with a bad director who was a producer before that. He should get some acting lessons!  And how does he get away with giving the female lead a horrible personality with that annoying "sultry" voice!  The plot is really stupid!  I liked the bad guy though. The guy who was bad, he was so bad, that I laughed.  They should make a movie where the female character tries to win her boyfriend back with a silly stunt (this is for the stupid people who like these type of movie).  And they should let all of the characters wear a different clothing at all of their scenes!  A "B" grade movie for a "B+" rated movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "How to make a movie about a film about a movie!"   This is the same movie from a new director, and a couple of days later a new actor is in it, so they are calling this a "new" movie. It's not.   I saw it once, and I hated it. It is horrible, offensive, and dumb. I don't know where they found the cast, but I guess they were just looking for actors who look like they could play a video game. There were some funny moments, but they were too far from funny for me. It was terrible, offensive and not funny. The script, the actors and all, was just bad. They just did not know how to get a point across. It wasn't funny, it was not offensive, it wasn't even offensive for what it was about. I cannot find the original footage to see what it is actually like, but since it's all in the trailer I'm pretty sure it's a remake.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I saw this movie and, to be honest, I was expecting it to suck.   In the last 30 minutes the movie goes and ruins itself more than ever, and it is a very big "fuck you" to the entire franchise that started it all.  While it is fun to see Arnold Schwarzenegger go ape shit in the last act, the movie doesn't come out of nowhere.  We've seen the "worlds collide" before with Total Recall and this is just a much more blatant and blatant ripoff of both movies.  For instance, the story in the first half of the movie is basically the story we've all seen in the previous two movies with Arnold as a cop from the future who crashes his car, which also happens to be the world's only vehicle that can drive at the speed of light, but can't because of the "gifts" that came from the alien that crash landed on earth that have granted his powers.  This of course gets out of hand when Arnold is arrested for murder and we are then plunged into the movie's third act.  First, we are taken to a police station in the future that is controlled by Arnold's "super-cop" partner (who is actually a robot, but it is hard to tell due to the ridiculous robot makeup).  Next thing we know, they're fighting a big bad robot from another planet, who is called MIB (which stands for "Minister of Intergalactic Intelligence") and also has a robot body and is the main bad guy of this movie.   Now, before I get too much into what I think is the biggest mistake that this movie does, I'll just get the bad news out of the way first.  The plot in this movie is a total mess.  Firstly, why is MIB controlling all the cops in the world?  It's like they want to go back to his home planet and rule it with a big stick.  Why is M.I.B. so powerful?  I guess to be fair to the movie, he is more powerful than Arnold.  Okay, I get the idea that M.B comes from another world that can control people, but why can't Arnold just go back home to his planet and save the day?  This is also the only bad thing about this movie, but that is enough for this review.  It also seems like every plot device was borrowed from the other movies in the series
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had really high hopes for this movie. I'd seen the trailer and I thought it looked great. Now I'm here in the theater watching, feeling that it's a waste of a $15 movie ticket. There are a few memorable scenes, but it's nothing that really stands out. I have to give it a 2 star rating because it's an ok movie. Nothing new here. But I guess that is what I got in a $10 movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this was a very good action film with great set pieces, but it was a terrible movie overall. I don't think it is very well made, the action scenes look very unrealistic. The characters were annoying and unlikable. I did enjoy the fight scenes but the movie just had too much fighting that would have had to have been cut down to an hour to make it more enjoyable. 2/10  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I'm not kidding. I'm not even kidding. If you want to talk about bad movies, I can't think of anything worse than this one. It's the worst of all the movies I've seen at a theater in the last 15 years. This movie has been in the theater twice now. It starts off fine. I don't like it. I think it's a terrible film. I would never suggest it to any young or impressionable movie-goer. I recommend it only for those of us who think movies should be thought-provoking and entertaining and not a depressing waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________________________   The movie starts off with a couple of people getting into an argument which turns into a fight with one of the victims being the main character. He is the last person to be seen alive, except for a few frames, but we are introduced to a young girl and a young man as the two victims are walking through the woods. The woman has her hands tied behind her back, it is obvious she was tortured but how she was tied up is a mystery. This scene is really disturbing and I felt a strong desire to get out of the room and hide. I was so disturbed I ended up watching the film again a day after seeing it. When they leave the scene, we learn one of those men that kills people has a past with a woman that lived in their town so I was thinking the killer must be close friends. As time went on I was getting very upset watching this film, the film is like watching a horror movie as the violence never really starts out to be scary it just starts out that way and soon the film becomes a gory, bloody, nasty and very bad movie that will leave you scared from the very first frame until the end. The only thing I liked in this movie was the soundtrack by David Bowie.   I thought this was one of my favorite movies growing up, but it is not something I can recommend unless your just looking for the shock factor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â Â A long way from home. Â The most boring, Â uninspired and most uneventful movie I have ever seen.  In fact,  It even has the word boring and is about an abandoned building.        This movie is a piece of garbage and you will never see a worse movie than this.  I was not expecting much from this movie.  The director of the movie is  John Travolta and  he is also known for his role in the movie 'The Godfather'  and for doing many other movies.  He is also  the father of one of my little ones and   I do love that role!   The story is about a man that lives in the old, abandoned building and he is looking for the key of the building. He will use the key and when he will find the building,   he will be able to take his family to his parents where the family will live in peace and harmony for a very long time.  As   soon as the building was built,  the building that was built is now abandoned.  To keep up the facade of being a home of peace and tranquility,  all the staff of the place will die in order to make the building safe. When the staff dies the building will become as if it's never there!  The movie is set in the past and  as I mentioned before,  there  are a few pictures of a young Trava and the same man is played by the guy who plays Jack Sparrow in the film 'Pirates of the Caribbean'.   When the plot is started you will feel a sense of anticipation as  the setting is set to a peaceful place.  I can remember the beginning of the film is set as they are driving a truck.  Once the truck is done driving through the countryside,  this truck stops at a roadblock.  All these people get out the truck to get their license plate so they can get back to the building they are in.  They are all about to go away until  the truck driver stops the truck. Then the truck starts to go to the house but it will stay there and stay there.  Then all the people get off of the truck and start to talk in the house of peace,  peace is here because when the police come it will kill the people in

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________________________________________________________ The story, as it is told, is that a doctor falls in love with a very pretty doctor at an orphanage. His mother finds out about his relationship and beats him for his insolence, as she thinks she knows him better than everyone else. I couldn't get past that. It was just sad. His father was an alcoholic and a loser (like many parents) so he spent time in a mental institution and that ended up being his second prison. When he was released he was given an apartment in an industrial district because his father was a lawyer and that's where he found his wife at that time. The rest is an almost perfect film about a very nice person who is completely dependent on another person. They even show their parents together as if this is happening naturally and it does seem to be a very natural story but there are too many problems here with the acting and the dialog. The dialog is terrible. I was also very disappointed with the film because I had high hopes for it and for me to be able to see something so good from such a bad film I would have to have had a lot to do with it first. It wasn't, it was just terrible. ___________________________________________________________________ "And I'm here to tell you we're not a bunch of savages..." This is what the song is about. The first couple of minutes of the movie were pretty entertaining too but the rest was more like you watching a bad soap opera than it was a film. This isn't good acting or direction. It's not good cinematography either. A lot of the scenes feel like they were shot on a cheap camcorder. The acting is terrible here as well. I'm sorry but it just didn't seem to make any difference to the characters. You could almost be sure that when they were in the background of the shots they were speaking but they were being shown off on a screen instead. As for the dialog, it's just as bad here as it was in 'My Friend Dahmer' which had better acting and good dialog. I won't go into details about what this movie has to offer. I am sure you've seen it or watched it many times before so you can tell I didn't like it at all.  Posted by Richard Pipes at 11:32 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking for a good horror movie to watch with a friend. We both had seen some bad ones, but nothing had the suspense or the heart that a classic should have. I didn't care for it much, I was hoping for an extra layer of evil, like a good old horror movie should, but instead, this was just a typical cliche 'I don't know why they call it a horror movie', I don't remember seeing a film like this in my life. It was a terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, I have watched this one before. It is about a boy who falls in love with a girl and goes through the whole story of her life. It was the usual "girl goes around and has sex, boy falls in awe of her beauty, girl has to be saved at one point or another, boy goes to college, girl gets married, boy has a baby, girl is a bad mother." No matter what the boys say about it, its a bad film. The acting was awful. The director's name was not given. And so was the title. This will not stop me from buying another DVD copy. Why bother buying something bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never really understood the appeal of American Graffiti (or I did until I saw it). It was about an asshole who would fuck anything and everything that moved and ended up making himself look even dumber and dumber until he killed himself by drinking a can of beer. The most irritating part of this movie was its constant overuse of the word 'ass' (with its own slang variations) and the way it was constantly used in different situations. I think it was the first movie I could say I hate and this one is as annoying as the first! One night, I walked into a bar with a woman I'd been seeing for the previous few weeks and a friend of mine and we were both in a bit of a drunken haze and a girl in front of me said "I think your cock is gonna get a real job someday!" I was just about to say 'I'm fucking amazed you can be so fucking blunt about something so stupid!' but then the thought came to me and it made my eyes twitch like a rabbit's. The girl behind me continued "Fuck you if you think I don't have a cock, you're full of shit!" And my friend just stared at me for a moment, before muttering "Yeah, I'm sure. It would be funny if it wasn't for the fact that the girls in the movies always talk about their boyfriends." This movie's most important part is a scene where I had to hold his hand during sex and talk him down to "Fuck the whole fucking place. Fuck that fuckin' whore! Fuck that fucking fuckin' bar." I was not happy with the way the whole thing went down but it did help me get my shit together enough to get out of the bar and out of there without getting raped.

There is a plot device which has been used before, but here it is used to a horrible extent.

The ending was horrible.  The story was bad as well.  This movie is not very good.  Don't bother with this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not for me.   My favorite thing about these types of things is that every one of them is based on true events that actually happened. I've read quite a bit of history, and it looks like this movie takes a couple of those stories, and twists them a little to make it seem like they are happening.   The story starts off with a young boy in a tiny cottage upstate getting into a gunfight with his father. He shoots the old man, kills his son, and then gets himself killed. This boy was going to be a good soldier. Then he gets the idea to steal some clothes to make himself look better. It's just one of those weird things that happen to people who have their own way of doing things. I suppose I can understand that. The only problem is the movie tries to give his own story of how he became a spy a little more air by giving a bit about what happened to him before. If there is a problem here, it is that in its attempt to give the boy an air of importance, it totally removes the character from the story. That is not the fault of the director (or screenwriter, I should say) or the writers. It is the fault and the responsibility of these poor guys in the studio, who apparently have a huge problem getting this picture out on schedule. The story of a little boy who gets killed and gets a chance to kill someone else at least seems like it could fit together. It was like watching something that was going around in my head for a while, then someone would make a suggestion that changed it into something I liked. Then I watched it, and was amazed that it happened, until I couldn't take it anymore and told everyone else about it.   the film never seemed to be set up for a happy ending. It started out with an ending that didn't make any sense and was a little odd. I'm not sure I wanted him to get his father to stop being such a jerk. He never said a single word during that sequence. I found it a little jarring that the mother would just start telling them to get ready for the war when the boy is already out in the woods with no clothes on. Then she starts yelling at the boy and telling him she hates the Americans, and she's going to tell everybody they're killing her family. She even said it to his father after he killed the kid, which wasn't really necessary. Even after she
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If this is an improvement over the first movie I'm sure its gonna be a disappointment,   This film is based upon the book 'The Last Starfighter' by Raymond Erskine. In my opinion it was far too long and it had me worried about its quality all the way through to the end.  The story follows a young man named Luke, played by Billy Dee Williams, a mercenary who works for the Alliance of Free Planets, a rebel group.     He has just flown a mission into the Outer Rim, and his ship has been destroyed. Luke needs a new fighter so he travels to a mysterious planet to steal a new ship from a man called Dengar.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've heard a lot of bad things about this movie.   It was supposed to be a remake of the original, but that part is not accurate.  This is not a "Revenge of the Nerds" kind of film. It is more like a kids movie that could have been made in the 90's, that I think they were trying to cash in.  The film does take a lot from it's source material, The Muppets, but unfortunately it has little to no heart or humor.  If you are looking for some kids movies to laugh at, then this is not for you.  It is just a terrible movie with no redeeming qualities and the plot was ridiculous.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie does not have any good points about it.  It is an unoriginal story that follows two teenagers.  The first half of the movie is mostly the same story with the exception that it is narrated by two people (I can't tell how many), one the narrator and the other being the main character.  They live in a rural town (or is it rural/urban?) and seem to be quite normal.  We watch them getting bored of having things done by the other people they know as the town seems to have the usual inhabitants such as the girl who seems to be having the time of her life and the guy who is always on the go.  But it doesn't take much for the boys to make some trouble and it seems to happen pretty often.  I don't mean trouble that they will try and fight the other kids, they just want to sit around the house and listen to all the old folk and talk about anything they fancy, which is why they will often end up doing stuff that annoy the others.  These two are no more than the main protagonist and a sidekick.  Now let's get to the good parts.... The actors.  All the actors did a great job of portraying their characters.  Some of them did a good job with the role they were given.  For instance I liked the acting of John Cleese as the main boy, he was always funny and made it seem as if nothing was out of the ordinary as there were quite a few times when the boys came up with the strangest things to do.  He also added a nice layer of gravitas to the film, I think the only person who could do that was Jim Henson.  And his character was a nice addition, it made it more real as there was a boy with a big ego who is trying to make it in the town.  Other actors did well as well.  David Baddiel as the old lady was perfect.  She always seemed to add a slight note of humour and her son is always the one to break up the monotony as he will either be on the lookout for trouble or be doing a good deed.  As for Ian Holm as the boy.  His name was actually the second one to be written on the script as it was always something in the middle and when it was written on he was the last one to play it.  The music and sound effects were the good thing about the movie

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was mediocre at best. The main problem was that the director was a bad director. He took what was good from the original and made the first 3 films look like cheap imitations of it. The third film was not a bad remake either but it was a very cheap movie and I believe the director got his money back from the first two.   5 out of 5 stars I still have my VHS copy of this film as it is a great, gritty, low budget, action romp! I'm a sucker for good, low cost and gritty action. The character is not the most interesting though, though I do find the humor to be somewhat funny. It did have it's moments however. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really wanted this movie to be a hit. The story, cast, and music are perfect, but I think this film is a little disappointing. I will warn you that there are no boobs in this movie, but they are quite big and they do not seem real, they seem real because you expect the bad guys to have big boobs like in all of the other action movies out there. I loved the premise of this movie: the hero is an elite spy who must save his family from a terrorist, but he must find his way to a remote location to find his family. Unfortunately, what you get is a movie that feels like a cross between the Die Hard movies and the bad action movies of the nineties. The movie has some good action, and while it's not spectacular, it's certainly not bad. If you really like cheesy action like in Die Hard, then you probably will like this.  The story is really bad: the bad guy kidnaps his wife, takes off in an airplane, and is never heard from again. It feels kind of like a bad action film in Diehard, only not really bad.  There are also some good twists in the story: the father who wants to rescue his family is not his real father, and he is kidnapped at a very young age in Afghanistan. Then his family gets kidnapped at the same time. And he finds himself in an Afghan war, which is actually in a very remote part of Afghanistan.  I'm sure you'll love this one.    The movie also includes a cameo from James Woods and Michael Douglas.  So, if you're looking for a fun bad action movie, you might want to check this one out. I really want to go back to see this one, but that's just me being a sentimentalist.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am sure that there are some people who saw the film and were not impressed. I liked it.  Some people don't mind a story that is set in a city that is a mixture of Paris, Rome and Amsterdam. It tells you that if you are not careful in what you do, you will be ruined.  The story is about a man who has lost all his money and finds himself in the position of a pawn. He is a man of limited resources and has to use everything at his disposal. The story begins when the protagonist, a man whose name I do not know decides that he must become a pawn to get back what he lost and finds that the person he is going to be a pawn with is the most evil woman that anyone has ever seen.  They have a good time playing the games and having a good laugh because, let's face it, it is fun to watch a man being put into a position he has to be able to survive. But one night when all these games seem to be going in favour to the evil woman, this man decides to play a game of his own and get revenge on her in the most gruesome way.  It is so good. It is such an entertaining movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The biggest weakness with this movie is its main character. Not even the best supporting actor in the world can overcome the character's shortcomings. I'm sure you guys are wondering what the big deal is with his character. Well, his "lack of personality" doesn't help, and he can't even act when a problem occurs (which he tends to do). So, the movie revolves around his constant whining and complaining. It's the kind of attitude a child would have, and his whining doesn't go over well with the audience. That being said, there was a lot of promise with this picture. At first, it's a cute little story about a little boy who doesn't want to grow up, and is in love with a small flower that he keeps in his room. It was pretty cool at first. But then all of the fun goes out the window when the main character has to take care of an old man who needs help. The old man's illness becomes so bad that the child feels he needs to save him. The story progresses like you'd expect it to, but there wasn't much room to really make it a happy story. It starts out cute, but quickly loses much of its good feel.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, this movie has all the makings of a pretty great romantic comedy... and it actually is!   While it begins with a bit of a slow burner, we're quickly treated to some hilarious slapstick that really helps to lighten things up a bit.   The film seems to spend a lot of time in a series of rooms, each one being slightly different in it's style and decoration.  But for a romantic comedy, the jokes are still pretty solid.  As for the romance, I felt that there were two main couples, and although both of them have been a little underused in many romance comedies, I think there are some good things about them.  And that leads me to the second big thing about this movie, which is how well the story is told.  I haven't found an anime that did this.  This story is presented in a pretty light and humorous manner.  It's very easy for us to get into the characters personalities, and it really keeps you interested through out.  The plot is actually very interesting, and while it has a very "what the heck" feel to it, it ends up being pretty "real" as well, and that's a great thing to me!  There were parts where I was honestly afraid to stop watching, but I'm so glad I watched it!  Overall, if you enjoy some light comedy, romantic comedy with a twist, and a story that gives it's characters a whole lot of personality, then I definitely suggest you give this a go.  And that brings me to a few final thoughts...   Well, you've heard me mention several times before that this anime is one of my favorite anime.  There are so many things I loved about it, that I had to write an entire post just to explain them! But that's probably why it didn't make this list.  Because, while there are a lot things I like about it (most notably, the art and music), I can't say that they're "essential" to the anime, because they're certainly not what makes it great.  While I have nothing against some romance-comedy or romance anime out there, if it's simply an excuse to see attractive women and see what happens to them, then it's not much of an anime for me.  What does make this anime great is the way that it creates a very unique and original story, and then builds upon

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    An adaptation of the cult novel.   I know this may not be a great film, but I think this should have been a film to give back to the fans who have been begging for this movie.  The characters are pretty good.  I can see why this film was made.  It was good and scary enough at times. I also like how all the characters are different and some of the more interesting characters are the ones who were originally from a tv show.  This movie is a little odd. The story has nothing going on.  There is just the guy on the couch. He sits there all day and is haunted by his past.  When the guy comes to live with his daughter he is forced to work with her brother (who is her husband's best friend).  I guess his daughter was his girlfriend from TV.  She thinks she is the ghost that haunts him.  But he is actually her lover.  He comes to think of her as more than just a girl.  We find out that his daughter is a girl as well.  At the end she decides to leave him so he can focus on finding out what is haunting him. In the end the story ends pretty much where it started.  While this movie is pretty bad, I could actually see where the movie was going at one point.  For a film about a boy who comes to believe he has been possessed by a girl who is now a ghost.  Maybe this is what the author was going for.  You will never be the same. It is very good.   It is a movie of its time. It doesn't really make a big deal about it, it doesn't use very many special effects, and it is actually very scary.  My favorite part is when the guy is sitting on the front porch, he suddenly starts screaming because he has a vision of his dead wife.  To see her in the middle of the street is just too much for him. I guess we are supposed to feel really scared after that, which I sure did. This is a scary movie. If you like horror movies, you won't want to miss this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell! I've been a fan of the "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" films since I was a kid, and have loved most of them since. I thought the film was one of the best films ever made. If the movie was rated a 7 instead of a 7.5 it might have been even better. But alas, it wasn't. The film has a lot of flaws. The most glaring flaw is in the writing. The movie was originally written for the stage. When it was produced it got a film version and that wasn't good enough either. The best the film got is a 2.1/10. You need to go out and see this for yourself or even better, watch the TV version!  1st Grade:   I saw the film with my parents. We have three children, and they were four at the time. I remember it well. I was so scared I wanted to cover my eyes. When the movie came out it caused a lot more of a stir. It didn't hurt anything but it was quite funny. It was like a movie version of "Eddie". We did see the movie a few more times but I can't recall all of them.  2nd Grade: After seeing "Et tu, Eddie?" I think I was hooked. I went to see the "Fright Night" film the next year, too. So I think it kind of "made" me a fan. I loved the way the story was told. If they made a movie about that story I think that movie would be one of my favorite films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a sad and depressing movie about the effects of depression.  It was supposed to be about the character that had to leave her job.  She was diagnosed with depression after losing the husband in a car accident and has a difficult job as a secretary,  which is to take phone calls from other clients and make the salespeople.       She takes the call from someone who she has never met before, the man who has the same name as her old employer (her former boss) and his family.          This is a good example of a movie where a character is not the main character but is in another person's shadow.  Her relationship with the woman (also named Mary) who she works for  is not good because they have been married for 30 years and this relationship is  like a mirror  with  the other person having the same problems with  Mary.      The character who does the hiring is played by Steve Coogan, who has been a successful comedian before he became a director and is pretty good at that job. Steve does not work for the man he has the job for (Mary) because of her depression and has to go on the phone to her at work because she is unable to do it herself.  They are going to make the movie so she will have time to work for a better man.  Steve is very nice to the director and the other actors and they seem to enjoy working with him.  The problems are solved by the wife who has a little brother that wants to become a magician.  So she has her brother get a magic show on the night of Mary's depression in order to help her.    It seems that this film was not very well written and was poorly acted.  It's about a couple with very different  views about life which is not very fun.  I didn't care for the character and I liked how the film was so short.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ This movie is so bad, that it can only be described as a disaster. And to give a little extra color to my overall rating, I would just like to say that the ending was a really great way to finish the movie. I don't even understand why they were able to film all of the shots and then they just made me pay for them by cutting out a good part of the movie and leaving the rest for a later reprise.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a comedy with a small bit of tragedy. This movie is filled with humor that makes a few jokes about life but not enough that it becomes funny. This film is really just the plot of someone who was always a loser when he was young and was also a big fat loser when his mother died (a long dead mother) so he goes to live in a mansion with his girlfriend (an older woman, also a widow, who he met when he and his father lived on a ranch in Idaho). After a while the wife is moved to be the new girlfriend so the movie goes into a comedy style. The main character is not a bad person but he is not quite funny as some other comedy actors are. After a certain point in the movie all of the comedy gets a little old and a little funny and the movie just turns into a typical family drama.   And this movie gets old because its too long. And too long because it is just too repetitive. There are many scenes in the film that are just too similar to the previous scene from the movie. And that is a good thing as it is so boring when it happens so many times. The family really lives very boring lives. But there is one scene in the book that is different. It is that when there is a big family fight between the wife and a man that just comes up the stairs. That one scene is very very different. And it makes the movie even better.     Overall this is a very boring movie.   The ending is kind of cheesy and over the top but it is funny. At least the ending in the books and the ending when someone says he loves me and a person saying that is very cute. I hope that when the book is made into a movie its a lot better. That would make this movie more appealing to me. Because I had a lot of fun with the book but the movie version I just cannot watch.   of 6 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad movie: -------------------------- Not only is this bad, but the worst part about this movie is that it comes out of nowhere...like it's not even supposed to be a sequel, but a prequel (or even a pre-credits sequence that only occurs when the movie starts and the ending isn't even shown). Now I know it was a remake of a similar film, and it's probably not as bad as that movie was, but still...it's not very good. What I do like about this one is it's like a movie from the old west...you know the type...in this case it's a western that is only in color. And when the sun goes down, the desert becomes very bright because of the glow of the oil lamps, and everything becomes very colorful. In this movie we get to see quite a few of the original characters: John S. D. Taggart (as in John Taggert) is a sheriff who is going to get revenge against his nemesis, Johnny Steele (a pretty bad looking guy) and he has an eye for girls. This is another good character with a cool hat and a sharp tongue. Another character is the Indian girl Chanda (who has no lines, but who is really sexy) and she has a little "fantasy" with Sheriff Taggarts son (who comes in later and is a lot of fun to watch). There are also several of the townsfolk who like John (and who are only in black) as well as the town police (who are only wearing white). So basically this movie takes place in several places with a mix of both Western and Western-themed characters. And you can tell right away that this is one that really tries to do something different with the old fashioned Western. It certainly doesn't work. It's just not good. The soundtrack is mostly generic cowboy tunes, with a few exceptions in which the music is played very loud. The acting is terrible, and the most memorable part of the movie is not one of the characters, it's the scene when Sheriff Tass is hunting a bear and he encounters a young black man, who shoots him in the chest with a pistol. When Tass falls into the canyon, the bear is right there, waiting for him. The bear's roar is amazing, the rest of the film just doesn't seem to work. I'd give this a 2/10. Just remember this is from the 1980's, and this film is a

The brothers never really go anywhere, but you really don't think about that when they are being the brothers you get a lot of laughs in between the bad guys getting their comeuppance. The movie was so short but had so much action and action like it was really made for the TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A big star is wasted on a mediocre movie.  The movie starts with a great introduction about a girl, Rosella, who lives by herself.   Rosella is beautiful and beautiful with a very rich family and it is said that she is a natural born princess.  And then Rosella was born in the 19th century to the famous painter, Leonardo da Vinci.  Rosellaaaaaaaa da Vinici was a great painters and he was great at painting pictures.  He had beautiful landscapes and so on.  So he became wealthy and had a huge mansion.  One day an unknown person was given a painting of Rosella.  The first time she was given the painting, it was the painting that was sold by Van Gogh to Van Gohehe who then sold the painting to the Duke of Marlborough.  When she was three she saw this painting and she felt it was a very beautiful painting of her family.  She went to her family and said she was a princess and could she please have the painting.  But when she was told that the painting was sold, she cried her heart out and asked her father to sell it to her instead, but he refused.  This was the end of Roselli's life.  Now we are told that Rosella married and moved to Paris in 1866.  There she meets a man, Claude, who was from the Royal Collection.  They fall in love and become a couple.  In this book they meet a few other beautiful girls as well.  You see this movie is all about the love story and how Rosella falls in love with Claude, they fall in Love and then start a family. But there is one thing Rosella loves to do more than anything else.  Like her husband she likes to go to the theater and she gets a great show every evening.  I will add I wish the movie was a little more like the book and was a more romantic movie.  But that was not enough to save this movie from being a disappointment.  At the end when Rosella finds out that Claude is going to die she is distraught.  Then when Claude passes away she doesn't cry or get sad.  We get a few lines of Rosella, like she said "I'm gonna miss you Claude" and "I love you and I'm going to miss you every moment of my life. "  And she does. I just want to end
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was not a great movie. The first act was fine. The "love-story" was ok, but not anything special. They had great action, and even a special, which I didn't care for at all. The second act was boring. The characters seemed to die (literally). The story felt very contrived. The ending didn't even make sense. The movie is filled with clichés and poorly written characters. There is a lot of swearing and sexual themes in the movie. In short, this movie is very bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of the people on my newsgroup seem to think this is a wonderful movie.  I'm really sad to see it being panned as crap by a good number of people.  But here it is, a movie no one could resist.  It's a simple but very clever movie, made to seem like something it really isn't.  This movie takes place in a world where everyone is made of flesh.  The "monsters" are flesh-men.  These flesh-man are a race of beings with flesh on their bodies and their minds run on flesh.   The main protagonist of the film is a small but intelligent and brave man who goes on a journey to the world of "the monsters" to find a way out of their horrible world and the horrible people who live there.  In the process of his quest, he comes to face some of the "monstrous" people, especially a woman who is "tough and strong" and who can fight off "monstres."  The movie uses a story line that involves one "monster" after the other.  There's a giant "monstrosity" who is also the leader of a bunch of monstrous people who have kidnapped a girl.  He has the girl trapped in his basement, and he'll do anything to get her to "come out" of the cellar.  Then there is a "very strong monster" who seems to be the leader for the other monstrous people.    Then the story becomes more "horror film" with the "very very strong monster," who tries to make the "girl" come out of the dark basement.  And so on.   In general, the "movie" is rather well acted.   The people who play the "monster people" and the "flesh-men" are also very nice.  Even though the movie uses "fictional" material to explain some of its plot, most of the dialogues is delivered pretty well.   The movie is quite fast-paced.  Some of the scenes that take place here and there, sometimes in the middle of the movie.   One good thing about this movie is that there is no nudity, no sexuality, no drugs, and no evil creatures.   This movie could easily pass for something like the "Titanic" or "Raiders of the Lost Ark" in a lot of ways.  So why can't it seem like a movie worth seeing
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The title of this movie is very clever, but all the rest of it  is so bad. I liked this movie. There are moments I liked that other times I could not. There were moments I hated that other moments I loved. This movie I like a lot, it is a bad comedy and it has that "funny" feeling to it. It has that comedy element to it that the comedy genre was known for and if there are some laughs at this movie there are plenty to them. I do find that at times with other movies it is sometimes easy to get bored. Not this movie, however. The movie has its moments of good acting in it, but is all bad acting. I would like to see some good scenes from the other actors, not only because there were very few scenes for the most part, but because it was so obvious at times that all the other acting was not good. There was one funny part and one funny scene and that was it. So, not good acting at all. The acting for some was very poor. It was hard to be funny and the movie has this "funky" feel to it and if the acting is not good in this movie then the movie is not funny. It did not have enough jokes for me. If there are funny moments for the acting then there are enough. If I were to watch this I would skip the other movies and watch this because it is funny and entertaining. I did not enjoy this much to be honest.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In a way, I understand why the writers felt like they needed an excuse for the final act.   It's the only good thing about this film, and that's the entire movie.  To me it seems like there were some really cool possibilities here.  There are a number of great and interesting characters, and it seemed like this film could have really taken off in a different direction.  The only one that sticks in my mind is Mr. Mosely.  Maybe this is just the film that brought him back to me.  In the end however, it just seems like a good way to close the series (of what was actually a series of films) for the time being.

It's a great movie with nice music and effects, but it's a complete waste of time and effort.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- I am a huge fan of horror movies, so when I saw the trailer for the new zombie movie "The Dead State", I had to get it. After reading some of the reviews that were good or bad, I knew I had a keeper. When it started, I thought I was going to be the victim of a crime movie. It had a great score, and made me look forward to it! The set up was a college girl gets bitten by a zombie while in the shower, and tries to make it a sexy zombie movie! The girl looks like a sex doll, and has a very disturbing smile. The movie is very interesting, and the effects were good. The sex scenes were great. The zombies are a little annoying, but they are always there when a zombie is coming! The zombie is very good, and a lot of the action happens when the zombies are in their "natural state". The only thing I could complain about is that the girl was not attractive enough. The rest of the movie is a winner. If you want a mindless zombie movie, I would definitely recommend this movie!

The movie is pretty much the epitome of bad horror, it's so long you wonder how they will get away with this crap. I have the feeling that I'll be seeing a lot of the same films from this list.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie doesn't work, it's not a good movie at all. It has a script that's just boring and stupid; it's a film with no real story and no real emotions. It's basically a film where the characters just talk, all the action is boring and none of the acting is interesting. This movie is terrible, in fact I'd probably watch it again just for the fact that it had such a boring and poorly made script. Not to mention that it was made in 1989 and the special effects are dated and awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is all about the kids. The story line was not original and was just lame. The only thing that kept me going through all of the bad times were the kids who went through the fun times. It all worked out. I liked the kids more than I liked this movie. I did not like the ending to this movie at all. I do not understand how someone could not like a movie where the movie is about the main character.  Rated 4 out of 5 by jakeg from funny movies don't get any funnier I think this was more of an adult film but it seemed a lot younger than that. It is definitely worth checking out as there is lots to like about it but also a lot to dislike about it. I hope a second installment happens for the characters and the whole movie is not all about them. The acting could have been better especially because we did not get to see the entire cast in action. The main character I like a lot but there is a lot of kids that get their share in the action. Overall I enjoyed it very much. This could be a good comedy with the kids but it really did not end up being that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This movie is a complete disaster. First of all it is obvious that it was made by an idiot with a huge ego. The acting is atrocious and it's impossible to understand a single line being spoken. Also, the story is terrible. If I had a bad story it would be about an ugly kid who kills a little boy, who then grows up to be the greatest wrestler in history. This is not that story. Instead the kid gets a new identity, and grows into a big weak loser. It's obvious the writer put himself first and that's why the movie ends in disaster. This movie should never have been made. It was a complete mistake. I gave it a 0 in my rating scale.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   I was skeptical about this one before I even started it because I had never seen a movie about a cat that looks like he was carved out of solid concrete, but after watching it I'm a convert. If you've ever wanted to do an actual live act with a stuffed animal I can't think of anything better. The actors are all good, the scenery is spectacular, and the acting isn't too bad. My wife and kids thought it was hilarious and it's one of those movies you can watch while driving, just as long as you don't get any dumber then you did in the first half. If that is too much for your blood, then just take my word for it and skip the part where it's an actual cat.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't expect it to be anything but a boring and unimaginative action film.  It's not even really about any of the characters or their struggles.    It's all about the characters themselves and their problems.  They were all in the same place at the same time and it's like they were talking to each other all day!   When I found out the actual story I was just confused as to why we'd ever go to see the "Hollywood action movies" when they're all so predictable and devoid of life.  What a waste of money and time...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is a bit long and the special effects are pretty bad.  It doesn't get much more ridiculous than a guy that goes through a magical transformation into a giant turtle and then runs into a small girl, only to be crushed to death by a mountain.  And that was it.   This is not the movie I was hoping to see.  Not much more to say except don't watch it unless you want to see a man eat a girl, and then he would probably have to eat a goat as well to avoid being too much of a dick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is one of my all-time favorite films of all time. My dad gave this to me at my 13th birthday as a Christmas present. I must confess that even I was taken aback by this movie; the acting was amazing, the writing was witty and the music was outstanding! This film is just so much fun that we don't really care who or what dies, as we're all too enthused and amused by what's going on. But my favorite part, by far, is the film's music; they give a beautiful, haunting tune when the main characters finally reach their destination: heaven. For me, heaven is a place where everyone is happy and everyone knows how to act and what to say!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is like a bad horror movie, with lots of creepy stuff. A guy has fallen off the roof, and is dead. The body, in a state of undress, is found floating in a canal. He has a woman with him and he is also dead... The woman gets angry and kills her lover. The woman is a witch and uses her power to kill men with fire (or acid...) and to take a child as a sex slave. I didn't like this movie at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________________________ Behold the new film by the one and only John Waters: A Christmas Tale. I never expected to see the director of Drowning Pool return to his lovecraftian roots, but what a delightful film! It took a while to get going, but when it did it was a good ride! I would have liked to see a bit more done with the characters, such as how do you tell the story of this holiday story? I guess it would have been best done in black and white or something. The special effects are all very old school: a fireplace, some creepy figures etc. I don't see a big difference between the old and new ones. But what I do like is the title "a Christmas Tale." I think some children could identify with that. If not for the little "joke" in the beginning that some people like to tell at Christmas that "you ain't got no Christmas spirit", this movie would have taken a long time to set up. I know that there are better stories out there, but I liked it. There was a lot of blood for a short movie, and I was afraid they'd run out of it, but it's not as though they need it. I suppose I've seen Waters films in the past, but this is better. I'm still curious what this is for though! It's not worth a watch. __________________________ View or download online via:  VHX.com or TV.com ______________________________________________

It's too long for the movie but not the movie itself:   After a nice opening, the character  Baskin  is taken under the wing of the evil  Professor   Gorgon  at the University of Thessaly.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've only seen a few bad films and had always been interested in trying new films. This is a really interesting film. It begins as a typical comedy film where we follow a couple through the night and then into the morning, the usual comedy plot where a woman's husband finds a little girl who will be his wife (and she is beautiful enough for her own wedding). She seems pretty intelligent though she seems a bit naive and a bit slow. There is a funny moment towards the end where she has to pretend to be a virgin and then the girl comes back into the bedroom to find the husband lying there naked naked (a bit unusual in a film where everyone seems so clean). And this is all as the film develops in a pretty conventional way, it just is not as good as it could be.   So you begin in the morning where we see the couple driving through a deserted suburb. It is a fairly typical film but the mood of the countryside is quite interesting. The husband is being rather slow to respond to the idea of taking another woman but he does eventually do it. Then we see a rather large building with people who seem to be in some sort of factory. The first thought I had was 'a castle', a very large castle which I was hoping to see the inside of but alas no such luck. There are apparently some very strange men working in that factory but who they are is hard to get clear. What is even more worrying is the idea that the man's head can be removed from his body without any pain to the man! It is very disturbing as we see this man being tortured and then to have his head pulled out of his body just seems very bizarre. Later in the day we see some people in a car who seem pretty normal. We meet a character named Denny (the one who looks like a clown, he is quite a character) and he is an interesting character and even seems to be enjoying his job as a clown. Then when we do get to see Denny in action he is a very peculiar figure, he walks with a limp and walks in a way that seems to imply a sort of sexual humiliation or something. He has a very small penis and the way he walks is very interesting. He is also quite clever in his attempts to get what he wants and he seems quite likeable. The film does not go into any really interesting areas beyond the main story and it seems like a fairly dull film to me.   the music
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie in the entire canon and it's the worst movie ever made...I didn't know what to think.  Why is everyone always acting so sad?  This movie is like the last hours of a very sad people who don't have anyone to care about them but for their pets (they don't even talk to each other) and they do it to themselves and it is very sad.   And the last two minutes when they all leave, and the dog runs out with her head stuck in the fence...  If you watch this movie you will cry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ This was an interesting attempt to do a science fiction movie about an interstellar war between two groups of people. The one that comes from Earth has advanced weaponry and technology that allows them to fight on planetary surfaces. The other group comes from the "Star System" which includes an "Eden," "Arboreal" and "Temperate" planets. While on planet Arboreal, the planet is destroyed by a gigantic asteroid. This is when we see our heroes. They are all from the Arboral colony on Earth, they are sent into space to retrieve a mysterious artifact known as "The Heart of Darkness." They have all their technology there and they are in a lot of trouble. I guess it is all a part of the fun that these guys have! _________  I am a huge geek, and I love movies like this and I thought it was a fun sci-fi movie. The only thing that bothered me about this movie is the bad acting. Some of the actors were so bad, I thought they should have been fired. At the beginning, the lead actor, Michael Pena, is a great character. He is trying to be funny and a leader but the rest of the characters don't know he is a joke. There were so many things that should have kept it funny. But it never really was. It was too much work for a group of people that aren't smart.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst of the trilogy. The story was great: it's like a mix between a movie based on a book and a movie where the bad guy is portrayed by a comic book artist.  It's the same bad guy who had made several films before this, so you know he's going to do something ridiculous.  The screenplay is so bad that it's almost unreadable.  The story is about the hero, a scientist (a young Charles Durning) and his wife who are traveling through Central Asia when a bunch of bandits ambush them.  When they're all taken prisoner, the young scientist (he had been an engineer and worked for a secret government agency) manages to use a special chemical that is supposed to be invisible to the eyes of people who have not been exposed to it.  This is apparently the super-weapon developed by the government to use in the case of a nuclear war.  In fact, it's a horrible thing, because it makes anything with it invisible, and it also can turn other people invisible.  It's a wonder any of the bandits are anyone of note, or that the scientist's wife can get out of the room unharmed.   The only thing that saved the movie from having a bad ending was when the scientists managed to figure out a way to turn the chemicals invisible again.  I could spend a whole paragraph explaining why this is a terrible movie.  And it's terrible because it has a writer who's never made anything worth watching, and who doesn't bother to make the science interesting at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a poor movie with weak characters, bad writing, poorly shot and the most boring ending.  That, of course, is the point!  There is no plot, no real emotion, and the acting is not even that good.  I will go out on a limb here and say that it should be labeled a terrible sequel.  The story is about two girls who find a book that has magic powers that are more dangerous than they really are.    The author is trying to make the book more dangerous.  They are told to put it in a tree, but there is a problem. The tree doesn't grow in the real world.  Instead, the tree is growing in the dark, with people coming to it.  It's a scary story, and I liked it a lot better when the magic didn't exist.  You can't make your characters scary if they're invisible.  I'm really glad I saw it in the theater.    If I was really into horror movies, this would have been a favorite.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a shame that so many young people are lured into the world of this movie. It is very difficult to make a good movie out of this.  The writing is mediocre.    The plot is uninteresting and slow.    What makes this movie so bad is the performance of the two main characters and the two girls.  I thought it was about two teenagers that get lost in the woods and must look for the exit.  The plot was weak and I can't believe how many different characters were introduced.  It was like the movie was trying to keep up with the times.  This movie may be good for teenagers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's the kind of movie where a good idea and some good actors are all it takes to make a bad film bad.  The story is weak and the acting (from the movie's co-screenwriter) was terrible and unoriginal.  The plot is stupid and the actors were all trying to be serious and convincing (except for the girl) and the story has no story to it, it's just a lot of talking, a lot and lots of singing and dancing to try and convey how great the big-budget flick is.  As for the acting, my one complaint is that the girl who plays a prostitute was too bad, the movie could have been called "Sex with a prostitute" and the whole "Pimp's revenge" thing was just lame and I don't like her characters (the movie is based on a book and she plays a character based off a character in that book) but her only saving grace is that she's the first time I've seen a prostitute in a movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this a few times over the years, so it hasn't really stuck out for me.  If you're an action fan or just like explosions in your films, this is for you.  It is a movie with a good premise and a great cast, but the execution is just off.  The story is a lot like the film, and I mean, it has been done before, so that's not a bad thing.    The premise is simple, a boy's dad is abducted, and the girl, a new recruit to the army, has to go in to rescue her father.  She doesn't actually have a dad in the story, she's adopted, so the story focuses mostly on her search for her father, and trying to figure out how to get him home.  It's a simple idea that could have been much better, but I guess with a movie named " The Girl Who Loved To Blow Stuff ", a simple is good.  Also it is one of the first movies to ever involve a motorcycle, and you know it!  At its heart, it's a movie about the bonds and bonds of the soldier (and it is mostly a soldier) but, in this case, the soldiers are on motorcycles.  And you'll see where this is going.  One of the movies that I just don't like, I can't say it was because of the action or just the acting, but because there's way too much of it.  There are a lot of scenes that take up at least a third of the screen, and even if there is a reason to the movie that's been in the making for a while, that doesn't change that this film doesn't add anything to the world and never tries to tell a story.  I don't know who is making this movie. It has no story. It is just the same old stuff with explosions and robots.  Even with all the characters in this movie, it seems like the only thing the director has given to the characters is that they look identical to one another.  So while you are getting to know who the guy is, you also are getting annoyed by the constant change of clothes the guy gives himself in different scenes.  Just as the characters seem to be on the verge of realizing who these people are, they immediately change to a new, unknown character and then back again, then they do it again!  So, if
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie as it is pretty fun to watch and it doesn't make me laugh once. It's so far removed from the original, with so little to do or see it feels like we're doing the same old thing, but I'm not even sure we are. As a movie the actors get very little to work with, but don't let that turn you away. I think it's a fairly good horror film with a few very bad scenes but it's also very enjoyable to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am going to be honest and say that this is really not a good movie. It does have some pretty cool scenes and some nice effects, but for the most part, this movie just looks like a really expensive CGI movie made by a bunch of kids, and we're supposed to care about them? Really? The whole concept and premise is pretty lame and ridiculous. The movie makes this bad guy look a bit like a big-ass manatee and the girl who tries to capture him (in a big fish tank) actually resembles a giant crab. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is the first movie you watched, this movie is not really your cup of tea. The story is predictable, a bunch of old men run around a village trying to prevent people from being murdered, then there's some random death to cover up that they themselves caused. They don't make any sense, or don't think of the most basic reasons why these deaths should be prevented. If these people were truly bad guys, they would have figured out that the only people they can't get to do this kind of thing are the old people, but the movie makes it seem like they are all so stupid that this is no big deal. It seems that they want everyone to know they are the only ones smart enough to run this sort of thing. Then there's a really silly plot where the evil witch from the movie gets captured by these old guys and they don't just have to make her get back to their country to make sure she doesn't run amok. They just want to kill her, and then when she gets out, they don´t want to just let her go because they don' know who the hell she really is. This movie is just a bunch about the old men with a big plot of some sort of "revenge" that can't be accomplished.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie at the theater a few times. The main reason it's not a four star is because the actors do not act. They are not in any way in sync. They all do things, but they all don't act like they do. They could act like one another but they do not. It's all about acting. I like it when the movie tells a good story. But not this time. There are very few moments of true emotion. The scenes involving the young boy were okay but the rest were pretty weak. I was sad the boy was killed in such a way. I also liked that the movie had something to say about war, but it could not be said without a major reprise. Not a four stars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a good movie, but it is terrible. A good story about an American soldier who is sent to an occupied country to protect the inhabitants.  The main problem with this film is that the characters are not really well drawn or realistic. They seem a bit "slightly insane". The camera style is a bit choppy and the sound is not as good. It is worth seeing for the "action" and the soldiers but you will be disappointed if you try to enjoy it as a comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies where everything comes up short. The acting, story, and the acting of the woman. When she talks we are like, "Hey there's someone over there." She seems to be saying that to other characters at times, but we are left thinking, "Is this woman really that stupid or did she just think that it would look good for the audience." The dialogue is like the first grade of the show. The jokes are stale, the characters are wooden. The show is not funny. The characters are annoying, the acting is pathetic, and a horrible special effects scene.   The first two are more "funny" than anything. I just wished this was the last.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of those things where the story just didn't make any sense. It is a pretty stupid story, so much so that you have to give it a negative rating.   The movie begins with the narrator saying that we have reached "A new world, a new world" with an "old man's voice." We are told by our narrator that it will soon be full of "old men." This old man is a "sir," and our narrator says that there are only three kinds of people in the world, the good, the brave, and the stupid. The good are the "sirs" and the brave are the good people of their times. In our narrator's time, there are very few brave and very many stupid people.  Our narrator says, we have gone from a time when good people were brave and brave people were good, to a time where, because of some reasons, the "old" people are "now" bad. This is a very short description, but it illustrates the general theme of the movie very well. The narrator then tells us that the bad people are also "old," so that the world is now "nowhere." The narrator continues by saying that this is one of the "new worlds" and that we need to have "a new time" in which to live in.  The narrator says there is much work to be done in this new world because "they have a few ideas" about the new world and we need a new society with these ideas and the kind of values that we should have.  This is basically a list of ideas that were apparently invented in the early days of the 20th century, which is very vague. There are things like "equality" and "mutuality," which sounds like "communism," or "liberalism," but the narrator does not explain what the ideas are that the new "new world" wants to build and which values we should try to build our society to have. It just says that we are told there are many ideas that are "invention" and there is "a time to act." That means that we may have a time to do something in which we may not know how to act or not yet know how we want to act. It sounds as if we do not know what to do. That is probably true, but not because we are stupid. We are simply stupid people, who will have to find out what to think for ourselves. In

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am going to start of this review by saying, yes it is that bad.   It's a story based on real events that happened in the mid 19th century, the story revolved around a famous artist named John Sable, who painted The Story of the Sable Family, a series of 16  paintings about four members of the family who grew up under a very poor, uneducated, hardscrabble  family.  The paintings portrayed their daily lives and the way the family operated, they lived in a rough neighborhood and didn't have a car, there was no place to play, and the Sables had to sell all of their property (their home and all the animals they owned) in order to buy food to help feed their family. This was the background for the story of the characters of the character of The Sable family, and it's a typical American family going about their life.  I won't explain too much about the story, I'll let the movie do that, I'm not even sure if the movie is actually a story at all, it seems like a poorly conceived and badly acted piece of shite.      I'm going to talk about the most unbelievable of the things in this film, John Sables own dog.  In the movie The dog is supposed to act as his assistant.  He was supposed to be a man of great intelligence, and his job was to assist the family on their daily life, he was given a cane as a treat for walking on two legs, and he lived in the garage and barked whenever something bad happened to The Sables.  But what we see is The dog acting like a child.  It is an animal that is being trained and I think it's the most ridiculous thing that a human being could have been put through.  If the dog was a human, and not an animal, it would be thrown in the dumpster right away.  John Sabel's assistant was an amazing little dog, a manatee, that kept to his home and would only bark, and John Sabled was so worried about the manatees death that he would kill his own son if he ever came close to them, they never got too close to each other but John was afraid of the man-atees for the rest of his life. I don't know about you but to see a man-eating manate with the legs of a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!! I never thought in my life I'd be seeing a movie about a cannibal. Well, we have our protagonist. I loved his story. The whole idea is a pretty cool, but not perfect, setup for a movie. He gets a job at an old lady's nursing home in the midwest. The old lady is not having a good day. She has a bad headache and has to take a bath. The nurse has been there for twenty years. We get there and the old lady isn't in the right state of mind. Her husband is a violent drunk and is beating her up. The man that works at the nursing home is there. He looks to be thirty years old and has pretty green eyes. Well this guy is very nice and tries to help. He tries to talk to the guy that is beating up the old woman but the old man isn't going to take him seriously. He just keeps on beating up and beating the woman. We find out that the old guy is an alcoholic and that he drinks blood. He has a ritual that he does before he drinks. He goes into the bathroom and puts a rag over the woman's mouth. As soon as the rag is off the old person begins to drink blood. The guy tries to make him stop but he doesn't really care. So the guy decides to have the old mother drink some blood as well. As the old people are drinking blood they find the old nurse's dead body. They begin to eat her and she begins to scream. Now I think that is a scary beginning. It's like this horror film is setting up itself to be pretty bloody in the beginning. The rest of the movie isn't too bad but the beginning of this movie is scary.  The opening of this film is pretty much the only good thing that you will see in this movie.  The rest is pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A few years ago, the film I saw was a horror movie called The Devil Inside.   In it, a man was killed by his wife, a woman in love with a man she married.   One night, she tries to murder him in an old abandoned house where they lived.  When the police arrive to find the body, a horrible demon comes out of the house and kills the cop.  At this point, a group of friends show up, including a psychic, an alchemist, a witch, and a few other crazies.  The group is trying to save the man from the "demon" and bring him back to life.  What starts out as a strange comedy (in a really strange sort of way) becomes quite dark over the course of the film.  I felt this film had a very unique idea and story, and it is very interesting how it is told.  A special note for the actress, who portrays the bad witch in a very strong way.  This movie was produced in 1976 and it shows its age now, with the acting and some of the special effects (but not the lighting effects, not too much. I'm a sucker for it). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a very depressing movie. The only "fun" in the movie is when it's a couple of men playing with their cat (who happens to be a girl) and a dog (who's a man). That's about it. The best part is when the bad guy goes around taking people's shit and when he's about to beat them to death for it and the bad guys tell him they've had it with him.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say I was very unimpressed with "Kung Fu Panda 3".  Honestly, I would probably have enjoyed this better if it were animated.  This is the third movie in the series, and so far it seems pretty unoriginal.    What's not to like?   I liked the first two movies (I think I was watching them with my brothers when I was a kid).      I guess I don't mind that the animation was the same as before, as it still looks very good.  In "Kundun Warriors" Kung Fu Panda fights the bad guy who kidnapped Panda and made Panda do bad things.  If you know what a bad guy is, you can probably imagine the terrible things that this guy does.  It seems to me like the character was simply a vehicle to tell the story and not much else.  There is so much filler here to make up for that.  The first half is mostly just a lot of action scenes and a few nice fight scenes, and that's about it.  This isn't bad, but it doesn't really do much for me.  I have to give it a three or maybe a two on the animation level, with a big zero for the story.  P.S. I have never liked Kung Fu Pals. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this flick very annoying, it is a very repetitive story, the story is told in first person from the point of view of a woman who has recently suffered a miscarriage, this is the only character of any significance. The story is about how a little girl named Mary comes from a bad family of people with no respect for anyone and doesn't know any manners. The people around her aren't very nice either, she doesn't have much hope for the future and when the father doesn't show up for the family wedding she does what every little girl should do: cries. The movie is a pretty bad one because it does not have enough humor or a heart. When it comes to this kind of movie you get the usual 'cutesy movie' that has an original plot and a well done performance and a cute little ending that was so sad. In the end this movie is like a really bad comic book. That's it, not very funny, has no heart, sad and without any sense of romance.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! That is a BAD MOVIE. Not even a good one, just an awful one. But in the worst possible way, the people on camera are supposed to be your friends...and they are acting like total assholes! I wouldn't go out with this movie again! And I'm pretty sure that they are the only people watching this movie that do! Don't waste your time with it! It's no good!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was the fourth (the second in the series) film in the franchise and while it's not terrible, it's hardly a masterpiece. The cast is completely forgettable and the story is too predictable. What I can say is that I really wanted to like this movie. It's like a rehash of the first film and even though it's a little dated it's still entertaining. The CGI is great as well as the music and even the special effects really bring the movie home. Unfortunately I can't give it a higher rating. If you have the money, I recommend the first one because this one is pretty cheap.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love that they kept this under 2 hours.  It is a fun movie if you love kung fu flicks (i do).  The story is well told and has great fight scenes.  I am impressed with the way they keep these movies going with good action scenes and funny dialogues. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most pathetic attempt at making a fun and exciting action movie that I have seen.   I can hardly wait for the next sequel.  The first half of the movie is about a group of mercenaries hired to bring in a Chinese gangster from a remote island so he can have some fun playing cards with a rich Japanese dude.  The second half is about how they meet and how they go to get some good laughs and some high octane action. The rest is just a bunch of bad acting, no great action, no memorable characters and boring plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The last 20 minutes of this awful flick will drive you bananas! You see, that man who is driving a motorcycle is a real jackass! We have an incredibly annoying movie about an army unit, and of course, the main character, a motorcycle rider who gets to ride his machine through town at night and kill a bunch of people. Then it is revealed that he actually died when his motorcycle crashed! We then have an action movie about the army doing their job! The military gets all that they deserve. The special effects are bad, and some of the people are completely ridiculous. I found it all very cheap and stupid, especially the acting and the music.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best way to describe this movie is "funny". I would like to see someone come up with something really original.    "It is a pleasure to die, it has so much to offer. Death does so much in the world, and he can be so much fun, especially when I'm with him. But...you can't be a good death, you must be a perfect one. That is my motto, that is my life philosophy."   This movie may look silly and stupid, but there's actually a lot of good ideas.  This is a really nice, enjoyable movie and one that I would probably recommend to those who have some spare time on their hands. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- I love the story and I love this movie but this movie is nothing more than a big boring boring movie. The special effects look ridiculous and the storyline is boring and boring. It's a big disappointment in this movie especially because I had high expectations of it but it doesn't deliver a good ending to a very bad movie. Don't waste your time with this. Don;t waste yourtime with this movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's all over the place.  The film starts as I thought it would,  with the characters, at first we are introduced to Paul, a young man who has a problem with a girl that he's seeing.  After seeing a video of her (played by Sarah Jessica Parker ) I said that it sounded a bit too similar to a film I had seen a couple of years back -  But to be fair, I wasn't alone in thinking this.   Anyway, Paul (who has been looking for a way out for a while) gets a job at a motel and finds a room that he likes.  It seems like a normal hotel, but he notices that there is a girl in that room.  The room he lives in is full of strange things.  There is a woman who has her own special room that's only for her, there are a little man-like people all over that room, and a girl with black hair, blue eyes and a mouth that can move.  Paul also finds that he has to take care of a small man named Jack (played as a young kid by Michael Rooker)  It's obvious at this point that the film is more focused on the characters than a story about a supernatural place. It's a film about people that seem like they could be friends, but they don't really seem to want to be.  Also, the plot is not very interesting.  In a good film like this you would never expect a big payoff.  Unfortunately this film is a bit of a slog.  This movie has a bit more action than the first two in the trilogy, and the final moments are good.  But I have seen the first three movies and I still think they are all better than this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Fifty Shades of Grey" has the same problems as "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the case is closed on this case, and the jury has rendered a verdict of "Not Guilty". The jury heard evidence from more than 10 witnesses, and heard the testimony of 10 people about the behavior of 50 Shades of Gray in various ways--some of the stories were so horrific and vile that the jurors sat there holding their breath, some of the witnesses seemed to want to do it justice, most of the facts were simply irrelevant to the case, some were clearly made up, and almost all of the testimony was false. The defendant was found not guilty.  But, the fact is that the jury was allowed to do its job and do what we have been told to do, and I am sure that they did what is right in every case when it comes to deciding who has a right to love and who does not.  I will leave it to my readers to make up their own minds about the facts that were presented by a jury of eight women and four men who were all able to hear the evidence and then to reach a verdict.  Some people will see the facts and decide that 50 Shades must be guilty and that he really does deserve to be in jail.  Others will see that none of the allegations were ever proved and that none were so horrible that a jury would have to sit there and hold their breath.  Those people will think that the whole thing was a joke, but I assure you it was not.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film begins with a woman trying to escape from a group of guys who are keeping her captive.   She escapes and runs towards the woods, only to be found by a man who tells her that the police have found her.  Apparently, the police went looking for her and found her on the trail of a serial rapist.  The girl was found in a state of shock and in pain, and a doctor told her that she was going to have a bad time.  They took her to a local hospital, where a doctor gave her a shot that would make her feel better but she could still feel pain, so they gave her morphine to calm her down.  Then we are suddenly introduced to the other three characters.  These are three guys who work together as the "Wolves of the Woodsmen".  One is a "Dirty Bird" (a nickname used by the people of the woods for a man of ill repute), he is the leader of this group.  He takes an interest in the girl and decides to take her back to his group. He also gets the girl a knife to take revenge on the man she was trying to save.  This is followed by "Mister Green" (or "The Green") the second in command of the group.   "Mack the Knife" is the third in command.  "Muddy" is also a "Wolverine".  We soon find out that "The Wolves of the Forest" are a group that hunt animals for sport.  It is pretty clear when you start talking to them that they like to hang around on the trails around the woods and they really like to have sex.  For starters they all go on hunting trips every weekend and each of them has a female companion with them.  There are also the girls that are hired by the men to serve as their sex slaves for their hunting parties.  I'll let the movie speak for itself:
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very bad movie.   It is just so bad.  The story is completely silly and unbelievable.  It doesn't make any sense, or make any character development at all, especially that one, "Beverly".  The plot is absolutely ridiculous.  If you are going to spend your time watching things such as these I would advise against it, unless you like watching the "Mummy, The Curse of the Werewolf" movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was a real disappointment.   A movie based on a real murder in which a man is killed and his body thrown in a barrel.  It was the same case as the two previous films I'd seen, that is, the same murder, the actor in this film is the same actor, the murders are similar.  Not that this is a bad thing, not when you've got a film like this, it's just that I thought it was more exciting the first time I saw it.  I was hoping they'd make it more interesting by making it follow a different murderer, the main one was the second, so that was kind of a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought I liked "Saw" the first time I saw it on the big screen, and I still do. It's a pretty good comedy about a group of people living in a home for the elderly. Some of the people are so out of it, and their personalities just scream, "I could care less," while others seem to actually have a sense of humor. The other characters are mostly uninteresting, and it's almost a waste to have a character who has to have more than one line in the movie: "Oh, it's just me." It would probably make a great comedy, and then a very boring documentary, but not a funny comedy. But it does have something that really makes me love it: its beautiful, sad and quiet ending.  I really don't think that there is much that can be said about the story that hasn't already been said. A group of elderly people who've lived a long life are still at their best, and there's a bit of comedy in the beginning, even though it isn't very funny at all. But after awhile, the movie becomes very depressing, and the humor in it seems to be lost. After about a third of the movie, I found that it had a somewhat dull ending, and that was when I gave up, and just sat there and watched it. I still enjoyed it, even if it wasn't my favorite.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a couple of decent films from the directors David Cronenberg and Thomas Pynchon, the story here is predictable and dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â I wasn't sure what to think of this one. I've not been impressed by any of the recent "Fifty Shades" movies and most of the bad ones I've seen have been bad for the same reasons: there is no story, no actors are playing the usual roles, nothing really connects except the idea that a man is so turned on by the love of his life that it changes his personality and he begins to abuse her. Â Now if you have read the books there is a lot more here to think about than what happens in the film. However, this is probably the worst of them all.  It has nothing to do with sex or violence or anything else that would have made it worth seeing. It just is a bad film for the worst reasons. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is nothing new at all.   The film is based around a man called Rufus (played by James Garner) and his fiance Lina who is the daughter of a man who once was a good leader but turned bad.  The man Lina's father was a really great leader with an amazing eye for detail and could draw his people into his life in a real manor even when he was getting on in years.  Lina and her father then decide to take over the family business.  This movie has an amazing amount of violence.  It is really hard to keep track of who is who.  At one stage she tells her father that her grandfather is a big shot that once ran the town but his son has moved on to other things now.  That's about it.  I don't understand why they went into production with this movie.  In the end there is really not much going for this movie at all and I wouldn't recommend it to even my family and friends who enjoy violence.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main story line of this film is a complete mess. It's hard to get a handle on what's going on, and it seems like someone's writing has run out of ideas. It seems like a plot that has been used before, but I would like to know why the bad guys have to be so stupid to be able to escape from the police. This movie has one of the worst plot devices of all time. There's a helicopter that flies around the city, and we never see what's doing. It is never clear what they want, and most likely don't know the plot either. The main villain has to travel over a river. He looks really cool, with a jet engine on his jet-powered motorcycle, and a giant sword. There are only one or two shots of this sword and it's just kind of a blur. The only good thing is that it looks real. I don't have to look at a computer for that. The film is so ridiculous that it makes it hard to care. We're supposed to be looking at a film that's about a young girl's adventure to find her missing father, and when it finally comes around you think it's gonna be good, but then the movie goes on a rollercoaster ride of badness. I would have loved to see this more. I wish I saw it earlier, or with an early edition. It could have been great. I'm still angry at the filmmakers, as I'd really like to see the ending, but since I have seen it now it wasn't that bad. I am a bit of a masochist, so I loved it, but there wasn't anything new to be discovered here. That's just me, though.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie does not deserve a score. It's just that bad. The story about a man being haunted by his own son is interesting enough, but the way the movie ends, when it ends, is just a disaster. There's a whole sequence at the end, when the son has to get dressed and go to bed, in a different room. Then he opens the door to this other room, with this ghost, who is holding a gun, and then he has to shoot him. Then the ghost shoots him again. This happens over and over, like a movie with no ending.   I have had quite a few nightmares lately. I have had a lot of nightmares. Not one has been as bad as this one. It is just that great. I know I should give it less than a 1 out of 10, but no way!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this on VOD last night, it's about a bunch of students who go to a party. The first day is fun! All of the people are having a good time except for the guy on the bus (played by George Wendt) who is drinking and making jokes at everyone's expense. Then he gets an old man with a long handlebar moustache. This is the worst film EVER about a bus guy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't watch this movie. I got so bored watching it.  So boring!  It started slow and then just kept coming.  I mean, I don't like fast paced films, but it did not get any better.  There were only two moments in the whole movie where I was enjoying it. One was when they were trying to go through a door and the door was like a doorframe.  The other was when a doctor was helping a little boy with a toothache.   He was a very nice little kid.  This film will not entertain you, so skip it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main issue is the acting. It feels as though they went all out for this film. I had thought it was a funny idea until I saw some of the dialogues. One of them is called "Ladies' Night" which is an obvious reference to the infamous 'ladies night' clubs that exist in every small town throughout the world. One is called the "Bond Girls" so, yeah, that's how this is going down. The dialogue can be funny when you can get past the terrible acting, but I guess I don't want to hear such cringeworthy scenes and dialogues, let alone worse. The film is so much better than it sounds. I can't tell if this is the end or is it just a set up for a better film. But in any case, there are worse films out there. I'd highly recommend this, but if you're looking for something that will entertain you, skip it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If I wanted a story of survival, then this movie would've been perfect. And I'm not talking about being stuck in a mountain. What I'm talking about is an escape from the real world.   The only real story I've ever seen about this was The Exorcist. I can't remember who won that, but it was a lot of fun.  As for the acting, it was awful. Everyone was doing exactly what they should've done, and none of them were doing a good job at it.  And then there's the acting. I didn't know who any of these actors were, and then I saw the final scene and I was like "What?"   I found it funny that they all wanted to be an actor because they all thought they could be one, but they could never make it in the movies.  If there's one person who will make the most realistic movies, it's this guy: " I just don't have anything."   So, I guess you can put that as my rating for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It looks like a great idea with an intriguing concept, and maybe I'm the one that is "not in tune" with the idea. The idea was that if an alien came to earth and made us all play video games he'd make us be the heroes in the video games, and that we'd win. I'm starting to get that the "heroes" in the games aren't just trying to kill each other but instead to protect their universe. At one point it was made clear that the aliens have sent a computer virus into this universe and that they are in the middle of a war between the aliens and the humans. This is just not interesting, and it's not even very believable. So in comes the bad guy, who doesn't even seem to be in charge of this whole "plan" to make us play video game. What is he in charge about? Why is he on this planet? Why aren't there any other aliens in this video game universe? He's trying to make this video games where we're all the heroes? That's not what video games are. Video games are to be played to be beaten, and the games would end when there is an obvious "victory" over the villain, who isn't even capable of beating him, let alone the other aliens on this Earth. When the bad guys come back in to get the treasure, the bad aliens just stand around and give the heroes the chance to get it? Yeah, I'm not buying it. The movie never even manages to explain how the baddies come back after the treasure is taken away. The bad guys are all too happy to stand around making fun of the heros when it's all over, and then just run off again.   Overall, a bad video game movie, but I'll give the movie another shot.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad piece of rubbish with a terrible story and some good performances.   I don't know what the heck this film is about, but it doesn't even try to be good, it is an unoriginal, boring and cheesy adventure with a bad story.  I can not believe this film has such an imdb rating of 3.3.  I would prefer this film in a museum instead.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I have seen, with some bad acting and stupid characters. The movie starts off with a shot of a huge building with fire sprinklers. It becomes much darker and eerie to where we learn that there is a group of killers who can hear anything that is in the room and they are going to do something to the owner. It is the same group of guys from the movie that went back to haunt this town in the past. This is just stupid.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After being disappointed by The Hunger Games, I was excited about this one. Unfortunately, it wasn't any better or worse, but I still wanted to love it. I did. I mean, I loved it. It's a cute movie about a girl who finds a cute bunny. She's never seen one, so she's pretty excited to find one. (Okay, I'm pretty excited about some pretty cute things.) She can't find a home for it so she decides to adopt one. The Bunny is pretty funny, but the thing that stands out the most is how sad she is about losing the bunny. I'm not too familiar with the franchise, so I didn't understand a lot of it, but even without knowing the entire plot, I was entertained enough. That's about all I can say about the movie, other than to say that it was adorable.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was the worst movie ever. The character design is terrible and the plot does absolutely nothing. The movie just ends and the only part is a dream sequence where people get run over by cars and fall through the streets. Not even a cliffhanger and it ends with a stupid song in a fast car. What a terrible bad movie. I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie.

His last days on earth (i don't remember where i saw this, but i think it was at the library at my school) were very poignant and funny. The movie, on the other hand, had me rolling in the aisles. The special effects were great (especially the first half). The movie took place in the 1800's. It has a very dark vibe with a little horror thrown in. And what a climax. ***********
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For a movie about a young girl learning how to use a telescope to capture a comet, this film does a pretty terrible job of it.  The story involves a young lady named Lucy (Jodi Foster) and her telescope. �It doesn�t take long for Lucy to realize that she�s a hopeless romantic,� she doesn�tty have a clue about astronomy. �� But Lucy is a very good telescope.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love this movie and the director is great. The acting is great (and the movie has a lot of funny ones) but I don't like the way it was shot - and that's not just me complaining about the way the movie looks, but also the way some scenes were shot. The movie doesn't have that real sense of place and it doesn't feel like it's in the middle of some kind of magical city that they call Manhattan. The scenes in the bar were shot on location in an Italian restaurant that I haven't been to in a long time. It doesn't look all that great either. I also don't understand why the movie doesn 't start on a high note? We got the good guy getting the girl (and getting the job), the guy in love with her, and a great little romance to end the movie.   The movie could have used a little more comedy in it, but it never went above that. I was disappointed in the ending because it didn't feel real and it felt forced. I liked the movie and I like the director. But I wish it started on a higher note and that the movie ended with more of a cliffhanger. I will rewatch it on the DVD.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked the first movie so much. I saw it when it came out. I have been interested in ghost stories ever since then. I loved it a great deal. It was well made. The people who made this film were good, but there were lots of mistakes.   This movie features an innocent little boy and a young woman. They are in a haunted house. Things get out of hand when a monster gets into the house and eats the child. I think this movie is a good start for a story about a child and the monster in a house. I'm glad that the movie ended when it did.   and it was very fun to hear the girl talk about the child in her head and her feelings about the ghost.   (This movie, at least the first one, doesn't come close to being an effective horror movie.)   If you've seen this movie before, please rate this with a score of 3.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A group of three young girls are taking their first flight on a brand new plane. They are wearing cute outfits, but something is wrong. The airplane is flying too fast, and the plane's instruments have gone off the screen. As they fly back, they make a lot of wrong turns. The instructor yells at them and tells them to slow down a lot. Soon the plane crashes, and one of the girls is killed. Everyone is in a panic and runs for the exit as the plane goes down. At the landing, the three girls are tied up, and two police officers are coming to arrest them. The first officer is a nasty guy, so he tries to rape one of them, and it's not hard. That's the last anyone sees of them. Plot :  It's really simple. The three girls go to a vacation hotel and get into a fight, while the two guys show up. As it goes on, the two girls are not too interested in the men. That is, until one of those two girls says something to a guy in the bathroom, and a fight begins. The movie follows a girl named Yuma, who is trapped in her hotel room. She's stuck with the three guys from before, plus a new guy. The two guys are trying to get the girls to go down to their basement, and Yuma wants them to leave. They make their way to the basement and Yui tells them about her past. The four of them are locked in the basement, but they manage to escape. They manage to stop the bad guy (who turns out to be a police officer), then they head off to school. It's not much better that they did at the hotel. There's not a whole lot going on. There are some cool cars, Yuma gets some stuff to do, but it's all pretty unimportant. The music is not awful (though the music is just okay), and the girls are all cute (well, most of them). This was definitely a cheap movie that really shouldn't have sold a lot, but I guess it did.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this film so many times; it's one of those movies where I can't put my finger on why I like it so much. I can only say that its funny, I mean who isn't? Who wouldn't enjoy a film in which a guy walks into a diner (which isn't a diner, but it doesn't matter), says "what'd I do this time? Lookit this!", then pulls a gun out of his pocket and walks out into the street, laughing as the people around him freak out. I don't know, it's fun. If that's the reason, I'm fine. However, this is only half the movie. A lot more is going on. The ending is a cliff hanger and it's not resolved for months. I know this isn't part of the story (and it isn't) but I find it very frustrating. It seems like something could be resolved at any moment. There is no closure. But it's all fun and games, as it should be, until they realize a murder has been committed. Then, you have to watch a sadistic torture scene with the two leads, then a very creepy sex scene. They are both really, really good, in a very good movie. I'll finish with a quote from an old movie that I really like... "I'm a killer. Just a normal killer. I love the sound of a gun. It's like music to my ears."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a big fan of "The Twilight Zone". I have rewatched it several times since I was 12. So this remake was a big disappointment to me. The movie had all the elements I love about "The Thing" - the aliens, the mad scientist's evil plan, the bad guys, the aliens... and now they're gone.  I liked it when the monsters were scary and the effects were great - but now there's nothing left except the bad guy and the actors who made this movie.   One thing I have to complain about - the special effects at times looked horrible, and the monster's head was the only good part of the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm giving this a 5 star because I've seen this film at least 3 times, but it never gets old to me, and the performance by the young Jason Lee as Jason Voorhees in it is superb, I like the film and the character, and it's a fun way to get through the season for me. I've watched the trailer twice and that's enough to get the movie going, a good start.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a very good movie. As a whole, not bad, but I have had better. There are so many moments where I just felt sorry for these kids because they just seem like a bunch of dorks. There's one scene where one kid runs into a wall while running, then another one, then a third. I've never seen kids run that fast. I'm a pretty slow person but I just couldn't even keep up.  Then there's the whole kid acting like a dumb ass because he can't even run up stairs, which is not that hard, I promise. And, I get that the movie had to do with children being bad, because the movie tries so hard to give you that message but it doesn't quite work.  And it's a total disaster.   I think I can make a pretty good point about the film being a complete train wreck. There is no sense of story or anything else going on because this film is completely devoid of any sense of reality. And I mean that in the most negative possible way possible. No sense of the "what ifs" or "what might have beens" here. They don't even seem to be trying to make a good story, they just have a kid run out of a house to go to a dance. This is basically what the whole movie is about. But, I have to say the worst part about this movie is the people on set. The kid actors are pretty bad. Their acting sucks, it's just awful. They're just walking around doing nothing and just don't know what to do. They keep giving the same lines over and over to the same kids. And the directors have to play these characters up to an all time low. Just awful.  A movie like this shouldn't have the time of day. I don't think it deserves to even be given a release because a movie like that should not even be screened to the general public and we're lucky that this has even been rated R.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I have seen so far this year, it was the kind of movie you would expect in a sci-fi tv show made by a guy who has no clue about making a sci fi movie. We have a space ship that has a crew of 3 astronauts.  As soon as they land on the planet the captain says "you mustn't touch a fly!". What? Yes! I do not understand why this guy has such a silly idea? As soon it gets too cold for the temperature, the captain calls his mate who is a mechanic, and tells him to put on his suit and to go and build a fire using charcoal, which is easy. As soon the fire is up, the ship starts to fall over, and the captain decides he must do something about it. He then gets a big stick and makes a fire out of the coals. As it starts to get dark, he takes out his torch (why he needs a torch, he is a ship navigator!) and burns the forest down! The forest looks like the one on a spaceship in Star Wars! I am not kidding! You could not make this stuff up! I guess it might have been fun to watch because it was interesting to hear the captain say the silly things like "you have to keep your eyes open!" and "it is not easy out there", and "you better not touch a live one" so what I say is: do not watch this movie! It is the kind you want to watch to watch a good movie with a bunch of bad guys who are just as bad as the ones in the movie so far!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't think this movie is bad. It is actually a good movie that tells a good story. I like a good, fast paced action movie, and this is the best one. It's easy to follow and to watch as well. I'm glad I watched this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** ********* This is a very bad movie. The people on the streets of Tokyo are all about fighting crime. I am a sucker for this sort of story. Unfortunately, this is a bad version. For starters, the story is confusing. The hero is supposed to fight an evil criminal called Mr. X and kill him. But when the hero arrives, they find that the criminal is actually the boss of the criminal gang (not a bad idea) and they have a long history together. However, in the last scene, the hero goes from fighting the evil boss to fighting Mr.X. When I first watched this scene, I was confused. I don't remember if the hero was fighting the boss or not. I can't tell you why because it makes no sense. I have never seen this sort o bad movie and this is definitely one of the worst. ***********
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had seen this one a dozen or so times but this time I didn't care for it. It was terrible. It had a good premise but a terrible acting performance. The first act, when the bad guy kidnaps a girl, was just pathetic, with just bad acting. The whole movie was just about the main character and his relationship with the girl. When he kidnaps her, he asks her why she wants to be with him. I didn´t understand him. She just says that she will marry him. In the end, when he has sex with her he says that is for her parents. She says she loves him, but the rest is just boring. They should have killed this movie off a long time ago.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well here we are. We finally get to the finale. I was a bit bummed when the first few minutes of the film were just the intro to an action movie. But after that, it's just a bad adventure movie, with too many "we'll never get caught" jokes. I don't know why this is a cult classic: it's not that funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst horror movies ever made, this is just sooooooo lame. It is not an original idea, and at no point do the characters feel real, the only character that feels real is the bad guy, who is not really that bad, and the only point of the movie is to scare a group of people. The movie is also filled with soooo many mistakes that the movie would never work, if the characters were in any way realistic. I just wanted to throw up! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******************* I have been to a few movies in Hollywood, the most recent being the "Cape Fear". I was very impressed with it. The film was pretty good overall, but I felt the ending was very disappointing and not fitting for the characters. I thought the last scene was lame, the same character was shown doing a stupid "dance" like the one on the cover for the movie. They didn't have the ability to do anything else. I didn't buy it, even the reviews didn't really help it. I don't like sequels, it was bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was horrible.  And I hated it.    The actors did a bad job of portraying real people.    One character who wasn't terrible was a little girl whose grandmother has a strange disease and the grandmother is a real person.  It was just a complete mess of a movie.  The characters seemed too perfect, one was perfect, another not, a third seemed like a man with a machine gun and two girls didn't even seem to get along well, it was like one scene after another. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those crappy "movies" with poor special effects.   It doesn't make any sense.  I'm not sure I have ever had a more disgusting movie.  The girls are dressed like a bunch of zombies, with their hair all wet, and the bad guys, the zombies, are wearing a bunch t shirts, with the zombie's names written on them.  How does one make such a crappy movie?  It is like you watched the whole thing without reading the script, then a writer came along and wrote the most terrible script imaginable.  It would be better to spend that time reading a script and not watch a bad bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is based in the olden time but it really tries to make something new. It is really an entertaining, romantic, romantic movie but there is nothing wrong in the story but it is quite unoriginal at this time. It does not have a good message. The story is not original but the way the story is written is really beautiful. I do enjoy watching the movie for some reason but it was not very good to me.  I give it a 3 out of 5.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******************** First off, this is the "real life" film version of an idea that appeared on the internet back in 2004. A few days ago I read about a video game that has a "ghost hunter" who will fight against ghosts from the past and the present. ********** Ghost Hunter is a simple story: a young man is looking for his father. His father died in a car crash some twenty years ago. Now he lives in an apartment in a small, isolated, rustic, old house. ************ A few years ago, my friend's father died of a heart attack. She had known him long and had grown to like him very much. Now she is on a mission to find him. She goes to a local ghost hunting club called the Ghost Hunters. They have a special device which they use to track down ghosts and they will give her a job. ******************* The film follows our main character Jason and his friend Chris (played by Joe Pesci), who are both members of the Ghost Hunter group. Jason is a young, idealistic guy who, for whatever reason, is obsessed with death. In his spare time he is also the president of the neighborhood association. His life is one huge fantasy game. ------------------------- When they first meet, the Ghost Warriors are just the two guys who take the job for the sake of the money and the fame. They both feel that they are just doing the right thing. Chris seems like a typical high-schooler. Jason on the other hand is an idealist who is driven by a burning desire to prove himself. _________ Jason's mission in life is to search for his deceased father. Chris finds himself being sucked into Jason's bizarre and exciting fantasy world. This fantasy world in which they must search for old ghosts is nothing compared to the other world where Jason lives. Here he is a "Ghost Hunter". ------------------------ Chris has been told about these kind of jobs before, but he didn't think he would be the one. It is strange as well how quickly his life will change. There is a series of incidents in his life that are happening right in front of his eyes. When he realizes that there are two ghosts that haunt him, and that one of them is the person who raised him. Chris must travel to the past to find the cause of this strange phenomenon. ___________________________________________________________________ So the story is simple. A young man (Jason) goes to look for his dead dad (Chris). Chris
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "In the first minute, the film tells us the story of a man who gets out of a bad relationship, ends up in a new one and takes his new love to a wedding.  In a strange reversal, the movie tries to tell a story of redemption but only succeeds in making us feel sorry for the person who is being saved."  - Jeff Vaudeman, film critic, The Wall Street Journal:  (This movie is very similar in style to some '80s TV commercials)  It doesn't take long for the new love interest of the lead to discover that she's the object of desire of the old lead: "I was only a child." I found this film pretty funny as most comedy is, until...  after the wedding.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad that it should be banned and censored.   They should add a "do not play if you have a heart condition, or if your heart condition is prone to irregular beatings, heart attack, or cardiac arrest".   The only thing good about the movie is the fact that it has a happy ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It seems to me that a new version of an old movie, one that I liked a lot.   I was pretty disappointed when I saw this one. The original version I remember very well. But this one doesn't quite hold up.    The movie has a lot of great stuff. The special effects, the humor, the dialogue, the story, all of it. But there's a big problem.  What I mean is...   The story has a few problems. It is almost painfully stupid.  It has a great story and the ending is pretty darned funny. But the whole plot takes up about a third of the movie.     So the movie could have been made a lot shorter if the whole thing had been cut.  I'm a huge fan of the first movie, but this one seems to drag the rest of the story out of the way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It didn't help that the production is awful.   The effects were laughable, the CGI is too cheap for comfort.  The acting is atrocious.  I can't believe I've read so much of the book, but to me this movie is almost as bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of this movie begins like a horror movie: a girl gets abducted and brutally tortured. When the girl arrives at a strange house, the man with a big mustache, wearing a fedora, walks with a huge stick towards the door where the girl is, and then starts to beat her for no reason. The girl dies in the house, but the man gets caught by the police later on. The movie finishes like a true horror movie.  The movie is set in a nice little town and this movie focuses mainly on the creepy town. The characters are also well done; most of the characters are good, but one particularly bad one, a drunk guy with glasses, is a bad joke. The most interesting character, the wife, is totally normal, and not a bit creepy. I enjoyed the movie, as it is not that great.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you ever get the chance to watch any of the "star trek" movies, do it right away, they are just that great and they bring so much emotion to your mind. The sound of the movie is great, the action is awesome, the characters are well put together, the science fiction is great and the music is also great, but the worst thing about it is the acting of the actors is poor at best, I would not have thought that the writers of this movies would have thought of an actor as great as Mr. William Shatner would be a bad idea to play a villain. I did not like the movie very much I was disappointed that I had wasted 2 hours of my life.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* THIS MOVIE IS SO MUCH LIKE A RAP OF THE WEEK. ********** This film is so obviously directed at a straight to the point teen comedy, and in the end, the whole movie comes down to the last two minutes and a final line. ********************** I can't believe I'm not raving about the badness of this film, but the badmouthing is very bad. I am so angry that I really feel like I'm going to lose my mind at this moment. ************ In all honesty, I can say that I've never seen an ending like this.  *********** I hope that people at the theaters are as pissed off as I am. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is crap. I can't say much more than that. The first thing I noticed was that we were in a church, and it was very sad. Then we were to a bar...that was not very good either. We then went to a house...no lights....no windows...no one home and very cold. I am not a fan of horror movies and this is not really a good one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________ I just saw this movie and it's so bad it's embarrassing! I would never want to ever see this movie, it's bad. _______________________________________________________________________________ I was amazed by this movie. It's a story about a girl, and a boy that gets into a big fight in a bar. She is going to be married, and gets into an altercation with the guy she is going, and then a friend of hers comes over to get the guy, then the friend falls down in the fight. Then another guy comes over, and they wrestle each other, and the girl manages to beat the guy up, and this is all played out on video. The whole thing is just a bunch of bad jokes thrown together. I guess it makes sense that these bad guys would all show up after the girl's wedding, and that a bunch would show up afterward to beat them up. _____________________________________________________ I can't give it more than 3 stars, the movie is very uninspired. If it weren't for the fact that this is in a crappy movie, I might even give it a 3.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this is a bad film, just a really bad one, I mean, I like to laugh, but I don't like anything in this movie. It has poor acting, bad voice acting, terrible special effects, and a pretty bad ending which makes it seem like a rip-off of another poor film, "The Man from Earth". The bad acting is because it was produced in the late 40's, so it didn't get the special effects it deserves. The acting is pretty bad, especially for some of the actors. I mean there are some bad actors in this film and all of them should know better. It's just bad acting, it's terrible, and I'm sure many people who like this film wouldn't even watch it. I had to turn it off after the last couple of minutes, and that was too much for me. I think this should get a bad rating for me, even though I think there are better horror movies out there, like "Screamers", "Shane's Party", "Dead Silence" or even "Fatal Attraction" (not as bad as this one). It just lacks any creativity or any good idea at all, it feels like a cheap exploitation film, with the same old same old characters with even worse acting. I wish I had never bothered to see this horrible film. It wasn't worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is actually worse than a bad Hollywood movie or even bad Bollywood movies. It just gives the most horrible "look" of a real person being killed in the movie. Even my mother did not like it very much. It is just as if the makers are making fun of Indian movie making as well as Indian culture and Indian culture is in fact NOT the best in the world. I had seen the Indian classic  My Name is Khan  (1975) and if it was any better it would be like a bad horror movie.  The film has all the typical elements of Bollywood like dancing, singing, a love story, bad language and bad scenes. If anything I found the director's direction to be poor. His choice of music for the film is just like the music music for "Chappie" and even the ending of the film has just such bad music that it seems to be like the sound track for a bad B-movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought the film was terrible and I was right. I could understand why its creator thought it was a good idea to make a comedy about a gay couple. It is just that no one in his right mind would want to do a comedy based on two guys who are always together - except maybe David Cross! The characters are as cliched as a gay film gets: Jack and Kevin. Jack is a self-important, oversexed, entitled loser whose life is ruined by a bad breakup. Kevin is a pathetic loser who is really quite pathetic - as are a few other things. The only interesting thing about the film is the performance of Christopher Mintz-Plasse as the pathetic loser. What he does is play the role like a complete fool - or a moronic idiot. The same goes for the rest of the cast. It's a joke, but it's a very boring one. I mean, the only thing funny about it is how lame the jokes are. I would like to see more from this guy.   The acting really isn't so bad. The two gay guys are fairly well done, although Chris Mintzplasse is rather overdone. He doesn't really act much like a real character: he's not even very funny. I guess this film would have been better served by having a male actor play the character instead of the female, unless it's because Kevin can't act. Otherwise, the rest is pretty typical comedy stuff.   to get back on topic: I don't think this film will appeal to a large audience. I don''t think its a terribly funny film, and it has some genuinely bad acting. But it has a really bad idea to be a comedy, it doesn''t have any original ideas or stories. It''s not funny, but what do you expect from a film where you''re supposed to sympathize with a gay person? The whole thing just feels like a bad idea that fell through the cracks.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm very very disappointed! The story was not at all what I expected, but when it starts to go there is no stopping it. I can't think of anyone else who would have done a story like that, that would go there! My biggest problem was with the acting, the only actor who I really liked was the female lead, but then she was the only one who really felt like a person. She had a few scenes in which she just really screamed her emotions, but they felt forced and rushed.   A movie needs a little romance, a little humor, and a decent amount of action, and this is definitely not it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not expecting anything special from this movie. It was ok. It didn't even try to be a great comedy. It felt forced.   If I didn't hate this movie, I would give it a 2/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~ I have seen this on a couple of occasions. First time on the big screen, and it is really well acted. Very good, well thought out story, with a good script. But the characters don't seem to know how to be likable, the movie becomes really over acted, and a little silly with the kids, and the kid and the mother (who does her best) are the worst two characters. I don't know if I should recommend this, but I sure hope it makes a comeback at the box office.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a little hesitant to say this, but I don't remember seeing an Australian film that I wasn't disappointed.   The lead is great.  He does what needs to be done in the film, which I like (I think this is what makes it an Aussie film).   They do a great job of showing us what life is like in a prison.  A prison that is overrun with convicts and murderers and all types of people.  They make a couple of mistakes in the script, but that's it.  I enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only saving grace for the film is that it has an extremely creepy and intriguing storyline. This film is not a well made film but a well written and executed film. The plot is simple but intriguing and the actors are all great. It has a unique look to it but it doesn't work for me.  My wife and I have both seen this movie many times and we both agree that this is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't listen to this bad movie and don't take the plot seriously. The movie starts as a boring and stupid "franchise" that seems to exist only to make money for the people running it. I didn't take it seriously until I watched the first trailer which has an actor who looks like a robot and speaks like one as well. So in short: this movie was made as a joke movie. And they really should have called it "Bizarre Movie: The Movie".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I'm a big fan of the book; but like any other person who has read the book, I felt I had to see the movie. I read the whole thing over, in a weekend, so I'm not sure what to think. It could have been worse. A story about a girl who, when she's a kid, is abducted by an evil scientist and her family, from her house and sent to this castle, is an excellent read and I'm glad to see more of this story."   It was just the same old story. The movie didn't add anything new to the story. I mean, I'm pretty sure you knew it already, but I guess we're not going to see "Kiss Me Deadly" when I return to Disney's animated fairy tales (I am not sure if I will watch the movie again, for some reason). As the old saying goes:  "There are some books that you know when you read them, but you have no idea when you think you've read them."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad bad movie.  I don't understand the reasoning behind casting this movie as a'sophomore film' since it's not a good movie. The story is bad and they try to make it worse with a bad villain and the story just becomes a poorly told story with bad acting and poor effects. The only thing good about the movie is the music which is a lot of fun but you will be bored to death after about 20 minutes of the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I haven't seen the original Star Wars, so I had no idea why Lucas had these creatures on the Death Star.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to see it because of its trailers, and I think I can say that it is an awful movie. It's a pretty good looking movie. Not a lot of jokes, though. It had some great characters, a couple of great themes, and some cool moments, but it wasn't funny enough to bring me in. There were also moments where I laughed to myself, which is a rare thing these days (though I like some good cheesy old movies like Bambi, King Kong, and Rocky).   The whole movie is just lame. It is not a bad film, but I just didn't like it and it made me feel worse about my taste.   It's not that I didn't expect more from this movie. I like the concept, and there were a couple great moments of drama in it. But the execution just wasn't up to the movie's good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So I've been trying to avoid this movie for the last few days, but finally I had to watch it.  When I heard the synopsis I thought the actors were going to be the first guys on the moon, but I was pretty much disappointed.   I don't think the science aspect is all that realistic.  Maybe it should be called "Space Trek without the fun".  This movie had a lot of jokes and that was about it. If you're a Trekkie, you may like it, if you aren't, you will be disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning, the movie gives you the feeling that it is about a couple (a mother and daughter) who are driving home after a bad date and are stopped by a police car. There's a scene when the police car is looking to turn around and go back to its regular way of doing things and its lights turn green. The scene is interrupted by the mother driving up with her daughter in the back seat, not in a car, just on foot. This girl is not a "walkabout" or anything like that, in fact, she seems to be having a really good time and not a moment does it feel that she's a girl whose life has been stolen. In fact, the whole scene just feels like the cops are giving this girl a big old "What the Hell?!" (like one would give a kid a big ol' smack on the head). I mean, these are two parents who have really made a terrible, bad mistake and they're being "taken to jail" for the rest of their lives. The parents are the type that wouldn't even try to stop a little girl from being sexually abused by a group of teenage boys, but they decide to try to take a stand on a minor incident involving this girl and a pair of local kids. I was really hoping that they would have done a better job of getting the two of them a bit of justice. Instead they just seem to make a big deal out of the whole thing which is not only an insult to the parents, but a big big disrespect to the little girl who was really nothing more than a pawn in this whole "family drama."  ...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Lets be honest I have not seen this movie for a few years now. As someone who was a huge fan of the original movie it's like a step backwards. There is a bunch of little scenes that make this movie seem like a children's movie. Not to mention that the music is really bad. It's like they're trying to do a musical version of a childrens movie. Also there is a guy in a big suit and a couple of guys dressed as cowboys, a woman who has a horse and some other stuff that looks like the old TV show, only even cuter! But the worst thing is that the movie is so poorly made! The special effects are not believable. A guy named Donnie wears a funny hat and he looks a little like the guy from the original but that's about it.

The film has a lot of cheesy, cheesy, cheese-like movie scenes-this is a shame because otherwise there are a lot things going on and a nice story which has many good moments-like the old "Sleeping Beauty" song, and the story that this movie tells is not that original and I can't see it becoming an interesting story for a long time.  I didn't mind seeing this movie as long as it had the singing princess and all her dancing magic but I'm sure a lot more people will be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a "horror" film. That's all I can say about it.  I can't help but feel sorry for this motherfucker.    What's the best part of this movie?   Why, The Monster is his own mother, who is a woman from the 1800's.    She is completely insane and she uses a chainsaw like a sword.  This movie was so terrible that when I first saw it I thought it was a real rip off from "Ghostface" on "Horrorcore".   I guess he is going to make a cameo in "Lethal Weapon 4"?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't care who says it's a bad film. It's not. It has a lot of good elements that makes you care about it and it has a couple of flaws, especially since I can't remember what happened before it ended.  What is going on in the background of the film is completely unexplained, the character development is also weak (especially the love story) and some of the plot development is ridiculous.  I gave the film 4 out of 5 stars because it's just so strange! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's funny, even when it gets repetitive, but it's a bad, boring action movie with only a few moments of real drama.  The most memorable aspect of the movie is the action, in which they shoot down airplanes with hand guns, and make them soar into the stratosphere.    As for plot, you could do worse than a plot so simple it makes little sense.  If the writer of the film had put more thought into the story they could have given us some tension and even a plot twist.  There are a few cool moments including the character's attempts at flight, and the last few moments in which a plane crashes into the ocean and a couple of characters (including the villain) make for a great underwater shot.  The only bad thing about this movie is that it goes on too long, even with such a dumb premise.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be completely fair and unbiased, there are two aspects I need to highlight: 1) The movie was made by a team of three: "Travis, Matt, and Jason", and they all did a terrible job together... The acting was great, but they're all not great actors, and there is a big difference between a talented actor/actress and a mediocre actor/acting team. The dialogues were also the same as the last movie: some annoying dialogue to make us feel sick, a very bad main villain who is so stupid and stupid that it doesn't make any sense, and of course the ending is also stupid: I cannot understand how anyone could think that a dumb ending is ok... 2) I don't know how to write a good review for a movie I think is very bad:  The bad guy is called "The Devil", and his name is very catchy. He has a great role that you could imagine in many movies: he takes someone to hell, and then there is another guy who shows up: the movie is called HELLBIRD... HELLBIRDS! The bad man is the guy who takes you to heaven, and his evil side is called the "Angels of Death". He is a very evil guy who is very hard to find, and you cannot figure out where he is going to attack! His evil is the biggest! The only other characters that I can remember from the movie are "The Man of Sin" and some of the girls. There is no action in this movie! Even the first 2 or 3 minutes of the movie, there is no fight scene, nothing! The action scenes are in the ending, in the last part of the film! There are few jokes in the movie: one or 2 are very funny, and some are funny, but some jokes are a little too much! All the dialogue is very stupid: some of it is not even understandable... It is also a movie made by the guys who made the bad movie "HUNT FOR DINOSAURS", but even they can not do a worse job in HELLBIRLD... I wish I would have stopped watching the movie after 2 or maybe 3 minutes, because I would then have gone to another movie. My rating: 2.0 out of 5.0 (A bad movie) I've been reading some of your reviews, but I'm going to just say a few things: 1 - I think that "The Inferno

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie but the director took the time to write a bad script and poor acting. I was supposed to like the movie but it was a boring script with a dull acting and no originality.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I have no idea why anyone would bother with a sequel to a bad and boring original." I am going to start off with how much I LOVED this movie so much it got me to buy and watch a new movie this year I really love movies like this but its hard to find good ones like this you see the same characters being played over and over and never get to develop any story lines it is so boring with no character development no story at all just more of the same but a very original looking movie I loved watching that movie it would make a great movie and movie to show the new ones to my kids I love the old ones because they are so original and fun to look at with the old style of movie which is why it is a little harder to find a good movie like this because it is not very good at all but I still love it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A couple who live in a rural environment are killed in a horrific car accident. The local Sheriff investigates and is very concerned with the situation. He and some of his officers, including Detective Baugh are sent out in search of answers. Baugh believes that the woman may have been involved and when he has no response from the girl, he decides to follow her to another house, this house he knows belonged to the man she was dating just a few weeks before the accident. When they arrive at that house the woman is gone and Detective Bough is found unconscious in his own car surrounded by dead bodies...I can't be any more precise than that, if you wanted to hear another good bad movie this was the one for you, but I don't feel that way. It is not bad, but it is not a great bad movie. The acting isn't bad either, just generic and the screenplay is a real piece of crap. If you want to see a good bad bad movie then the one that made me turn my computer off, don't watch this one, but if you enjoy good bad films then I guess it is okay. I rate it a 3.8.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In my book this is a real waste of time -   - The only good thing is that they left out the awful music! I can only hope this is just the first movie to go. The rest of this is terrible!   It has all the signs to become an instant classic, it has a great premise (a young man learns to fight for his father's amusement after being rescued from a group of thugs) and it has lots of fun with it... However the acting is very bad. The guy with the glasses is the worst. They do not even try to hide their accents (it is so bad they are actually embarrassed). There are not even any attempts at a believable voice (even though the director clearly intended for them to be funny).   This is the kind of movie that makes me feel bad about Hollywood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is mediocre at best. I didn't like this movie. It's like I'm talking about a film that made me feel like I was going to die of embarrassment. This movie is like something that was made by a teenager. It has no plot. It just sort of happens. And it's not as bad as I thought it was. There are a couple of good points: It has one of the best, and most memorable, performances of the year! I don't mean just by an actor, but the whole film! It is so good that it is almost painful to watch: If you don't like it, don't watch it! It might make you cry or something... Anyway, I was laughing a lot at the movie. I wish I could put a lower rating, but this is a comedy that makes you laugh so hard that you can't even function properly...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's nothing good about this movie. I'm not one to hate on movies with special effects (i like science fiction and the like), but this one was a big letdown. If this had been made in the 80's then I might've liked it more. It does have a pretty good villain, but he has zero characterization. He's just there as some generic thug who goes around and terrorizes his way around a big, bad city. He never gets the chance to show off his powers and then just leaves the city to his own devices. It's the movie's fault because the villains are pretty one-note and most of them make no sense at all. When his evil counterpart shows up, he's there because he wanted revenge on a police officer who was torturing people who had been accused of committing a crime he didn't commit. When the police officer starts interrogating the victim who was in fact not guilty, he starts to feel that the only way he can clear his name is to take him down. I thought the idea was cool, the execution a joke.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ It starts out OK enough. You are a teenager stuck at home. Your dad has just been kicked out of the house for his illegal behavior. You live with your mother who is not happy about the move. You see her smoking weed and smoking pot and you get up to help her out, so you get a job and get a ride to her house. The first time you go you see your mom lying on the bed, high as a kite, and then you do the only sensible thing: you get back to your mom and try to convince her to stop. She wouldn't budge. She kept smoking weed off of a joint, and it got to be pretty obvious to you. The problem is: __________________ After a couple days of trying, you try to tell your mom why you are not going to stay, and she yells at you, tells you to get out and don't come back, and tries to kick you out. _________________ You do not stop at your mom's house. You make a run for it, in spite of the fact that she just kicked you out, in her car. You do this because you are tired of living in the house with this crazy woman. You also run because you have a fear of abandonment. _______________ Eventually you get to your parents house and you realize your mother is not crazy at all. She is a woman who has had trouble with drugs, she is high as balls, and you don't want to stay with her anymore. ________________________________ ______________ After getting out of your parents room, you get into your parents car, and start speeding off.    The next thing you know you are back in the room, high again.  You are not sure why you did it. You have a hard time even walking the next few days, but you are a strong woman and make it back to the home with a little help from friends, but they are not there. ______________________________________________________________________________ You finally make it home. You knock on your moms door, and once again you see how low she is. The next few weeks are filled with her babbling incoherently while you have your sister by your side. ______________________________ After a month or so, she leaves you and runs off to her sister's home, where the family and children are all together and living nice and comfortably.      She comes back home a few days later, not even realizing what she
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (No. of) stars: 2 (No, of) characters: N/A (No) reason to watch this:  A bad horror movie.   But I did not find it so bad.  So bad, it may be even good.  As an old, boring guy who watches all the bad movies, I find this one to be a little entertaining. I think the director should get a Nobel prize for this movie: he uses a classic horror movie theme - the killer comes at night. There are a few different ways in which he comes, and it is up to the viewer to decide what the killer is.  This is the only horror movie (I know of) I can really name off.  But this one also makes me think about the movie I saw a few years ago: The Blair Witch Project. There is a small town, haunted by a girl who has become a girl.  The girl is found by a group of three people: they set out in search of the girl and a girl named Lila.  And they find a girl in the woods, who is also a victim of a witch.  In this story, the girl has become her own ghost and has to face the horrors of the woods in order to survive.  For me, this is one of the most disturbing, yet funny horror movies I've ever seen. It is a little scary, but with a nice end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I think that this is a terrible film. It is not funny at all and is a horrible and unsympathetic film.   This movie is about a boy who is kidnapped by a group of bad men, and then tortured.  The bad men were all evil, the father is an evil person, and the boy's mother is just an evil mother.  My son watched this on TV one day while I worked out in the house.  All I can say is that it is probably the worst movie I have ever seen.  I hope it stays in the movie rotation for years to come, I would hate to be on this movie's jury!"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story line is just bad.   It just feels like someone sat down and watched The Last Samurai, added a couple of samurai-types and a bunch of random characters, threw in a few gunfights in a Japanese forest and came up with a movie that is basically the film in which everyone fights with their hands over their head.  No matter what anyone does they are always shot or shot and left for dead. Even the most basic of hand to hand combat is reduced to a couple minutes of boring back and forth. What we get instead are pointless sword fights with characters that just show up at the beginning of a fight to take a few punches until they have to stop.  To top it all off we never really get anywhere.  The plot has no focus, no character, just an action movie, not even a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My wife and I were expecting another baby so we were extremely excited, but unfortunately the baby didn't live long!  It is very sad that the baby would not even live one more day, and it was hard to watch it all play out. I thought it would be a sad film with all the sad family moments. Not at all. It felt like the entire family had a great time.  My wife and the rest of the family got to really play around and they all got to be happy.  As a kid my brother and I never had the chance to play so we had a blast as adults.  The only issue I had was the ending was very rushed. That will be the only reason I wouldn't give this movie a higher rating! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably the worst movie I've seen in the theaters that I can think of.  I know there are worse movies that are out there but the movie really just gets no respect, if anything it was really a rip off of a film that was good and this movie just comes off like something they had made in the 80's and it just doesn't work.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was going to see this movie when it was first released. I got it because I wanted to see some great Hollywood films made in Germany. I've been waiting for decades to see a German-made movie in a British movie theater. This is not it. In fact, it is an insult to any Hollywood fan (and the Germans). You can see Hollywood stars, but they are completely inept. Most of the movie is set in the movie theater, which has no special effects whatsoever. The actors look like they are pretending. But the film's story is a mess: it starts off very well but quickly drags and makes no sense. The whole movie is nothing but a joke. You would like a "Grimm", but not this movie. A good German comedy. I'd recommend it to those who like German comedy and a laugh, but I don't think it has much appeal to those interested in German cinema.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been waiting for something to do with that one character since the movie was released, and this is his only role in the film. It's not very good, and it's certainly not original. This will just be a very oddball little movie. It is very bad as a movie that does nothing but have an audience laugh with the characters.  "You'll like the movie if you're an adult."   This was a remake of a film that was released in the late 1970's and never been used again. It does have some great special effects and effects, and has one of the most memorable villains I have seen on film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a typical "buddy cop" movie with a lot of funny one liners, such as "I'll put you into a trance with my words" (as a cop who can't find a hooker) or "I can make that happen all the time"  and "I'm gonna use you as my bait dog"   It also has quite a lot to do with the "I don't know" attitude among the boys, so, well, it doesn't really have a lot going for it    However it has a nice set piece and great music, not great music by the way, but it is more than enough.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I'm having a bad day. I get home to the apartment and see a box on my door. I'm excited to see it but don't know where it's from. I open it up and get no response from a box that's clearly not a box.   When I open the box, inside are two beautiful t-shirts and a cute hat.  I'm not exactly dressed right though. I put on the t-shirt and have the most awkward and uncomfortable laugh I have every once in a while. I take the hat off and it smells great.  (I'm sorry for taking the time to describe that)   I put the hat on and smile at the person I thought was my boyfriend but he can't seem to recognize me. He does get it though and we hug.  The next morning I see my friends and they tell me I got a good one.  I've had my eye on this guy for a few weeks.  At work I'm not really thinking about this guy. It's hard not to think about him on a daily basis though.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So this is one movie with a title that is all about bad boys who are bad for each other. What follows is the story of a group of friends who are high school seniors and are supposed to be getting married. There's a whole lot going on in a school, and none of these boys would ever be able to keep up with the girls in their classes in terms of school work. They are all in the same sports teams as well and do quite well as they all try to get the attention of a girl they fancy, the beautiful but somewhat arrogant and competitive Liza J. Jones, who is going into her last year at school. So far as they know she has already had two boyfriends already, and they even have been to her high school prom. Of course she has to go, and she is not going to be there by herself. Now there's a problem with that. While at the prom a bunch of other girls have already been to the same prom in the past, one of them happens to be the girl that the students all know and care about. So that girl is going to have to go for Liza herself, and with her being the only girl with any power to stop Liza from getting there first, who would want to go with her? That would be her big sister, Karen. And it would be Karen who will be the key player in Liza's eventual demise as she sets out to have a little fun with a couple of the other boys. It's only a matter of time before Liza is at the school to get revenge for Karen's teasing. She is going there to see the prom to find out what's going on between Karen and the other girls, and the whole idea of seeing Karen's prom is enough to make Liza want to get her revenge even more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm actually really enjoying the first movie, it has some good action, comedy, and even some great action/sci-fi set ups.  However the acting is atrocious and you'll be surprised when a female alien gets a blow job by a human (or at least a male human), the story doesn't work very well and I don't like how the female alien takes advantage of a man's desire to get a blowjob.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story of this movie was not very original or fresh. The movie was just boring in almost every way.   After seeing this movie I can only describe the story as 'boring.'   I would give the movie a 2 out of 10 instead of a 5 because if there was more time for story development then this movie could have been much better.  You have been warned... Just a little bit before the movie starts, we see a little girl who has an invisible friend. At the beginning of the story she was only able to see him while she was on the school bus. As she grows up she becomes friends with a little brother who is always in danger. His father tries to find the invisible friend in all sorts of ways; from hiding him in a barrel to setting him free. It gets to the point where the evil father has the little brother kidnapped and when the father realizes he could not get rid of the invisible boy fast enough, he decides to put him up for sale. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was hoping to see this movie for the first time since it was made.   Unfortunately that wasn't to be.  It wasn't an awful movie, but it wasn't a good movie either.  I could have been forgiven for expecting a little more from the original film.  The writing was very poor but that was the only thing wrong about it. The story itself was a bit dull.  If you are a fan of James Bond then you can't go wrong with a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm sorry you got suckered into this. It is an incredibly low budget movie, and so bad that it makes my stomach twist even a little. It's pretty clear to anyone who is remotely intelligent that this movie is a blatant rip-off of the 1989 horror flick The Evil Dead. The film opens in a cabin. The young daughter of two hunters takes her mother's hunting knife and opens a can of worms. A woman named Lucy (a little too much of a whore to be a mother but oh well) is in the woods with her boyfriend, and has apparently been bitten by a werewolf. I was surprised when I first saw this movie that it doesn't open with a monster bite, but then I realized the premise. The werewolf is an old lady who has been looking for a place to live. She gets a letter from an old friend, who has offered to take the family hunting in Canada for $500 a night. When they go, their new friend, Henry (played by a poor, under-scored Michael Jeter) starts hunting the family for sport, and Lucy becomes a prey. The ending of this story is so silly and contrived that I'm sure no one really cares what happens next.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself is just about a group of kids at a "sports camp", they all have different skills (in other words, everyone in this movie is an idiot), they all want to be like the popular athlete, and they all go over to see him, even a couple of the older kids (all about 6-7 years old) show up. Well, the sport of choice is wrestling, the wrestler being Billy Batts, a tall, short man. So, a giant "pit bull" named "Mountain" shows up, this is the only thing the kids are interested in until the end, when Billy Batters hits his opponent with a golf club, and that's when the kids notice that someone is holding a giant hammer. Well...that's when they all decide that they should stop the wrestler, but since this is a movie about sports, they have to use this knowledge to go to a school of athletics, but their plan is to try and use this to their advantage, and with the help of the school kids, they take over the athletics building, which the wrestling ring is still inside of, and use it to their own advantage. In all honesty, I wouldn't say the movie was bad, but I didn't really find anything worth watching it for, but that is a problem in all of the movies, it depends on how well it is made, and you can't expect to be entertained watching a bad action movie.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a movie that takes all the elements that were wrong with this series, and puts them together to form a film that is not bad at all. A few of the people in the film are annoying, but that's how the story is structured. I found myself wondering what was going to happen. At first I thought it would be some sort of parody of the movies like The Rocketeer. That's not the case. Instead they play to what they are doing, which is creating characters that could easily be real, only instead of flying and having the ability to see the future, they're just running around the countryside doing what they should be doing.   The film is set in the year 2042, which gives it a futuristic feel, though it is still set in a fictional country. I would think the story would be better if they used the real country of Australia, which should be a much better setting for a film. It is also really hard to follow the plot, which consists of a large cast of people doing nothing, only getting more and more annoying. I am not sure why they are there, the story seems to make little sense, at all, and the plot is actually only just about the main characters.  If you want to see a good sci-fi film, this is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a travesty of a movie. The production values for this movie were awful, as were the sets. The special effects were terrible. The acting was atrocious and the film was very dull. The script was terrible. A poor excuse for a "family" movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The problem:  I know it was just supposed to be the first episode, but it had a story like something out of the 90s, with a lot of cheesy dialogue and a bunch of "Hah! HAHAHA!" moments. If you haven't seen this movie, just think of it as another movie by Michael Bay. And yet, at the time, a "Bay" movie was a good movie that gave us a good action scene and a nice story, and it made me laugh a bit too. It wasn't bad though, it wasn't terrible and it wasn`t that bad.   It could have been much better, but I`m not sure what is the best way to do a movie in a year where Michael Bay is making a lot more movies.  This movie had an amazing opening, and a really good action sequence that left me quite happy, so there was a bit of a problem. But then there were just a lot if bad moments, and at least the story was well written.  It just felt like someone took a bunch old 80s action movies and mixed in Bay style. That wouldn`t be bad, but the problem is that those action scenes weren`t good. I mean, they could have done them in a much less ridiculous style, they just didn't really do them, and that really hurts it for me.  A real shame, because I know they had the budget to make a good film here, and they could still have made a good one. If they had just taken Bay style moments and thrown in a little bit of something else and had a really well written story, we could have seen a decent movie here.  The final fight scene had some great fight sequences, and I think it`s an awesome final battle in a battle.  The bad things: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First of all, I don't understand why this movie was made. A bad movie does not need to be funny. The jokes are funny because they are too absurd to be considered real, even for someone who hates the genre. The worst part of the movie is that all of the jokes are so stupid that the "funny" thing is completely ruined by the fact that the movie tries to pretend that these jokes are somehow profound. When I think of all of those funny moments, I get the idea that it would be a great idea to have a movie that is so badly made that it's funny, but then this movie doesn't happen. It seems that this movie didn't get a lot of support from the producers, even though I think it was a very interesting idea.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a bit annoying since it was the same thing with the same characters. It was just a slow, boring, boring movie. I wouldn't even recommend it to someone who isn't even good at the movies, but then again I don't feel like recommending it to others.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a horrible movie I guess you can say a sequel of the first movie about a group of vampires, one of them is a girl I assume but not much of who else. I did not feel that this was a very good sequel but there was a vampire but there were way to much blood and it was a bit messy. Overall not bad though, I would give this a 3 out of 5, if it was only for the blood.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie isn't bad, but it's too basic for a horror film. The writing is cliche, predictable and bad. The gore is overdone and over-the-top. It's just okay.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's hard to pick a winner here. There are some great shots, but there's almost nothing happening onscreen and it seems to drag on and on. It's not a bad film, but it was a bit much and overstayed it's welcome. The plot is a bit stupid as well. If you're interested in sci-fi, a space opera with a cast of eccentric characters and a badger's head, this is not a good film. The story does seem to have a good sense of humour and it's hard not to be drawn into the antics of our heroes. It would be very difficult to make a sci-f film like this now, and I wouldn't recommend this one to a child.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't really have the heart to write about this, but for those of you who've never seen it, here goes: I'd just watched the movie "A Boy And His Horse" and then "The Hobbit" again. "A boy and his horse" is a pretty good movie. It's an adaptation of a children's book (which was a great read in itself). It's a pretty sweet story. You don't need a detailed description to make you feel happy, the message is that people need time to grow. (A good lesson anyway, if you ask me.) "Horse" is the best horse I've ever seen in my life. He looks really cool too. I think they were looking for someone like this horse in the movie. What a cute little horse. I mean, how could a horse possibly be that cute? I know. Cute is a good word to describe them, but this horse is just... wow. It just really, really looks like it was drawn by an 8-year-old. When they cut off his nose, they made a "hole" for his brain to go in! The whole movie was just a very sweet movie. Then comes the "hairy" part. I'm not sure what they were thinking doing this part in the middle of a movie. I guess people were saying that the movie was a little creepy. I was actually a little bit creeped out. Then they show this "guy" that is supposed to be "hanging" from his horse's back, but he's too big. I wouldn't want to "hang" with this guy. I know this guy is supposed "to" be there (or I guess he's supposed to "be" there), but I think that's what "being" there is, right? I mean like, that's pretty much what it is. The "guy"... I don'st know what to call him. It looks like he was "made", right? How in the hell would a kid make a kid? And I have to admit, it looks really weird when the guy hangs off his back. I don' t know what I'd do, exactly. I really don't know. That's probably why this is a childrens movie, for adults to see it, and find out that it really isn't that bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is very similar to 'The Man with the Golden Gun' and is an adaptation of a short story 'Kwaidan in the Desert' that is an excellent story and I would strongly recommend it even though it's a 'bad' movie. There is a plot twist at the end and it's better than the original as well. I think the director has learned his lesson from the previous films and has made a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best movie I have ever seen.   This is a film about two people and the two things in which they share. These two people are the only things I will ever share with anyone. I have never met this woman. She is so nice. She loves to bake cakes, and she is quite the neat freak. She lives with her sister and she has never dated before this film. She's really cute, is a good cook, and has really good tastes. I can see why this lady is so popular. But in the movie it seems like she has no soul or soul of her own and only serves up the dishes, dishes she's made herself. The best thing about this film is that even though it is so cute, she is still a good girl. That's the best kind of girl.   to be continued.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "This is an incredible film, but it can't seem to get beyond just being an "awesome" picture of a little boy getting into trouble. The movie can be a pretty dark place as it portrays the family as a bunch of crazy people but there isn't a lot to talk about in the movie. The best part is that the whole movie is pretty much just a single camera close up. Nothing happens for long and yet there's some nice dialogue and interesting effects. Unfortunately, there's also a lot of "wtf" about the movie that makes it a bad one. It feels like the whole "awful" theme got a free pass to be written into any story and just kind of ran over the viewer. The film is a decent example of how not to direct an animation film. A well-designed, and very attractive environment is the only thing about this film that stands out as anything besides a bunch and random people running around some weird place. If the film was more animated like a feature that I was very tempted to actually watch, the story and the characters would have been much more engaging and interesting, but I found this an extremely unmemorable film in a very unmemorably funny movie.   The soundtrack was pretty good; it was definitely a strong feature, with some nice background music and sound effects. The animation was also pretty good, although, some of the characters do look a bit out of place. The voice acting was pretty decent; it seemed like each actor was trying to do a little bit of everything. A lot of it just didn't seem convincing enough. I do think they could have done the children a lot better, though. The kids could have been more animated. It's hard to tell since the film is so short.   the movie is over about 3 minutes after I've started watching it, so, if you're looking for a quick and humorous way to kill a couple of minutes off your day, and you really don't have any time left for anything else, this film is for you.   The only problems I really had with this movie are: 1. The plot is just a bunch or random people who meet, and then decide to do something or other. (It's almost like a comic book of sorts.) They do something, the next day, the person who actually did it gets caught for it, and this movie is a lot less entertaining than it is interesting. (Also, you have to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The title says it all. An average movie that could have been so much better. The plot is very simplistic and the acting is not worth anything. I don't mind a good action film but this film does not hold up to the title. There are plenty of action scenes but they are so poorly executed that it gives nothing to the story. The ending is so poorly written and it doesn't even make sense that two bad guys would get together and then get killed. Even after all the bad things they have done I am not convinced that the bad guy will be able to beat the hero in a sword fight. The film is so bad I will not watch it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When you've seen a lot of bad movies, you kind of grow tired of the same ones, especially when they start talking about "The Power of Nightmares." I would have been OK with that movie even if I had not seen any of the others (most of which were bad), but in this one, they are talking about a movie that's actually pretty good, but the director just doesn't really know how to use the effects he was given. In this movie, they used a lot more effects than in most of the other horror movies they made, but this time it didn't really pay off. I found it really funny in a bad way because it reminded me of all of those scary movie sequels that would make you think that the first movie might have been a bad one, only to end up being a good one. The ending was pretty corny, but I'm not really a horror movie diehard. I liked it though.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a very boring film. It had nothing going for it other than the fact that it was made in the late 30's. Not a good film at all. And it had a horrible plot.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very bad film that had its time.  I really wanted to like this movie and I wanted to enjoy it too.    However, the script is terrible.  This movie was a bad mess with a low budget that could have been improved in any way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it is worth mentioning that this is not a movie that has any real originality.  It is mostly the same old thing with a few changes here and there.   Even the best movies try to be different from each other, so I was not surprised to see that this was not really different from the last one.  "I don't think I was supposed to like that movie, so why did I buy it?"  I was really hoping to find something different in this movie.  The story of a woman named Linda who gets to meet an alien named Yee-Haw and ends up dating him for awhile is pretty interesting.  He is a little bit crazy but pretty loving.  Unfortunately the story is not what it's cracked up to be.  Yee Haw is all about sex and that seems to be the movie's most popular point.  I did not mind this at all, but it is not something I would really recommend.  You might like this if you are bored and have a movie to watch with a friend.  My only comment about this movie is that if a guy is into blowjobs he better find a movie way way back when that's what a man's job is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lame little "fantasy" movie from the late 50s with a bad cast (the same four actors from " The Moustache " and the same "pony" singer).  And no, there isn't a single ounce of humor.  I remember this one as I watched it in the 70s on TV and when I heard this movie was being revived by the "Cinemax" crew I couldn't resist giving it a go!  Well, I am glad I did. ______________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The opening to the movie has a lot of potential, with a strong protagonist, and a strong lead male and female. The only real problem with this is the acting. There's not a lot there, and most of it is kind of cringe-worthy. The one that really stands out is the guy in the black leather jacket. But the guy is in black leather, so the fact that he talks in a monotone, and talks over a lot while talking about the future, is not too bad. It's almost like someone is acting their way through a monologue. What's really annoying about this is that the movie doesn't work like it should if the character is supposed to be serious. The guy seems to have his tongue in his cheek, and not actually understand what he is saying. He may have been saying something serious that he meant to say, but it comes out weirdly. He's not really a good actor, and it's frustrating to watch him. He also does a lot more of the talking when the girl is around, which seems unnecessary.   But there's so much potential in this movie, but the movie is wasted on a bunch of stupid jokes and acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ I saw this movie twice. The first time on a Saturday night in February 2013. There were no shows in town and I had to sit through the entire 3 hour long show in a local park in a dreary day time. There was a little kid who played bass that sang a few songs and the rest of the time was spent talking about how much money he was making on the TV show and how he was the "King of the hill". A lot of the song and dance from the opening credits were actually taken from one of the music videos the show did and some of the songs were sung by a woman who sang all the songs. There wasn't even a good song in the whole show but the show was full of the worst of all time which is saying a lot. There are some very strange things about this film. 1) The main male character in the show has no name. He doesn't say much and his lines seem random in their delivery. There's also a girl who doesn't talk. 2) A lot more action than you would expect. The whole film is basically a car chase scene where a cop car is constantly getting chased down by a motorcyclist. 3) The girl on the show had the worst voice I ever heard. 4) The show itself was almost like a video game, the kid would make up songs, act goofy and dance to them and then they would play them over the radio. 5) I hated the guy who played the bass. It would be like if I went to watch a movie that made fun of the bass player but I'm not going to do that, I'm going to watch the movie. It doesn't even look like a movie, the characters were just there, and you didn't know exactly what they were doing. _____________________________________________________________________________________ So what did I think? This was basically an extended "American Idol" with a few added songs and an odd voice. It wasn't awful but it wasn't good either and it took all of three hours to do a car race and a little boy singing to songs and then playing them over a radio that would play one of a handful of songs that were in the movie itself. I have seen worse movies, but I don't think that was even a movie movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's the only action movie in the entire franchise. That is a shame...The characters are all bad, the special effects are poor, the story is stupid, the acting is bad, it's like a poorly made Star Trek: The Motion Picture, that I haven't seen, only because it was made in the 60s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the end, the entire movie was just a bunch of generic, dull and boring bad movie. If there were no plot, the movie could not have been much worse. The whole thing was just one big boring action sequence of a group of guys who are out to get some bad people. They are led by a guy named Johnny who is the leader of the group and a very arrogant jerk. Johnny's wife is a very strong and powerful character in the movie but the way Johnny treats and treats the rest of the characters, in particular his wife, is very uncaring and cold. The other characters are also very bland and stereotypical, including a woman from Indiana who has a very good attitude but is also very dull and predictable. The only other characters who are really memorable are a young cowboy named Johnny and his girlfriend, a black woman named Angelina and her husband John who both are very good in the way they treat the other characters, but not much else to say. It is a good story but the characters in this movie are just not that interesting to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know I should know better. But I couldn't stop watching that movie after seeing the trailer. Then, I saw it again and I was sure that this will be a great film. But all of a sudden it's just a terrible movie. The best way to describe it is: "I want to eat popcorn and see a great movie." It was so bad in my opinion it was amazing. I found it very funny! The movie is about a guy named Peter (Iwan Rheon) who meets his girlfriend (Bridget Moynahan) for the first time. She's not the typical girl that Peter would meet. She is sooo good in bed that you just want to have sex with her, but you never get that chance. When Peter goes home, he says his best friend (James McAvoy) wants to show him some new cars and Peter just can't resist. On the way home he meets a girl called Tessa (Kristen Connolly) who is very nice and sexy. They are on a picnic with a bunch of kids when something goes wrong with the car and Peter's car crashes into a tree, killing his car. Then Peter meets a little girl named Emma who says her family just died and they buried her in a small cemetery, but she wants to find her mother and so Peter agrees to help her. The movie starts out like a great car crash movie with a very cute little girl as the victim, but after this movie, the movie changes dramatically. This movie is just sooo bad. This story is not the usual movie, not just a car crash, not even a bad car accident movie. It's more like a movie about a broken heart and a broken man trying to get her back. If you are going to watch this movie be prepared to laugh your a** off and get very frustrated with the poor acting by everyone. I was just so amazed when I was watching this film. It really made me sad that there are people who want to see a good car accident story about a girl who gets killed and has to bury her in an open field and that's the main plot of a movie. If someone can make this movie I'd be very happy! And I'm sure someone can. I just hope the movie gets better because, honestly, this movie is stupid.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've heard the argument that this is the worst of the Disney animated films ever made, but I find nothing bad about this movie.  A very sweet and happy story about a family of animals coming to live in the manor of the villainous lord, Count Olaf.  It's a perfect animated presentation and I'm very glad I found this one.  I loved it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you have been reading my reviews for a while you will know by now that when I try anything I am prepared with a "backup plan". I never expected that this film would actually be any good. To start with, the production values are terrible. The acting is bad. Most of the times you will catch the actor trying to act like he is some kind of a superhero, but in the end he looks like a man who's trying to be a superhero but not doing a good enough job of it. The rest of the characters are also just bad. The only one I found to be likable (Bridget Jones) is forced to act really stupid. The other characters are just awful. It would not be good if it was not for the amazing and over the top music. There is no way that I could not listen to the soundtrack when I need to drown out all my other thoughts. I would recommend this to people who want to see the worst and you can't help but laugh out loud at what you see!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not great, but it was fun to watch for the first couple of seconds, and then it goes downhill.  The plot takes the place of a traditional vampire movie.    As the title implies, the title character is a vampire hunter.     There's a bit of mystery about what he really is and how he came to be a vampire.        In a nutshell, he's a very good guy who has lost his family, and so he's out to do something about it.    He's not exactly a saint, but he does have his own demons, such as the desire to have sex with young women (the vampires in the film, of which there are two, have an unnatural urge to do this).   He does seem to be doing what he thinks is right, so he is a little confused about why the town is so against him.   The story takes a turn about halfway through the movie.    The bad guys have the town hall under siege.  While everyone knows the "bad guys" are there, they have no idea who they are, and most of the townspeople just stand around and do nothing.  At this point, the town leaders start getting more and more annoyed with Vampyr's presence in town.  There are some hints that he's being set up (something that, when you think about it, is a pretty good plot for a horror movie), but I don't really care about all of this.  I enjoyed the bad guy, but the town was pretty annoying, too.  The main character is played by John Cusack, who did a bunch of stuff in that film, including a couple of big scenes where he played a vampire in a shower in a very silly outfit.  For a movie where Vampyrs is supposed to be the story of a man who is trying to do right by his family (and a pretty standard story), it's really annoying.   Overall I give Vampyrom a 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful! Why would they give this a R rating instead of an M rating? Because this film has nothing whatsoever to do with either horror or comedy or any sort of comedy. Instead we are treated to an assortment of creepy creatures that look like aliens and have no other purpose than to get into people's homes and scare the crap out of the homeowners.  A few minutes into this film and I have already heard of one family whose house was supposedly haunted.  The acting is horrible and the acting alone will turn your stomach. The music is not funny and doesn't make the whole film any better.  It is just boring bad.   It's really no surprise then that the film is also pretty much bad. It looks, sounds, and feels like the worst film I have ever seen.  And while I think that it is a very poor film, one thing that I can't stand about it is the fact that it actually ended up being very entertaining. I think if they had given this a C, a D, or an F, I think it would have been a total bust!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's about a guy on a mission...and it's not his fault.   (view spoiler). I know, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I have watched this film more times than I can count. It's a really bad idea.  If you like bad movies you will probably like this one.  You have to be really drunk to understand how bad this movie is. It feels like the writers were in a really dark mood.  It is also pretty bad in general. This film was a long time coming. I feel like this film was written in a night of horrible ideas.  This is one of those movies that should have been made at the beginning of a long dark time with little light.  A lot of the scenes don't even work in the context of the story.  I really wanted to like this movie.  There is something really creepy about the writing. There are a lot of disturbing lines. The acting isn't very good.  The actors are playing the part of a person who is very drunk.  Overall, the movie is bad but not too bad. It is the worst kind of bad. This is a horrible, horrible film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an interesting story told with a heavy emphasis on the military. There's quite a few people on screen at any given moment, though they all look like a bunch of people that are trying to look intimidating. The film tries to tell the story of a group of soldiers who try to find a lost soldier. One is shot with a silenced bullet. He is discovered by two other soldiers, though only the first can identify him. There is a strange girl who also turns out to be the lost soldier, as she has the same scar as the dead soldier. She is being used for scientific reasons to look for clues, and even though she is not very impressive she does a pretty good job. Her real purpose is that she is a mind reader and is told about the location and what will happen next. While this is not original, it is effective at using a soldier with a mind reading ability to tell what will go down next. It is all done in a fairly realistic way that works well. The soldiers do make some pretty weird choices at times, and one really seems to be in trouble with a soldier from a different company. Even though the plot works, there are some other problems, as the people on the camera have no voices except for the voice of the narrator, who often seems to talk through one or both of the actors. The narration could have used a little more emphasis on one or more characters, especially the narrator. That is a rather unusual thing to do for a feature film, however I really think it works better for this film than anything it has done so far. As a whole this film does a fair job at being a feature, even if it doesn't always make the most of its cast.  One thing it does well:   Score:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like watching a bad old western.  The "bad guy" seems to be a decent man.   He is an old timer who grew up in the Wild West, and now wants to go back and do what he can do.  He wants to restore the town where the "bad guys" from earlier times had their first big victory.    It's like a Western version of "The Wizard of Oz" except the "evil" one (B.H.) only uses magic to steal from the farmers.   The villagers have become pretty decent, and the old lady has become a bit more of a saint.  There is a good old man in the family who also knows how to hunt.  This is a "good" old western movie, and it is not a bad one either.  For a movie like this, I didn't expect anything to really come from it, but it really was a good way to spend my Saturday afternoon.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- *Bitch Slap, Slap * I've always loved the movie "Bitch, Slapping", it's a really bad movie but a lot of people say it's really good, I didn't like it but I liked how the movie could go really bad and you could just laugh at it. *The movie starts off with a man named Mike and his girlfriend, Sheena who are about to move in with her boyfriend and his friends. Mike is a jerk who just wants to start his own gang and take some money from them. So he goes to work, gets his "gang" ready, and then goes to the house to talk about the deal, Mike then starts to tell his story and he's really a horrible story, but it gets even worse, he shows his friends his new tattoo and gets an idea for a tattoo, and that's when he gets the idea of him starting his gang. That's when his gang goes out and start to hit on some other people and Mike is the first one to get hit, and he can't stop it. So that's the rest of the movie, it ends with Mike coming to the cops with his gang, and they're so drunk that they can't speak up.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is a great example of the early 80's 'low-budget' horror cinema. This flick was pretty good, even if it was just a 'feature-length' (which was more or less pointless for a horror film) that was just so bad in every conceivable way that it wasn't even funny. It's so bad I actually find myself laughing hysterically at it during the credits, but it was so much worse than that.  This is a very bad film, but also very, very weird.  I don't know exactly what to say about this movie: everything about it is a complete waste of time.  The movie tries to be scary but it's so much bad CGI that it just looks so ugly and it can't even look like a scary movie.    The plot is also quite pointless, as it tries to cover all kinds of different things and there's not a single good idea in it.  It really doesn't even have a plot or anything.  What it does have is a bunch of random characters and an overall strange plot that only exists to throw you off while you don't even know who you're supposed to be watching and why they're talking to you in the first place.  They just have the best way of doing it:  they just say one sentence about something they know nothing about but can talk about it like it's some sort of serious situation to you.  This is why I hate this movie. I'm giving this movie a 1 out of 10, the rest just need to suck.  I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The second half of the story is a complete waste of time. The story is all about a crazy woman who gets possessed by the spirit of the devil, and as such becomes insane. She is also apparently possessed by something called "the demon's heart" which apparently is an evil force.   That sounds like fun. And yet, it's actually not. And for the record, the demon's body is actually just an extremely over-sized head. I guess it could be thought-provoking if it were just someone over-size and crazed, but that does not happen. At all. And that's not even the bad part. The whole sequence is really kind of boring.  I can't recall if it ever got remotely funny or not (I guess it was sort of like the old Beetlejuice movie?), and at the end it seems to conclude with the lady taking her head and running away because she doesn't want to take responsibility for what she's done.  So it would appear that the Devil has taken a new host, the devil-woman.  It's just as crazy as the first! I'd take a few laughs out of it, but to be honest, I couldn't care less.  I'm probably just wasting my time here, but there's nothing wrong with it.   I really can't see myself giving this a shot, but if you don't have much else to do in this world, then maybe you should give this one a go.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The whole movie is about the fact that every year when she was a teenager (early 20s, around 15-16), the girl went to a little school in the middle of the woods where a bunch of weirdo kids live. The girls and boys who lived there looked pretty normal, except for the fact the oldest girl in the school, Marge, was a bit crazy. She told them she lived in the forest and would eat anything left over from other people's cooking. Of course they all ate a lot of food left over by other people and one day, she went crazy and started eating all the stuff. They tried to put her in a box but the monster kept getting out of the box and started destroying the woods and killing the little children. Well, they finally killed the monster, they burned the forest, and everyone was happy again. Well Marge got mad, so she started to kill all the other kids that were living there. But a boy came and killed Marge because he heard her scream. He went to the teacher and said, "Marge has killed the other children" And the teacher said, "'What's this kid doing in the woods? What is the problem? She has been dead for hours, and I've been trying to find her."   Now, you might say, "It doesn't make sense that a monster would start attacking children, but maybe it is a metaphor for human nature". Well, as I said, the movie starts with Marge talking to her sister about a dead girl whose body was found and who they are supposed to bury. When Marge went to bury her sister, they found an old picture frame that was in the girl's room. The picture has her naked on a bed with a cat on top. Now, a little boy who grew up in that same house was watching over the girl and was crying and mumbling about being sad because the girl was gone. Marge is so disturbed by the crying boy that she went up to the house with her gun. And as you can probably imagine, this is where the movie gets really messed up.   If you think about it, all the people in that house who were dead were all kids. The guy who was always crying was a little child. The cat was a kid. The dog was a boy. And the dog ate the cat. It just goes to show you that even the kids in that little town were kind of screwed up
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an ok, unspectacular movie. It might be boring for the first 10 mins, when the main guy is talking in his car to a girl who is getting annoyed by him... I was not surprised that the movie is a romantic comedy - I had a feeling the girl would be a pretty girl, and it wouldn't be out of place in a cheesy romantic movie, with a guy and a girl talking about their problems. But, after that, it gets dull, and only is there is the main character and the chick. The chick does not even stand out, she has nothing special about her. This is not a bad film... just not really enjoyable at all.

The story is set in 1851 where it was possible to live to be over 100 years old. In this movie you will meet several characters but this movie could only be a comedy. The plot of the story is a bunch of crazy things happening to people and the film shows all of that.   I am sorry but I just did not enjoy this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a train wreck! I've been trying to get to know the characters (especially S.E.B.E., and the one who does his homework) and their motivations. In the end I can only say, "Why do they care?" There were some really great gags in there. The kid who is supposed to be a big man could have a fit on his bike, then get on a bike, get off, get back on the bike, and be too busy to care, or get in a wreck (which is what happens). Or he goes to a funeral and the casket falls. Or he's a fireman, and the fire gets him (and in my mind I think we're talking about a kid riding around a burning building trying to put out a fire, and he's trying to run down some bad guys). And they say the guys are trying to steal a baby, and then they all pull back when they realize he isn't the baby's father. I don't buy it. I think they are all thieves.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a pretty bad movie with a bad acting, but if you watch for a laugh, it has some laughs in it. If you're going to watch this, you'll probably never laugh again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you enjoyed this movie, please be advised that it's not quite finished yet. It should have ended with a 'Happy End' like the title promises, a nice little twist, not so good and not so bad. There are so many plot twists and a huge cast that there is not enough time for a plot that is barely there.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, it is all fun and games up till the end when there's a big twist coming. The last scene is very disappointing as there are some pretty horrible scenes that I had to stop myself watching, that is if I was willing to continue with this movie. I would have rather found a different route to the ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a pretty fun movie. I am not really a big action movie fan but I found the movie more than entertaining. The fight scenes are very good and the film has a cool theme of what happens when people try to bring down the world in order to live in a perfect world. The film has plenty of cool sequences that leave you thinking. The final battle scene is a good example of this.  I liked it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When "Boys" (1989) was first seen, it was quite clear that the movie was going to be a great one. This was evidenced by its rating of 86% and it's high praise from movie critics such as Roger Ebert.  The movie takes place in the 1950s and the story follows the lives of three boys who are playing at being teenagers. They are a bunch of kids who have never grown up but still enjoy high-energy pursuits like football. They meet one girl named Linda (Cindy Williams) who is looking for a date with one of the boys. When Linda meets the boys it quickly becomes clear that they are more than just boys. The boys go out to a party and make a mistake that lands them in the hospital. The story then moves to a high school where a teacher is on the warpath to make sure that her students get straight A's and get to keep in touch with the old crowd. The teacher, Mr. Hays (Robert Blake), is a racist who is the only person in school who still believes that black people are inferior and who has a tendency to make sexist remarks. .  (The movie was not well received by critics and received a paltry 75% approval rating.)   The story is set in the context of the 1950's. The movie is not just a tale about young people who are having fun in high school but also focuses on the struggle between the boys and the girl. There is a lot of yelling and profanity in the movie and it does not help matters that the dialog is written in the first person. When the movie is over it is not particularly enjoyable and the plot does not advance much. The acting is poor, the comedy is mostly dated and the dialogue is very clunky. The only thing that really holds the movie together is its amazing soundtrack which is performed by James Brown, the original James Brown and others.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just about a family going into a new city to visit a old friend. All is normal until the day that the family have to move into a large and strange house. The house has a lot of weird stuff going on, for instance there are pictures of cats and a little girl (there is a young boy but he's in the kitchen) on the wall. There is also a little boy, his name is Joe (played by Paul Sorvino) who appears to be around 11 years old and has a strange habit of playing on the piano and singing. The family are quite shocked at first when their new home is invaded by the bizarre guests, but soon are taken over by a strange "giggling child" who wants to go to school. One interesting aspect is that it is never explained how the children got into the house and what their parents thought about their home being invaded by such strange visitors.   Overall, it is a poor movie, but there are some good ones out there.   for some reason, Paul Sorvy's character is based on a character in one of my favorite novels (the novel is called A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night by Haruki Murakami and is in fact published in the English translation as My Name is Joe and is available in the U.K. as a paperback, but it is quite long - about 800 pages). It's quite possible that this was the basis for Paul Sorva's character, although he looks different, is even younger, has a white mustache and a full beard and is of much better looks. It's almost as if the writers took the book, wrote a lot about the boy and made up his character as a parody, although the resemblance is there.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is boring, not to mention lame.   The main character (who has no name but I call him 'Joe' since it's the name of a comic character who is one of the original cast members) is not that important, at least to me.  In fact, I don't really feel like he is that important.  Joe does have some interesting stuff in the movie, most notably, the guy who gets in trouble with the cops and tells them he's a cop but really he's just a homeless person that gets himself killed trying to run over a guy with a car.  The guy's wife is played by someone named Mary.  Her name is Mary.   That was the name on the card Joe was given the night he's shot by the police.  I had always thought of Joe as being that way, but she's probably not.  She's probably just someone who had some money she wasn't going to spend but decided to use to help her husband get over his loss of his girlfriend.  Mary's only funny thing is that she's always dressed like she's about to rip your throat out while giving you a hug, so that's all she can muster up.  This woman isn't worth her weight in gold!   And the movie never gets around to giving a good character arc to Joe.  They make him out to be a great guy who can do anything, but that really isn't the case.  It's a waste of time.  Even with a really weak script by a guy whose name is Mike Hirsch who wrote two other cheap movies and two crappy independent films.  A decent script could have made this movie worthwhile.  And even with the bad script, this movie could have been pretty good with a good script (which the poor Mike Henniscall never bothered to write).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A long time ago my dad introduced me to this movie. It was a huge mistake.  There was a young lady in this movie and she looked absolutely adorable.   She was a good age (19) and there were a million reasons to take this chick. She was funny and had this really cute little voice.  As you can imagine from watching the movie, she had to be the "hot" girl.  The sex was so over the top it was ridiculous. She also had to have a really big dick.  Not the kind of dick you can see with the naked eye but if you saw the whole scene (not that there was much to see) you could imagine a giant black cock jacked off her face.   So if you like the big black cock in front of you, you are in for a treat.  This was a complete waste of a movie.  I think I might have seen a better movie by this director.   If you have never seen this movie, you really should. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is really good.  However it is also a bit annoying to watch.   And if a little annoying is a little bit of entertainment don't you think so?   I can see the director wanting to create an anti-war movie but the movie really lacks in it's themes.  The movie is filled with the usual political rhetoric which is not at all surprising to find in a movie like this.  It's an odd decision to put on a political film at a time when the world is in chaos.  But a movie is a movie and it should be funny and not preachy.  To be fair the film does have a few very good moments such as the first shot with the camera and the film starts off with a very catchy song and there are a few good jokes.  And while you can tell that there is a lot of trying to get an anti war message in here this really isn't the movie to get that message across to.  There is not a huge amount of emotion in this movie but it is at least not an empty one.  It can be said that the film has a lot in common with the "Oscar winning" "Oceans 11" which I think is the best Ocean-related film I have seen.  If you liked Ocean 11 and have seen any number of the later movies then you will like this one.    And while that may seem like a negative to some it is not.  I think the movie is funny and it is more than a little entertaining but it can be a lot worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* This is a bad, horrible, very low quality movie. The story is interesting to see a story that could be the beginning of a new series. There are characters that are just bad, bad to the very bone. I have seen some of their episodes and they are terrible, bad, BAD! The actors are horrible and the music is very poor. There is no plot to keep you interested in watching the movie and I believe this would be a very poor movie to watch, but it is a fun watch, and if you have one of the little ones in your house it is just what a bad film should be.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a complete waste of time. It's pretty much an excuse to have a stupid looking alien who has the personality of a child. It wasn't that bad but he looks like a kid, he speaks like a toddler and it just all looks like the most stupid looking creature ever. I would have been happy if it was a different film since I'm not a fan of the Aliens. It was just a waste of money and time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am not even sure if a movie is bad, but when I first saw this movie I didn't really want to go to see it. I read the review and it was all about this big bad guy who was in the movie and the rest of it wasn't even about him at all. In the first scene of the movie when they find the guy that was in that movie who is dead in the basement the movie just kind of shows what happens to the guy's girlfriend and a bunch of guys who are just hanging out. Now before I go on I just have to say that I agree with what the guy who wrote the review says about the movie is very good and I don't really see why everyone hates it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is as cheesy as it gets.   It is very hard to understand what the movie is about since the subtitles were in Russian for a while.  This movie has some nice special effects and some cool music from John Barrymore, but the story is pretty cliché.  I watched this movie on my iPod and it looked great until a half way through the movie when the Russian language was switched to English.  The next half hour of the movie had a bunch of Russian names written everywhere.  It's very sad that this movie is only available on the Internet and I have been looking for it for quite a while and only found a couple of clips on Youtube.  The Russian language is very bad and a nightmare to translate.    One scene in the movie which was supposed to be a funny is actually very mean spirited.  If it were in English it would be hilarious and interesting to see how the translator would have to translate the dialog. There is also a great song on the soundtrack.  So why are all these Russian names on the screen so often. I don't think the movie would have got as much attention if there weren't that many.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As far as bad films go, this one has some merit. I would recommend it if you're looking for something funny, but don't expect anything more. The first half isn't too bad, but it gets a little boring and repetitive after a while. The ending is kind of funny, if only for how it completely disregards the rest of the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a great idea for a film. The story of a man who had a very bad day and wants to escape by stealing a giant robot for his girlfriend's birthday. I loved the idea of this one.  There was no CGI in this movie, it was a very true story. I was pretty excited when my daughter asked me to give her a copy of this movie.  The first thing I noticed is how good this movie looks.   The special effects in this one are amazing.  As if they took all of the best ideas from Aliens and Terminator 2, and mixed it up in a nice manner. It looks very slick.  The animation is nice.  It is a really nice blend between 2 different styles of animation.  At one point you will find out how the main character stole the giant robot and when the story switches to his girlfriend it looks like some kind of cartoon movie.   This movie is great for a good laugh.  To tell you a true story, my friend in high school got really drunk one night and decided to walk from his home to a nearby park, as the story goes this area was really creepy at night. The park is surrounded by tall cliffs, it's dark so there is not much light in the area. I thought this was a pretty funny idea.  I was just about to tell him to return the giant mech to his home when he was chased by the robot into a dark cave where some monster lived.  He was scared.  So I took the picture I took and showed it to my friend who had only known my high school friends, and he thought it was great.  My friend and his friend wanted me to show them this movie as well.  One of the friends said "It is so good I will go and watch it with you."  I told them I would see how it played out with my parents.  After watching this movie with them I was very impressed with how good the movie looked.  This movie makes my life seem much less interesting and I have so many things to say about the movie. It is really bad!   This is a movie that is hard to watch.  There is no plot.  Nothing that happened happened.  Even though the robot was big, it still turned into a small boy in the end.  And the ending of the movie really disappointed me.  Well I guess I should just say it was another boring story and a terrible final
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For such a young actor as Gage the man should have had a far more mature and professional look to his face.  The young man was the "drama child" of the film and in a film full of teenagers his face looks like he was put there by the animators.  "Don't be too proud of it. " The other child actors are a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a very bad movie and its an all-around bad film. It's not a bad film to watch. I enjoyed myself for the most part but the story is so dumb that I didn't feel any emotion from the characters. I didn�t understand anything about the plot. I don't think it was funny at all. It was just a boring movie. I think the producer was trying to cash in on the craze with his own version of a "Darth Vader� movie. But in my opinion, that isn't all he is and he couldn't find a better actor to play Darth Vader. It is a film that shouldn't have been made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I can't recommend this film to any audience, because the story doesn't get any better."  This is actually the first film I have seen in the series where the director actually takes the audience in to the story from the first few moments, not as a flashback like most people probably do.  It has a very "lost in space" feel and feels like a real film no matter how weird it looks.  There are many people in space (with some in the original movie) and they are fighting over food.  The thing I like the most about this is its really bizarre but funny at the same time.    And it's just too bad that there wasn't more. This film made a lot of people really mad and that's because it does have some questionable scenes but I think it's actually really interesting and fun to watch, if not for the weirdness. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason I watched this movie was for the "Crazy Legs" part. If there was not a "Curious George" cartoon to distract me, I never would have gone to see this. A good story about a guy who was trying to get back the money he lost due to a scam of someone on the beach. I wish the director would of thought of a name other than "Crazys" to use for this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You know, I saw "Aliens" on opening day to find myself disappointed. The story line was so bland and the acting was so bad I was not surprised when the alien turned out to be a girl. Well, the female one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an obvious, blatant rip-off of The Thing, with the same general plot and story line. The movie is about a man who is on the verge of suicide and needs to be saved by two humans: a human-cyborg hybrid and an alien. However, when the alien and his hybrid get sucked into a black hole, the man has to go back in time to the 1960s to bring the hybrid back to life. The only problem is that there is no time machine! This is where the story falls apart a bit. There is so much to do in the 1960's, and there is so little screen time for the other characters. As with other science fiction movies like The Thing, Aliens, Spaceballs or Robocop, a great deal of the movie can be devoted to a character who is only mentioned in passing at various points in the movie. There really was nothing about the guy to make me interested.  A very bad film that I can only recommend to anyone who has a short attention span.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hate to say this, but I was just disappointed that the ending of this film was so rushed. I really wanted the movie to go on and not be over in a minute or two. There's a scene where the man is trying to find an old woman to have a baby with him. And the whole time they are just talking about how they are still together and not having sex. But the man goes to the woman's house and tells her he is going to break it off. And she says to him, "I'm sorry, I just can't live with you." And the man says to her, "You're so much older than I am. But I guess that's just how things are, right? Anyway, I hate to tell you this, it looks like I may have a real baby with you tonight. I hope it'll be a boy. I don't want you to take my old man's place, that would be too humiliating." And this is the last scene. And then they go to his house and he says, "Now then, I'd like you to leave the door open for me while I take a shower. And I'm going to do a little dressing up with my old lady." Well, he puts on a tuxedo and she wears a short dress and a wig, and gets in the shower, and after the shower they just hang out. This whole movie is like this. It's so rushed, and the ending is just so terrible. The story really is nothing but nothing but bullshit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie in a mall in Texas.  The place was crowded.    It was probably the worst movie I have ever seen.  They filmed the movie on a green screen.  The movie was shot with a green tint.  These kids did not look like real teenagers.  I don't know what made me do this.  After all these kids had to sit on the ground.  It really bothered me.  This movie was a waste of my time.  Do not waste your money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you don't want a movie about people who think they are superheroes go see another bad movie.   It has bad dialogue, bad special effects, bad acting, bad characters, bad plot and a total lack of humor.  This film was very expensive to produce.  The cost of the film was more than it had to be because the director decided to cast all Asian actors instead of just casting Asians as people who don't use guns.  What the director did was he cast the most evil people that the world has to offer to create the impression that they are the good guys.  But I'm not trying to make this into an Asian movie and I just wanted to say that the people who made this film do not deserve to be in the movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! - I don't know who this was or where this came from. I hate it. I am not a huge Star Wars fan, but I did enjoy this movie. I thought a lot of the special effects were amazing. The whole movie was an action fest. I just didn't like it at all. The only way I will come out and say I hated this is because it was directed by John Landis. I know Landis is a great director. But this movie just wasn't very good. I did look forward to the action and some of the plot points. I hope Landis comes out with a sequel. I could see how much this movie bothered some people. It did bother some people who don't like any kind of violence. I mean, they made me laugh out loud. Some of the characters are ridiculous. The acting is poor. The costumes look like they are not from the 80s. There is some music in this movie that I have never heard. Also, I never even heard of a "Jar Jar Binks". I never heard that word! This movie is a rip off from the original Star Wars. The special effects are awful. I found it a rip on the original. I can not believe the film is being sold as a prequel to a sci-fi film in the 80's.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad version of the movie "The Sixth Sense". It is really bad and very lame. The actors play a couple of roles - a bad person, a good person and a very very good person. I do not like the bad characters or the bad scenes in the movie. The special effects for the movie are really poor. If the movie was filmed a couple more years later, I think it would be better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! THIS IS A DIGITAL FILM!!! I hate the word "video." And that's a shame because there is something so very satisfying about seeing something that is "out there" projected onto a screen, like a live performance at an art gallery. The movie itself has a wonderful mix of styles, from the dark humor and "horror" aspects of a film about a house with a secret door, the "science fiction" elements of its first half and a couple of sequences with a "noir" theme that reminded me of a short story by Raymond Chandler.!!! This was a pretty fun film that should be seen with a couple friends around the house, or in front of the fire during the hot summer nights.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Glad to see a young woman taking her revenge on the evil men that have been tormenting her."  I hate to be the bearer of bad news. I found a great movie in this movie and I just had no idea of the horrible story behind it. I'm not a fan of any kind of horror and the fact that there were so many horrible things to look at was extremely disheartening and sad. When I first watched this movie I was expecting something else, I mean how could a movie like this be so bad? It looked like some sort of a horror movie so why was this one so terrible and so bad it almost makes you sick to the point you can't watch the movie anymore? I watched the movie a couple of times and it seemed to become worse and worse as the movie went on. There was a good deal of violence and gore as well as very nasty things that happened to women. In the end the woman, played by a young man by the name of James Patrick (I didn't realize until a few days later that it was Patrick that played the evil doctor) found her revenge against the men that were torturing and destroying her and she gets revenge with a knife. The girl who plays the evil Dr. White uses her knife and a chainsaw to kill all the other victims who were tortured before her. Well here's the thing the movie gets worse and worst as the story goes on and the characters become more and more mean and disgusting as they have to suffer the violence and violence is committed against them. You can't even watch this movie without feeling sick to your stomach, the scenes of extreme violence are very disturbing and I can't say that they ever helped me to forget the terrible things that were going to happen. The story of this movie is truly horrible, especially to watch the woman get her revenge and take out some men who were really bad guys. This movie has to be on the top of the worst movies in film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What an excellent idea! This movie is about a college student who gets trapped in an arcade (that actually is a video arcade) and is trapped there for the entire movie. That is the premise. This could have been a really good movie had the producers followed through with it. The movie is mostly shot in the arcade and the entire cast is playing video games. The only "star" of this movie is the guy who plays the computer. The rest of the movie is just played by him. The characters are all pretty bland and boring (except the main character). The only good thing about this movie (besides the fact that it is filmed in an actual video arcade and has good video game music) is that the producers should have hired more well-known performers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1/5  Why do we keep seeing this story when I feel the need for more action? This movie starts off with the usual lame plot, but then it turns into a disaster... The film is so bad I couldn't laugh. The only reason why I wanted to stop watching is because I kept thinking, "What happens next?"    and a half hour to go before the end   I think this movie is a masterpiece. The acting is not amazing at all, but it does their job. The script is perfect, even though it's written like a storyboard, it's an actual story. And I love it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was horrible, and this is not a negative for me, but a negative about the movie itself. The plot in the movie is really boring, it's just a bunch of random people trying to stop some criminals from stealing a big shipment of food, it was just lame. It was really hard to suspend your disbelief at some point, as this is a movie made by a big studio that probably could have gotten away with the screenplay without having to rewrite it all, and that's a pretty big compliment. In fact the movie kind of reminds me of the 'Beverly Hills Cop' series, a movie that is just so bad that people still enjoy watching it, and it's even worse because of its lame script. The acting is just terrible, not even the movie really tries to impress you with the acting, not that it could, this is the worst movie I have ever seen, I just had to wait a long time for this crap.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie has great special effects and the story is good. But the movie isn't funny and the characters aren't very realistic. The acting is great. I'm sure I could come up with a hundred other good jokes. I thought the movie was great until they came up with the "Egg-Grapes" plot: when a couple of egg-grapes falls to the ground, they are found in a bowl. This is obviously to throw a comedic element into the movie.  It doesn't work very well.  The plot is boring and poorly written.  There's a group of aliens who want to eat our heroes, and when they take off into space, they accidentally release the evil creatures on Earth.   There aren't any aliens in space. So the aliens get blown up while eating eggs, which I thought was pretty funny.  At least the aliens are realistic enough, so it's not a dumb concept.    The movie does have a very cheesy ending.  I liked that the aliens were able to fly.  All that "fantastic sci-fi" didn't work for me.  One thing I have to do is watch a movie before I review it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I'm ready to watch a movie about two people who get married and have kids and then one day, the son asks his dad why he's the one who's always helping out, and his dad says, "The money doesn't change you, it just makes you stronger. That's all I've got."   (I'm pretty sure this is a movie made before The Big Lebowski, if not before this one. The guy who played the father, Paul Reubens, used to be the guy who starred in the TV series The Dick Van Dyke Show. I think he's a pretty good actor.)    This is the story of one of the greatest comedy writers of all time.   Well, maybe one of these days I'll find a good one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had never been to this particular town of Lake Havasu before, so I thought I'd better see what was on offer, so here I was, standing at the entrance of a very rundown motel. And then the lights went out.     A quick glance at the clock told me it was only 9:55pm. I stepped out into the freezing cold of Lake Superior in my new boots.  What's this.    The whole town's gone dark.  And so began my life as a tourist in a dark town.      This was my very first adventure in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and I found it to be quite the challenge.  I would recommend it to all the first-timers, especially when it comes to the winter.

This film is all over the place. What's the problem? Well, the entire story seems to be going off in an illogical fashion. The main character, Rolfe, is a bit of a coward, so his girlfriend, Nino, offers to go on a date with him to a haunted mansion. He goes alone and soon finds himself lost in the maze-like house, trapped in a room that looks like a dungeon. While there, the house comes alive in a manner similar to the way that the haunted house in Alice in Wonderland appears to a child, and he is in the hands of some other creatures. Some of the creatures are good-natured and do not try to hurt Rolfes feelings, but there are two that are particularly nasty. The only redeeming feature in the film is the singing, with one of the cast members performing his part well. The songs are rather catchy, and if the soundtrack alone weren't enough for you, the film's action scenes would have worked as well. I give this film a 5/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was disappointed, I am a huge fan of the show and the film. They are very well-realised characters, who in my opinion are not as nice as their characters in the show. They play with a lot of emotions, which is good, because it brings the viewers into the world of the story, although, to a limited extent. The actors were good though and the movie is not that bad, it is just that nothing really happens. The world of this story is great though, there are so many people, so much destruction and so many monsters. It is a fantastic world to live in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________ It's hard to believe that this was one of the few movies from the early 2000's that was at all good.    A great big fat giant robot in a giant suit of armor makes his appearance. I never knew if this movie would make it big or not because it was so long and bloated. The movie took me from a point of view point of "oh man what a stupid movie" to "oh my god that's so dumb" to a point to where I just want to punch myself in the face. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that will probably leave you bored, yet confused. The plot is simple, it's just a guy called 'Ridley' and a female friend called 'Sarah' that lives in the old mansion in the middle of the woods. They're not exactly a couple, or at least they don't live together. Sarah has a boyfriend, and in this movie they go on a walk with their cat. It's supposed to be a funny day, but it's not all that. It starts off fine, and it looks as if they could have been making a date. Sarah is a bit of a flirt, and he keeps getting her attention, but nothing ever really happens. Then Sarah breaks a vase over Ridley's head, and starts throwing stuff at him. The next day, she leaves the cat with him for the day, and Ridley is still there, but she never comes back. Well they go to the town that is pretty much the same town, except that now everything has changed. There's been a flood, and now everyone is dead, but Ridley lives. So Sarah decides she needs to get him back, and so she goes into town and asks for a loan. Unfortunately for her, Ridley has no money, and because he has no real place to live, his only option is to go with her on her date. Well the walk gets boring, and you start to wonder if they'll ever get to see each other. The movie isn't that good, but the ending is kind of disappointing. It ends with Sarah being arrested, and she gets thrown in prison because he doesn't have enough money to pay for her bail. Well this is the most boring movie I have ever seen.   What made this movie good: There is a good idea in this, and even if the movie ends on a bad note, it would be pretty much perfect to spend a long walk, and not get bored.   with a bad ending: Well the ending isn't good. It could have ended better, so it might have been better if it had been a long enough walk.  , 4.75 out of 5, based on 37 reviews
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really bad movie, it is a horrible excuse for a movie and I will never watch it again. The story is pretty bad. The main character is a guy named Sam who wants to be a superhero who needs money for the cost of his costume. He is actually a big goof who is never serious when he's in the comics and doesn't really know how to deal with other people in the real world. So he goes around punching bad guys in the face and yelling at the audience and not doing much of anything. It's not much fun at all, but then again that's what this movie is. The second half is the worst part of the movie and it really makes it look like it was made for kids. This is why I can't recommend this movie to adults and why I don't think there will be many kids in the cinema who will be able to enjoy this. 1 out of 5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only redeeming aspect of this story is the title of the movie: It's a pretty bad one. You will laugh, you will get a little choked up but that is all. The story takes place over a holiday weekend in the big apple and when the "fishing trip" has not succeeded, the gang decides to throw their own special holiday party. They don't even know that the fish, the boat, and the entire beach is on fire.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________ The biggest problem here is the fact that the people in the film and the characters don't have anything to do and the movie just wastes the time with pointless characters and the same old story. There is one scene where a man and two children and the man's wife are having dinner in the kitchen. There's the guy's wife sitting in the corner. One of the kids asks him "What are we having this evening?". Then the man turns to his wife and said "We'll be having chicken!" And he goes to get chicken. All of a sudden, someone walks in and asks "Can I have a taste?" The guy looks at the kid and said, "You can have a little bit." "What's that?" They said. "We're having chicken tonight, you and the kid. Don't you want to know what we're having?" "Yes sir" They said, smiling. And the film ends on a very cheesy, cheesy and cheesy ending. ___________________________________ I like it! I don't like it very much. It's a terrible, horrible mess, and it's almost painful to watch. It starts off great with the children playing together, and then the story takes a completely different turn. It seems like every scene is about the same people and the story is always the same. It just does not make sense and there are several scenes that you don't even remember, except for when they happen to you the next day. One scene in particular was about a woman coming home after a failed marriage. She goes to the bathroom, sees something that looks like the shadow of someone standing behind her, and she walks out of the bathroom...and the shadows come back. The next morning, she finds that her husband had walked into the kitchen and left her standing by the fridge in the middle of the room in the exact same position. It is a very strange thing to happen to someone who is so used to thinking they have a normal life, and you wouldn't even guess anything strange was about to happen.  I would like to thank the folks at the theater who let me watch this movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an okay horror/thriller and I would watch it over and over again. It is one of those movies that is made worse by the bad acting. It has its moments: A little young boy meets a dead woman in a barn and she tries to eat him because that is how she ate a man. The scene between the father and his daughter is pretty much a rip off from The Exorcist. I know what you're thinking. The only good part in this movie is the last act. In it the wife is dead but the children survive and go back to the house. In the house there is a man that looks like a dog. This is kind of creepy but he is okay to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! I know, I know. Everyone loves that "Star Wars" series. But after this movie, I have to say, there is just no way that I will ever have another movie like this. There is no point in saying much more about this one. It was just bad, bad, very bad.!!!!!! The cast was terrible too. I do not understand how they could find actors that were so obviously not prepared for this. Everyone was so out of their mind they could barely act!!!! This "Star War" has become more of a legend than any of the films before it. It is really pathetic that these people put all of their energy into this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You can always count on the good guys to have a plan, but the plan for the bad guys in this movie is the complete opposite of a plan.   One of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  The movie was great. The story is very well written, so why did it take three hours to get here?  I've never seen a movie this bad.  It's so bad, you don't realize how bad it is.  In a good movie, you just need a bad guy to make a bad situation worse. Here they have to play a bad joke about the president's wife, all in a parody of a western.  This is one of those movies where the bad guy's plan doesn't make any sense. He has one of the most stupid lines in the whole movie, "That's why you're so rich, because you're rich and nobody ever bothers to take you to dinner".   This movie is a total disaster, just a piece of crap that no one should see.  And yes, I agree with the other reviewer, it was great to have that guy back, who is so much better than that other guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a bad excuse to waste your time, and it's not even a very good excuse.  The first act is good, and the rest of the film is bad:  I don't know what the point was.  It was just as nonsensical and as annoying as every single thing in the first act, so it's no wonder I hated it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing I noticed about this movie is the fact that its a story about a boy who is abducted and taken to the moon in order to save his mother who he hasn't seen in years. The first 10 minutes of this movie are very scary and very graphic. The last 10 to 15 minutes are very good for its kind. There is a bit of a subtext about the girl that was supposed to die at the end of the film, and it kinda makes the whole movie even more disturbing. This is definitely NOT a movie for children. This movie is a great example of how not to write a horror story. It's just plain terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It starts off ok, and I guess it should have because the opening is a long time coming. But it's kind of hard to get into the movie. The characters are really weak, the storyline is totally random, the plot just doesn't make sense in the slightest, it's just kind of a bad and uninspired movie. So I guess to finish it off I just watched the sequel!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ This is the fourth movie I have seen from this movie and I've tried to see this in a theater. It looks like a cheap home movie made with the best of intentions but has become a bad remake of a similar film that was made in the 1960's called "The Red Riding Hood". This is also a remake of "The Wolf from the East" which was a horror film from the 1930's. This movie is even more campy than "The Werewolf from the West" which has it's fans but has a different plot that is completely different. As always, the acting is not great and it takes a while to get used to the style the film is shot in and there are a few scenes that are really hard to watch. The music is very creepy and very low quality so you won't be humming along at all with the songs. The special effects are very low budget and the creature effects are really crude. There are several instances where they have used a red dress for the wolf and it looks completely ridiculous and there is only a few instances of a wolf's head. This is why the wolf looks so goofy and weird looking. The film really has the feel of a horror movie because there is some good horror moments sprinkled throughout the movie. The acting is just poor but the story line is not very good and the acting will keep you guessing until the end. I would really love to see the sequel to this movie but I really don't like the direction and direction from the second movie was really hard for me to watch due to the poor acting. ____________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was absolutely awful. The actors in this movie were very bad and it just wasn't funny. This movie is really bad but you might laugh a few times but you wont laugh the whole time. I'm still mad at myself after watching this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad, stupid movie.  If I were a woman, I'd take it to the woodshed.  It's like a woman had her head handed to her by a bull, then got back up and went right back to it again and again and made it worse with every passing frame.   The dialogue is so awkward it could make the character you aren't supposed to like so much, the direction is so bad it's good, the special effects are cheap and ugly, the cinematography is so cheap and stupid, the music is dumb, the acting is dumb and the writing is dumb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have seen in this decade... The only thing I can say about this movie is that when it first came out it was soooo different. It had a nice twist to it. We were led to believe that our main character was going to get engaged to a girl named Emma who was very close to our main male character. We weren't told that she wasn't real and that she was a puppet. When we started the film we are treated to this weird thing where we see that Emma and our main guy is really just a girl who has been playing a pretend girl on stage for a few years. The puppet act was very funny and it was very cute to see Emma be able to put on this puppet act when she did it.   Then about halfway through the movie she starts acting more like an actual girl... and she started acting more childish than Emma ever had before. I don't know if I have ever seen a movie this dumb. The main male is constantly being told to get off stage as he is being used. His body gets used as a woman's body at every turn. He starts doing "women" things for his puppet wife who gets turned into his puppet. Her acting was very dumb in this movie. At first she was just playing the same stupid acting routines with no reason as she always does in any movie she is in. When she finally does something interesting we're left to wonder why she isn't allowed to continue acting. So many of the things that she does are so dumb I can't believe we watched this movie twice.  A few scenes that I found even stupid. This guy walks into a house pretending to be a guy. There is a little girl standing in a doorway watching this guy walk in. The little girl is pretending to give the guy a hand up. When the guy comes through the door the little girl starts laughing at him. Why do you laugh at a guy pretending to look like a guy? I don,t remember any other movie that gave me such a bad case of the giggles in a couple of scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most boring movie ever made.   A bunch of actors playing the same characters with a bad plot.  All we get are bad scenes.  The whole movie looks like it's filmed with a $2,500 camcorder.  This movie will get a rating of one star.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The "B" movie is pretty much over now, and the film has been re-released again, and more often, and it has been in many different editions and countries.  And of course it has come out on VHS and DVD and now streaming video.  It is a good little horror comedy, but it is not very good at anything else.  I remember being in high school and feeling very stupid as we watched it over and over.  The characters are all too much alike.  There is one female character whom we all want to be a good witch like in the old movies and who has a lot of problems in this one, like her lover is an ugly ugly pig like in some older movies.  That is one of many stupid mistakes by the author.   I don't remember any of the other bad things. It is not a great movie, but at least it has never been a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a mess! There are so many plot holes that it's not even funny. I really don't understand why the characters were forced to make a bet on a man who wants to kill himself (as they call suicide...I never understood the "suicide pact"). They must have gotten all dressed up in a very nice way and decided to go see him and make a deal. The movie was very dull with very little action. There were some "dramatic" scenes with the characters in the desert (the first time that I really liked this movie), but they never make any impact on the plot. I am not sure if the director wanted to make this movie or a comedy, but neither of those choices were really good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would like to commend Mr. O'Hara for his ability to create a classic in a style that is perfectly suited for the era of the old movies, and not for the new ones. It is as good an adaptation of the stories from The Phantom of the Opera that you will ever see, even the most faithful fans of the books might be able to find things that didn't make it into this one. The story is as old as that of the book, a young man is taken from his family at a young age to an apartment where he is trained by a female who believes in a supernatural existence. He is then used by the female to murder a young fellow trainee, and after a successful escape he returns to his family. He then travels to Rome to search for his family, but the journey is not without incident. After several of these adventures, he returns home with his new friends and their love of opera. Unfortunately, all of this is lost on his family when they receive a phone call from his fiancée telling of an accident in their apartment, in which the young man who escaped was killed, and that the young woman who trained him was also murdered.  The widow's son, a professional violinist, tries to find out what has happened and what could have motivated the young ladies to commit these murders. There are other murders to investigate, and the story moves from there with the rest of the characters' involvement. There is no mistaking O'Malley's genius and the fact that he takes some of the best elements from the books and incorporates them into something more modern, something with which the movie truly shines, although O'Mahara seems to have used a lot of the same techniques in creating it. I am not sure, but I think it might have been a good idea to have had the movie be a bit more dramatic than it was. It would have saved some of its tension and drama if it had been a little bit more straight forward in what it wanted to say. Still, it is a wonderful movie that is quite unique in its own way.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you thought that  The Devil's Backbone was a decent little thriller, you are going to be blown away by the    [ spoiler ]! It's the sort of film that is not only fun, but also can teach a lot about the evils of greed, power and corruption. I really enjoyed the story, with great characters, a good story line and a good ending. I think the worst part of the film is it's length. This film really doesn't run that long. The story is pretty decent, with the first hour or so showing our young hero, and then the evil mastermind of the family begins his plan for the rest of the movie. But then again, what is life without a few problems? I know it's only 8 minutes, but I think it would have been better to cut the middle of the story.   It really doesn´t feel that long, but it is a classic that is well worth a watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I loved this movie.   I really thought it would turn out to be a great sequel to the first.  What did we learn?  Nothing.  I was expecting a new adventure to the same old story arc.  Nope.  Everything was the same, but with a new title and a different cast.  In all fairness, a movie based on a comic strip can't be bad, right?  And maybe this is the only bad movie I could find in a long time.  If you want a good laugh this is a good comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Just kidding. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was watching this as a kid, but I'm older now.  This was an awful film!  It was a bad time when everyone was crazy about this film.  This is a film about a family being torn apart by a murder.  The mother of the child is the murderer.    She killed him with a wooden spoon!   Her sister went to the police and had it ruled a suicide.  I hope this was a joke.  They didn't even have the decency to show that the little boy who was the victim had a very bad accident.  Why does he have a wooden stick in his hand?   I'm glad they left it out so that the kids would be able to see how it was that she died.  It was disgusting!  I'd rather watch it now than then. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You know what you're getting into with "The Exorcist". It starts out with some fun and excitement (I'm sure that's because it's a good movie) right up to the end. After the ending the movie just becomes silly and pointless. When you're not looking for the gory stuff this movie can get really interesting. The character development is a little disappointing. When Michael is trying to get to know his sister he is constantly getting distracted by demons in the form of the neighbors and the local priests. Then he meets the priest who is kind and gentle. Then after that they can't seem to make up with each other but then I saw that they were siblings they both were evil. It seems they both wanted to be in the same house and didn't get that chance but then there's Michael who has to keep Michael. That's right, he has to play with the demons. Well they aren't exactly demons but they are pretty big anyway. I don't know, it makes you laugh I guess.   I'm not going to even try and go into the things that don't work in this movie. The voice actors can't do much to keep up with the acting. But this movie is so bad, I'm not even going to watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts off with a quick flashback to what happens in the first twenty minutes of the film:  "What would a modern day Indiana Jones do?  In 1912, a series of unexplained murders and missing persons has become the stuff of urban legend.  On one such night, Indiana Jones (Tom Hanks) and his friend Henry Jones (Richard Gere)  are the last people to see Marion Ravenwood (Gwen DeMarco), a beautiful 20 year old who lives with her elderly mother (Meryl Streep) in a town called Ravenwood.    " Marion is discovered missing by several people, who have all disappeared at her same time and in the same place.    In his quest to solve the mystery of Marion's disappearance, Indiana is joined by a ragtag bunch of friends and a former classmate, a young archaeologist named Cyrus Stone (Barry Pepper).  ... And on a very strange note, the plot seems to have more of a Victorian/mystery twist to it than the Indiana Jones film.  "  At about 2:40 into the movie, things start to go downhill very quickly for Marion, because she runs into an old man who says he is the boy she saw in the "old" photograph.  One of the other townsfolk says they see a young man wearing green and blue overcoat and a fur hat in front of a large farmhouse.  And then there is the scene where Marion is sitting on a bench outside her mother's home with a big group of people gathered around her - "There are a total of 12 characters in the film, so I will just list some of the more noteworthy ones and describe their respective qualities."   They are: 1.  Indiana Jones 2. Marion Ravenstone (Mylar DeMarco)  3.  Cyrus Stone  4.  William Morgan (Peter O'Toole) 5.  Billy the Kid (Eli Wallach) 6.  Ethel (Kathleen Turner)  7.  The Widow (Sue Perkins) 8.  Old Man (Henry Jones)   But this is just my opinion - everyone else may think they do well in the roles.  After the first fifteen minutes of exposition, we have a movie like that is exactly what is needed to introduce the viewer to the story:   There is a very short synopsis of what is going on in Ravenwood -  "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My first thought after hearing the word "Troll" on the tip of my tongue is that this is a very bad movie. The story starts out promisingly with the first chapter and it starts off with the main character (named Kevin) at a small school called a "Jungle". After a few classes, he is transferred to a much larger school known as the "Rambo" School after a huge fire that happens in the school. The movie gives an amazing description of the school and the life of a boy named "Kai" who is a nerd. The first chapter is very well written but the next two chapters are not. After a chapter about the big fire in the jungle that starts with the story suddenly turns around and starts with Kai making fun of the new kids that the school has now with Kevin playing the part of "The Dragon".   After this chapter, everything goes downhill for Kai and it is hard to keep a straight face when watching the movie. Not only does the story not have anything to do with anything good (it just kind of feels like a bad animated movie) but it does not even seem like there was much of a plot at all. Kai is supposed to be a nerd with a dream and it does a really poor job at giving those dreams a direction or a goal to progress towards. What is worse is that at no point do they ever explain how those two things are connected. Why is Kevin going to college? Why is he staying on at the jungle for a little more? Why does he think he can make it as a professional actor? Kai is an awkward guy that just wants to be with a girl, so what is the big deal? Why the crazy story about a crazy monster that comes and eats the monsters? Why isn't that story ever explained? Why has Kai been acting like a fool? These questions are never answered in the movie and after the first half hour of this movie, I was ready to just let it ride out into the sunset because I was so sure the second half of the movie was going to be even less interesting. But it was not to be.   Now the sequel to Troll is Troll II. It is not any better and it was a horrible movie. I will be writing a review about Troll 2 next but in the meantime, the movie itself is very simple and a real pain to watch.  The movie is about a boy that is a big nerd named Kai who is being chased by a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really going to have a bad time watching this  .    A bunch of people have a funeral for a friend, but the reason that a bunch of them gather is because   some of them want to go home and take care of   themselves   (as if it was ever needed).  This is so fucking stupid it is funny. I've seen a lot worse movies than this. I think that's enough on my list so I can get on with my next review:  I need an aspirin right now! The third act of this movie is so stupid.   This movie is fucking stupid.  Is a film about a dead man that someone stole from his grave. The people that he came in contact with, the things that they did, the people that they loved, the dead people that visited him. This movie could have been made ten minutes earlier with a bit more budget and some less stupid people in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know if you can actually say that you've ever seen anything worse than this, not even the worst of the worst from the old horror/comedy film genre. I've seen worse, but this has nothing on the old ones. The story is silly, the jokes are made-up, the characters are forgettable, and it doesn't help that the dialogue is really really bad. This movie was a complete waste of my time and money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't even know how to review this movie, let alone enjoy it. I don't know why it didn't work better and more it did. But it's still not good, but you can have that. You can have a good time watching some actors playing a bunch of weird characters. It's like a cross between "The X-Files" and a "Twin Peaks" episode. I know it's a dumb movie but it's not really bad and not as bad as most of the other movies I've seen this summer. Maybe if you don't like the movie and the actors, you're a masochist. The story is ridiculous. There's a bunch (?) of weird and mysterious characters with strange things going on, like they're in the middle of a movie like "The Man From Nowhere" or something. So it's like someone took the "Ghostbusters" movie, and threw it on a campy summer camp movie and set it in an old-timey, weird farmhouse.   This movie is bad because it's really dumb. I've never seen it, but it seems like a movie that would go bad right at the start. The movie starts off with a short intro of an old farmer talking about how his cow had a strange dream about what was going on and then he dies and his spirit appears to take him home. The farmer then meets this boy (who's also a farmer) and the boy's son, and then the movie goes back to an old town with an old woman who's been gone for twenty years and she's come back to tell her story. She then tells a lot of stories and they all seem like they've been retelling this same story for decades. If this movie was made by the same writers as "Ghostgate" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" you'd think it was a parody of their style. The humor here is so bad and it just feels so like an extension of something that already exists rather than taking it in a new direction. And I think that's the point. This movie is very much like someone who watched "The Wizard of Oz" and then went on to watch "The Phantom of the Opera". It's just this old-fashioned movie, it's got all this old Hollywood stuff, it has the old people dressed up and talking and having all kinds of crazy situations. It has the same old-style actors playing the same weird characters and it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like the other reviewer, I loved the book. It's dark, disturbing, and fun all at the same time. I don't think there's another book like it out there. But, I also enjoyed watching it and enjoying it, too. For my money, it has a lot of good points. And a couple of things that are bad: The movie version is the worst of the three. It was pretty boring. There were a lot more scenes added, and not enough time is spent with the movie. The movie was about a guy who had his wife killed, but now he's in jail. The whole thing takes place in one day, and I couldn't finish it. I feel like the character was pretty bland and his wife is pretty much useless. I'll try to forget this movie, but I still have to rewatch it at least once. I enjoyed this very much! This was the first book I've read about the Salem witch trials. It really didn't read like a classic. It had more twists and turns than some of the films, and there was a lot to think about. But it was still a very good read. I have to say that while it was entertaining I didn't quite care about what was happening. I mean, the plot was intriguing at first, but it just wasn't as well-crafted as the other books I've seen on television. There's a lot less going on than other books, and the book itself is pretty thin. I wish there was more of it, because it was just really good. If you like any sort of literature about the history of witchcraft, this book is perfect. I hope to read more about it soon.

I'm not even sure it's a documentary, but I'm even less sure it contains accurate information about the time period. I saw this movie, and I'll admit I was a little confused at the end. It seems the film was taken from a very long video-tape made of interviews with celebrities who had all been shot to death, and the footage was put together to try and find out what the world looked like in the end of the century. We're given a list of the people on the tape, and they look like celebrities. We see their homes, but it's pretty much a rundown place. The interviews are very cheesy, but the people that are interviewed have some interesting stories. One of the guests on the video tape turns out to be a crazy person who speaks in a high-pitched voice and who can see invisible things. She's really scary, and we never see her again, but she's certainly a part of the movie. It was pretty confusing at the beginning, and it seems the interviews were filmed in the 1980s. But then I went back through the movie, listened to the audio commentary, and watched the trailer, and what I hear is very much at odds with the footage."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My wife found this movie pretty funny, I found it not funny at all. The movie is very dull. The story is about a dog that is given a job cleaning a hotel, he has to clean the guests rooms and clean the lobby, but every time he comes home the hotel is in such a mess that he is having to clean it up from scratch. This movie is supposed to be a story about dogs but the main character has only one line and he is the only character that doesn't have any development at all, or at least none that matters. Even a dog should have a personality and this one didn't. The dog is so dull that I could do a scene from Animal House with it.  - Jan, 2004
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never thought I'd write a review of a film like this, but I have. While it has a few flaws, I enjoyed watching this film quite a bit. Unfortunately, I found the ending a little contrived, and not very believable. That said, I still found the film a pretty enjoyable watch, even if it was a little over-the-top at times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was like a train wreck that just kept going, until it hit a very interesting climax.   However, a lot of times, the story, dialog, and acting, just fell apart.  And the pacing was just ridiculous, from the end of the first movie to the beginning of this.  I was a little upset that this movie was released for Halloween in a week when I wanted to be thinking more about the horror of it.  The story is just about a girl in a house, she is sleeping, when her mother comes into the room. She screams, which wakes up the woman.  She says "I think I caught it! I think you're the next to go!"   The ending was kinda silly:    This is pretty much just the beginning.  While she is playing with dolls, she sees a clown, with a very eerie and haunting face. And she is frightened. But the clown walks back to his clown house and he says "Hey, I'm not scared of you! Just scared of getting caught! Come out and help me!"    She comes out, and she tries to escape.  But when she leaves the house, a clown goes into the house and does a lot more things.    And she has to do all this in order to save her mother's life, which she does.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have nothing bad to say about this movie.  It's the usual crap movie you see on tv, yet this was an original and enjoyable movie. The art is good and the story of the people who live in the mountains are a very interesting idea.    The film begins with a young girl named Mary who is searching for her mother who had disappeared two years earlier.  She was taken in by the locals and told they were the last living people left in the world.  When she arrives at their valley she discovers that it is a land of a past time and the only way to escape it is to travel back in time one year.  Her mother, a mysterious old woman, is trying to stop her from going back. After a great deal of traveling she eventually finds her way back to when her mother was young. It is at this point that the movie starts to lose some of its luster and the music starts to become a bit off.  But Mary has an idea!   One of the things that makes this movie very good is that the characters are all really funny and it's great to watch them play off one another. It's a good mix of funny and tragic and the jokes never get too cheesy.  The story is good also.  This is the first time I've ever seen this kind of story told with actual live actors.  The art isn't too good but the story and the acting are very good and I found myself laughing a lot.  You need to see this movie if you are looking for a good time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of the most bizarre horror movies I've ever seen.  I mean, really?? A "zombie" who can only speak English because his throat was slit from the mouth down? The only thing I like about the movie is the creepy soundtrack and the fact that the film starts off as a zombie horror movie about a bunch of college kids who decide to take advantage of a zombie infestation.  This isn't very original or anything though.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible film. If you are a fan of the series, you probably know that it is very cheesy and not all that well made, but in this film it is a very, very bad film. For a start, it is too long. It should have taken a few minutes to make the audience laugh and to get the whole thing going again. It is also too slow, so the scene which takes place in the cemetery is very boring. They could not have cut out the unnecessary characters because it would have been better if they just added in the first five minutes again. When the movie was done, I started to be very annoyed that the story was not finished and there was so much more to be done in future films, because this film could have been very good. I think that the author was trying to follow the series and had done a good job, but unfortunately it was too long and not very funny. The only good point is that the actors did a good work because in the next few films they will probably be the stars of this series and not just the supporting players of the first three films.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What could have been a wonderful and touching film about the power of love in the face of insurmountable odds was sadly derailed by a predictable story about an evil, self-obsessed, self sacrificing, sex addicted and often-wasted director trying to steal the spotlight from his beautiful actress. His "love" was in the form of the villain who turned out to be so over-powered that he seemed like a caricature of an evil man. A self-involved actor in a love-story made his characters seem unsympathetic, so the actors did not add much to the story except for their roles as "heels" or "loose women". I really couldn't tell who was who and why anyone would want to be with anyone in this film at all.   The film was based on a stage play (the play is quite good) about a young woman who is in love with a young man, and she is the only person to know about the man's "love". But the man is an evil person who constantly hides his true identity and does all sorts of evil things to try to make his love happy. He always wants to be a hero, to save people and to be important. Yet every time he does something to help her (such as giving her a necklace or getting her to drink a bottle of wine), he makes her feel bad and guilty. He is so jealous, so controlling and so controlling that, by the end of the film, she thinks he wants her to go away.  , by: David A. Schilling
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It really is a shame they couldn't find a decent plot, because if they could have done so I would have been all for it. Unfortunately, they didn't, they just went back to the same basic set-up as the others, and with some less-than-impressive direction.  The acting isn't even the best part of it, that'd be the writing.  I really do not want to say anything bad about this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie has a lot of good aspects. The story is a very interesting fantasy tale.   At the beginning we have a very innocent (not very young) girl named Miral. It soon becomes clear that she has magical powers and it seems that her father has some plans on her.  She starts to learn all the magical spells from the local sorceress, she also discovers that she is related to the land of the Fae, and can see the future.  The plot is told in alternating time lines. In one story she travels to a desert city, and becomes friends with a mysterious girl named Zazu. In the middle of the story she meets the Prince of Darkness, who wants her to help him defeat the Queen of the Demon Fae. Then the story takes a darker turn, as Miral turns evil and seeks vengeance for the death of her friend.  Unfortunately, despite all the good aspects of the movie, the acting is not very good.  I was not really a fan of the main female character; I think she is meant to be very innocent and likeable. It would have been much better to cast a more attractive actor in the role.  Overall the movie was good, the story is interesting and has a nice twist at the end, but the acting was just too much, the plot was very unclear, and the acting seems to just be poorly chosen. If you are looking for a good fairy tale, try this movie, it won't disappoint!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really excited when I started this movie because it looked very similar to "The Crow", which was also a very good movie, which I did like. It was not a bad film, it was just really bad.  The actor was so bad and the movie was so stupid.  When they were in the elevator, the girl said she was really really hot and then the guy said "That's not nice"  How stupid can you be to say that "That isn't nice"?  It also was stupid why did the cop ask for a ticket when they went to the park?  You should not tell people "That is not nice."  They could have put a lot more effort into this movie, they could have tried to put a plot on it, but they didn't.    So I would say "Don't get this movie"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was bad, but that should not matter.  It was based on a true story about a little kid who is adopted by his rich mother and her wealthy lover. After a series of sad events his real mother dies and the adoptive mother becomes upset that he never talks to his true father.   In the end the boy's real father is revealed.  After watching this movie I can now understand why the original title was The Miracle of Morgan Lee.  In any case:  I hope you will enjoy this film.  A well-produced movie with a funny message in the end. I liked it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The Thing" is the story of a group of scientists who are the last survivors of a world ravaged by a great environmental catastrophe. With no hope of ever returning to the United States, the group embarks on a dangerous journey to a remote island where they will attempt to survive a series of new scientific discoveries that promise to provide a possible solution to the Earth's ecological crisis. (This is a pretty good movie.)   After the first act, there isn't much to do, and the film is only around 90 minutes long. You could have easily made this a much longer film. That said, it is a well-made and well-acted movie, and if you want some "frighteningly true" true stories about the true scientists who made it out alive (yes, it's true), this is the one to watch. It has some great performances, it shows how scientists actually talk and act, and it has a great soundtrack (I would be more enthusiastic about a movie like "The Fly" or "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" if they had these kind of performances.)  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only good things about the movie are that most of the actors are really good and everyone in the movie knows each other. I have seen so many bad movies and this one is definitely on the lower end. It is so cheap that I can't help but smile at it. The sex scenes are bad, the acting is terrible, and the songs just don't add much to the film. What really makes me mad is that at the end of the movie, it shows us some of the members of the band that have died. Now the film does a really bad job in dealing with the loss of these people. The movie should have been called "The Death of the Band". Overall a bad idea that will never be watched.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went to see the movie with my cousin and he loved the movie and we watched it together. The movie is a lot of fun but I really have to say that the acting in the movie was awful. The characters were bad looking and they didn't act like actors. All of them seemed to be talking out of their asses. They were all like that annoying "I'm so stupid, my life is stupid." type of person. The actors did a great job with the action scenes but the scenes of the characters talking out loud with no context were the most embarrassing. I would rather watch a video game show with bad acting and crappy music than see this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not sure whether to laugh or cry at the end. I will say, the movie takes place in a college campus where two groups of students have made a pact never to talk about the college. One group of students is a group of introverted types, while the other is a more outgoing crowd. The introverts are the leaders and it's the introverted kids who want to leave the house. They try to convince the outgoing kids to join them but they are opposed by the outgoing, loud and obnoxious kids who refuse to listen to reason or try to talk to them. As you probably can guess by now, the group of outgoing students wins and the group who are more quiet and introverted get sent off to a college that is even more different. The movie is about three girls who try to make friends with a group who do the opposite. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: -------------------------- After a fun little sci-fi romp set in space I think this one is not a particularly great one. There really isn't much to be said about the story other than that it is just a bit of a drag. It's the typical "space" romp with a "mysterious alien" as the main character. What does he do? That's a good question. I'm not a fan of the aliens as a lot of the time they just kind of stand there and just look good. It can get a little annoying when they start walking around and looking for something but even with that there is nothing new about them. I wouldn't say that I hated them but I wouldn''t recommend this one unless you are interested in a good space sci-fiction romp.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I hate that this movie was even made. ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ 1st Act:  The movie begins as soon as a little old lady is driving across a barren and seemingly endless land.  She gets lost on the way and in a flash of inspiration she decides to start walking to the north.    "Look, I see a little girl walking towards me"   She is approached by the head of the town, who wants her help with a problem in the town.  Before he can get his point across, the girl stops her car to look for someone.  After a good three minutes of staring off into the distance she makes a sudden turn into the town of Shatina.  She stops to chat to the locals.  Soon enough they start to notice her and make fun of her for looking like a crazy old lady.  Her brother was supposed to be playing baseball the next day, she tells him to get out now.  The next day he is killed in a fight with some local thugs.  When her brother's body is discovered they don't take it well and start to throw rocks at her.  This turns into a full out attack on her life.  Not only did they start a fire in her house, they cut off all of her possessions and stole her only pair of pants.  They tried to have a woman killed in front of her, which caused her to become a recluse.  Shatino is the only one who can get anything done around here.  So she gets a job cleaning out the local graveyard.  Unfortunately the dead bodies that are buried in here can't be removed.  Instead of using a sledge hammer or a drill, she finds a large wooden stick, and uses it to remove a body.  Eventually she gets too old to continue cleaning graves, so decides to move on to her final destination.  It's a very boring trip.  There isn't even any water at the very end.  I didn't think this was funny or entertaining.  2nd Act:   In this act the girl is on a train heading for her final resting place.  What happens next?  She's attacked by some of the thugs from her house.  One of the criminals attempts to rape her.    This causes a terrible argument between the mother and the daughter.  Both of them go at each other.  As they argue the girl's
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing wrong with this movie, at least it does what it set out to do. It follows a little girl who goes to visit her mother who has been missing for a while. She is a little child whose parents did a lot of hard work to raise her but one day she ran away. She went to live with her aunt and uncle who have a big garden and a house with many things for them to do and make life fun. One day the little girl was making mud pies in the garden when she fell in and she fell from a great height. She has always wanted to fly like a bird and has had a bunch of birds in her bird house so she knew what it took. The whole film follows the little bird who is learning how to fly, learn to communicate, and learn to be a girl. After she learns how to do all of these things she sets out to find her mother. The girl who had gone missing is shown as a little kid who is very inquisitive and curious and she loves to learn. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been a big fan of the Matrix movies (I only went on a third one since they got the rights to this franchise), but the first one is quite a good example of the style of the series.  It has a great idea, a great setting, and an excellent film.  But its all too obvious the first movie is not that great.  And the second is even worse.  The film has a couple of good action sequences, and even a good, albeit rather weak, story that doesn't really have much depth.  One can be forgiven for missing out on the first film, although it isn't hard to find on youtube if you want to watch it again. This is a movie I was waiting to see since I really wanted to see a new movie in the series, and the reviews for this one were very positive. So let's just say if you like the first and second Matrix movies, you will really enjoy this one as well. Unfortunately, it's a pretty poor film, even for the Matrix franchise. For one thing, all the action takes place in a black and white movie theater.   They show a bunch of really awful looking robots, none of which are that impressive, but the robot fight is still a blast.  Of course there is the same annoying, cheesy music throughout the whole movie.  You can't really blame that, considering how awful the special effects are.  The plot itself is pretty basic. It features a team of people who are on a mission to stop a supercomputer from destroying the world. But while it does have a fairly good story, it has a lot of plot holes, in fact one of the bigger ones has to do with the fact that the team members are a group of computer engineers and programmers, but have never seen a black-and-white movie before.  In the end, it does seem like the only reason they are able to pull off the mission is because they are working together.  This isn't really a bad thing per se, but it does take some getting used to.  The movie does go for the action a little bit more than it should, but that's ok.  You don't really need the visuals or sound in the Matrix to be exciting, which is what I believe makes the movies fun to watch.  And the acting is great, with plenty of great performances from all the actors, even though they
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess I'm not a huge fan of horror movies, as they're more of a guilty pleasure or a way to pass the time. While this movie can't really be viewed as a horror film, but it still has more than enough to it to keep it fresh.   A few things I thought were funny about the movie: * The people of St. Cloud are trying to get rid of the Stalemate and he has an odd little problem: if he dies he'll go to Hell, if he lives he'll get to live happily ever after. * He does get to "live" (and I really liked that bit) with the aid of a woman who seems a bit of a pervert (don't think that I mind the girl but this guy is clearly a perverted bastard). * Apparently the Staledane doesn't like to be used as a weapon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this on TV while watching a movie, and I loved it. I thought it was a great idea for a series with a lot of different villains and lots of weird scenarios thrown in. I do wish they would've left the main hero alone in the first movie, but even though that is the most problematic thing about the movie, it still makes me laugh. I hope this story continues for a long time to come.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ನ I never thought that the movie of the series could be a good movie for a children. I guess that I expected something better. I don't even recommend for teenagers, because that is not their audience. For those who would like to enjoy a story of a brave boy going on a battle of the gods, I must say that is a good anime, in spite of my bad impression. If I can't find good manga like that in the anime world, then I don\'t know how the world works.  Helpful that this anime is a very good movie, although it's not suitable for teens. This movie has some episodes which are a bit repetitive but they don't bother me because I found them so entertaining that I had to keep watching them. But the other episode is good because it shows that the main character is a strong character. I enjoyed the story, the action, the comedy and the characters too much to give them a bad rating. The animation is good, but the characters look like a typical comic-book characters. There are a lot of cartoonish character, like the "hero", who is not the strongest character in this movie, who tries his best, and his friends that are kind of like a sidekick. The only thing I didn't like was the special effect, which looks like a black and white screen.Overall, if you want to see a good fantasy movie that could give you a laugh but at the same time, shows something interesting about life, I recommend to you "Berserk: Battle of the Gods". If it was made by kids, it would probably be a lot better, but it's better than I expected.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very, very excited to see The Amazing Spider-Man, and after being told by some of the cast members that this was a major step forward for the franchise, I was not disappointed. After watching the first five or so minutes, I thought, "This is what the series should have been like in the 90's" and I was completely wrong. I have to agree that it's a significant improvement over the first film, but I didn't feel much of the change. I really couldn't get behind the storyline as Peter was so far removed from his Spider-Sense that he was never that useful as he was introduced. The action was really a let-down compared to the previous installments in the series and that wasn't helped by the fact that we had little to do with anything that was happening on the screen. The special effects and photography were excellent, but the acting and music just didn't hold a candle to the last movie. It was pretty much a repeat of the last installment and I wouldn't be surprised if this movie is the last appearance for our young hero. It is a shame since there are so many opportunities for some fantastic action sequences.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film starts with a large number of people sitting around a dining table in the early 1950s, enjoying some wine, while some older man reads a newspaper. This man is named Jim, and is a "dirt farmer" who has been tending his field to make a living. A little girl, Betty, is sitting next to Jim; they are on their way to town to visit Jim's niece, who lives in a different town; Betty is very impressed with Jim, who is a good writer, and a good artist. The movie does not start off very well; some of the dialogue is not good (though that was due to a poor translation of the English), and it is very dark and gritty at first, with a scene in a dark barn that looks like it has been shot by the great Hitchcock (see my review of The Birds ). The film picks up a bit here and there, with some people talking and a boy running a race at the carnival (in one scene a large clown is running for high school), though they all go by too fast for my liking, and it seems like the scenes have been filmed very fast in a hurry. As the story progresses, it takes its time getting going, and I can think of a lot of different places in which I could have been more pleased with the plot; most of the times I was not. I was really interested to see how these people got to town, and what kind of towns they would be going into. I think this was a movie with a good story that was cut up by the story editors. It was nice to see the good people in town again, but the poor people, who do not seem to be in town with the "great" people, are all living in a big mudhouse in a place called Dunker, and they are in some ways better off than the poor folks who live in town. That is not a bad thing, but when we have a lot more people (and lots of bad people, too) living in small places (dunker), the town will be very small and there will not be any town life to speak of. The good people also seem to like the town well enough, but it is not so good as Jim, because there seems to be a real lack of respect for the people who live there, as if they are all not worth anything, and that is the only good thing that comes out of Dunker. There is also a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For the first time in this series of shorts, I found myself wanting to watch this movie. And I say to myself "What the hell is going on? Why should I care about this film?" Sure, its plot may be somewhat contrived, but I found the acting to be a bit lackluster. The characters don't even come off as well written as the other shorts in this episode, and while this film is not that bad, it definitely doesn't live up to the standard we've come to expect from this show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What happens when you cross a famous celebrity with a little known yet extremely funny writer? A great movie with an incredible plot and a unique style. Not so original but I really like a movie with a good story that doesn't really leave any of its plot holes. The humor is good even though it comes at a price. I recommend the DVD with the English subtitles. (June 9, 2007)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You may have heard it before: the film is an ugly mess of a movie.   The dialogue is terrible!

I would like to know how a movie like this got made at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to a theater to watch   The Rocketeer. I saw the trailers and thought it looked like a sci-fi parody movie. I am not sure if I went in with that opinion and I wasn't wrong. I was in awe of the actors and the action was really cool. But the film wasn't very good in my opinion. The story and the characters were cheesy, the effects were poor and the story was really badly paced and I really didn't care about this movie. Not to mention that it just kept going from ridiculous to stupid with no real direction. The bad effects also didn't help matters. I think it should have been called The Incredible Super Hero Rocketeers: World's Greatest Science Fiction Film. This film was just really lame and that is probably why this movie has a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. There were better movies to watch with this kind of story. So, if you are looking for some fun, this movie doesn't have much to offer. But if you want to see a bad film with a really bad plot then this is a good movie to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say that this is the worst movie I've ever watched would be an understatement. It's a boring, raunchy, poorly-made, badly-written slasher movie in which people with no brains or dignity try to survive a brutal night of mayhem by stabbing, strangling and shooting their way through the human trash. It has one of the ugliest soundtracks I've heard since it first came out, and in a movie full of them. The film even fails to follow through with the original ending from the original movie, in which the police come in to take the murderer away, only to find it is a young man who just killed a little girl the night before, with a knife to her neck! (It turns out she had just been walking home from her babysitter's, which was how the killer murdered her.) The "hero" then gets shot for being a coward, while a bunch of other people stand around and do nothing! The murderer also gets shot in the neck, but there is no blood, and the wound goes undetected. They still call an ambulance, who doesn't show up for several minutes. There is even a very poorly-shot fight scene, when a police officer is shot several times, but still does not die! The ending doesn't seem to make sense at all. (The killer is caught in the act by the next morning. The cop was supposed to call an "emergency line" but apparently failed to do so. It turns out the killer had been watching his victim walk home from the babysitter that night.) It is a very bad movie (and this is saying something) and the poor acting does nothing to make it worse.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sure everyone who saw it has already gotten it, the movie is simply ridiculous.  It's just a big black trash truck, on a trip down the highway.    The driver sees the truck in the left turn lane, turns right and drives directly into the back of it!   The truck then proceeds to drive along the road for about 4 miles, then it makes another left turn towards the highway, at which point the driver begins to slowly pull back to the highway and stop, but at that point a truck drives up to the truck from behind, the driver of the truck is then impaled with the engine of the big black truck!  That wasn't too hard!  The rest of the movie consists of the drivers screaming like little girls, it was a very uncomfortable experience.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a pretty good movie, but, I don't know... There's no suspense or terror or anything. Just lots of bad puns and bad acting, mostly from the two men involved.   I mean, it really did get worse.  This review is for:  I am not a big horror fan, but my mom told me that this movie "scares the shit out of me". The film had a very "in your face" look to it. Not very subtle at all, but not too over the top either. This movie didn't have much scares, but I guess I am one of the lucky ones that can stomach scary movies for a few hours and still be able to do work in my day-to-day life (if that makes any sense). It's a really strange little film, it has a great cast, but it is a bit weird. This is a decent movie, even though it wasn't very original. I would suggest giving it a go.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not one to watch movies that I dislike, and even if I had a favorite movie from my childhood growing up I would never watch it again, but here is that movie: an extremely boring movie about an old lady (who looks like Marlene Dietrich) trying to be a good grandma who goes to the museum to find and save a famous painting. The painting was the work of famous artist El Greco, who is also credited as 'the master of painting with women, and the great artist who made women happy'. So, I am sure he can take care of her. That is what I expected, an old ladies life trying to show what it meant to be human being, as most of these movies try to do. But I guess I was disappointed to see that instead she is trying to use the painting as a soapbox for her own ego. And her attempts are a huge mistake! I think she would be better off using her painting as something else, and find an even better inspiration in it than trying to make people laugh and forget about them. At times I felt like watching some old lady taking the painting away from all those old men trying to take it from her. But when the painting is not there she would just forget and get over it like a child. She is the worst old lady that I have ever seen, and her story was not well written. And I'm not even exaggerating. I think that in the old days she might be a beautiful old lady, but now she looks like a spoiled brat! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie in the "Ghostbusters" series.  It is only good because it is a remakes of the original movie (a classic from the 80's).  The film is boring and it is over the top and stupid.  It is supposed to be a parody of "Ghostbuster," which has nothing to do with this movie.   I hate the idea of making a remake of the movie because it's a remake made by a person who is not talented at everything he did.  In the remake, the Ghostbusters are portrayed as old, lame, bad looking, lame people that don't care about anything except for how much money they can make with their movies.  There is no plot of anything.  The first scene is a parody with no plot in the movie.   The second scene is supposed be a plot to catch the Ghostbuster but doesn't go anywhere.  Finally we see the new Ghostbuster, and he is a horrible actor.    There are only 3 good guys in this movie and they are bad actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************************ This movie is so poorly written. I thought it was supposed to be a parody but, boy, was I disappointed. The main character has to deal with the fallout of a drunken date. Then, after he and his girlfriend go back to the couple's hotel room, they decide to sneak out to smoke their weed. I was hoping for something a little more mature but, the script, acting and directing were all so sloppy it made me cringe. *******************************
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is pretty weak. The movie was shot in black and white, with a couple of people walking around in front of their houses. Then they meet this girl who is just a girl who just moved into a place and wants to have a good time with her friends. They go into this place that has a bunch of rooms with different people who act just like each other. And the girls are the same but all look just different. And they play around and do different things. They start kissing but don't go too far since it's a movie about the guys and girls hanging out. At the end, one guy is killed by a girl named Lisa. Then, one of the girl's dad shows up and says that it wasn't the girl but the guy who was killed and he is going to get justice. And so, at the end of the movie, we see the guys who did the killing and then they see the girl and she and the rest of the guys get all dressed up to dance and celebrate.   I really don't know if I enjoyed this movie at all. I could see the movie being so great and have a great time watching it but after all the horrible acting, terrible story, bad writing, all the bad things that happened to this people and how the movie didn't come across well or something, I felt bad for liking the movie because the only other good movie was "The Mask". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie in a midnight showing. The whole theater was full, it looked so promising. We were all very excited and hoping for something good.   After the opening scene in which the movie plays out and then stops, we get a scene of the main female character sitting on the bed (sitting) watching a TV documentary. (she is a young woman now) She looks very nice. We do not hear much except that someone is in her room, but she does not answer (she just goes about the room). There is a knock at the door and she opens it (suddenly) to find her mother on the other side of it (we do not see her face, but we see that she is pretty, not pretty in a sexy way.) The mother is in a state of shock. Her father is in the next room, and she has just been told that her mother died. (the mother is not a mother!) The mother goes into shock and does not know what to do. She can't sleep. The mother then goes into a long and terrible argument with her daughter. She tells her to get up and be with her father.  The mother does not want to listen to her, and the mother gets up and goes back to her room to wait for the father. Her daughter says: "We can't help you."   We then see her daughter sitting on a couch with a book and a bowl of cereal (and then a cup of ice water.) We find out later that this is not the girl's room.  We see her sitting at a table in an office. Her hand is shaking and her eyes are glazed. The hand she has is not her hand. She picks it up, and it is not hers. In fact it is a doll that she has picked up. The girl walks to an elevator that is there, and then back to the table and the doll. We see the doll and the girl at a later date. There are scenes of a girl on a bed, and her father in the bathroom. There is an argument between the daughter and her mom. Then we see the daughter picking up her dolls (we never see the dolls again but we hear a girl call her doll her doll.) And finally, we see her mother picking up a doll and it turns out to be her mother.  My only complaint about the movie is the title.  I wish the film had been titled "Baby S
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cinderella is not a good movie, it's a bad book that doesn't make a lot of sense and ends up being pretty uninteresting. It's almost as if the author wanted to make a cute movie, but just got too many ideas that didn't pan out. The only good thing about this movie is the voice acting. It is pretty bad (I'm a fan of the '90s cartoon shows), but I did think it was pretty cute to hear little girls screaming like little children. The book is not great either, though some things that happened in this book (like the King's death) will be very familiar to readers. I could see that someone with a very low threshold for humor would enjoy this book. I didn't, but there were a few funny parts.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so sad. So depressing. I understand that it is for a childs picture, but it is too slow at the end, the story is completely boring. It is not even good. It was very hard to enjoy. I recommend this movie for those who like children movies but not for those like me who do not like that kind of stories.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I've ever seen.   This is a complete disaster!   A huge mistake!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My brother and I took this movie out of the theater when it first came out and loved it. My brother watched this as a kid, and had this movie memorized by the end of the first act. It made a lot of the same points we as kids had about our families, school, and our friends. What made this film interesting to me was that we as adults could talk about the things that were common to those things in a child's eyes in some of the funnier scenes. And it was in the humor that this movie really caught my interest. My older brother actually said this was the worst movie he had ever seen. It reminded him of "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" in that it had a child who loved a child, and two adults who would do anything to protect that child from his parent's misdeeds. What you need to know is that you should never, ever, watch this film until after you have seen all the others in order to understand it properly.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't want to.  The worst movie I've ever seen.   It's the worst movie of the year.  It was bad from the first minute, it started off bad, and it didn't get any better.  In addition to that, it was the worst acting I've seen in a movie in quite a long time.  If the story didn't suck, I would've given it two stars, but I didn't even care about the story and it was too boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some bad movies out there that are entertaining to watch. I have seen this film multiple times, and it is always fun to watch the good guy fight the bad guys, and sometimes the good guys have their chance to do good, and they lose. If you like the story, action, and style of movie, there is definitely something to watch here.   "It's not what it appears to be, that's what makes the world go round"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was really just a bunch of bad jokes about terrible people being really terrible (all of which are very funny), and I was not at all surprised that this was never actually published. The worst part is that the book, when it comes to "real" horror movies (which have a long way to go to match this film), is not that terrible. It's pretty bad, but not that bad. I guess that's kind of the point, right? The only thing about this film that has any real merit is the performances, and that's just enough to get you by and to laugh. - September 9, 2010Good but not enough
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would say that this is a fun movie about the life of an average guy. This was my very first PG I ever watched. This film was an entertaining romp and I was entertained by it. The acting was also entertaining. I have a few friends that like to watch this movie at all times and even in the middle of the night when we go to the park and are still in the car watching the movie we still enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie that took me a long time to watch, but eventually did so for what seemed to be a good movie (as I think it is in fact), I was pretty surprised at this. I've always found the film quite amusing and, as a comedy, I'm quite happy to be back in the business with it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time we hear about this little show, they're talking about the fact that we're supposed to hate these people; and then we discover that they're real people; a good idea, maybe, but really, this isn't a good movie. There's a lot of acting; that's why the movie was made, I suppose. The rest of the movie is boring, and the whole time, there's an awful lot of yelling, mostly in the form of an Indian kid that's a very good actor. I like him. The special effects are pretty okay; not bad, just mediocre. I think it might have worked better if it weren't just a bunch of Indians and a girl who had a strange look about her. I don't know about that, maybe the special effects were just not up to the kind of standards of the movies of the time. As for the characters, well, I guess the movie has one good character: the woman who teaches the Indians. Her name was the famous Dula; she is the first American to come to an Indian village and try to teach the people; she's just like the one in this movie, a good, well-meaning teacher and an awful bigot. The Indians didn't know how to get along with her because of the way she raised them; they all hate her. The Indian kid, by the way, is about half as good as his father, though he does look a little like Dula. All in all, I think the characters don't mean much (the film never explains to us why these people are so nasty and nasty to the good people like the Indians) but their performances are good enough; even the bad ones are pretty good. The movie's plot is just as dull. They come in, and they take over the village. The village becomes a military base (for the Indians), and the Army is all-powerful. The Army tries to teach them how to be good human beings; it doesn't work. Then they invade. But the Indians don't like that one bit; they have a very strong sense of honor, and their honor starts to waver when the Army comes to try to destroy the village and kill their women and children. At this point, there are about four Indian women, in different stages of pregnancy (in the same village, but they've just moved). A little boy is born to them. He's not supposed to live. Then there's a baby
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies that is bad on so many levels it is a real pity the makers didn't try to make it better.  A boring story about a child who kills a pig with a shovel, which then falls in a pool with a boy who then drowns because he had a knife in his stomach.   When it is not raining at a lake in Spain they are going to kill a duck to eat him with and a pig they have picked up on a fishing trip,   So, this poor kid is the only one who is not stupid enough to shoot his shovel while going up to the pig and the only kid in the class who is willing to go up there alone to kill it.  It all starts with a kid on a duck hunt when the duck dives and the kid tries to shoot it, but only does a light tap.  But, he does it anyway so that the poor duck dies.  Then we get into the pig hunt where we see the kid doing his thing, shooting at it. And in the end, when it falls in the lake and we are supposed to cut the water in order to drown it the kid pulls the trigger and it doesn't work either.  The only thing to do is for him to swim in with his knife and then the pig will drown in the cold water.  So after that, he just swims with his little knife at the shore, and then gets picked up by a girl and she goes to the lake to fish for the pig.  She picks him up, but he swims away, and this girl finds a boat nearby and picks him back up.  At the end we are shown that this girl is about to drown the pig when she hears a splash in the water. Now, we get to a little boy swimming at the lake.  They both end up in the boat and they are getting on it when we are told that the girl has drowned the pig while the boy has run out to rescue her.  It is then revealed that they drowned him.  This movie is bad,  I didn't want to watch it,  my wife and I wanted to leave the cinema after the end.  I would say this is a really old film, because it was made around 1910,  but it just can't be compared to other films from that era, because we don't get to see the main characters grow up,  this kid is only six years old
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After a really bad movie this movie still managed to be a good movie. This movie has the typical genre of bad movies. It is the type that has a few funny moments and then the bad stuff happens. However there is a lot of stuff in this movie. There are several action scenes, but it is not very good and the characters have nothing to do. I was not very impressed by this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought the movie was quite funny. The plot seemed to be that some poor woman is kidnapped by a man who is using her for a slave and raping her. They take her to a remote farm, and the man tries to rape her a second time and this time she runs away and ends up on a cliff side with a boulder on her head. However a dog with a whip scares off the man, he goes away. Later the woman is found wandering a lonely road, a man tries raping her again and she runs but this time into a ditch. The man has gone for a rest there and when he comes back a year later the woman had been pregnant.   My mother liked this movie quite a bit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a good movie, but there is NO story, and the only characters are the two boys.   It was like a short story told through a slideshow.   A good short movie, a bit slow paced, but it's good to see how young boys are.   I guess my two friends think this is a great movie and they all laugh at the stupidity of the adults.   No story, no characters, no one gets a chance to shine.   So that's a movie for the kids!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A poor movie with a poor plot and boring and stupid characters. The story is very basic, with a man falling in love with an animal in a zoo. He is then killed and a man who has had his eye pulled out falls in love to rescue him. Unfortunately, there is no plot development, no real chemistry between the two, and no real excitement about anything. The zoo is boring and the animal scenes are boring. The ending is too stupid to think anything good will come of it, the man who was saved by a woman who is a giraffe? I just don't know! And you know this is all in the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a combination of three different films. This is not a bad film, but this movie is not as good as the first. The second movie had a much more intelligent plot. The third film lacks any real plot. This film is just three people sitting in a theater waiting for a big bad wolf to attack. That's all it does. It's a movie that the kids can just sit there and have fun watching. The three protagonists are all the same: a girl, a boy, and a little boy who looks kind of like a giant. The main antagonist of this film is an evil giant. In this film, we never find out who is the monster. We just think it's a giant and it does all sorts of horrible things to the three characters. You know what the other thing this film does? It shows how awesome it is to be a kid. Yes, you really can just watch this movie and enjoy the three cute little characters talking to each other.   In summary: The kids are in a movie theater watching a movie about a giant who has killed a family, who also has a terrible habit of killing babies. The other kids are scared. The girl is annoyed. The boy is just having fun. The monster kills the little boy.   The movie ends with a huge explosion. The kids, who have just seen their favorite film about a killer giant, are so upset that they decide to go outside and have a picnic. I'm not sure if it was because they wanted to be with each other, or because they were so sad that they weren't even able to eat or enjoy themselves that they all decided to go for a walk. A couple hours later, the kids are talking to themselves like crazy, because all the other kids had just left them and wandered off with their parents.     I had fun watching this film. The people in it are so adorable. It had a really cute opening, which set the tone for the story. The story was pretty standard. There was a killer, he was a bad guy, and there was a monster. After a while, the kid and the little girl are just talking about the movie. The guy doesn't know what he's doing in the movie theater. We never really learn anything about who this creature is. After the monster kills another baby, the monster goes after the girl, and the two of them end up on a small boat. There is a bunch of monsters trying
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish I'd had the guts to buy this one.  This is a movie that you can't talk your way out of. It's about a young woman (played by the great Jane Wagner) who is a very shy and insecure woman. She lives in a small rural town, which is about half an hour away from her home, her brother and mother. This woman, despite her shy and nervous nature, is able to get herself onto the football team, her boyfriend's football team. At the beginning of the movie, this woman is a timid kid. She tries to act like she's above everyone. She's a big softy, who doesn't want to make a big scene when she and her boyfriend are about to have sex. Her boyfriend (who is played by the brilliant, Robert Mitchum) is a big man, who is all tough and tough guys. He's a complete prick. They start to have a big fight while the football players are trying to cheer them up. She starts to cry, because all the sudden everything is gone from her life. You can see that everything in her life is now going to a sad, sad end. At this point, she's not sure what to do. She and her son are alone and that's about it. The end. She is, in effect, abandoned, just like you would imagine a child in her situation would feel. There isn't anything that she can really do for herself, because she is not sure who her friends are or what she wants to do with her life, which can't be a lot. There are times in this film when you can feel, when you are watching this film, that the writer didn't know what to make of this child. At one point, after she's dumped her boyfriend and her boy is crying because she's going to have no friends at all, she looks at her house, which has been turned upside down, and it seems to her that she has turned into a small house, and is sitting on the ground, in a lotus position. The little boy is sitting in the kitchen, and her mother is sitting at the other end of the kitchen with the cook. She looks and sees her mother, and thinks that they've had sex. She goes back to the kitchen. She takes the little boy and walks through the garden and through the back door. It appears to her from all this, that her mother has got her boyfriend back. She walks

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this is the worst of the "Jumper" trilogy. The movie starts off very well. A young girl is jumping through a portal and comes across the Jumper. She is attacked by the alien and dies. She comes back, but not before the J.R. goes into the body of her lover and he falls in love with her as well. He becomes an actor and plays the role of "R" in the movie. It is supposed to be a horror movie, but the story is about the love triangle and they can't seem to separate. I don't remember if the last third ends with them separating. I think I've seen it twice so far and there are so many mistakes in this movie that it's hard to give a good review. But I have to make a confession. I saw this with my wife and my son was 8 and we had fun laughing at the "jumping" thing that the aliens do, but we also thought that they should have had the girl put in a body that she was in before the portal. The aliens shouldn't be able to be in the same body and they shouldn't even be in a film. This is just plain bad!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Not so much a good movie as an awful one. The story is about a girl who is stuck living in a tiny bedroom (the bedroom has no windows or walls, so you see in every direction from the inside of the house). She has been a model and a teacher so she is good looking. In the beginning of the movie she has a small baby (that is why this movie is so bad) and is doing well with raising this little baby. She tries to find a job and be a stay at home mom. In order to find this job she must do a modeling gig so she decides to go out on tour in order to make money. One night at a party she falls asleep on the bed. She wakes up the next morning but realizes that her baby is gone. She calls the police and they do not believe her (her baby disappeared) until they see the baby in the child's nursery. At the hospital they call the police again, and they are told that she is not allowed out of the hospital without a proper ID (which she cannot get because she has not had a photo taken in her life) or a social security card (which is really hard to get because this is a very conservative part of the country). She gets them both so they have to find the baby. Unfortunately, she has to give the baby back to her mother's aunt when the child is a month old because she had gotten them both pregnant by the same man. So she is forced to spend time looking for her baby and then she goes out and finds the baby on the street that she had given to her aunt. The aunt calls the cops and tells them about the baby and the aunt dies so she goes back to the aunt house to get help. The uncle is a man named Paul who has an office in the house. He tells her she is an old maid and she is fired. When she tries to leave the house she is threatened by Paul and tells her to stay there. She goes out again and finds her baby again. Her baby is so cute and so funny. She keeps taking the baby with her wherever she goes and when she goes to take it home Paul asks her to get in bed. He is too much of a man to get the baby out of her and gets sick and collapses. His wife and step daughters come out and they tell her to leave because it is over between her and Paul and that they will not take her back unless she does some chores.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a total and utter cluster. The plot is about four friends who go to the island, and a couple of them go "nautically" to the sea of stars. What a farce! The story is that they are not allowed to swim, but a fish swims into their boat, so they go along, because they are all on a dare and are going to be the first ones to swim in the sea. This is a very silly movie. You have a "star" which is a fish, and this is a bad example of a star, as the fish is so large and the screen is very small. This film was so far in the past that the computer animators had no idea how to depict a "nautical" scene. The camera does the best it can but there are a lot of mistakes with its depiction of the characters (some of which are very well done) the ship is just "out" in space, there is no atmosphere, they show the stars only, there are no sea life, no nautical, and the music is awful! The stars are so far away that you cannot make out the stars, the background is too dark, the animation is "mushy" at best, and its musical score is just awful! There are many mistakes in the animation and in the music (one of which is really bad) and all in all, a bad and rather pathetic film which is just a cheap ripoff of "Spaceballs".  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie 3 times and I am now afraid to do so again. I have seen it in a theatre in a city I had never heard of before. I knew this because of the star of the show who appeared before the screening, he was a local TV news presenter and the local reporter/anchor was a friend of mine from work. This was about a couple, a teacher and his secretary who are out for a walk. They are walking from one end of the park to the other when the teacher sees a strange looking creature. The school and the world is left in shock and the teacher goes into hysterics. A doctor comes along to try to explain the strange creature to the class. The rest is simply bizarre, creepy and a little upsetting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The idea is that a man is a serial killer because he kills people, then says he is sorry and says he will never do it again. Then a doctor and his wife come to his house, and the whole movie plays like this: The doctor, the woman and the kids (the "victims") are all in a horrible state. One of the kids goes missing. Everyone freaks out, including the kids, the guy who killed them, the parents, the doctor, his wife and the police, the TV camera, and everyone else. The doctor talks about how sorry he is to all of them and how it was his fault and how he is so sorry for how he treated them all. When the doctor tells the girl's mom that she killed her daughter and her son, this is when it all went bad. I thought this was a very sad movie.  Why a movie?  I have seen this movie so many times now that it has become something of a classic!    I loved this movie for its gory gore and the insane dialogue. The killer/serial killer (I believe it is a "zombie", but I am not sure) is played by one of my all time favorite actors, Richard Widmark.   Widmark's character is so demented and ridiculous and a terrible person, I loved it. But why was I so sucked into the movie. The movie tells the story of a man named Frank (Widmark) and his stepmother (Diane Lane), their son and some other characters all living together, with the father not even involved. Frank is really a terrible son who is jealous of his stepfather, and always wants to do all he can to get his father's attention, even though he knows that his stepdad is trying to hide the evidence to prevent the police from finding out what really happened to them. The movie is a bit long at 3 hours, I found myself wondering if it would be even better if there were only a little less time.  I am a huge fan of horror films and think they are some of the best ever made, which is why I love this film so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not in any way interested in this movie, but I was curious. A man wants to kill his way across Africa. The movie makes you think the movie was made just for me. I really don't know why the movie is so bad.  The title is a nice one, but the movie really doesn't have anything to do with it. The lead is a tough guy with a long, lanky build that doesn't look too well built or well dressed. I would say if he wanted to be taken seriously he would use a different voice or a different manner of speaking. In the end he isn't taken seriously by anyone because he is just an over the top tough guy. There is nothing in this film worth seeing because the script isn't very good. The film never explains who the bad guys are or why they are doing what they are. There are many good moments though, such as when a small plane pulls in close to him as he talks to his pilot, and the guy in charge of the movie tries to shoot him as a way to "stop him." A good little movie that is more of a fun ride than a horror flick.

It is a movie that takes everything we know from 1980s and throws it out the window for no reason. It just seems the producers thought this movie would be an interesting comedy. They were right.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And so to the review of a film called THE TIGER MAMA. Yes, yes, yes. This is a film so terrible that it has to be seen to be believed.   And it isn't just that it is stupid, it is really, really, absolutely horrible. It is so badly written that it cannot possibly have any plot or any point to it. A man goes to India to visit his sister's new husband. He is a member of the local Tiger Mamas (which are all Tiger Mams, right?) and in a Tiger Mama's lair they watch all the Indian movies. And then one night they watch "Kaa Tere" with great enjoyment. As they are making love she gives the tiger the medicine and the Tiger Maman kills him. The man in India is horrified, but as there are no tigers there, this means no death and no revenge. The woman, however, is very pleased. The sequel, "Kya Tere Aa Ke?" is equally horrible and the characters are as pathetic as in the previous film. At one point a man is watching a tiger, it appears to be a woman, which has been transformed into a tiger. The other Tiger Moms are having an affair, they are having a tiger do the acting. And the end of the film is a terrible montage of a bunch of different scenes, which are pretty much all made-up and with no plot. It could be a film by the Marx Brothers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was terrible.  Some good ideas were lost on the filmmakers.    The dialogue was not so great.  What is even worse is that it's a sequel.  My parents liked the movie.  4 of 12 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really bad.  And I do mean BAD.  This movie would work more as a parody of old sci-fi movies like The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951).  In this movie, aliens invade the planet, and the President (William Shatner, of Star Trek fame) needs a solution!   The solution: a bunch of "specialists" (read: robots and aliens) who can do anything to anyone and everything, as long as they know where the "target" is.  And because we're in the future... But the thing is, the target is not the target, the robot can't figure out who the target of the laser beam is, and they get sucked up into a black hole and then killed (after an unfortunate "possible death" in which Shat a nd others are sucked into the black hole).  It's a pretty good movie if you like old sci fi and are not interested in Star Trek.  But this is NOT a Star Trek movie, and I don't have to tell you WHY! This movie tries to be clever by having Captain James Kirk (Peter MacNicol) a good fighter pilot and a brilliant scientist who comes up with a solution: A giant black hole! The only problem: The black hole sucks up everything into it! Not good!  Here's the trailer: It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that was as bad as this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of bad choices: bad story, bad performance, bad acting, bad editing, bad directing, bad writing.  The director got a bad rep for trying to sell his crappy movies to his audience. The story is all about the bad guys trying to do bad things to the good guys and the good guy trying to get revenge against the bad guy.  The problem is that the goodguy has no personality or redeeming qualities in the least.    The baddies all have such a terrible presence and presence that makes me uncomfortable because I have seen them in my nightmares before.  This movie also makes me realize why movies like this are so popular--because there really isn't anything interesting or memorable.  I don't care who the badguy is or what he is doing.  To me he just comes across as a big idiot and everytime he talks we just see this stupid little guy making the same stupid faces over and over again.  You can tell that there's no depth or anything.  If this movie was made when the acting was as good as it is in this movie it would have at least been a 3 out of 5.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If it's a horror film, the horror is not good. It's a well-made film that doesn't make much sense. We see a couple of kids and a parent go camping in a little cabin in the woods. The parents take their kids into the house for a nightcap and then the kids are gone again. We are given the sense that they went out into the woods to look for things and things just didn't happen.   This film was a terrible disappointment. I found it to be the most tedious film I have ever seen. It is like someone took a bad story that happened a long time ago and wanted to tell it in the most boring manner possible. It was just not done well. It makes no sense, was badly directed, the characters were all one dimensional and a lot of the writing was horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are worse movies I'd rather see than a man in a suit standing outside a grocery store and selling an old movie ticket for a nickel. It was just boring... but that's not really a bad thing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is too bad that the original "Dawn of the Dead" was not a better movie.  The sequel was much better but the original was much more fun and with a good story.  After "Doom" i didn't know who would want to see it but it was like an oasis at the end of the desert of film.  There were not really any zombies, or vampires or werewolves or Frankenstein's monster like things.  No big creatures or huge creatures at all.  It was a small village of people with a small graveyard and the only thing they had to do was just to have a party or a barbecue and have a nice picnic.  You can't kill everyone and they were all people of normal size.  One time at a picnic one of the people took the wrong fork to eat at.  So when the dinner was ready they all got up and left to their own place to get food.  Some were walking and some were driving.  One of the other things they needed to get was a knife for cutting.  I guess they didn't get any because everyone who was walking was dead.  All in all it wasn't a bad story but it's very dull.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "This was such a let down. We didn't get to see the action and we didn't even get a good story that was a big let down as well.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is very obvious that "Boys in the Mist" is a bad sequel to "Trouble with Harry". This sequel features one more "Bag of Crap" character, and I could understand that the producers wanted to make a sequel to this film. However, the first film was very good and funny, with good acting from all the actors in the film. I do not even know how to describe the plot, since it is more "bad-guy in a town" than "Buddy in a school". I guess they thought they had something with "Harry" and his friends, but it does not help to sell the idea of these characters as heroes. The plot is nothing but a long way to try and sell a movie, since we never really see "Harry", but we do see his friends! The cast of the film is very "good-looking" and "smart-looking". The only reason they do not win an Oscar is that it is not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very bad movie and no other reason than its name, which sounds like a bad bad movie is why i am reviewing this. I was about to give it five stars because the acting was good. But all the story was made up by someone who does not know what the movie is, the acting sucked and the story made me laugh out loud. Not even kidding. It is a "bad bad movie" that has nothing to do with anything in the world other than bad acting and funny scenes. A very bad actor would not have made his characters act this way. I can not even finish this movie as i keep watching it. You would never buy this movie. - March 12, 2005How can anyone make a movie called Bad Bad Bad??
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   While I'm sure there are much worse movies out there than this, it is one of the least imaginative and interesting films I have ever seen. The plot goes like this: a girl gets abducted by aliens. They are humanoid, but more than anything, they are creepy. They make the female lead wear one big black helmet with a face mask. They go around doing things with her, taking care of her as if they are gods. Later, while the movie is moving along, there is this long-winded, nonsensical speech by this guy about how aliens are so good and the girl is such a precious thing. It's not very good, but it's definitely not bad.   The actors who play the aliens are not all that good, either. There is a very bad-looking alien named R'El who looks like something from a bad horror movie. He also has a really bad voice. If he weren't so scary, I'd be more impressed than frightened, just because there is no other way to describe his behavior. And his mother? She's...a little creepy!   What really makes this film a poor experience is that there is little of substance to it. The aliens are cool, and I'm glad they are used. But the story has no sense or anything. It all comes across as a little amateurish nonsense. As an adult, I still can't figure out what is going on. It is basically just a bunch of silly ideas that are not very interesting. It really isn't the best sci-fi movie I've seen, but I can't really recommend it to anybody. It simply isn't worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is based on the short story by Ransom Riggs. The plot is not a big deal except for the way the movie is shot. This is very similar to a movie called "The Ghost Story", in which all the ghosts are portrayed by actors from the past, and in "The Haunted Palace" the ghosts only talk but have no visible human features. So it looks like a cheap exploitation movie. There is a few ghosts but all are very little and have very little lines. The only thing that really is memorable is the villain (I never knew who he was) who turns out to be another actor, this time a comedian. The director never tries to hide anything, he even gets his actors to go naked, it is obvious that he never intended on having any of these people talk. There are no good ghosts and there is not much horror.   It is not hard to see why the movie turned out to bad, after seeing how bad it actually is. It is not even worth the time or the money. It has nothing to do with ghosts or anything else of the supernatural. It does not even have the guts to do what it is supposed to do. It was produced for money so the film has to be funny in order for people to buy it. And in order to make money the movie has to have cheap scenes of actors talking and showing off their bodies and pretending that they were there when the ghosts attacked. And as a result "The Phantom of the Opera" turned out not to be a ghost movie at all, but a cheap movie.   the only thing the director could do with the actors was to make them act silly and to have them run around naked with no clothes on.  .
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has so little in it. The film starts out with a young girl who finds a book. The author writes in the book and goes on about how the book was written a hundred years ago. She talks about how she wants to go find the book to read and to learn something new but what she finds out is that she doesn't care for the book at all. A couple of other people go looking for the same book. After some time, they find the same boy's body. They get the boy's name but have to decide if they want to keep searching or go back home. This boy had an unknown past. This is what the rest of the film is about. This film has a bad script, bad performances and no plot. You see a young boy who has no past, has no home, no family. A girl is also a victim of a murder. The script was so bad I didn't know what was going on and even when the boy starts talking it's all so stupid. The movie has no story. There isn't much in this film. There are no emotions or any plot that is going on. There is even a couple of times where the director goes and adds his own scenes that have nothing to do with the plot. If you like action, you will like this movie. However, if you like any kind of story and the plot is something you can care about you will probably hate this movie! I think this film is really for kids.  Posted by Vee at 11:55 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a couple of cops who accidentally kill their brother who is a high ranking officer in a mafia-like gang, thus, all of a sudden there is a blood feud to be dealt with in the small seaside town.  The cop's wife dies after a car accident, as she is leaving the police station she is hit and dies.  When the police officer's son becomes involved in the bloody feud he is the target of the gang, so all of the blood lust comes from the cops family.   The movie was a complete flop, with no plot, no characters, no plot twists, and no humor.     This movie had me laughing out loud throughout the entire running time, it had a great soundtrack that made it really entertaining.     Overall I liked the movie, but it wasn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    An uninspired movie with a weak script, poor acting, horrible CGI and a terrible story.   I have the movie on DVD for the price of $1.95.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time I saw this film I laughed out loud. It is like a bad parody of " The Little Mermaid " from Disney and is as bad as " The Black Swan." You have a little girl with black, cat-like eyes who is always watching over a small lake called " The Woods." Once she discovers a young boy named James, who has gone missing, she tries to bring him back to her home, even going so far as to create a spell that will turn James into a swan and send him to safety. Unfortunately, James goes missing and it soon becomes clear that James has not survived the spell!   What follows is a series of ridiculous scenes, including the aforementioned "feline spirit," but also the antics of James's pet cat, Mr. Bitterly (who is actually a dog) and, most laughably, an annoying little boy with a nose ring that is never removed. As I said in the beginning, I don't watch a lot of movies that involve the casting of a child to be played by a woman - I don`t find that funny. That being said, the cast is good but they could not carry this film. What I wish is that the producers of this picture had thought a little harder about what was necessary to get this picture off the ground. The film is not for kids, or anyone who likes to see silly pictures. I wish there was more originality to the plot, that James would be played with more depth and the cat would be more fun to watch, instead of making her one of the most annoying characters ever to appear in a children's film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot: The title says all you need to know about this movie! I will not elaborate much about the plot as I don't want to spoil it for you. But after you've seen it once or twice, you'll see why the critics hate this movie. After all, I don t remember it from the first movie. What's there to mention? The worst character in the history of the world is played by Kevin Spacey! This guy's a psychopath and it's obvious from the movie itself that he has done this movie with the intention of making a great role for Spacey. This movie is so bad that it is more like a "bad movie" than an "action" movie because of the terrible acting, lack of talent and direction of all the characters! In the beginning of the movie we find out that the hero has a lot of potential and we see him make some important choices. But the story doesn t develop and the story line just drags on. The characters all have some sort of problem in their life and then they become the pawns of some horrible guy who is played very well by KevinSpacey. If you like Spacey as an actor or if you like his performances from "Halloween", "American Beauty" and other movies, you should see this movie but for what purpose? Just do it cause Kevin Spacely is really a good actor and he is absolutely perfect here! And the fact that the movie is bad makes it better! It is so horrible that I laughed out loud more than once!! It's almost as if the director was making fun of the producers and the audience for going to see this horrible movie. I think he was really trying to create a really bad movie for the sake of having some fun. If only he would have put all his energy into making a good movie he would be a great actor!   I give "Dead Pool" a D+
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie, and an embarrassing one at that.  It has a story that is about three people - a woman, a man and a boy - who fall in love with the same girl. It also has a bad title.  This movie starts out with the bad guy - I think his name is Zagane - making a threat to the three. He tells them to go to the beach, where there is a lake, or at least he says there is.  Then they are on the beach and Zagani's girlfriend, who seems to be a really good actress, shows up, and they start to have sex. Then Zaganis wife gets involved.  The story then changes over to the guy and girl having a relationship.  But the movie never gets anything good going. I felt as if the movie was trying to make a statement about homosexuality. But then they had some scenes where the girl was acting very feminine, making a girl on the screen, and the girl on Zagano's wife.   When I first started to watch this movie I thought it was a bad comedy. This movie doesn't deserve a laugh from me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing that was interesting about this movie was the way that it was shot and that the film never really bothered to hide its flaws.   One bad scene has been changed by the director and it is the reason that this film is not worth your time.  The only thing interesting about the movie was that they never bothered to change a bad scene or to show their actors how to act in a scene like a good actor.  It is one of the worst movies in the film industry today.  One problem is that this was made when the only way to make money was to make a lot of violent films and this was one of them.  Even if you have read this review, it is probably too late and you probably have seen the movie and are not interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a pretty average movie. I'm going to admit to a couple things. I've had a ton of crappy friends that I think are great friends that are awful at everything they do. This was the second time this happened to me. First time was when a friend and her new boyfriend and their dogs decided to go out for a nice dinner. First off, a dog's dinner? I mean, the man is clearly an idiot. But even more, the dinner turned out to be a complete disaster. The man got drunk, the dog ate all of the food. I had to get the kitchen cleaned up twice. I even asked the man why he had eaten all the food even though there wasn't a single item in the menu that he didn't like. I mean he obviously just didn't want to eat anything at all. But the worst was the man ended up telling me to "just relax because the restaurant would close soon." Well, I never learned to relax. Even when the food wasn't bad I still couldn't relax. It made me so mad that I literally screamed at the man. Then I was forced to eat the restaurant's leftover food that had spoiled. So I ended up having to pay for a new meal. The food didn't taste any better and was even worse than the first time. But it was a nice restaurant and they only took credit cards so I guess that makes it okay. I guess I was more disgusted with myself and my friend's dog rather than my poor dinner. And if your friends and/or family have anything to say about it then maybe this is not a good idea.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story takes place in a desert and it isn't for the feint of heart. The story follows the lives of three brothers who decide to leave the desert to become real men and take over their father's gambling business. The only problem is the brothers all turn out to be bad men. I don't even know what the writer was aiming for but there is not much to the story but the story of the brothers themselves and the family problems and what will become of the family if one of the sons is a bad man and if the family dies out. You can get the idea of how the story will turn out just by the cover with the three brothers in a big desert and the desert looking very barren. This is the only redeeming feature of the movie. This was a horrible picture. There is not a soul of redeeming interest to be found in the movie so much so that the film should have been shelved in the hell and the deeps. I would not recommend this to anyone. The writing is not too bad and the story is mostly decent and a little bit interesting, but it is just not very good.   Overall, a very very poor movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.   The characters are all lame and the acting is completely lame as well.  And the plot is completely bad.  All the characters and the plot do not have a heart but just get on with things.  The writing is all over the place and the dialogues are just terrible.  This was a disaster of a movie that I will never watch again.  Posted by Mike D at 6:19 PM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!WITHOUT EVEN ASKING: NO! THIS IS A BAD MOVIE. It has horrible acting, terrible acting, horrid acting, horrible acting... It is about the same story, we're told that two characters in the world of vampires can turn into a girl. So one of them goes to her school, and he meets a girl who's like that, so he kills her. Then she turns into a cat, which is why he thinks he turned into a vampire. Then he goes to the vampire doctor, and the vampire guy says this isn't the way it is supposed to go, he thought of a cure, and tells him to go home, and leave her alone. Well, he goes home, but, the girl he killed turns into the girl from the movie. The vampire doctor wants to kill her. There's one scene where all they do is talk in the basement, and she is a horrible girl with teeth in her hair. The ending is, the vampire goes home and leaves the girl alone. I hope no one sees this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is a mess. ________ __ It is really bad. _____________________ It is a bad flick. ________________________ It should not have made it to theaters. _________________________________ I hope this review did not waste the time of anyone. ************************ The movie is about a small town in Texas that has a murder.   This is the only scene that will work.  And it's pretty weak, too.  The main character, Mike (played by a good looking guy) and the girl he loved go up to the town to try to find a missing woman.  Mike is obviously mentally challenged, which is no surprise.  It is a pretty standard western genre.  This movie also features some of the worst acting ever done in a movie.  No, I am not kidding.  Even the lead guy has no charisma whatsoever.  He doesn't seem to give two fucks.  Why does this movie have a "director" but no writers?    These people were just hired to play the part of the locals.  At least it is supposed to be a Texas Town. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It starts off like some sort of horror-comedy.   I'm not sure what kind of movie this was, but the opening credits don't really tell anything, just a couple of pictures of some guys talking in an office, then a guy enters and they go off to a hotel, maybe a little scary.  They all meet their wives, then they all go out for a night of fun.  After the sex scenes, we're shown a woman's body on the floor from a long shot, then the next thing we know is that we're in a very creepy hospital.  We meet an old man and a young woman, both are dressed like old people, the old man with a thick moustache and long hair, and she in her white nurse clothes.  The old man looks very sad as he watches the woman bleed out on the table, then he sits down, very sad, and cries, while his daughter sits next to him, staring at her mother's body as it falls to the floor.  What really got me was the close-ups of the two old guys, we know what they're talking about, but there's no sound effects so we can't even understand what they say.  I didn't think I liked this movie at all, but it did have a good ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a total train wreck that is nothing but stupid, dumb, and uninteresting.   A bunch of people who should have known better and thought twice before coming to a restaurant where a prostitute has to get the "blow" or "charity" to pay off her drug debts.  This is where the film starts to fall apart.  First of all, why in hell would the prostitutes go to such a place?  If it had a roof and a heating system that worked, and they had to clean it a few times a day and cook in it, then they could have gone to a place like a diner in the suburbs, or a burger joint in the strip, and there they could buy drugs for the day.  The food was terrible, and the waitress was a complete and utter loser.  Second of all... why do they even stay in such a bad hotel?  What would the hotel even look like?  The front room had a big open area with chairs that were made of old wood, where the hookers slept.  There was a tiny closet that had a table and chair on it that had to be dragged to by a hooker.  Third, the people in this movie would not understand a word that they were saying.  When they had a discussion in German about how the prostitutes were so attractive.  They looked like they were just sitting around waiting for someone to come by for sex.  Fourth, the hooker who goes by the name of Mary said something in French that made no sense.  Then, when the waitress asks the hookies where to go to the bathroom, they said, "I don't know, what do you want a bathroom for?"  If that had been a real hooker and she was speaking English, she wouldn't have said what she said.  Finally, we get to the bad part.... we have the hookings.  We have three hookers in this film.  One of them comes over, gets a blowjob from a woman, then goes back to her room because she wants a shower.  (Oh yes, she wants to clean up.  No, I don't think that she needs a shower, the way she looks after the others.)  Next is the woman with the tattooed face.  It is supposed to be her boyfriend.  But she has such a big nose that he really couldn't do it.  And you just can't believe
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie should be:  - An action adventure movie - A bit predictable, but it's not really bad   This movie is too simple. It's a story about a guy who's a former soldier who's now a security guard of a casino. He's supposed to do the guard's job, but he has a personal problem that's not that easy to fix. It has more of a sci-fi than horror/sci-fi look. I wouldn't have minded it any more if it were more like a mystery movie but the story doesn't get started with any decent or suspenseful story.   There are two other characters with little personality. They are: - A guy who comes and helps the guard and wants to be in the show, but the guard is the only one who is not a bad guy. - The female guard.  It's so much like a TV show that you can't be more bored. I don't even like TV shows and don't like this one at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think the movie was a little more serious (though the movie doesn't get the full horror genre name) than I expected for a horror movie but that didn't really change my overall rating for the movie.   Overall there was not much horror in this movie, more like a campy, fun movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was looking for a good romantic comedy to watch, and I found exactly that, except it was just so bad it was painful to watch. At first I was not sure why I liked it. There was nothing really wrong with it. Then it began to get good. At times, it was really funny. There were some really great moments. It is possible this is a good idea by the director. The acting is top-notch, the music is decent and I got a kick out of it. I don't think I will ever try to watch any more of these terrible romance comedies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a bit of a "travelling salesman"-type of guy. I don't live in the city and my job is mostly office work in suburban settings.  I have always wanted to do an urban film and while in the planning stages for a "Trouble in Paradise"  - a film about the city streets, the carny  gang and some of its shenanigans- a little research in my local area and it dawned on me why a film like this is rarely made.  Troubled streets, a lot of traffic and all that good stuff.  For a start, the film's plot is not very original but then again, most films are not original but usually do not need much to "hook".  The story goes something like this: a little boy, played by the young Tim Roth  (who is a little too young to carry that name with his mature face), is sent on a street stroll by his father, a "gopher"  and his gang of boys and men to see the  city streets.  I'll spare you the plot's rest - it's a good story - but this film could have been a bit longer.    In the film there are a few characters who are all somewhat like a cross between "Boris Karloff" and the villains in a "Borscht belt"  - all in brown trousers, all walking with purpose and one in a suit walking in a park is the only "good guy".   But there is also quite a bit that is good: a lot (mostly bad) cars - including the ones I think should not be there (I'll spare the details), the gang  and a few others.  The film is all in black and white although a very bright colour picture here - the best here is not that bright but rather dull, the light coming in from the windows of cars is not too strong in order to make the film appear to be in colour but it is a good effect in itself and the shadows are very good.  It is just a shame that such an interesting film doesn't get the budget it deserves.  As an aside,  "Travelling Salesman"  was actually nominated for a British Independent Film award for Best Picture.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXtI-d8bzc0
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't watch this movie!  This movie is terrible and that's not a bad thing.  It's a bad story, a terrible story.  There are a few laughs but mostly these are at the expense of the characters' lives.   The cast is really pretty small.  The writing isn't as good as the bad acting does a lot of bad things.  I've seen worse movies and this is at least twice worse.  It's a pity it got made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main cast is a bit uninteresting. You have a young woman, and a man, who are in a relationship, when a stranger comes into the room while they are having sex. The stranger kills the man, takes over the body, has sex with the woman, then stabs her to death with a knife. The man and woman are dead. The people around are all shocked because they don't know this man. They all assume it to be a suicide, because nothing has happened, until a local policeman arrives and shows them the body. They do nothing, and the police leave, and they all think that this man has killed all these people... Written by Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu>
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To sum up this movie is a huge pile of junk. At its core, it has a really well done story, with some well done character development, especially in the lead female character, who is a very likable, and a lot of fun. It has an enjoyable soundtrack and is pretty funny, but then it goes off into the realm of utter crap. It is really an epic clusterfuck in which nothing happens and no characters grow. And this is not even half the movie and there's still a lot more where this came from.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one bad movie.  The movie follows a very typical storyline: a guy who's lost in space, getting to know his new ship, gets the ship's computer to help him get home...  and just can't stay there!  He goes on an adventure through space and on the earth in this movie, doing lots of "sciencey" stuff and making a few friends (one of the bad guys is called the "Space Captain" - he's a Captain - a person in charge - of a vessel) but the movie doesn't have enough to keep him intrigued.  I'm a science guy.  There's no space flight, no space travel, just lots of science and lots of space travel.  The movie does have some good special effects, it has some great music (and there is one great song) and it is a good movie to watch after you've finished watching a space adventure movie like "2001: A Space Odyssey" or "Armageddon" or anything like that.  But it isn't as good as those.    I didn't like it as much as I thought I might - a little too boring to keep me watching - but it was a good time for science and space movies...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A couple of things: 1) This movie is in the same universe as The Last Dragon, so it is not a surprise that it is a bad one. I don't think anyone should ever watch this movie, it's awful. 2) I didn't like the acting, the music was ok, the acting was bad, but I thought the music in general was pretty good. I didn' t really like the bad guy, I think he was bad for being a bad guy. 3) The last thing is I was expecting a good twist at the end but none came, it was all just predictable.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was simply a bad film.  The acting is terrible, the storyline is a mess, the cinematography is a little bit dated, the story is very convoluted and convoluted, and it is an absolute waste of time.    I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Dude, the sun is setting down! Get out your big gun!" This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie has bad acting, bad story, and bad writing. This story was based on the book of the same name by Ray Bradbury. The screenplay is by David Mamet and it would be very hard to give it any better than that. You can tell from the beginning that this movie will be like a bad dream. It is very bad. This is no good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The premise is that three friends get together with a group of high school teens and attempt to get laid in a hotel parking lot.   There's some good jokes but they're not the ones that drive this movie.  I guess they were too afraid to use their real names and allude to this film's theme.  It is a movie that is more a series of "songs" rather than an actual "film."   I feel like I should have seen this as a kid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Thing" is a fun, low-budget, short thriller from the creators of "The Big Lebowski" and "Dinesh. The Thing, the Thing, and the Woman." (This is a movie called "The Thing," with one exception, but it'll be covered in a minute.) The movie follows the exploits of three men, who are trapped in a tiny cabin in a remote mountain cabin. The third man, an alcoholic (played by Richard Dreyfuss), is very angry because he finds out that his wife (Bette Davis) is seeing a married man (Robert Redford) when she said she couldn't get with a man without a family. The three men have to decide if the other man's wife really does love him. This is just a silly film of the low budget variety, which was made in the early 80s by a group of amateur filmmakers in a rural area of southern California. It's a little like the old "A Bug's Life" but there are a few good moments in this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ I have seen this movie so many times that this review will probably get boring pretty quickly. I'll just say that the movie is so boring that at times I really didn't care about any of the characters. We have some cool old guys, some cool ladies, a robot and a super villain (if he is anything). I didn't think this was bad, so I expected some sort of story to progress. Maybe it has a storyline, but the plot was so bland and forgettable that I just wanted to hang out with the characters all the time, which is not something you can do in a movie. There is no storyline, no logic, and no character development. The only reason people are able to stay interested in this movie is the way all the characters interact with each other and the way the actors act. If the movie had a plot it wouldn't be so awful, but there is a plot, and the writers can't seem to get it together. The worst thing is that the entire movie is just a series of slapstick scenes and really boring dialogue. It is like they are trying to do a comedy, and it comes out as a bad joke that no one will like. The ending is really silly and is all that we get as a payoff, but it just makes me want to watch it all over again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- A bad movie, not a great one but a bad one it is! --------------- So after the first 10 minutes we see an old man with no eyebrows and a grey beard sitting next to a fireplace. He then starts reading to the woman that he cares about and as he does he has some weird flashbacks to his life where he was married to a man from the south. He was married for 50 years and loved him very much. He married his own brother in law with her consent but then she was gone! Then he found out that her daughter was pregnant at the same time. The wife was very old and he said he was going to kill himself! But before he did he left all his things behind in the attic. As soon as the fire started to burn he went out the back and got back into the fireplace. This time a whole family comes by to take some family photos. This was a big mistake, he didn't care. This is what he wanted to do but he doesn't! He has flashbacks to another man that he killed and how he used his axe in the forest to cut down trees. He had a huge axe and that was his only weapon. He could've got away with it but he didn' t. He used the axe to chop down a tree and he fell off the side of it! Then someone saved him and a little girl was saved too. So she went to her family to find a new family, but she wasn't there! She had vanished. A little boy found her but then he died as well. --------------- Now we are in the present. A man wakes up to find himself back in the past. It was dark and foggy and there was a black mist coming from everywhere. He is so confused and not knowing where he is. The fog is so thick and dense he can't see straight. Then the guy gets a vision in his head. It is the man that is married to his brother in-law that he just killed. He tries to escape but the fog was too dense, so he fell into a hole and died. -------------- Now, the man wakes back up and it's dark inside the house but he can see out. He goes and looks outside, but there was nothing there. There was a trail that went down to the woods from his house! The man went and got his axe and went down the path. He walked to the place where he killed the man. But there was no one there
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's pretty obvious they didn't even try. There were no people in the place when the cops were chasing the mob. And no one is ever killed. The main actors don't appear until the end of the movie and when they do, it's because they are the only two left! But I do understand the director: It's a movie about people that live in a world that is so dark that it has no light whatsoever. It's been a while since I've seen a movie with no bright spots. I was in my bedroom when it came on TV. I couldn't have been more than 13 years old at that time. I heard the sound of a car approaching from behind in the driveway I was lying in. It stopped in front of the house next door and people started to get out. I didn't know it was a film but a car driving around with lights flashing and everyone jumping out and out the windows trying to get away! I was too frightened to go into the bathroom and go look out the window. I went into my bedroom and threw my bed up. My mother looked in and she saw my bed on its side. She yelled at me to get up and I told her that I was going to get a bath. My room was on one floor of a two floor house, which wasn't big enough to have a two-story apartment like mine had. At the time, it was the suburbs, so there weren't many houses like that one, but the windows were all boarded up. I had to climb up a ladder from the basement to the roof. I could have done it with two hands. It was pitch black in the roof space so I couldn�t see the steps that led up to the third floor, but I thought it was an attic because I remember thinking that the stairs didn't look so tall. I got up that ladder and climbed to the second floor but it was pitch dark up there. There was a door to the right and a dark space in front. It made me think that perhaps the room was an office and the dark area was a back room that they locked the door from. It took me a long time to get into that dark space. Eventually, I made it and ran into the dark space which was a hallway. I looked into the closet to find that the door was locked from the inside. I opened it and locked the doors behind me. As I stood there and watched the closet, all of a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!! (4/10) This is an interesting film. It follows an old woman who is a member of a small town that has been abandoned by its people who moved to a new town on the other side of the country. When the old woman's husband dies she leaves behind him her two small boys. While they were out on an errand they come across a man who is very handsome. The two boys see that this man is a real romantic and he takes them out for a walk. He teaches the boys everything that he knows including how to make beautiful dresses out of linen. The older boy gets involved in the strange life of the man and he too falls in love.    I am giving it 4 points because this is a good movie. It has some very cute and strange scenes that bring a little excitement to the picture. My main problem with this movie is that it is a little long. There are some scenes that are very long and I find it is hard to concentrate for the whole duration. I think this is probably because of the fact that the story seems to be going on longer than it really is.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is not funny at all. The acting sucks, as well as the story itself is stupid, like some kind of low budget made movie made by people who have seen and forgotten a lot. If you want to see a stupid movie make sure you find a comedy that can actually make you laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (The "mixed with" in "bizarre" has some weird, but not a bad time...)   One thing in a movie that you can't get out of your mind: The movie is a remake of a film by the legendary German filmmaker and producer Alfred Hitchcock.  This "Babylon" film by Hitchcock, has the famous "Hitchcock" theme playing in the beginning of the film.  But in the "Babel" film, the story takes a new turn in the first act when a character named Walter Babcock takes a walk.  He ends up in the city of Babel.  Walter Babock is a German who is walking along and suddenly he hears a voice calling out to him and Walter Babke is the protagonist of this film. I never saw this movie but as I heard that Hitchcock's Babkock film is "Bible-like" then I thought that this movie had a connection with it.  I remember it being something like a story about Babel and what has become of the language and the people who still can speak it. And this is the film that got me intrigued and I had to see it!   But the worst thing about this movie is that the ending, the fact that it was a "silly" plot which was "just so good to go along with" didn't help matters.   In the end, you might as well say that the movie was a bad "mixtape" and it got a low rating because of it.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was not enjoyable at all.   It's an old, stupid film about a guy who tries to get a wife by stealing her friend's husband.  I can assure you that the plot is a stupid mess, with ridiculous characters (and some pretty bad acting), horrible acting, and no plot whatsoever.  It also has a story of two women whose relationship goes bad after a bad trip at a spa.  The whole film is silly, just dumb, with no real story in it, it's just an excuse to throw a couple of jokes in every once in a while.  If you watch this movie you will be happy to see someone who has had enough of bad Hollywood movies and a couple more bad actors trying to make a movie that people would laugh at.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am not going to write about any other bad movie other than I am disgusted. I saw this one last night and I had to take a shower about halfway through this film. I guess I really had to deal with all this crap. I could see the humor but this is not comedy and it really wasn't fun for me. It was so awful that I had my camera away and just took a picture. I am embarrassed to admit that this is the second time that I am going to see this awful film. The first time I saw it was as a movie for a special at the library. The kids in the class were supposed to go to the movie but they were so bored with their day that they did a lot of reading. This is the story of a teacher, Mr. King. Mr. Prince is a teacher who is always teaching about things that aren't good for kids to read. Mr Prince is going to teach the class a story about how some kids made out with a man and then he gets arrested for making out with the man's girlfriend. Mr King then goes to jail because he is a good teacher who gets kids excited about learning about the good things in life. Mr Love is Mr. Royalty's assistant. She is going around doing "pranks" on Mr. Love because she is sick of him messing with Mr. Queen. This movie isn't just bad. It is bad on every level. It isn't funny, it isn't nice, it doesn't have any redeeming qualities. It only is bad because Mr. Phillips wanted to do something different with a genre that he feels is a tired one. This film is a terrible mess that will make you wish that all the people who make movies were burned at the stake.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was given a copy of this movie when it came out on Video on Demand (VOD) about a month or so ago, and I'm having to give it a "D" grade. The story was pretty basic, but still very enjoyable. The acting was good for the most part, and the music didn't really move the movie. But really, that's about the extent of the entertainment value.  A few weeks ago, I was sitting around a campfire when I first saw this movie. I'd seen it once before (not as bad as this), and I remember being disappointed with this movie, despite having liked it then. I knew that was supposed to be a sequel to the earlier movie, but the script was far too convoluted to be of much use. It was just another boring western where a couple who just left a small town find themselves stuck in the middle of a very dangerous situation. And then they run for their lives.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a terrible movie. This is about a woman and a man who were lovers until one day the man's sister (who was also a mistress to her husband) came to visit him. The man, now widowed after his wife went insane, found his new mistress and wanted to marry her. However, her family was in the middle of an economic crisis, so the man had to sell his house and his beloved woman was out of the picture. The wife came to him one day and asked if he could marry her again. The woman turned out to be a witch. She tried to convince the man to marry again but it was not easy for him to be accepted. Her last words were "Don't go down this dark road." I had no words for this horrible movie. I would hate to see it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________ This is a movie I was afraid to see because I thought I could not appreciate a film like this. But I got caught up in the story. It's a mystery movie. Well, that's all it really is. It takes about 3 hours to get to the end. I really did not like the ending either. It seemed like they cut out the very last thing that happened before they start the whole mystery story. I was really upset by that. I'm not a detective but I'm a good movie watcher. This is one of those movies you watch with a nice cup of coffee with a good book. It is so good I cannot wait for the next one. ____________________________________  Stars: Michael C.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's almost a perfect movie: a very funny and funny story that has some very funny moments. There is even a very nice ending. However the movie is not great and it doesn't really end.   If you don't remember the movie:   A young woman who is not really sure how to feel and how to live, who is depressed and who is living in a tiny apartment in the middle of a big city. So she decided to find a job in the city where she thinks she will feel better about herself. Unfortunately she is the only one who wants to work and her boss says that she has to stay in the office till tomorrow.  , but one day she gets an offer in the department store in the main square of the town. She is about to leave, but her boss tells her she is being let go tomorrow. There are many people who want this woman and her job to be hers. She will not be alone at all. Her little dog also wants a job too, she has a very cute and friendly looking dog. After many years of living in the same small apartment together and of trying very hard to feel more happy and not depressed, the happiness turns out to be very short lived.   with a funny ending like this there is nothing more to say.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is so bad I cannot even do a simple review! If you ever saw this movie, you will realize it's a complete rip off of the movie, Ghostbusters. There are only 5 main characters in the movie and they are all the same people except for a couple of little different characters. Also the script is so horrible that there is no sense of humor or comedy in this movie. All of the jokes seem to be made up on the spot. I was so annoyed watching this movie I had to wait until my wife got home before I even finished it!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Just when you think you've seen everything, this film breaks a new one out. It makes me wonder if that is a mistake. At least, that's what I would like to say. But that is not how it actually is. This film is just a film of the year contender if the name Robert Zemeckis did not precede it.  It would be better if the film had been cut down to around 90 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know it sucks but it is what it is.   I had high hopes for this movie... and not much at all. The plot is kind of interesting, but it just doesn't fit in. And in the end, the movie feels like it didn't have a chance and just ended before it even started. There isn't a ton of action going on here either. There are no twists. There is just a bunch of people who all want to kill each other.  And it feels very rushed and unprofessional.  It was fun the first time, but I'm not going to buy another watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bunch of wannabe writers, working in some big New York literary magazine, go out one night to have some fun at a party, when, to their dismay, the party hostess gives them some bad information: A murder is going on, in a large hotel on the Upper East Side.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Mama's Boys   Mama's Boys are not a "fun" film.   They seem to be doing the "old style" of comedy, where a girl's life is in danger of being ruined by her father's constant nagging and the fact that she was abandoned by her daddy before she could walk, which made her a sad and unhappy child. Mama's Boy also has an ending where the hero finds his mama and he kisses her, and it does a good job of showing how good a man her father is and how much of a mama should be happy for her dad.  "No way will he let me go!   I mean really…he would…he wouldn't let me!"   But when he comes over again, after he has made her promise not to go to town and not to tell anyone about him, the "great" and "true" father is gone, she is all alone and depressed, and he is back and she thinks:    "I've got to get away. I've got a brother who's waiting for me in town."     And the sad part of this movie is that he is really gone, that he no longer lives in town. When a girl like Mama is abandoned by "the great" daddy, and she is alone and without help or family, she will most likely think that a boyfriend, or a husband, or maybe even a baby, or even her dead daddy, would be enough to help her.

It's a slow burner with a lot of laughs and I thought the ending was perfect. I watched it the day of its release so I'm not 100% sure how it compares but I'm pretty sure it's on par with "Talladega Nights" when they are all high on a cocaine high.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The final part of the film consists of a few short segments that contain a lot of nonsense and an absolutely stupid main idea. In fact it seems the whole thing was filmed and directed on a low budget.  If you're expecting to see a comedy about a clown trying to catch some frogs, you might as well not bother.  My rating: 2 out of 4 stars (the other three were really bad) The main story is a typical "monster from the forest" scenario:  After a big storm the evil spirit of the forest appears on earth and attempts to destroy us all. After a few years the forest spirit is finally defeated by a brave boy who fights off this evil beast.  The funny part comes around halfway through when the boy tells the forest ghost that he's not so tough after all and asks his father to make him a new outfit. He ends up running around a giant forest while fighting a bunch of frogs with his new outfit that somehow changes his appearance.  When a frog starts to attack him, he quickly disappears.  Not a good idea at all, even if you believe this was intended to be a comedy, but who knows? In a way, it's still quite amusing and the fact the main characters make it through was rather impressive.  This was not the type of movie that I enjoyed watching, but it was enjoyable enough so I wouldn't rate it too low.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â This is a pretty fun movie with one great twist. When someone wants to kill their girlfriend because she cheated on them (while they were out of town), they break into a neighbor's apartment to get her, and when they find her, the neighbor's daughter is being murdered. The daughter's name is Doreen, she's a little bit older than the girlfriend, and is just shy of graduating high school. Her boyfriend/son, Mike (I've never heard this name before) is a jock who goes out every night (with the girlfriend's permission) and plays football and basketball and just generally hangs out with his friend/athletes. When he goes out with one of them, and he goes up to Doree, and gives her a kiss on the cheek, and says he misses her, she tells him she's leaving soon, and as Mike and Dorene are leaving, her boyfriend calls the cops. Doreene and Mike both take advantage of the cops and tell them to look the other way, and run away, but not before Mike throws a bag of cocaine at Doreemean (with Mike being the victim, not the assailant). It's not the best of the movies, but it's a fun time. Rating:  * The rating is an average, and it wouldn't really be an 'average' movie if it weren't rated as such. Â I'm sure a lot of people would like to see it, and I sure hope I'm able to see this in the future...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was a big mistake. The movie starts out very strong with a great first act. But after about 5 minutes it turns into crap. We spend an hour with a group of young people trying to help a group who has a bunch of stupid little problems they have to deal with. This one is a great example of how a movie can be boring but have a great beginning. But the ending was terrible. The characters do not develop. They are stupid and dumb. They act like teenagers. The only reason they do anything is because they know they would probably get hurt if they don't. Their actions in this movie are retarded. This movie should have been called stupid teens.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a bad "sequel" that didn't really add much to the movie at all. The plot seems to be a sequel to the last movie, where a couple of the kids who had been in a car crash were taken to a hotel where they meet two people who don't care about their feelings because they just want their money. The only way I could describe the movie is to say that it is a parody of "Halloween" in which the kids go to the same costume store, where one day, they buy a costume for the guy in a clown suit, and he is also playing a clown. When they get there, the girl is wearing a t-shirt that reads "It's a Sin to Say "I Love You" to an Idiot". The only time in the movie that I really liked this movie was at the ending where the two guys come up to the two kids and try to play a prank. Unfortunately for them, they have to meet up with the police because they think the girl's dad is a cop so they can play the clown. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high expectations from this, as I have seen plenty of bad movies before, but this was just a mess. I was expecting something better than this, a movie with some plot, but sadly, there was not even that. If this was a good movie, I would have liked it more. Instead, I'm just going to keep a positive attitude about it, and hope the writer continues working on the scripts he's been writing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say, this movie is awful. It is the worst zombie film I have ever seen. It starts off bad enough. We are watching a zombie killing a school bus full of kids. Then, the movie cuts to the next scene. In this one, we find out that a girl who had been turned into a zombie is trying to get away from the zombies when all of a sudden she runs off a cliff. A big rock falls down to kill her, and we find that there's a big zombie eating some kids that are still hanging onto a piece of wood. Then the camera pulls out and we see the zombie taking the kids' heads off. When it's all over the zombie is sitting on a cliff with the girls head hanging down. It then cuts back to the original scene. We find out from the girl's dad that her mother has died of a disease. When the film ends, the film goes into a voiceover. It's a pretty poor voiceover which explains that the zombie girl is the daughter of an "Easter Zombie", who has lost his children in a zombie attack. I didn't understand this at all. Even the characters in the zombie movie seem to understand that this was a bad idea. Even after this film ends with the voiceover, the zombie gets out and the people run for the woods to escape. The ending was not scary at all, and I don't think it really added anything to the film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ "This is a very bad movie. It should have been called Dumber than the Dumber. It does not have a sense of humor. It tries to be funny. But it does not work. It is stupid and stupid and dumb." This review has nothing to do with this movie. The plot is absurdly stupid and nonsensical. The movie has no sense of comedy and even the bad actors (in particular, the bad actor played by Sam Shepard) are bad in this movie (because they are only bad in their parts). I can't believe they were ever able to get anyone to look at this movie! There are so many things that are wrong with this ridiculous film that I could go on. I think this movie is the most worthless movie I have ever seen. I have seen many terrible movies and most of them are pretty good. This movie is very bad. It has no redeeming qualities. I would like to give it a 'B' but I really can't, because I can not look away from this film. If I had a dollar for every time I saw this movie, I would have enough money to go into space and live on a distant planet on a planet filled with giant animals. I do not recommend this to anyone. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie!!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't really know anything about "Nights in Rodanthe", and there's not a single thing that made me feel I could care about anything. It's an overbearing, stilted, pretentious, over-the-top (even for a Pixar film) story that could have only been written by a child. If you haven't seen the original, watch it! It's not perfect, but it's one of the better movies I've seen. A review by a little kid: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing this in the movie theatre for my very first visit to the UK. I loved the little touches like the little children (in their silly outfits) playing in the park with a dog and the woman with her face painted on an old car on a windy street. The music was very catchy but it didn't last long. There is nothing wrong with this movie and I really wish it had been made in the US so I could have seen it in the cinema, even if that meant I had to pay almost $100 for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I first saw this movie my first thought was, wow, this has really got to be the worst movie I have ever watched... it does have a pretty decent story line, but the characters just do not work. Most of the cast are just there, I could see most of them as a real hobo, a tramp, a prostitute, or a drug addict. This is about a bard who gets the job of writing the words to songs for a group of singers. The songs are so bad that they ruin the songs, and the singers have nothing but bad voices, which is even worse. The singer who is supposed to be a pretty blonde girl falls in love with a guy named Bob. The music he writes, while pretty good, is horrible in many ways. The acting and singing is so bad it is hard to believe that they got it made for only $500. I really didn't think anything of it at first, but by the end of it I started to wonder how they got away with such awful music...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a bad horror movie.  A really bad one.   If you've read my review of  The Black Swan  (a book I've actually written one review of!), you'll know why I didn't like this one.   It doesn't even try to be anything but a horrible horror movie:  "Don't get too close, it's a dangerous beast.  The plot isn't nearly as awful as it sounds.  They're going to investigate a house on the outskirts of town by the river.  This is a very typical haunted house horror movie where the house is an actual, real house, but one haunted by a spirit.  A poor man that's been stuck in the house, with only his wife, their dog, and a few family photos to keep his mind going.  Once again we see the film taking a page out of the Michael Clayton book:  It does the same things over and over again.  You know the story:  The man is in this house with a dog that bites the dust every time he turns around, even though they try to tell him not to let the dog out, and the same creepy old woman is standing by the window with the key to the front door hanging from her fingers.  It's a slow and boring movie with nothing going on other than the movie's theme.  I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone.     I'll never watch it again. "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not a big fan of the movie, and was disappointed after the first 20 minutes of the whole thing. It is a short, well-made, and fairly good movie. There are two bad points. One is the main character. At one point he is a soldier. I think that the author had to do this to keep the plot short. In the later years his body becomes old and he becomes a father. The other bad point is that the movie has a lot of dialogue, and while most of the story is told through silent images, you will often be thinking about the bad things that are said. I found it rather dull.  An unappreciative review by a "hardcore" reviewer: A lot of people who like to complain, hate all films that make the same mistakes as "The Great War". They have a huge problem with "The First Man". They think they're in a time machine, and that this story is some sort of reenactment from the war. A movie which takes a lot from actual history, but has very little in the way of historical accuracy. The only good thing about this movie, as far as I'm concerned, is the acting. One of the actors who plays the hero is Tom Selleck. It looks like a movie which was made before the first computer in the movie was invented. It would be quite easy to make a movie about a time traveller from the future. It isn't really necessary. The war is so boring to watch, it is pointless to even try.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Borrowed from The Best of the Bats for this, you can tell it's a copy of something that was actually made, this is just as good.  The story is the same as the first one and with less violence.   This is also a fun film to watch as a laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________ "Guns" by William Goldman (1925) In one of the few good '70s movie noir movies about an alcoholic and murderous serial killer (played by the famous William Goldman) a very young girl (played in a very sexy way by Kim Novak) moves into a rooming house to avoid her parents. As is typical in such movies the mother and father are at odds with each other. The father is a "hick" and the mother is a liberal-minded person who is an atheist. (Note: this movie is the inspiration for the television series that is aired on PBS from 1972 to 1999.) The story takes place in a fictional country where alcohol is available in all bars. A young alcoholic, Mr. Marcellus (played superbly by the legendary Robert Wagner) tries to make the best of his difficult life by working for the local "bar" and taking in an older alcoholic named Dr. Karp (played brilliantly by the great actor George C. Scott). The two are good friends; and Marcellon (played beautifully by the wonderful Shirley MacLaine) is happy that she has found work and is going to get a little money to buy a house and maybe buy a dog. One afternoon Karp tries to kill a guy who has been harassing him and his girlfriend. This is followed up by a murder by another guy. Karmal (played very well by the good actor Don Toth) appears, in his own way, as the conscience of the film. But there is another person who wants Karmel killed: his boss, the man who is the owner of the bar. As in other films about the bar, the murder is followed by a mysterious series of events. Eventually it turns out that the guy who murdered the bar owner is not the culprit at all. What he had been doing was stealing his money. Marcy's parents decide that they have had enough of her. The only way she can be saved is to leave the house at night, so that the people in the neighborhood don't see her coming and then commit suicide. She decides to do just that. But as is the usual case, it goes wrong for her. She has a terrible hangover and it takes her several days to remember to go for a walk. When she finally gets the hang of it she has to make a hard choice: she can kill herself to escape the neighbors and save her parents from the shame of seeing their daughter

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a good movie with great art and great acting, but the whole point and raison d'etre is a bit silly.  The story is set up as a classic "who's going to marry the beautiful witch?" with lots of silly gags like an animated version of the "whisper" game (a very popular game in that area) where all the witches have their own "whispers" for the players to guess.  When witches are asked by a prospective groom, she tells him that he is to come and play the "Whisper Game" with her and her other girlfriends at her house.  One of the most memorable moments of the game is when a player gets a fright, and the witch's eyes flash in the darkened room.   In the movie, however, the "witch" is a girl who plays a video game called "RUN" where you run around in a small room looking for switches and keys on a tiny table.    In the game, you have only a few minutes to solve as many clues as possible without losing time by "running out of time" with a "game over" screen and the next player having to do all the work in front of you.  However, the reason that the "games" are so popular throughout the "world" is the fact that one of the girls is a "witch", and all the other girls think she is very "cool."   The movie is set in the United States, where the main characters are actually teenagers that were sent to live at the "wicked witch's house." The "witch"'s house is really a dungeon with a few "fun" areas like a pool table, a bowling alley, a movie theater (which the "magical" movie theater from the movie is based on), a giant room with a bunch of snakes in it and lots of other small rooms.  The "villains" are called "Grave Robbers", the last of which are the "ghosts" of all the players that have died before the players had a chance to come to the "real world".  When the "prince" who has been waiting for the "groom" shows up to marry her, the first thing he does is to send the "girls" out to play "Rumble" in the house which is in a large, abandoned factory area.  To get there, they must get through a series

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a load of bullcrap!  A big studio production that should have been turned into a cult classic, a complete lack of professionalism, uninspired acting, poor editing, the worst special effects and terrible direction.  There's a few things that make this even more disgusting than the terrible movie you'd have to endure by watching it on television for a few hours.  The special effects are laughable, the special effects don't do any special effect, they're actually pretty bad.  So in conclusion we have a movie that doesn't have nearly enough talent, a big studio that was clearly trying to make a big movie.  This movie is an embarrassing piece of crap that should not be watched at all. FINAL SCORE: 3 1/2 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has a few things that make it an interesting and entertaining movie, most notably it has a really well-written and acted supporting cast who seem to play off one another well. What I disliked most, however, was the acting. Most of the time, characters are speaking to each other, speaking in a sort of monotone monotony, and the dialogue seems really forced and forced. For some reason, most of the dialog is in English; it's hard to understand most of what the characters are saying unless you can read the subtitles. I'm sure that there was a director and a writer and the producers wanted to see the movie on the silver screen to bring a much needed change of pace, but I wish they could have found a way to put more into it, and perhaps just have the characters in a foreign country speak fluent English. If only a few of the scenes with the French were in English, it might have worked better. I guess it's not bad just that it seems out of place with the other movies in this series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really the first of many bad movies I am sure. This movie looks like the movie of the same name.

Not much scares you but you're very creeped out. --------------- The characters: --------------- Well, I can't believe they didn't get a good director for this one. ------------- The story: --------- This is basically a short story that never actually really gets going. ------------ The acting: ------------ They were well put together. -------------- The music: --------- The music does not really help the movie and I would not listen to it again. ----------------- I enjoyed this movie and will pass it on to all my friends to have a good laugh or two. This movie was good. There was something very frightening and disturbing about it and I hope that it wasn't too scary for the next generation.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't like this one. It was boring and it reminded me a bit of The Road Warrior. So much was supposed to be "new" about this film, but the characters were very similar and the story itself was boring to watch. The only saving grace is the music, and even this could have been an average movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved this movie! So good that I was almost in tears at some moments, especially the part when the evil doctor is about to make her do the surgery with the knife. Then she screams at him and runs away and then the movie cuts to a very good song " The Devil, She Wants to Wear Your Blood ". The movie then fades away and we see the doctor running around the office screaming. A good ending for a nice movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was good. As bad as some other of the movies in the '70s.   The cast is good but the lead is awful.  Not sure if it was because she didn't want to play the part or if she was just too young.  It was funny when she did something wrong, just not as funny in retrospect.  The story is about a group of kids, some older and some younger, who get kidnapped by aliens. They are taken to an "artificial" planet, The Ugly Alien, where the aliens eat them for food.  They then create a space ship and a beautiful girl and two men that look like the kids to help them find their way home.  This looks like the same story but without the silly plot about the aliens.  But, in the end, we find out that the parents don't understand what a good alien is for them, so they let their kids go. It is a story about an ugly woman who wants the kids back because their parents are a bunch of jerks.  One thing that I really liked about the movie was that the kids were real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had to have a bad feeling about this movie from the very first minute. It started off with an overly dramatic and cheesy-looking "cinematography" for a movie about some children being eaten. That made me feel bad and my stomach started grumbling. Then the plot about one of the children, who's an evil magician and a big-time bully, decided to show himself, his wife and the other children that they all "weren't that smart" and that they shouldn't bully anyone. I'm surprised it isn't written like that in the movie because it seems like something like that should be part of the movie. Then after that the next 10 minutes were a huge mess, with no direction at all, no sense of humor and just about anything going on that would make the viewer jump out of his seat. It was kind of a mess. And to make things worse it was supposed to be a kid's movie about how kids are so smart... well how about that for direction. This is a very bad movie from top to bottom. There is no redeeming value and no point to its existence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "A real life story of a young man who goes looking for a mysterious woman, only to find that she is the wife of a powerful and ruthless dictator."  A pretty good, albeit clichéd, story about a man who is a student at some college in a rural part of the country. The movie begins by introducing a young, young woman named Lucy (played by a wonderful young Michelle Pfeiffer) who is an orphan living in a small town named Pleasant Valley. She is a very beautiful, and seemingly innocent girl. When a young girl named Ann (played at a very young age by Meryl Streep) arrives in the small town to live with her family, the young woman is immediately interested in her. However, Ann soon discovers Lucy is not the innocent girl that she looks, and a strange and mysterious woman comes to live in her home. Lucy also starts to notice that Ann is missing from school most days, and that she has begun to act strange. As the story progresses, the mysterious woman makes appearances, which eventually leads Lucy into a battle between the town and the woman and all the innocent villagers who are drawn into the fight.  The movie opens with a close up of the camera as the young man in the movie is watching TV with his girlfriend. Then the camera quickly zooms out to show everyone else in the room. Suddenly, the camera pans around to reveal a young woman (Lucy) wearing a bright red dress and a white blouse sitting on the floor. The camera quickly pans back again showing a few of the other people in the house. A tall man (played in the film by James Cromwell) sits next to a young boy in a red, long sleeved jacket. The boy seems a bit older than the boy he's sitting next to. The young boy seems to be trying to hold a cigarette to his lips. The girl looks confused and a bit worried. She turns her head to face the man and he slowly walks in front of her to sit at the head of the table.  I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't think it was bad at all. It was just a fun story with a pretty average cast.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thing that stands out the most in this bad movie is it is a really bad version of a bad comedy film. There is very little to say about this movie. It is nothing more than two strangers meeting. One of them says, "I'm your brother." The other says, "...Yes...?" This happens so many times that it becomes a cliche. There are also moments where I thought it was supposed to be some sort of a family comedy, such as the kids making fun of the father's poor taste. The father seems to get even more upset when he finds out that the kids make fun of his son instead of him, and that his son was supposed get upset when his kid got a better grade than his. The dad is also constantly getting into fights with his son when he gets a little angry, but that was the whole point of the movie. The only good thing about this bad film is that it did have its moments of comedy, though it was very repetitive.   Did you miss this review?

Review Information: If you are looking for a cheap movie to watch at the local movie theater, this one should not be in your line-up! I give it a bad rating because it is not good and it does not even try. One thing to watch out for is that a lot of the time when two people are talking, one person is talking about something that is obviously not important at all, such that it is difficult to understand at all. However, it was also my personal experience that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie's plot is terrible and it's made worse by the fact that the movie's story is so badly written that it doesn't even make sense. The story has two parts. In the first, the main villain (played by the amazingly terrible James Earl Jones, who actually did pretty well for an actor in a horror movie) escapes a psychiatric facility and has to escape from a prison, too. Then we get to the second part.   In the second half, we see that the main antagonist (played, with a touch of comedy, by an actor (who I swear I saw on TV once) who could only come on to me on television) and his friends are all insane, and the police are chasing them. In my opinion, it's a bad idea to put two people (I guess one was supposed to be a woman) in prison. Why is that? To try and give them a chance to kill each other on the outside. It makes no sense. Also, the prison is filled with criminals (who are in a mental institution, too). Is it so bad to give an insane person (who is crazy enough to kill) an insane situation to kill him in?   (Oh, I forgot, my bad.)   It's also really strange to put in a mentally ill guy in a crazy situation to try and get him insane, but there's only one place he could go.  A little boy gets stuck in a house with an insane (he's in jail) and a crazy (he also is in jail).   The girl is insane!   We follow the girl as she kills her father (who she believes is trying to kill her). Then the girl thinks that she is pregnant and kills a woman (she thinks she's pregnant). The movie ends as the girl is in a hospital and being watched over by a police officer.  In sum, this movie is terrible.  The film is really scary with a good story (the movie was about a house where the main and supporting characters lived), but I couldn't get into the story.  I have a feeling that this movie was made for a special TV episode or special. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I have ever seen... The worst part about it is the voice work. I will never understand why they used a man with such awful voice work as their narrator. It was almost as bad as the sound effects. I hated every second of it! The plot was nothing but crap. Just a bunch of bad guys that want to rape a little girl, the whole movie. It's like when you go to the movies...you go to get popcorn, and you get popcorn and then a bunch that's all in one pile, and then you sit down to watch a movie that doesn't look like it's about popcorn at all, it looks like a scene out of a bad 90's movie. I would really rather spend my money on a movie about people with really bad haircuts. So many characters that were a waste of time. Some good ones, a little one that was really cute, and a bunch with no names. They were all just some guy named "the narrator" (they should have put a name, like some real people, just to distinguish them) that you don't know what he is saying. I never thought I could ever watch a "bad movie" but this was a real bad movie! I don't like the movie at all... It's just a bunch all in the same one scene. You could watch a better one and not waste your time. So, if you are in need of a good movie to watch...Don't watch this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Crazy Love" is a movie that seems to exist outside of our lives, a strange yet compelling mix of surreal imagery, surreal music, and surreal storytelling. A movie so completely without meaning, a movie without any real plot other than to tell a story that seems entirely devoid of meaning and purpose. I am always a fan of quirky little films, and this one is a perfect example of exactly what makes a film like this fun to watch and to look at. The acting is top notch, and in this film we are treated to a collection of characters who we see from the beginning in a variety of odd circumstances, all of them making the effort to appear normal even as they appear to be living in a completely different world. From the title alone the film is full of bizarre imagery and concepts, but at no point does this confuse the viewer.   It is a strange little movie that is a pleasure to look and watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The acting by the lead, Robert De Niro is so bad that he almost seemed to be playing a cartoon character. I know that some of the other films I reviewed were very good and were very funny, but this one was just awful and I could not take my eyes off him while watching.!!! I felt sad for the character when he started talking about a woman he met that was married to a rich man.!!!! So much of the humor is lost on me because it was such a bad, bad, BAD movie. The acting was very poor as well, so much so that I was beginning to wonder if De Niri was going to be good.!! I thought his character was really annoying.   I had to tell my friend to leave me alone because I could just listen to him talking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people hate it because its so "dark", which seems to be a popular description of the film; but its not; its pretty much a "dumb" and "stupid" movie. The story is the same as in "The Big Lebowski" except that the main character is "The Dude", a man who does things like drive trucks, play pool and be the owner and manager of the bar "The Lebowsky's". He owns and runs a "Duckie's" a pool hall, that is also the place to buy and sell all sorts of things. One evening he is playing pool and has just won some money. He asks his "friend", a "Theon" to bring him over some pot. After the two friends get to the bar, they buy the pot, the cash and get out of there. That is where the story begins to go downhill. In the next few scenes we are introduced to a girl called "Anna", a prostitute who just happened to show up in the bar. She and the Dude are introduced, but in no way is she shown to be anything but a very dull and annoying character. She is the most boring of all the characters and she is a pretty stereotypical character; she is always drunk and whiny and does drugs all the time, and she also does things that are a bit ridiculous. She smokes dope in the middle of the street, she buys and sells sex and she's also the only female character who is not raped. She also takes the place of a real "doll" when The Dude is not around.  After some drunken fun she is then seen with a "Wig" who is a friend of The Dude. The Wig takes her to a "Midget" whom she pays to have a baby with her. After that it's "Daddy" and his gang of mopes, who give The Dude some "slamdunks" in a game of pool. But these are not exactly the sort of sizzlers you might find in a poolroom, as the "sizzlers" get rather stale and the pool table is covered in vomit by the end of the scene. Then "Corky", The Dude's "stubbie", comes back to the room in a pimp's outfit. The "Stubbie" is a bad-ass with a hat that has a "T" on it, and is the only character
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think I would have been happy with a good popcorn movie but this movie is so stupid, I don't think it could have even been made without $15 million in production costs.    The main character has the ability to make popcorn explode like a fountain pen when he wants to.  This movie has to be one of the worst and I have no clue how any other movie could even try to make it look as stupid as it is.   If a movie had no plot and a character who did whatever he wanted, I would be happy. The director must have been so bored and irritated with the story he decided to do something he could have done a long time ago: make a movie out of a TV show.  I'm sure we all have heard about the story of that TV show but I can't believe anyone gave a shit about it.  If the story was so stupid I bet no one even watched it.      A comedy is made out of an entire TV show, it really has no story to speak of, the only characters are a "sociopath" who does whatever she wants and the "hero" who tries to stop her.  I have a theory that most of the people in Hollywood are morons but this one is too good to be true.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have had a lot of fun watching this movie at a very high level of visual-graphics, sound, and action that is much more than that you can expect in a "comic" or the most recent "sci-fi". But, when it comes to the story (and by this I mean, the story isn't bad for a comedy, and that is a very good thing), it is nothing special. The only good thing about it are the two main characters and the way they look like a couple...and I was not expecting a "love story" so I was pretty excited by the plot! But I never saw any romance between the two characters, so I couldn't really give a thought to how that would affect anything. And to be honest, I could have been bored by the movie very easy, but the humor was good and the action was fast and very exciting, so that was enough for me... I found the script (written by David Gerrold), the voice-acting, and the voice of the "girl in the dress" to be very good...the humor isn't very creative (and it is written by a comic who likes to tell jokes) and the story is weak...I liked it better the more I watched it, as I felt the more interesting things happen in the story and the "bad guy" (the "good guy" is played by the most irritating man in the world...a very good movie though, a bit short but overall a very fun movie). I would love to see a movie with the same style... I don't think it would be bad in the movie "Fantastic Voyage".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In all honesty there is no reason to even talk about this movie. The story was boring and the acting is below the average. There is so much wrong with this movie that it doesn't even seem plausible. I've tried many times to make it into a good movie and every time the result is disappointing. It really is a waste of a year of your life, which I must give to someone who has a real talent for being a bad actor. There are way too many times that the plot just gets stupid and stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of this movie seems like a great idea, except that a lot of it goes to hell.  I know it's called a "horror film" but when is it NOT a horror film?  It starts out okay, at least from an aesthetic perspective, when our lead character, Jessica, finds a severed hand in a bag of chips and tries to play the hand but it doesn't work out.  As soon as Jessica touches it, blood starts flowing from her hand (not to mention an almost-naked man in front of her.  She tries to use her body to remove the hand which works too.  This is the first scene, and we have a bit of fun with Jessica until the hand returns, then the horror starts and it gets worse.  The acting is mostly decent, I suppose, but there is nothing that could make me feel like I'm watching a horror movie.  There's only one scene that scares the shit out of me.  It's a pretty long scene when Jessica and some random stranger try to kill a giant snake, but they get away!  So they hide in some bushes and get ready to wait until it's finished eating the others before they can kill it.  When they hide, the snake is eating one of them!  I guess Jessica is a girl and she can't get ahold of it because of a severed paw.  After the snake eats her and the rest of the group runs off, we have the most bizarre (and disgusting) bit of creature porn ever put on screen.  All of a sudden, the monster starts coming out of the bushes.  Well, it's just a snake, right?  Then, the creature emerges and eats the poor unfortunate woman!    After that, it looks like the movie was doomed to be a failure and ended with a whimper, with only a very bad ending, but I'm sure we all know that's a "monster" movie for the best.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really, REALLY wanted to love it. I loved how it starts, where it starts in a forest, with a couple of kids playing around, and a strange green misty place coming towards them, and it's getting really chilly! I loved the first 20 minutes or so I watched, I got the feeling that it would be a slow, relaxing horror movie, but it's not like that at all! It starts fast, and fast, it's like a horror movie from the early 60's! I don't even know how to describe the creepy atmosphere it has, where you're standing, you are terrified, you don't know what's going on, the sound is very bad, I don to even watch this thing, it was very disturbing. It's not a movie for the weak heart!   The second half was even more disgusting, and very, very slow! It felt like a very, long, long sequence from the 80's!  . The last 30 minutes is when the story ends! I think I would be happier if the movie was over, and then I could watch the last 20 minutes of the movie with a clean mind. It starts to slowly get good, but then it just goes really bad. But it did get good! I guess I didn't understand it, but the last two and a half minutes was amazing! The most shocking moment was when the monster is seen, it just looked like a big green blob with a human face, and that was really scary!   of course, there were parts that were not so good... like a guy shooting something at the monster, but that wasn't so good. I mean, how could a human shoot at a monster? But it was all okay, because it was done very well! Even if there were some scenes that seemed really stupid... like the guy trying to get home, when his mother was screaming... and of course when the kids ran out of the house, when the mother was gone, and when the father said "I guess it's time to go", and then the little girl ran out and said "Mommy!" and ran away, like she had no idea what to do! I thought it was weird at first, when her dad told her to go, and I guess it made her want to leave, but after she left, when she went up to the attic, she said to herself "I want to stay at home and do the dishes!"   It
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* If this wasn't the case I would never have been a huge fan of the book, I did have the pleasure to see the movie a couple weeks back. The movie looked good, the acting was great. I did not care for the story in the book that much, although it did have its good points. I do think the film would have been more appealing if the story was taken out of the middle. I feel the film went out of its way to make things seem worse for the characters to the audience. The film was set in the future, and is a prequel to the events at the end of the first book. The story begins with the events before that. This is the only book I could find in which the author mentions his next book. That being said, I thought the book started off good, and I feel like this movie went out too far. This was not much different in the novel. The only thing I could think of that was different was the story, and they did the right thing keeping it short. I would give this a 2-stars if I could!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this a few times, in the theater, and I thought it was terrible. I mean, I've seen many crappy movies.   The film opens with a huge monster eating a giant baby.  That's all you need to know about the film.  The only thing interesting about this film was the opening theme, "What a Wonderful World" by The Monkees.  I saw this film last night.  I loved the opening and closing theme songs.  Yes, I am aware I am not a regular movie viewer, but I thought the opening song was pretty. The ending theme song was a little repetitive as I thought all the kids were being murdered by a giant monster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was skeptical about it when it was announced to me last month. But it wasn't until I saw it in the theater (actually in my local multiplex -- it was playing in the local college theater) that I found it to be an extremely bad movie. Not quite as bad as the first Alien movie was (the remake) but it was close. I'll try to make it as short as possible.   An alien spaceship crashes into the earth; some of the crew die during the landing. The crew is rescued by some survivors and a group of children who are part of a group traveling to the moon on a balloon. But the balloon goes down into a cave. The children survive and find a baby in a cave and they learn that they are being taken to earth. They have no weapons and cannot communicate. They are put in a space capsule and they are taken to a moon which is full of giant rock monsters. The moon is inhabited by the "Nemesis" monsters. They feed on the babies and the adults. The alien spaceship crew gets separated from the children. The aliens, led by their leader, are captured and are about to be killed by the Nemesis monster when they are rescued by a small alien woman.  The "space-panda" and the "baby" are brought back to the earth and they bond with the human crew until the aliens find out about the baby and the humans try to kill the baby. They can't. The ship is damaged and the crew has to be rescued. But as soon as they land, the space-pandas attack and destroy the space capsule, all the other alien ships on earth, and all of the survivors.  I give this one one star because they could have saved a lot of time and made this a much better movie by not wasting the whole story on the mother ship and their attempts to find and bring the baby to earth, etc.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â "I never wanted to watch this movie, it was awful, I just sat in the theater and cried for three hours" I don't know what you are talking about. I've been here all my life, and this is a great example of a great movie! A couple tries to get off the coast of California, get arrested by the police, and escape to Mexico, but they get stuck on a small island full of animals. This is another tale of two couples in love, a beautiful love story, and of two animals trying to survive. It's funny as hell and is a fantastic movie. I wish it was in 3D! The movie isn't a masterpiece, but it's great and I can't wait for the sequel!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a film I found myself sitting through, a film about a woman who, when her husband (Christopher Plummer) died, she moved into an old abandoned house with her dog (Krissie Williams) as well as the housekeeper (Kathleen Turner), who she was dating at the time but left behind to marry the husband of another man. The house has a bad reputation; it is haunted and is in constant danger of being burned down by the evil neighbors. The story is nothing great, but it is told well, and the acting from Plummer was very bad. Williams was very good as the haunted house keeper and Turner was pretty good as a maid and housekeeper who knew nothing about ghosts. I thought that when they were out in the woods by the abandoned house, I thought they were being chased by ghosts. They were not. They knew all too well what was happening in that house, and they all tried to tell it to a young woman who they all thought of as pretty but not pretty enough to take the ghosts for granted. The picture was pretty and if a woman doesn't want to watch a ghostly film, I can't see what she is supposed to do when a woman sees the film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the first two episodes of The Strain on Starz and I'm very happy to say I enjoyed them! There is a lot of suspense and the acting was good. The actors portrayed very varied characters, ranging from normal people, a detective, a mafia enforcer, a doctor, a cop, a serial killer and a vampire. Each of them has their own distinct personality and the action was quite good. Unfortunately, the story isn't that good or original. You could tell the writers knew they wanted to make a vampire movie and they nailed it. Unfortunately the vampire part was really weak, especially the character of the vampire. I've watched the TV series which was good and I'll probably watch the movies. I guess I won't be watching the TV show anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst of the series is this one. The acting is bad, the writing is bad and the story is bad. The only reason I give it a 3 is because of the effects, which are pretty great. But don't waste your time on this one, it's not worth the time that it takes to watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When you look at the poster for the movie, the first thing that comes to your mind is a bad-ass chick kicking some Nazi-ish ass. The movie is a mixture of action movie, romantic comedy and sci-fi, and I enjoyed most of it. The special effects were very good. The only reason I can't give it a 5 is because the movie could be made better, but I'm afraid of the movie being ruined by people who are too cheap to do a proper edit.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  The worst movie I've ever seen, in my book.  It had an unoriginal plot, a terrible acting job and an un-caring, un-human lead. It was really just another story about a young woman who is married to a bad guy. Her husband, a baddy and a coward, was always a coward. He didn't leave a trace and when we get to know him it's clear that he's a good dude but he never got a chance to be bad. He had this nice girlfriend, a beautiful girl with blue eyes and perfect blonde hair and a perfect face that she always wore and she was a great kisser, but she was the perfect model for her husband. It's sad really! When things were going well with their marriage they were planning to go on vacation to a nice place but they were kidnapped by a group of guys who used some kind of mind control on them and now they are in a prison camp and it's going to be a tough time and if it is they're going to try to escape somehow or die horribly. It really wasn't interesting, and it wasn't funny. It reminded me of something out of a bad 80's movie and the acting was awful. They all looked so stupid, it was all very sad. I wish there was a way to get their husband out of jail so he could be killed instead of a death sentence, and then he wouldn't be so boring! I think they should have found a better way to go about it and that's the sad part about it. The movie was really bad too.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Flaming-hot blonde babe with a big fake ass plays a naughty sissy." If you were going to watch a movie that depicted what a good sissy is like, you should have gone to the right one.   A movie like this is good if your looking for an easy fun film to watch, to get you horny while watching all the hot sissies getting fucked good in their tight pussies and assholes.  This movie is very well made, the girls are all pretty hot and have great bodies, especially the slutty blond with the big fake tits. This is the only sex scene in the movie, but it was one that we had to get to the end after watching so many others. A movie that I would really recommend you to anyone who likes sissys and anal!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If your into films like Dredd or The Expendables, then I'm sorry it didn't happen with a different ending! It had the same plot as the first three films. An alien invades Earth and kills the President. He is then captured by the police. This is followed by a long scene of the police and the President talking to each other in a car. The President dies and is taken to a prison with a prisoner. The prisoner is revealed to be Dredd. Now a movie from the 1970s with the same concept and style but with a new story. The story starts out the same as the previous films. Dredd wants to get to the President but cannot. Eventually a military commander shows up. We then get a great scene with Dredd and the Commander. The Commander tells Dredd about a government operation where they are trying to bring Dredd into the government. This part of the movie is a bit boring. The Dredd has to deal with an alien that looks like his favorite character, Max Rockatansky. We also get some action scenes and a fight scene between the Commander and the Dredd with some blood. At the end Dredd is released, as planned. A really fun movie with a fun story.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******************** THE IMDB LANGUAGE: ********* ************* THE FILM LANGUE: ************ *************** ************* ************** *********** ******** ************ **** THE DRAMA: --------------------------- ******** THE PICTURE: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~~~ The film is a remake of a French "dub" of the same title starring a pair of "machines" (which is French for "things", and "maches" are French for the "machine gun" -- which is also called a "trench".    If you haven't seen the movie, you will be surprised at how much of the action you won't see. The French version is almost as bad as the American one, but it is a fairly faithful one.   There's a lot of talk about the "French attitude" toward "militarism."   The French army gets quite a reputation in World War I.  One of the soldiers gets killed by a shell (which doesn't explode) and is promptly buried under the mud.  Another soldier gets shot through the eye but walks out with the help of a "surgeon".  This scene is set in the French trenches.  The character, "Captain Leblanc", is a "dungeon" -- a military doctor -- who has been taken prisoner by the Germans.  He is tortured for days, and his captors try to make him an offer he can't refuse -- to become a doctor in the enemy army!   Well... if you can't believe a French doctor (or a French character) being turned into a prisoner of war...  Well, it's not hard to believe!  There are a few other "gags" in this movie: a wounded Englishman with a "fog" in the eye (which will be covered in a moment) and a French soldier dressed in a dress in order to get into the "right" war front.  So that's French humor! The film also has some scenes of "German" soldiers having a mock "battle" in a field.  In this scene, the German artillery comes "over the top" and the English troops get shell-shocked!  The Germans actually do this, even though they are shooting at the wrong spot.  After a few minutes, the "English" start firing at the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A mediocre, one-dimensional thriller that barely features the characters, the plot is as contrived and predictable as "The Thing From Another World."  This movie is a direct rip-off of "The Amityville Horror" (1979). It has the same plot: A family moves into a house haunted by evil spirits. The house has an evil spirit: a child that kills, burns, mutilates, and rapes all its residents and then kills its victims while they sleep, then eats their remains. When the police find out about this they go to the house and it has a very similar plot too, but it takes a different direction and the characters are slightly different. For example, in the Amity house a little girl was kidnapped by an evil witch and tortured but she is rescued by a boy, who later on dies in the same way. Also the Amness house has evil dogs too.   The movie has horrible acting, some bad effects, poor CGI effects, and some stupid special effects that make the movie almost indistinguishable from a 1970's horror film. The CGI effects are mostly poorly animated, and the actors in the movie don't even look like they could move well; they don't seem like humans in that they look like cardboard cut-outs.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like "The Thing", then you will like this movie too. But you need to understand one thing right now: this is not a good movie. It is basically a poorly done monster movie. The only thing we get out of this movie is a really silly joke about the monster coming for him. The humor in this movie comes largely from how silly the joke is. There is nothing in this film that is good, nor funny. You will find no suspense, no sense of danger or terror, no gore or blood. The movie makes a joke out of a monster movie, the result is a laughably bad film. I think this movie was made to be on a comedy channel, and I think the joke was too funny and too stupid to be of any interest at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie that was bad in every way. From start to finish it was a joke. The cast is pretty much just a bunch of people trying to make money and sell some crap out of it. All in all just bad all around.   Be careful how you vote:  "I was never happy with this film. This film is a terrible piece of trash and I would never watch it again. It took away the fun from my life, and is now going to be the only piece of crap I have to look at on TV."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'll admit to being a fan of  Lost Highway  and it's obvious why: it's great to be back in San Francisco, California after being away for so long. This is a fine,  entertaining  film about the San Francisco Bay Area, California in the '70s (or whatever it was.) It feels like a little episode of Mad Men. If you're a fan, then you know that it starts out as a  pretty standard '80s comedy, and slowly becomes a good time, all while being a pretty classic tale of drug runners, money, and corruption. It's also full of great characters, including some great, old actors: Alan Alda, John Heard, and a bunch of other really good people. What's really great is seeing the progression of the movie from its first scene, which is nothing spectacular or noteworthy, to its third and most important scene. The first scene is about a little girl, the second about a guy, and the third about a woman. I wish the movie was longer, so you could watch all of it! In the beginning, the main character, a pretty girl named Tilda (Catherine Keener), is a young, innocent, and very innocent girl. She's been in the orphanage since her parents died, and her father (Alan Alda), a former circus performer, seems to be out of work. His daughter Tilda, however, is very well behaved. She lives with her mother's boyfriend (Robert Forster), who she doesn't really like very much, and he takes the job of helping her and her mother. After a couple of weeks, Tilda realizes that the boyfriend is not the man her mother is talking about when she comes by and tries to run away with him. He runs off, and she goes with her friend Ann (Helen Hunt) to get away from him, where they meet up with their father's friend (John Heard). The guy that her father's been working with in the circus, who has been a friend of Tilda's friend Ann, is actually her father himself, and we learn what a miserable, pathetic, broken, and sadistic man he is. The guy is actually played by John Heard (The Last Samurai ) in a really weird, very old school manner. The film is actually a parody of the 80s, in a very tongue-in-cheek way. The two women are very sweet to the character of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's hard to say this is a bad film because it's good in many ways. The first act features a couple that get lost in the woods and need help to find their way home. There are nice effects as a man and woman get out of a truck in the early part and look very similar. But a short time later, they're seen getting back in, and a different man comes up to them. This man looks like a man in the old days, wearing a blue suit and a gold tie. He also shows them his house, then they've got a nice chat and then he's back home, very pleased with himself.   I've said before that The Shining is one of the greatest horror movies ever made, if not the greatest. I don't think you need me to explain that in my review at all. But it sure is an interesting idea, a man who is trapped in an evil house, only to find out that it's been sealed off by his wife to keep him away. He has two choices, stay at home to live a normal life or break out. The only problem is, the evil house is sealed shut, the only way in is a key, and the only key is in the woman's pocket.  : It's hard and it's very hard for me to rate this movie because it has a couple of issues, the story is so basic that it could have been a children's film. The characters don't really act like characters but rather as objects to be used. The women are the "object", their role is merely to get the man into a trap. The man is nothing more than a slave to his wife and their evil and strange ways. But the story has a few good elements.   the actors are decent enough, although one of them could have done more to stand out from the others. And the music is fine but nothing special. The ending is the most intriguing part of the movie, but it takes some doing as it never seems to work out.  , it's the kind of film that could have had a much better ending. It's not bad, but you wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you wanted to be spanked by your favorite horror movie. And if you do want to be beaten, do it this way, be beaten by the original The Shining (1971)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't understand why anyone would watch this movie, and especially not so late in the day. The actors who play the roles of the two leads have really nothing going for them in this film. We have a small man whose name is "Wonnier" who is a "Wanted" fugitive and was in the army for quite a long time. When he retired he wanted to do something for his wife, and she has a daughter who is now a grown woman (well, technically a teenager, but you get the picture). The two leads are pretty much useless, their names are Wonnier (who isn't even a good acting actor) and Zeya (who is good as a comic relief character). The script is really bad, and the film tries to be something different from what it is. It is really too boring, and I think that the reason for it is the writing. All the characters are really dull and we are never treated to any real action. I think the plot is stupid and that the film is nothing more than a long series of dull chase scenes. This is the lowest-budget Hollywood film I have ever seen in my life. I really don't think it has a chance to break out on DVD or Blu-ray, because it does not really deserve any sort of attention. And I have seen so much worse in my day.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an "I wish I had a million dollars" film. And it is a bad film too... It is bad because it is stupid. The writing is bad, the characters are stupid, and the plot is stupid... There is a "bad guy" and a "good guy" (who looks a lot like the evil character in The Shawshank Redemption... "And I thought I was the only one who couldn't see a big bad wolf in a man's face"). The bad guy steals money from a bank and tries to rob the house of his neighbor. But the "good guys" come along and save the day... with a gun. The gun? A crossbow... The bad guys gets scared away by the good guys. This movie is one of those "bad films" that you go back to over and over again because it isn't the worst. But it's not a good movie either! This movie also has a scene in which he kills a horse... The horse (that looked like a horse in the horseback riding scene in The Last Laugh... It sure looks like a big, ugly horse.)... Was not killed. It was just "kicked" away by him. It is like the movie is trying too hard to be funny, especially when the horse is just standing there, so it is "funny".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of this movie is good. It's a horror movie that takes place during the 1800s and follows a man named David as he travels the country trying to collect a bounty on a giant beast called a tarantula. Unfortunately, what this movie lacks in suspense it makes up for with a lot of goofy moments. It has a lot less horror than I expected (I know, I can be bad too). There's the obligatory haunted house (I think it's some sort of cabin) that David discovers as he's on the road, but it's also a little bit too obvious where it is and it just feels really cheesy. There's also some pretty good humor and some really funny bits of dialogue. The movie is still pretty short but it definitely has some good things to offer and the concept is solid. It really doesn't seem like a horror flick from the '70s but I guess it could work as one because there's no blood, gore or ghosts at all.   So, yeah, it doesn't work. The concept is pretty great and David is a great guy, but this movie ends up just being bad. In fact, it's pretty bad. If you're a fan of bad films, maybe it'll be a good time. In the end, it makes me wish there were some way to tell this story in a way that made it feel like a genuine horror film but I can't wait to see it when it comes out on DVD in a couple years.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, I'll start with the positives. I was expecting a "Moby Dick" on a small scale. Instead, "ParaNorman" is a big-budget version of a smaller-budget movie, and a really bad one at that.  I was disappointed in the whole production, which is the main reason why I went to see it, and that's saying something since I'm not sure how my expectations are going to be high when so many other films are already vying for my attention.   The story is pretty basic, and the cast are all either very one-dimensional or unmemorable. I couldn't remember a single thing they did right, except for the fact that the characters speak in the voices of very old people, which was a plus.  It's not good, and you can tell it was made on an iPhone.  At this point, there's nothing else I can say about it.

It really is no good, nothing much to say about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After all these years, my friend and I took a chance on this movie.   It's a very good movie.   The story is a little predictable, but it isn't as bad as it is made out to be.  They make you believe they're going to take you out on a nice vacation, but they never even let you sit down.  The acting is bad, and the plot is very simplistic and illogical.  I wish that they had changed some of the dialogue, it's very boring.  There's even some sex in this film and it's not very pretty.  This is not one to watch while driving.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst comedy I have ever seen!  It is a movie that looks like a bad TV series.  There is no chemistry between the actors, the dialogue is always the same.   I had to look up who all the characters are to figure out if I was watching a sitcom or a bad romantic comedy.  I guess you can say this movie had a "let-them-eat-cake" theme.  The worst part of this movie is that no one actually has to do anything!  The entire movie is a joke with no "hook."   If I wanted a romance comedy or a comedy then this movie would have been great!   The film is about two characters who find themselves at the wrong place at the right time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story follows a group of students who are trying to survive in the meanest school in the county. They are joined by the handsome Dr. Paul (Sam Rockwell).   We are introduced to Paul when a classmate is taken from him and we learn that he is going to get married. But when his brother shows up to help him with the wedding, the whole family goes to hell.   For instance, there is the wedding planner, an old, very fat woman in a black suit. Her husband is a bad man and there is not even a wedding planner to save her from his tyranny. And then there is Paul, who is just trying to live in peace and quiet when the kids are thrown into hell and the girls go to a school full of mean girls who want nothing more than to make fun of and beat up the boys.  .   The characters are not all bad. Paul has his moments. His friends are very well drawn. But the bad guys are all really stupid: the mean girls, the bad man (who is just an evil and mean old man), the rich guy, the boss, the crazy guy and the two crazy girls.   He tries to convince Paul to go back to the old way of life when he can get a decent job and not be chased around by his family or the girls and get beaten up and humiliated. But Paul refuses.   has problems with the director (Dirk Bogarde), who is very lazy, and his wife, who wants Paul to leave. She is trying to get Paul out of his marriage and Paul refuses to give up his old way. I think the film has a lot of potential and the story is very good. But I just wished the director would stop trying to be so lazy. He wastes a lot more time on trying to give a good story. The only thing that could make this film better is if it had a female actor.  's not a bad film, it just has a problem. It is a pretty good film. It has a good script and is very entertaining. The cinematography is very nice and it does a very good job of showing Paul's life as he tries to make it better. But this is just the beginning of his troubles. The film has too much sex (too much for a school movie), which is boring. I wish they would have at least told us in the film what the relationship between Paul and Dr. W. was like. Paul seems
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~ I'm going to get this movie out of my head for good now. This film is terrible! The acting is terrible, the direction is terrible and the writing is terrible. What happened to this film? The story line is bad too! The girl was raped, the father didn't try to save her, they never went to jail, they were never punished. The police did nothing, and the woman is always blamed for the rapist. I was not a big fan of the movie, but I would recommend against watching it just because of the bad acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful. As bad as most bad movies are. It's a film made by some idiot who thought he could put some "action" in a boring story. But he didn't.   The story centers around a young boy named Mike, who is kidnapped and forced to compete in a race of killer clowns. That's it. A story in the same mold as those silly TV shows where "there is a clown in the house" or those "he has a bad hair day", like the two-headed dog. The clown race doesn't have much to do with the real story. You really don't care about any of the characters besides Mike. They say he is the only human being in the world that would have ever thought to watch such a silly television show as this. And the kid is kind of a jerk to, and cruel to, everyone, which, I think, is the point. But I guess it's not that big of a deal because it is so short and there are plenty more clowns and races in this movie.   and they say you can never judge a book by its cover....   There is a pretty much empty plot. Just a clown race. A clown competition in the name of clowns (there is also a movie, but I guess they didn't have the time or money to get the rights). Mike is an average clown and pretty much just a goofball (not that there is anything wrong with that. I have a lot of fun with goofballs). He gets a "head" and is then forced to race against the others. It is so boring it's funny.   a good movie? yes. not a bad one. if you can't tell that, then you probably won't enjoy it at all.   this movie had so many stupid problems, and the film makers didn't even try to deal with them. Why not use the old joke about the two heads and then show two pictures of people and tell us which ones have heads and which ones don't? It makes perfect sense, and would have been very funny. But nooo, instead they do the most retarded plot-line and then put it in the middle of the movie to try to make it more interesting. What a waste. I mean there is so little plot and so much stupid stuff, I wouldn't even care if they just didn't try. A great movie would have just told us that the clowns aren't

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a very good movie.  This movie has a bunch of really bad jokes, bad acting, and some really bad acting that you just can't help but cringe at.    I don't know if you noticed but there is nothing funny about this movie. There is one or two things of the movie that really stuck out to me that I would like to see done better and possibly animated one day for all those folks who can't really do a good gag that would be great for the movie as it is now.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "It's the year 1983. The Cold War still rages on and a large war game is being played by the world's powers. As part of a US government covert operation, the CIA has rigged an exploding atomic bomb inside a Russian submarine so that it will explode inside the Russian Pacific Fleet.   The detonation sends a massive wave of debris to hit the Russian fleet in the remote Pacific Ocean, destroying it. The Soviets, not having access to a nuclear submarine, are completely unable to defend themselves, leaving the US to claim victory.  .  :) It's an interesting idea, but it really doesn't do much to enhance the movie, if you ask me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like this movie because it's fun.   It's funny and a little sad that all our heroes are stuck here in this country doing what people used to do before the Civil War.  There's no romance in this movie.  No love triangle here either.  In fact, the characters are pretty much identical to any other hero from a comic book or movie (not that I don't like comic books).  This movie is a little dry in places, but it's okay because it just does its own thing and it never tries to be anything more than its own little thing.  I'd give this an A-.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A really weird and strange movie! I was a fan of the book and have always wanted to see a movie adaptation so when this one came out it was great to see that it has actually come true!   I didn't enjoy the movie and it was not bad, but it wasn't anything I haven't seen before.   It's a strange movie and I think I'm just not that familiar with it.  A few people who like to read a lot of books will probably like this movie as a book.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. First off, the film is very poorly made. I don't understand why a director would make a movie this awful. First, it looks like a cheap rip off of Dredd. And then when you watch the movie, the people in the movie are clearly not people that were born with a set of brains. They have the exact opposite personality and behavior. This is a terrible movie that you shouldn't watch if you aren't interested in watching one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ __________________________________________________________ I was about to go to see the original Transformers movie when I heard this "new movie" was coming out and the previews were pretty awful. In the previews the Transformers were running around in a city that looked like Chicago or Los Angeles. You could actually hear the wind blowing from a helicopter. The whole "urban theme" was lame. I'm pretty sure this is an action movie. _______________________________ It's a good movie. I guess I'm glad it's finally come out on DVD. They should have released it on laserdisc like they did the first three movies. If this was on Laserdisc it would have been a great movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not a good movie, and it's definitely not an excellent one. It has a very interesting premise and setting, but it doesn't get very far.

He's going to be the star of his own film. In the film, he's going on a trip with his guitar band called The Young Ones and their manager. I didn't know why I liked the film that much but I did. The acting was fantastic with the most memorable being the kids who got caught up in the film's story."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I've seen this film and a bunch of other weirdo crap. This movie, in my opinion, is very similar to the others. It has to do with a group of women going around killing other women and eating them. One of the women goes home to her room to see her boyfriend murdered and she takes it really hard. She then calls the guy and tells him what's happening and asks if he can help her. He says he can't. The whole movie is the woman killing off the other women in a twisted way. All the women in it are dead with their heads cut off, arms cut off or having bits of meat shoved down their throat. I'm not sure what this movie is trying to say but it's not very convincing."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen the movie 3 times and each time has been so boring it has been hard to watch.

The good guys get there airship, and we go to a giant tree, which is actually a giant ship which is in a wreck. There are some good set pieces here and there, but overall there is no imagination and no fun.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    At the beginning of the movie, we are treated to a spectacular, stunning closeup of the young man's face, as he smiles for the first time in years. After he gets home, we meet a very disturbed little girl, who looks just like the mother from the original book. She is named Sally. She has some weird and mysterious habits. First she wakes up and runs away from her room, dragging the curtains with her. This girl runs away, which makes me wonder why? What is wrong with that? She then goes into a room that is empty, except for a box, and then she goes inside, but the room is not empty. The whole thing is somehow weird.   The next night she goes to a party where the young men are having a good time. The other girls from school show up too. They all go to the house to do some stuff, including a nice blowjob where they suck and lick the guy's cock. It is all done so well, that we end up thinking, "Oh, that was good, this guy must really have a good cock". Later on in the evening, we find out that he didn't really, and it seems he is going to be taken home.   in a very strange way, his mother shows up. She also shows up at the party too. She seems very out of it, and she is really sad about her son. She then comes into the room, and all these girls start doing some crazy acts on her. We then see the woman's mouth being put to her ass, and her ass to a pole, which we assume is a big, hard cock. We don't have much time to be disappointed when the girl pulls away, because she is very excited about it.   with the next day they go to a hospital where she finds a doctor. The doctor says that he has seen her before, but he didn`t know it was her. She takes a sample from a piece of gum and he says that it is sperm. She tells him that it was actually urine! He looks at it and says, "Well this would explain a lot." He then says, ""She has been in a coma since the third grade" - this is very strange. Now we finally learn why, Sally's mother is dying in that hospital. We know she is dead, but she is actually still alive, although very weak.  , but it is actually urine!" He then
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those bad films I love to hate because it is a film by two idiots with absolutely no plot and only a few decent bits.  At a festival it was presented as a "lost" German silent film.    I think this film was made in 1940 for Nazi Germany.  At a festival in a theater a group of German soldiers are shown how to fight and shoot by German ladies.  What is really disgusting is their shooting technique:  to stand in an angle and shoot into the side of the other soldiers without making noise.  The soldiers seem to be very uneducated and it is obvious they have never even been on the same street as each other.  When they do get a bit close they do not move a muscle.  I am really annoyed by this film because the ladies did not show any other kind of discipline than having them stand in a line and shoot.   This would have been a very dull film for a German audience. 2 out of 5.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's just a bad idea to shoot a movie on location in New Zealand's South Island. The entire movie seemed to come off as if we'd been sucked into a bad science fiction movie. With the exception of a few of the scenes, the film isn't even remotely interesting. There is not even one character that I could actually care about in this movie. Maybe that's why I found it so entertaining. What made it even more enjoyable was when the actors and crew played the scene as if it was a comedy. I am sure I'm not the only one who could see how this movie could have been a movie with lots of comedy and laughs. Instead it comes off like a bad TV movie, with some of the actors not even trying to act in this film. There are moments of the movie that were just too bad to be real. I have never seen anyone do such a poor job as actors playing characters in this. The actors would never make their characters sound like they spoke the way they did. I can think of only one person I could think of who could play this role convincingly.   One of the other actors in this was also really good at getting the audience to like them. The whole movie seemed like a parody of the horror genre. I was shocked that it was all so silly. At the end of the day this is a bad "movie" with an obvious bad script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The director, Andrew Kneeler, has put together an excellent set of actors but has done an awful job in the screenplay. He has made the film not only un-original and incoherent, but almost nonsensical in certain respects as well.   It is a film about a family of people who have moved to a new house with their mother, who is an insane ex-convict and has been locked up in a mental hospital for her crimes. As a family, the men and children are not allowed out and in many ways this family is a bit stupid. It's not as bad as the movie is being made out to be, it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth, and is not quite good enough to be good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I liked this movie so much more than the trailer, but the trailer was actually pretty accurate. You've got a bunch of old women, some in rags and others in fancy dresses. Some of the girls have names like: "Chapel" (or "Cafeteria") "Pow, Pow" or "Mum, Mum" and so on...the way in which this movie is set...and the way it is acted all add to the feeling that you're watching a bunch old women having fun (that was not what I had in mind...I like old women). And what fun they have! The best part was the scenes when they danced in the hallways or, more often, outside in the garden; it's a lot like the music scene in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (where we see a buncha old men have fun in the streets). And then there was a bit where some old woman (who, let's face it, was not very attractive) danced on a table, and some old men watched as she danced (which was very interesting), then all the old women went off to play with some children, or to do the kitchenwork, and all the men started to get pissed because it was just not their day. But we did not need a movie like this to find out we're not in West Texas. What a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A lot of movie are crap but this one will not pass. It looks like an old tv movie from the sixties, and it has a funny ending. I guess it is too early to tell who is the star. If you really like science fiction then it is a good movie and if not you will laugh. If the author ever read this review he would have to add: - I am amazed at the quality of the acting. It is all very bad in it. - The title of this movie is really cool and good. - It is fun to watch. - Not very funny at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was bad. It was written by Stephen King and directed by Tim Burton. It's not a terrible movie, but its characters have little depth and they are pretty much one note, in a bad film about a man who finds a little boy he has never seen before and gives him a home to live in. They do this for a child who had been in the woods. They don't find out the child is a werewolf until halfway through the movie, when they have to kill him. So the only reason it's not an outright horrible movie is that the character development is decent and the bad guys are pretty well written. I've read a lot of reviews that said there was not enough werewolves and the scenes that did have them were all so poorly done, it's pretty hard to watch even if you didn't know the film was a children's film. If you were a child and enjoyed this movie at the age you did when watching it, you probably won't like a lot more films about werewolves that you will see for a couple decades.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The last of the X-Men trilogy which also contains X2, this is a dull and uninspired film that feels like another X-franchise entry in a long line of bland sequels and one-hit wonders. As is the nature with X-men films, this follows the path laid out by the first two X-titles. As always, the X Squad is back, this time with Wolverine, Charles Xavier (Logan) and Magneto (James McAvoy). They are on a mission to capture and rescue Professor X (Piers Chalk), a scientist who has somehow discovered a way to bring a long dead mutant back to life. Professor X's body has been located in Scotland where a strange cult has erected a pyramid on a mountain in an effort to raise the dead mutant from the dead. The mutants that were captured in the previous film are the only ones left, including Charles, so Wolverine and Magnet can take them to Professor X. However, the cultists have now been kidnapped. The bad guys have been defeated and Professor X has been saved. With no more mutant criminals to deal with, the guys decide to head back to Logan's place. Professor Xavier is in a comatose state, his mind being controlled by some evil force, but that's another plot point in the film that never reaches fruition.   Wolverine is still a lovable character, but he doesn't feel as if he is being used and the scenes with him and Charles were just as generic as the rest of the movie. The plot is a big mess, with a lot of back story that could be filled out in two hours, but never gets resolved. I understand that it is the last in the trilogy, but I didn't feel that this was a good use of the characters.  In the final battle with the evil cult, Professor X is brought back to the physical world, but somehow has no memory of how he got there. As it turns out, he was not just put on Earth by another group of X-villains, but has been imprisoned here for eons. It doesn't take long for Wolverine to break into the underground prison and free Professor X, but the plot of the film comes to a head when Professor X makes a shocking revelation: he's been planning this entire time to resurrect the mutant known as the Beast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it had nothing good or amusing to show, except for the first half, which consisted of a bunch of people fighting in a field, except that it took quite a long time to get there; when they did, it was so noisy that it was almost impossible to hear what was going on; the characters were so stupid that there was hardly a laugh to be had; it was all done in very bad style and the direction by John Alcott was absolutely appalling.  I have seen several of these and the picture looks like something out of a bad film. ~~~~~~~~~~~
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was absolutely boring. I was laughing at the horrible dialog throughout the entire movie. The story is about a group of kids that get lost on the way to their soccer game. Unfortunately the movie takes place in a world of darkness and the kids are forced to flee from some dark creatures.  What can I say that hasn't already been said, this was horrible.  It is simply another excuse for poor lighting and horrible acting and animation.  This movie is even worse than "The Little Mermaid" which is a Disney film from decades ago.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are only a few things I can say about this movie, all of which I'm not sure they should be said out loud. First, the cast is one of the worst I've ever seen in my life. I've seen a lot of "talented" actors get cast in these movies, but that one is in a class by itself. The lead, the most beautiful woman I've see in my entire life, is played by Linda Hamilton and she looks absolutely awful. I had to laugh at some of the most laughable things she says, such as "I don't feel pain." or "I can see what's happening through her eyes." If I ever see this film again, I'll try to avoid looking at her eyes. Then you have a lead actor who is such a coward I can't stand him any longer. I'm sorry, but he's one of my least favorite actors ever. Not only is he too afraid to act, he also goes out of his way to avoid fighting in a fight, even when it's obvious he will lose. The dialogue in this movie is terrible. I don't know what it was about this director's script, but it is completely incomprehensible. It is a terrible script. For example: The guy who is chasing the girl tells his friend "I'm not going to be seen!" but then he just starts talking about how beautiful she is and how he wants to get inside her. So the friend runs off to get more help. Now this is supposed to be a thriller. If this director just spent one more minute making it believable that the guy isn't even trying to chase this girl, he might have had a half decent movie. The ending, though completely ridiculous, is good enough to make me want to see more. But seriously, don't watch this movie. I tried to finish it, but I couldn't. If you want to watch a film about a woman who wants to run away from her abusive husband, this is the movie for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this for my daughter at the drive-in when it first came out. We sat in the movie theatre and watched the first three minutes for fun. We all went to bed and after the third minute, I got up to put on the movie. Then my daughter got up and watched, and it was not much like the first 3 minutes, because she thought it was a terrible movie. Her comments on the screen were: "it's funny, because you know that a movie is bad". In fact, she didn't watch it the entire time. Instead, she came up and picked her sister up, and they watched the whole thing on the couch.   Well, the movie is not bad, but, it's very lame and not very good. It's a "comedy" about an author who writes a book to make money, and a woman who is the publisher. This woman is in love with the author. This is the beginning to a romance. At some point, the author falls in love, and then, she is very sad. Then, she decides to tell her lover how she feels about him. So she lies to her lover. Then she does, to her own shame, to the publisher, and she falls in the bathtub and drowns. The two friends who are the lovers do everything to save her, and the publisher finally tells the writer that she is dead.   (The friend's name is "Wanda" which is a woman's name with an "N". That is "Nell". "N" is a "no" in Japanese.)

I was expecting a more interesting, more developed villain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with The Big Chill is that there is no real point. It is a slow burn. It begins with the "big" story, of a kid who gets arrested for being in a car with two "furry" men, who were doing drugs. They go out in a limousine and are chased by a police cruiser, but the officers just laugh at them. That's about all there is to the film. There is a "troubling" scene where the police officer thinks the "furred men" are the "possessed" (in reality there was no reason to doubt them) and the film ends with some police cars chasing them. The film ends on a high note, with a "familiar" scene, though the "original" scene is completely different. The "furs" are an interesting concept. They are actually two brothers, both played by the same actor, which allows them to be "fused" together. The main "character" is a young woman, who tries to help the brothers, but her efforts do not seem to be very effective. However, the film is about the police who investigate this case (I'm afraid they don't seem to get any further) and there are some very strange scenes. There are many police cars, cars and cars. The cops do not respond in any predictable way when a crime is committed. I am not very familiar with the film, so I do not know why they go to such extremes, but I just found it very strange. This film was really poorly acted. Some of the actors are better at "realistic" acting than the director, who is also poorly acting, but when he is not acting he does a very "gag" and a "stupid" thing. And the film director is also acting. There are some odd scenes in the film where the actors use their own body to simulate what they are doing. It's a bit like a horror film, but at the same time I found it a little bit funny (I've never watched such a film before, or seen a scene where there are lots of body doubles), although it did look a bit silly. It also has a lot of sexual innuendo throughout. I can't really decide whether or not it's funny or disgusting. It may seem like one or the other, but for me it depends on the situation. I guess it depends a little. It seems like

If you get bored with it, then I have bad news: the end credits are a very silly joke, and all the jokes were completely unappealing.  Also, there are a couple of minor characters that are not funny. It's really bad and the only redeeming quality is the music, it fits the scene very well.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie about a boy who can't stop himself from killing people. That's the premise, but there's more wrong here than there is right. There are things in this movie that are so unbelievably bad that a movie that should be so bad can't even be called bad. I watched this in the theater, thinking that the director (the bad one) would try and make this into a B movie. Instead it turned out to be more like an F movie with some good bits thrown in. The action scenes are as cheap as the acting goes. The acting is very poor; all the characters are bad except for two characters who we are supposed to like. And of course the plot is complete crap.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! I've never heard of this movie, it was made in 1970 so it must have been horrible. The only good thing about it is the music.... the sound of the film is awful.... it is really cheesy...  I saw it at the cinema in Germany and when I first saw the movie, I didn't want to stay to see it. The sound was so cheesy, I wasn't able to follow the story. After seeing the last scene with the dog, I got very frustrated and started to leave the cinema, I had no interest in the film. After I left the cinema the director was talking to me about the movie he had done with an American actress. I thought the guy was nuts. The whole movie was like a big joke, I saw it once and then never again. I'm so sorry if you read this review, I'm sure you will like the movie..... sorry,  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: art.kub.de
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an example of lazy writing, that seems to be the norm these days. It takes a full movie to set the mood for a bunch of people to do nothing, with no idea what to do, and that's pretty much it, just wandering around the forest.  That's it, that's all there is to it. But a good movie is a story you'll come back to later, with more to it than what you first saw. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a good movie and is a great movie for the kids.  But the bad guys are a bunch of fools and the good guy is not very good. The movie has lots of violence and the boys are very mean.  I think this was a kids show.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this short film, I do not recognize the film. I feel as if I have seen it a hundred times and it is always the same.  I could have watched the film several times, but the more I watched it, the more it got worse.  What was so bad about it:    There were a number of things about this that were so bad.  The script was poorly written.  It was so much like it was a cheapie, like it had to be a horror because horror fans would love it and it has that sort of "weird" feel to it.   I don't know why they thought people would like it, because it was so generic.  Why were there not horror films on television that really scared people?  Why not have them put in a house or hotel that had a history of deaths?  What happened to the rest of the house?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________   I really hope the first two films I reviewed don't offend anyone. Both are fine examples of genre cinema (a little off, a little too long but fine), and if we were living in a time where more people saw films from Europe or Japan we wouldn't be having this debate at all. But we aren't, so what does this movie do in order to satisfy its audience? It does this by using a few scenes from "The Magnificent Ambersons" (a French film) to make a "British" film. We are given a very brief glimpse of a young boy, and a man (as we learn from the end of the film, he is a doctor). I know this sounds odd, but to me that is what it does, in order that we should learn about the young boy and his family and his father before we meet him again (in the next film). And as we all know that we don't meet him and his mother again (at least not in the following film), this is just so far from being a British movie. But to me it is the first film I remember to have been in the US that shows us an American town. In order to show us the American landscape it is shot with such a degree of care and so beautifully. I know, I know.... it is still a French movie, so it isn't possible to show the landscape and the mountains from every angle, but it still provides a wonderful picture. And then it gives us the character of the doctor. The scene is in one of the more beautiful parts of town. This is the last shot we see of the young girl and her father. They are walking along a road and he is looking out over the countryside. We get the impression that we are watching the end result of some great landscape in the distance. We see the sun set over the mountains, the horizon line is quite dramatic, the trees have been cut down, the grasses are green. I guess that's what happens when you work out the angle of a landscape in front of you. The doctor appears and we discover that he is wearing a white lab coat and a bright white apron. The Doctor tells us that his name is Dr. Jekyll (because he goes by the name of Jekyl). His purpose in this story is to help the young man with the death of his father. J. Edgar is quite well known among movie fans as the creator
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, I am really happy that I had the chance to be part of the crew. For the longest time I was very bored, it was a very bad movie and there were many stupid situations. The movie is really lame and I don't know how it was ever made. What a bad cast. I wish it would have ended because they didn't show any scenes I didn't like. The story is really stupid and it made me not want to see the next scene. A bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For once a man with a brain actually manages to put on a great performance, and his dialogue is perfectly executed, but in the end the film doesn't come off that great. He basically has an insane villain in a very uninteresting and contrived way, yet a few moments of genuine emotion from him is all he gets. The film is essentially just a bunch of characters on a boat going from city to city, but that's where the similarity ends.  I have to wonder why there wasn't a movie made with the premise of "this is a bunch of people stuck on a ship, trying to escape from one city to another, who find their boat can only hold 10 or so people at a time".  The film really comes off as a mess of characters who are all uninteresting.  The plot really is the best part of the film, but I just don't think it stands up.  There is a story in this, but it doesn't really hold up.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A horrible bad movie, not worth the time. I'm a big fan of the '50s sci-fi TV show "The Twilight Zone". As a teenager watching this film I felt very sad when this movie ended. The movie was good fun, but too long.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very bad movie about a guy getting mugged, and then being stabbed in the arm by an unidentified assailant. Very bad movie. This movie has a bunch of stupid dialogue, a bad storyline, a few pointless scenes, and a very bad lead actor (and a bad director) that didn't think at all of his lines, and even threw some of them in the wrong spots. The plot was to get the guy mugged so they could get some money from a bank to put into a boat and sail it to the Bahamas. The guy has a gun, and has a plan to shoot the guy in the head as he tries to grab his wallet, then get the money to the bank. I can understand the idea to shoot that guy. A guy who doesn't want to get mugged by a guy who is going to stab him in the face. That is pretty logical. But the problem is that the plot is stupid. Why would the bank want to give away money to a group of idiots that want to just mug some guy who thinks he's rich and leave him alone? It's just not that smart. Also, there are two bad villains in the movie. One of the characters says he's a member of the Black Panthers, the other says he just works with a guy named "Tuff" who goes out drinking with a group called "The Mob".  I'm not sure how the other movie is different from this one.  If you're going to do a movie like this, try not to use a guy with a gun. It's bad enough, and you can watch the entire movie for free on YouTube.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like the other reviewers I was pleasantly surprised with the movie and the quality of the acting and story. I found the story to be intriguing and well written but it did have flaws. A lot of the times the story seemed to take a long time to build and the ending could have been done with a few different twists. There is always a lot to keep you interested but sometimes things don't fall into place and it gets kind of annoying.   The story is about a young man who was a boy before he met his long lost father and the long time friend he has since lost too. They get back together and the boy and father get on.  I really enjoyed this one a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a horrible piece of work. The ending made me feel sick. I can't even begin to explain how horrible this movie is. I couldn't stand watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a poor movie. The acting is terrible, the acting is really bad. I did not like the lead character. It's like they saw a movie like "Gremlins" and decided to make it a horror movie. It has no plot, it's all just jump scares and bad acting. There is no blood, no blood or gore, the characters are ugly and the film ends with an explosion. I was just too bored at the end.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, this film is the same as the one I watched at a cheapy little theater in the middle of nowhere. Sure, it was the 80's, and the audience was pretty much just regular folks. It wasn't bad in the "I wish a black guy was in this movie" way, it wasn't so bad it was painful, and it wasn`t all that bad that it made you vomit in pain, but its a movie about a family on Christmas Eve, and I can`t even imagine what Christmas Eve is like in the South (not that it would be very comfortable to see a white guy in a movie like this, but...). The music was awful (a very old school, very poor quality stuff, which was so bad that people at the time thought I was having a nervous breakdown), and the story was basically just a glorified Christmas Eve commercial. There is one scene that is very memorable: a woman with her black boyfriend at the kitchen table, both of them drinking beer, and he says to her, "I`m really happy that I get to have a holiday with you". Then his friend comes home from work, and tells him the house is on fire, but the flames are on the ceiling and he can`ts see a thing. Then the guy goes into the living room and sees the flaming ceiling and starts to cry.   I actually would have preferred a little more "action" in the picture, I think the "firemen" would have been a lot more effective had there been a little bit more of a fire, I mean, they could just put out a fire with a fire extinguisher, and all that.  - December 21, 2010No Christmas.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was laughable at best.   It was like the script was made by a 10 year old.  It wasn't funny and had a boring ending.  There were so many things that went wrong that it wasn't even funny anymore.  The characters were all flat and the plot wasn't much different from other terrible movies.   Helpful a comedy.  I don't mean it was bad.  In fact it was a very good film.  So the story is about a girl who is an otaku and has to live with an otakus and who lives with her father.  But then her father dies and she becomes a yandere lol. That's pretty much it.  Her mother decides that she should live with her dad so she doesn't die, and then the other parents go back to otakukin.  Then the movie is a comedy with a pretty interesting plot.  A guy gets an otchan who is a hinan (little girl) and he decides to try to make her more popular with other otakutas.  This is where I am starting to dislike this movie.  You have a guy who is trying to make a hikin more popular and it's supposed to be a comedy right? Wrong.  First of all it's very boring and the jokes are all the same: the girl has a little crush on him, they do their little things, she falls in love with him but then he's an otkain, then she ends up in a hot springs and they kiss, etc.  When is there not any more jokes? When the movie tries to go for something more interesting it just falls flat on its face.  And I know there is some sort of romance in the movie but it's so bland.  What they did is put a girl together with a guy and have them be friends who are like brothers to each other and all is good?  This isn't a romance at all and it just shows how pathetic this movie really is. And when I saw the ending, I just went "ahhhhhh"  There is nothing really worth watching about this movie except the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The good: The great movie is a great example of a horror movie that has a strong focus on the psychological horror genre.   It has a great screenplay about a young couple that are having trouble.  A stranger has come to their small town.  It seems that the local authorities are out to get them because they are going to be involved in something that doesn't seem right.  If you want a good psychological horror movie you should definitely check this out. The movie has a very good pace that makes you want to get on with it.  Some of the scenes are very tense and are very dark.  The ending was not a surprise and I was very disappointed.  The bad:  The worst part about the movie is the terrible acting.  As soon as the movie started I started to feel sick to my stomach and the director had a hard time keeping the tension up during the movie.  I will say that it is not as bad as some of the other films I have seen and is much better than other psychological horror movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You could almost say that the director just wanted to make a good movie. However, he made a really bad movie.  This is one of those bad movies that could only be made with the use of a special effects studio. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not the best bad movie (I've seen some worse ones) or at least it's not one of the worse bad movies made.  This is the first time that I ever saw a bad bad movie, but then I think there aren't any bad bad movies.  This is an action movie, so the violence is not in the same category as, say, The Wild Bunch, but it is certainly a far cry from the kind of action movie I grew up watching, which, at that time, I was enjoying.  There are a couple of people in the audience who are in it for the thrills (and not for their brains), a few of them, anyway.  The film is not bad, just a bit too formulaic.  For example, when the police arrive at the location where the movie takes place, there's an ambush, which makes sense in the context.  It's not too much of a departure from other examples in the genre, such as the earlier movie The Wicker Man. The movie is also far too predictable, if the audience has already figured out what is going to happen when the two bad guys show up.  I suppose it's because of that, that I was expecting the movie to be better than it was.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason why it wasn't a 1/10 would be for those few moments where things were done differently to show the audience what the hell the movie was about. At this point in time this was the only movie they would make.   In all honesty you could give this a 2.0 out of 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only bad movie i've ever seen, except for the story telling it was a great movie. But the acting is a little on the stupid side (i don't know why he calls her the whore) but that's what happens when a guy's face is covered in blood. I'm hoping they make the movie on the television show "American Horror Story." I saw one about a nun who was a nun and went to confession. I love the nun.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horrible movie. I am not exaggerating. The only reason I watched this bad movie was to see this terrible actor. At least in the trailer he was cute. I hope he is not going to be in more bad movies. I really enjoyed seeing the movie but the ending did not make my life better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's an interesting and interesting experiment with a different approach. If you think about it, there is no reason why people would spend hours and hours of their lives to watch movies. A film like A Clockwork Orange is almost non-existent. And to make it even worse, you have to read the book to get the ending. So, to make a long story short: Don't even bother with this movie. 1/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________ ____________ I thought this was going to be a decent thriller but it is really not. It's pretty good if a bit overlong (a whole half hour, to be exact, with some of the best action scenes in history in this one). The setting is great, and the plot was interesting at the time, but the execution just didn't work out. The two major suspects are a cop named Nicky Lavin (William Katt, who's really good as a cop and a decent lead character), and his wife Bonnie. Both are good police officers who really care about each other. They even get married and have a child together before Nicky gets a promotion that upsets Bonnie. So after being with him for a while, Bonnie is really excited about getting married. Nicky's reaction to her is "I can't wait to spend that money," but Bonnie's not so sure. She's also worried about Nicky doing a lot of drugs and drinking alcohol. In the end, they decide to get married, but Bonnie does have some other ideas about Nick. So she tries to murder him, thinking that he can be used to kill her drug dealer boyfriend. And then the movie becomes a mess. Nick is a very good actor, but he has to come out and do his job. But the two best parts of the movie are the car chase scene and the final shootout scene. After a few hours of watching two characters have a fight, a car chase, and a shootout, the movie kind of takes a wrong turn. The best scenes happen when Nicky and Bonnie have a drink together, where he talks about his problems, and she just doesn't see him as a person to use against people. Also Bonnie's plan goes into overdrive. Nick kills an innocent police officer. It leads him to be shot. Then she kills her drug guy and gets caught. Then Nick's best friend shows up, takes over the drug ring, and kills Nick. As a result, Nick kills Bonnie, because Nick is still angry that he has been tricked into killing a good person. It just takes an awful lot of pressure off of Nick. Bonnie and Nick are two people we would like to have a good conversation with. After they reconcile and go back to being good friends, they continue to have good times and some of them are actually funny. They hang out at Nick's apartment and they try to be civil to each other after Nick kills her. Bonnie's plans don
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As for the plot, it was an afterthought for a movie that had no plot of its own.  And that's why it failed.    The one thing that made this interesting was the music...and the music had some redeeming value as well, but that's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very bad movie and is made worse by the fact that a good movie has to be made out of it. I never liked the whole idea of the film. It is an hour and a half long. The story starts with a trucker that has just finished a long night and is sleeping off a good night's sleep. He gets up in the morning. The day is still bright and clear. He looks over at his old rig and decides to get out of bed to do some work on it. So he goes to the place that used to be the railroad town of Bakersfield. It looks beautiful. There is the old school house. There are the trees. The fields are in bloom. There was something in the air. It has to do with the old railroad towns in the central plains of America and the time when the train drivers were real men. All of the sudden the trucker wakes up. His truck is parked next to the old man's house. In the truck is a woman and she is still asleep. He calls her over and has sex with her. He takes out his tools and starts cutting out the old mans front door. He tries to fix it but it does not work. So the truck starts rolling out and hits the old men truck in front of the house. The house catches fire and the old truck explodes. The old man dies in the explosion and his house burns to the ground and he is not the only one who lost his home that day. There were others there too. The trucker is burned to death in front the old people house and his truck does not even break a sweat. I would not buy this movie or anyone would buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this movie I didn't even know if I wanted to see it. It had a bunch of bad acting, a weird story line, some poor special effects, and bad acting. However, it's still worth seeing because of a very strong ending, especially if you liked The Big Lebowski.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I do not own any of these things.     The movie starts with some cool shots of a small space vessel with its three crewmates and two robots, being chased through space by a bad guy, called "Cerberus." The spaceship crashes, and all three crewmembers, except for one, die. The bad guy escapes. (He is a real bad dude.) Cerberus makes a hasty retreat. As he tries to escape, he turns to the pilot to be a little helpful. The pilot, by the way, is played by the same guy as in the old Star Wars and Raiders Of The Lost Ark movies, and the crew's names are all the same:  So that's why all the crew is killed, right?  Cerberis is a very sad guy. He is supposed to be the pilot of the spaceship. But he gets killed on the job. So he is supposed be dead, and now he's got to live the rest of his life with this robot. But all he cares about is how to get his "little buddy," (that's not how it goes with the pilot in the story, but all you need to know) to come back and get the spaceship back together again. So the robot is a "fool" and is a constant pain in his ass. His name is "Ceiling." He is the worst little buddy of all time.  What's worse, Ceiling is very stupid. He doesn't have a clue what he's doing. He keeps forgetting to make his fuel, or he forgot to do some stuff for his fuel (or he's a little dumb, and that's what he is). So he keeps running out of fuel and all he does is complain. So Ceiling gets a bad report card in school.      He's a very selfish, and stupid, little robot.  It's a pity that all the cool-looking special effects are in CGI (no I'm not making this stuff up), because it was a nice looking space adventure and a great script. There were lots of cool scenes in this film that made it one of the funniest films I've ever seen in a long time. And the script was good enough to make you feel like the characters were real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think you should be more aware of the context in which a film is produced, in which it has to compete with the likes of Batman, Star Wars, Harry Potter and the like. A very good movie, but an unnecessary one for a man who is not able to do good in his life, and who is being watched over by a wife who is a good actress. This movie is not a bad one at all. It could be much better, if it was a bit less boring than it is and made use of its own plot and characters in a slightly less contrived way, but I can't think of any way to make a better one, unless it's to add in a lot more sex and bad jokes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As the title suggests, the movie is a short movie of a short film with a simple story, and a very unoriginal story: a guy wants to get his girlfriend drunk, so she will have a good time with him (after all, how can you not). As in most short movies, there is very little going on besides this simple, basic premise:  I didn't see anything special about this movie, though the soundtrack is a little bit sad.   The story is fairly lame: a group of friends go out on the town to celebrate a party that is a surprise to no one, while the guy is out working on his tractor on the way to the party. One guy has to drive the tractor around, and another guy is to sit behind the steering wheel and be in charge of the steering.  The guy gets drunk, the other dude drives the tractor, and the guy gets sick, and then the girl sees that the tractor has a flat. But the girl doesn't get drunk; rather, she's kind of bored with her day off, and so she wants to do a little something else.  The scene is typical "good boy" humor: a goody goody boy wants to help the girl out and he helps by providing a lift.  And then there's the car chase: a couple of cops are following the truck, but the truck drives off into a ditch, and there are two of the cops in pursuit of the truck. The chase begins...and ends in a shootout with the cop that's following the tractor.  But that's not the end of the movie: later on, the guy wants a second drink, and he's willing to pay $5 for it. So the guy offers to drink another drink for the girl. When the girl asks what the "second drink" is for, the man says it's because she is in the hospital and he doesn't want her to come home sick. And so the girl gets drunk again, and when the guy gives the girl a second beer, she gives him a third...and the third has been spiked with a chemical that causes her to black out and start bleeding to death (I thought that was a nice touch).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Crazy how this movie is trying too hard to get a rating of "Horror"  but the only scary part about this movie was that the story was just so lame!  I saw this movie at a local haunted house on Halloween.  It was such a cheap scare that I was just laughing! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, they decided to have the hero, as the title suggests, ride on a dragon, a rather bad idea. A dragon is an enormous winged creature, and they decided this would be a cool and powerful creature to ride on for an adventure.  The only problem is, they did not go with the right story. Â Basically they are flying a dragon around to collect gold, and the dragon is trying to fly down into a lake.  The plot:    The plot is a bit long, to the point of being a slog.  The movie starts with two kids riding a dragon (or what looks to be a dragon to me) which they want to ride to the edge of a lake to collect some gold from some pirates.  Unfortunately, the dragon gets separated from the dragon riders (and one of the kids gets the gold!), gets lost, and eventually gets caught in a storm and ends up being stuck down there.   Then the good guys decide to try and rescue the kids by using a bunch of magic spells and the sword of a fallen warrior (who is, as it turns out, really a guy who was an immortal god who was trapped in a cave by evil demons who want to eat him and turn him into a pile of dust).  I won't mention too much about the plot, but the point is, the story is pretty lame.  It doesn't help that the movie makes it appear that the dragon does have all sorts of super powers, so when it gets separated, there is a lot of flying, and doing a bunch more running.  If you really enjoyed the movie, try to ignore the fact that it is bad.  I gave it a 4 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ When I saw the first "Frozen" song, I thought "Oh God, this movie is going to be a huge disaster!" I was wrong about that. It's still a pretty mediocre film and I'm kind of hoping Disney doesn't release more of them because I'm sick of seeing this stuff! The story starts off alright but by the end of the second act it starts to go downhill. I didn't really like the lead characters, but I felt like the writer of this film really didn't know how to write a romance in this movie, like it really didn"t feel like there was enough passion and chemistry between the characters. I really hated the story at the end, it feels rushed and I wish it had been finished better so the characters could have been built more on what they did in the beginning, which was pretty pointless. And I don't feel like they did much to make the plot more interesting. I would've liked more romance development between Anna, Elsa, and Olaf. The story is okay, but nothing special.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Came across this on a website after hearing a horror story about a girl named Lizzie who was killed in a train wreck in the movie "The Train". Not the best movie for a young teen to see, but it is the first time I've seen a killer clown movie in a long time.   What do you get when you mix a good killer clown with a teenage girl? An ugly young girl who likes to kill.   The only way I can sum this film up is "Boredom mixed with sex, with no real story". At no point does she act like a teenager (she's 17) and there's no real reason why she's out killing random people with a chainsaw.   the clown only exists because of her name. It is very hard to keep track of when the clown kills his victims, and when it isn't, you feel like it doesn't matter.   This movie seems to have been made with little to no thought or effort put into it. I guess when your trying to be a horror movie, you don't really make it a great one, but you also don't need to be anything special.  ...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not bad, it just is bad in a bad way. The story is just so simple and you can't really see anything new in it. I don't really know what happened there. I guess maybe it's a movie made before or after the TV show. There is just no reason for this movie to be so bad. It's just a boring story about a guy who is obsessed with his sister and can't take his eyes off her. I just wanted to leave the movie as soon as I got it. It has really bad acting, bad acting is everywhere. The girl is just as stupid as the guy. All I have to say about this movie is that it's just plain bad. This is one movie that I can't recommend.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is about a group of people who have been transported to a land called the Land of the Sun (or LOTH, depending on which version you read), which is a utopia and a land of plenty where everything in society has been perfected. So everyone lives in a perfectly structured society where everything is perfect and free from any sort of violence and strife. One of the protagonists, a guy named Gertie, is a bit of a loner and he has a problem. Gertis' dad is a big shot, and the town thinks Gerti is his son. Gis has a very strong connection to his dad, and when Gert's father gets in some trouble, Gert has to get involved.   Well, I never really knew about any other version of LOTH before seeing this movie, and this was not a version I had read about. The only book I had ever read about LOTH was a book from the '60s by Dr. John Coleman, which was pretty terrible. It was written by a guy with some really weird ideas about the place, which are basically that there are two continents on each side of a big ocean. People on each continent live in a different culture, and basically everything on earth is the same on both continents. In the LOTH books there are only two peoples, the white humans, who have perfect lives, and some other races of humans who live a much more "savage" existence. They aren't supposed to use weapons and aren't considered to be very intelligent. The LOTH book also had some great descriptions about the landscape of Loth, which is all very peaceful. But in the movie there was a few things that bothered me. The book was supposed to be from the point of view of Gert, but we get this one character who is supposed to represent the whole world, but not the one who is the most intelligent or the most in touch with her environment.  , about five years ago was an amazing book by John Coleman and the best thing about it was the description of the Loth. But it was written in 1969 and there were some things missing. Like the "southern lights". And a bit that bothered, but wasn't really a huge thing.But I still thought the book was really awesome. Coleman is a really nice writer, and his books have been re-published a few times and they are still interesting and interesting and he writes about the real L

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie "Rambo III" has an excellent soundtrack. This is the same guy who does the soundtrack for the movie "Kazaam" and he does great things here. I believe he did an awesome job as a composer, it was soooooo much fun to listen to his songs. I like the music so much that if I ever make a movie that has great music like this one, I am going to use the music on the soundtracks in my movies.   There is a point in this movie where all of the bad guys are lined up and ready to shoot the good guys in a fire fight. This was soooo stupid and fun. I mean, if they could see this, they would realize how lame it is that people would play a fire fighting game, with real guns. The only reason this scene was included in the movie was because we have a guy shooting a gun and he has to be "killed", the way these guys think. If they would have just shot each other, it would have made the movie a lot funnier.   a bad story:   I feel like the guy who did this movie really did not know where to start with this story. The movie is about a good guy from a small town and his big brother was trying to come to his aid after he was beaten up, kidnapped and raped. They end up on a boat to go to some island that this bad guy's brother was visiting and to his surprise, all the bad people on the island (there were more bad people in there than there were good people in the whole movie) want him dead. They beat up the good guy's sister. This bad guy, who is the main bad guy throughout the whole thing, wants to beat the good buddy up as well. The good guy and the guy's bad friend, who were in love with each other for a while (they were both in love) try to stop him from beating the bad guy and they end up in a fight with all the big bad guys, who are all there to kill the good dude. This movie has a lot of bad people who do bad things to the good. But the good people try to do their job and save the bad dude.  .     In this movie, I never thought the good friend was the main good guy. I never liked this guy. He was a bad guy who got what was coming to him and did not even try to escape and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie opens with two beautiful women (a hot blonde with blue eyes and a redhead with red hair) in a very large room. There is a table in the room and a bunch of guys are sitting around it. The two beautiful ladies walk up and sit down in front of the table. The one blonde sits on the left side of the two redheads. The other blonde sits in the middle. The blonde woman, a great looking brunette with a pretty face, starts talking to one of the redheads (actually, it's two different people) and then suddenly the table is thrown open and out walks a black girl with a very thick and extremely wide black mane. She's about twice the size of the blonde and has very huge breasts, the redhead's breasts look like dildos. The mane she is wearing is actually a long pony tail and the two women look at it. They notice each other but don't really talk to each other because the other two people just kind of stare at them. They sit down at the table and just stare. Eventually a guy with a big, red, long nose walks over. He's a fat, old man with terrible health problems. His red nose isn't long, but it's definitely a pretty huge nose. Anyway, the fat man starts to talk to the blonde woman about something. He has some kind of accent and there are a lot of words he says that the blond never understands. Eventually the blonde can't take it anymore and she walks over to the other redhead and starts trying to ask her a question. The redhead just sort of stares at the blonde, looks her over with her big, black eyes and then turns and walks away. When she's gone the blonde sits down on the far end of the room. As she sits down she's got her head in her hand and she stares at her fingers. After a while she gets up and walks off. A few minutes later we get a shot of the woman and she is still staring at her hands. The camera then pans to her right side where the second blonde woman has her head turned and her eyes are open wide as she watches the blonde. About a minute later the woman in the center sits down. The old man on the couch is still seated and it seems like he is asleep. The scene ends with a shot showing the two people that were sitting together for a while. The second girl stands up to take a closer look and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why they used such a clichéd ending in this movie. It reminded me of a scene in a cheesy movie that was about a guy who had an accident and his girlfriend was killed in a car accident. He never talked about it till a friend said it on the news and that's why he can't bring himself to talk about it anymore. The movie ended like that. In this way, this movie is a cliché. I'm just glad it was only a short one. It was like a short movie for a horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have no idea why a movie is so bad it could have been made by a school teacher named Mrs. T with a very cheap smile but it's not bad.  It's a lot like a big bad wolf who has been stalking your family for years and this time you're supposed to save the day and defeat the bad wolf!  The plot is a long winded, rambling mess of a film in which I felt my attention wane for long periods of time, I thought I was going to cry and eventually it would go down hill.    The movie starts with the wolf waking up.  A little girl is singing, the wolf just sits there.  So you've got a kid who was being eaten.  It's a very good movie.  What makes this movie even worse is that the wolf would eat anything, not just children.  I guess I didn't like the film too much.  No one could figure out where to start, if the bad guy is supposed to be Mr. T, if not why would the wolf want to eat him in the first place, and when the bad stuff finally does happen how does the wolf even fit in with the whole evil-good thing.  At one point the wolf says something like "I'll show you a real friend" and we're supposed be happy!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To his credit, Don Siegel's "Krazy Kat" is a very enjoyable B-Movie. The film is basically a "bad" comedy, but it's a well-paced one. It's pretty bad in its badness, but if you're looking for something silly and fun for a little change, this film is pretty good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not a bad film, but I'd have much rather have the movie be about a "real" war (and there wasn't one), and not about this particular one with all the silliness and silly actors.  It is like a "regular" war movie in which no war is really fought, and everyone is just shooting the breeze and talking, but then the war breaks out and it turns into an actual war where you can see all the real blood and real deaths, not to mention the blood of your own men and the children.     One of the greatest things in this movie, and maybe only this movie ever will be, is the way in which the two soldiers that are captured and are being kept in the camp, a "convoy" of prisoners, do a "revenge" for their murdered commander.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies of the year from one of Hollywood's worst-ass directors. So many bad movies in a row with these "talented" actors. And now, we're supposed to like this? Is this a good film, or are we supposed to be in awe, like a little boy who gets his mother's car when he's born? Why does this film have such a bad track record?   Yes. It is a bad film. It may be one of the most uninspiring films of the decade, and it will make you feel something like a teenager feeling old, when you can barely comprehend that it is bad. Not just bad-bad, but just stupid. It's so bad it is a joy to watch, but the fact that the director was able to put a decent film together just by borrowing from the work of others is a major sign of why it is so bad. Don't waste your time watching this. I have no idea where the idea for this came from, but no, it doesn't work.   And then, there's the acting. Seriously. The acting is just so bad and so stupid. In this film, there is a character named John and he's supposed to act like a 17 year old. Well, he gets all the lines, he's allowed to do everything and he has to talk like a 14 year old for all of 10 minutes. He acts like a 12 year old, but is given lines! The only characters who are older are the main character and the lead actor, and they are clearly a bit older than 16-17. How about the character named David? He is 14 years old, yet he plays a very stupid 14 year-old. If this was a "real" movie, they'd have had real adults in the roles! And you know what, we'll even throw in the actor who plays the "younger" girl in the movie, but he's not even that good, either!   You'd think that a film that was a big budget of, like, $300 million would at least put some effort into making a good, believable movie with actual acting and believable characters, but it just doesn't even manage to do that. I actually had to watch this film to figure out what was actually going on! All of the dialog is just stupid, the acting is stupid, everything is stupid! The "plot" is the kind of stupid that only
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I guess I'm a sucker for the '80s movies. I'll give it a 3 out of 10.  The acting is pretty bad too.   The story takes place at a small motel (now a funeral home) in the small town of Rockford, Iowa.  In the early 90s, a young man named Mike is shot and killed by two other young men (I guess they were his friends) outside the front window of the funeral home (which I guess is just a funeral parlor).  I guess he was too good for them and had no friends. I don't think I need to tell you what happens next.  The movie is kind of like a movie about a guy who has gone missing and is going to stay there for the rest of his life.  But if you really want to know what happens in the movie, I would recommend reading the book instead.  I'll leave it at that.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful. It feels like a cheap attempt at a parody of a low-budget action movie and it falls well short of the mark. The characterisation is poor, the plot feels completely unbelievable and the acting, while good, is at best pretty laughable. The ending, while very predictable, is a nice finale. A shame that the sequel is even more disappointing. 5/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful, and it never gets good! The main character is a wacko, and she has some kind of "cute" dog. I don't think I've ever seen so many dumb animals on screen in one movie. It is an action film! The villain, Dr. Fung (a Chinese doctor) is portrayed in the movie as a very bad man. The director made a movie full of action scenes, but the hero, Lucy (Bridget Jones), is a ditsy girl. She just wants to be friends with a guy named Charlie (Bruce Lee), who is also a doctor. However, Lucy must go to China to have the operation done, and Charlie thinks Lucy and him are in love. Then, a strange group of people invade the country, and they are out to kidnap and kill Charlie. It's just a lot of action without any real story in it, and the main villain is a very lame villain, and his evil plans and methods are ridiculous. It was very annoying, because every time I thought the movie was about to get good, the director would change the movie. He makes it better every time, and every time he changed a scene a different way. He also changes some of the names of characters to obscure the fact he didn't want to reveal the whole story of the movie before the credits, so it's never completely clear what the heck is going on. If you want some good action without a lot to be angry about, then it might make a good movie, but this isn't it! (10/10)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'll preface this by saying that I didn't watch this until I had an opportunity to see it with a fellow movie goer who had seen the film a few times over several years. I will say this: The characters in this film are absolutely despicable. They are all absolutely despicable! Every character in this movie is despicable except one: The girl that wants to be a movie star. She is a perfect foil for this poor, clueless, girl trying to get the lead in a movie that is just plain terrible. I didn\'t realize that they just put this girl in the movie at the beginning. I thought, "There's gotta be something funny about a girl trying her darnedest to be the girl from the movie \"A League of Their Own\"!" The plot doesn\'t work either. In the beginning they are talking about how some movie star has died, and they decide to put together a team of movie stars to try to get back together. Then they don\'t have a clue that all their members are horrible liars, and not even a little bit good. In one scene the lead actor in the lead role (played by a horrible, terrible guy) says that his character isn\'t very clever, and he didn\'tis a terrible actor. Then after everyone has said this a few more times, he says he has to go home because he\'d have to work. He is the only guy in the whole movie who\'s not a total idiot, and the only reason he hasn\'t killed everyone and ruined their movie is because he doesn\'tis too stupid to be that bad. The entire cast is completely despicable, and that is saying something. I don\'tis as if they thought they could just put a bad actor in a horrible movie. I really didn\'ts expect anything from a movie like this. There is a scene where the lead character shows up in town wearing a dress. I had this image in my head of some girl in a bikini or some hot babe who was a star in the film or something, when I looked at the actress in the dress. It didn\'tt have a "A League Of Their Own" theme to it at all. It had nothing to do with the movie! The whole movie was a mess, and this horrible movie that I wanted to hate so badly had me smiling the whole time! I\'m still laughing at the ending scene of the movie. A man comes out of the woods
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was quite shocked to find out that this was a remake of the 1950s-60s TV movie  "G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero." The show was about a bunch of soldiers from all over the world who had been sent to a small North Carolina town to help the local sheriff put down a criminal gang that was planning to blow up some train tracks and kill as many people as possible. However, this did not end up being the case, and we all learned to keep a straight face as the Sheriff, who was played by actor, Steve Martin, began to lecture us about what we are doing here and what the government is up to. He also explained in much detail to us the various weapons we were to be issued with, which is why he was in such a good mood when the villainous commander, played by Frank Gorshin, walked in with his six foot-long chainsaw. The bad part about this re-imagining of a popular 1950s TV show is the fact that the movie had only 3 minutes of actual action on screen and we are told by the producers that this is to be done on camera (in order to justify the budget) so we have to endure over 25 minutes of a bunch more speeches. So, in other words, most of the fight scenes are taken from the original show. There are some great visual effects done by the Hollywood film-makers and the special effects of the original TV show do look very cool at times, especially during some of the close combat, but as a movie-goer I was expecting some more action than just a bunch speeches. The one real "wow" in the film was a scene when a mob of children was throwing rocks at a GI Joe, who in his trademark blue uniform with gold stars on his shoulders ran back and forth, throwing rocks back at them. If you know anything about the show "G. I. Joe," you probably can imagine how pissed off this little gang of kids would be when one of them got a rock in the eye. However the real reason this movie is not up to par is because of the characters. There is some funny scenes with the main characters who were played by actors such as George Kennedy, Bob Dorough, Richard Boone, George Peppard, and Dick Powell, but they are hardly given much to do and their characters seem to have been written with little thought about making any kind of a story or drama to go along with

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is not a good film at all. I do not get why anyone would want to watch it. If it's good enough for God to send me to earth to save the Earth then he can keep it. This movie is bad! I thought the last one was bad too. But this time it is worse. It is boring, lame, dumb, and I mean REALLY dumb. The movie is about a man that gets transported to earth in a rocket ship. He takes a shower (no we're not talking about the big shower in the sky here), does some stuff, goes to his car, then gets back in the rocket, goes in to orbit (I know, I know, it is an orange planet), then comes home and he has to go get some gas for his car. All this takes all of 5 minutes. This was a dumb movie. It was like watching the dumbest of TV shows (see what I did there?). In fact, the movie seemed to be made by a person who had never seen a TV show before and had nothing to do with this. For example, how does this guy get around? This guy is in a big green spaceship that is surrounded by lots of huge alien creatures that he must battle. That is it. All his adventures take place in that one spaceship. There is no other planet, no water (there is water on the planet but that's not a problem for him), no other animals, no trees, no life. The plot was ridiculous and uninspiring (like many other movies from this era). Why would a man be in space with nothing to show for it. Why would anyone want to go there? There was a scene where this movie got so boring that it really was unbearable. What's worse is the movie was over before it even had a chance to tell you anything about anything. In the end there is this guy going back home and his wife is waiting for him to pick her up from the grocery store, and in the back of the grocery they see a "ship" that looks like a huge flying saucer. They get on board, everything goes fine, they get to their car, and his car is shot down on the way down by a UFO (why would a woman have a car in the middle of outer space? Why? Why!?!!). A few more minutes of dumbness and then they're home! They're home and they have a TV. I really don't want
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So i was about to call this review a rant for it, so to do that i can't even use the words "awesome" or "stupid," or "terrible", because i was a little pissed that the movie came out like this. This movie takes place mostly in a house that some guy owns.   It's not an expensive house.  I watched the whole movie without missing a moment.  Now i'm going to tell you the reason i'm pissed about the movie, and the reason that the reason why the movie wasn't good: 1. The whole movie is nothing like the book.  A few minutes into the movie (i think) i was like "Man this is way different than the book!" i mean the first minute the house is empty, it looks like it's going to collapse, i think it is the end of the world and the guy goes out and it's a huge mess, so much that its the first time i ever saw a house like that.  I thought the house was cool though.  (i never read the book, so i'm guessing he did the movie and the book were filmed at the same time).  (the reason why i'm saying that is because i thought this movie takes off a little from the beginning because i expected something more from the ending than what happened).  The guy decides to fix the house (by the time you get to the end i mean) by throwing it away and building a new one.  Then he builds a bunch of stuff.  The whole thing looks a bit like the movie "The Shining".  And i mean that in a good way, it has that Kubrick-esque, dark atmosphere to it.  But the most bizarre thing about this movie is that it's really not that well written.  It takes place over two years.  There's not a real plot, all the characters are very different.  Some of the characters do things that make no sense.  They're all so stupid, they just have no idea what's going on.  So what I'm saying is that the book is a lot better written than this.  And the best part is that at the very end there's a twist (which happens to me so many times when watching movies)  Which makes the whole plot even better.  This is the very worst film i've ever seen, a true work of art. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are some movies that are made only to be forgotten as quickly as possible. There are other movies that were made to be remembered for a long time. " The Lost Legion " is one of those movies. It is made as a historical drama, which was an idea to make a movie about a small French Legion which had been defeated in 1744 and who, in 1751 was captured by the Russians as a prisoner. For me the only good part of the movie is the film.   One day the French soldiers came into camp which had not been repaired for a very long time and started to work. They were allowed to work under some conditions. For example, they could work only on the land that was already covered with snow, so they did not have to dig anything. The soldiers who were tired out from long and cold battle were asked to watch the Russians being attacked by the French. At first the French behaved very nicely and the Russians did not attack them at all. But suddenly they started to fight each other to the death, which caused a lot of problems between the French and the Russian soldiers. But in the end both the French prisoners of war and the French who were captured by Russians was able to escape to the Swedish King Charles XIII's country. The film is mostly in French language but the Russian script was really good and I remember the characters very well.  The story was not really historical but the character of the Russian prisoners of War had more impact on me than the French troops did.  This film is probably one of the most famous movies of 1970s in the world because of this film alone. You can see some interesting and good scenes in this movie that you just will never forget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love this movie! It is an action packed movie with lots of stunts and awesome fights. The plot is pretty standard and there is some plot holes in the movie. The movie also has some cheesy lines such as "Whoa! Whoa!" "You know what I call that? One of those movies where the dude gets thrown around by the bad guys!" and "Oh that's a nice butt! Lookin' good!" The characters in the film also have a certain type of chemistry and some really good lines. The soundtrack is pretty good as well and the movie itself is well written.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending is horrible. It has the potential to be a great movie but it was just bad in all the wrong ways. If a movie is bad there is a way to redeem it but this wasn't it. It didn't redeem itself for me at all. It was boring and slow and really not much more could be done with the plot. It really felt like the writers wanted to make a movie about a group of people who are on the road to find someone they are meant to marry and they're all going somewhere, but then they stop and the characters are stuck. It's just a bunch of people that are stuck and the ending was just a joke.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming quality is this:    This is a movie about a couple of young men who have a very unusual relationship with one another and who are really into each other.   The problem is that they are never really together and they never really have a chance to get together.  In a nutshell they have a really awkward relationship with each other where they are totally oblivious to anything but sex.  When you get to know the characters then it gets much stranger.  The best thing is that it seems that the guy from the movie is really into being a gay guy.  It is very weird and not very attractive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was disappointed with this movie. The acting was weak (it was just a bunch of people who were all playing their parts). The plot was weak. The story wasn't original at all.   This movie was supposed to be a sequel to the movie The Matrix, and it was a sequel in that the original had a more profound storyline. The Matrix did not have this much depth of plot.  I didn't like this movie in any way.  If you've never seen the first Matrix movie, I suggest you watch it first and then go watch this movie, as I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only positive thing you can say about this movie is that it is not made by the same people who are now making the remake of "Ender's Game" (which I really do not like, it is a different story with no Ender and no magic, no aliens and the movie is a poor remake). In this movie we have our heroine (Dwight Schultz) who is a normal teenager who gets caught up in a game, the game is called "The Game" and it seems to be all about survival. She is on a quest for "The King", who is supposed to be a magical creature who gives his powers to whoever is with him. Her quest is to find the mystical object called the "Lily of the Valley" which could grant her wishes. Unfortunately for her (for the audience) there are many dangers in this game. Dwight can be seen as a little over dramatic and a bit of a loon. His character is annoying in a bad way and is very self-centred. He also does not have the sense to think he is the "King" when he really is a nobody. After all the first movie does not even mention him and the script makes his character a laughing stock. She, on the other hand is smart, funny and has a personality. Dwight's best friend is named Mike, the two are best friends and are good friends, they spend most of their time together. The two are also very close, the first day they get ready to go on the adventure the three of them are on the way to the game. Mike does a little dance and the trio decides to head off to the city to find The King. When they get there, Mike falls in love with the local girl at the bar and Dwight is jealous. Mike and Dwight are also caught up with other girls. The girls also like Mike. However, Mike and the other girls have been kidnapped by the other heroes who have come to stop Dwight and the King. Mike is trying to stop the game so Dwight does not win. The heroes take Dwight and Mike to the "Queen of the Castle" and Dwight says he needs to find out "The Queen". So the heroes have a contest to see who gets the "Great Game" first and who can do the first task to break Dwight out of prison. Mike then decides to go with the others on the quest. The first task is to kill a girl who has had a big crush on Mike. They

It was a period when many people, myself included, avoided Dosty's works in general. I've heard that it's all that people loved about him in the '20s, but he died in '33. I suppose this can be interpreted as a tragedy because Dostoeivsky was so far ahead of his time. His prose is so vivid, that you lose any sense of reality as you read. He would be called a 'literary-poet' but it is in fact a 'detective tale'. The language he writes in, is both precise and complex. He tells the story with every nuance, as if he is reading the minds of his characters. His characters are extremely complex. The reader is constantly being drawn in to their inner thoughts. Dostooevsky is also one of the most interesting and original writers in the entire Russian canon.   This is the tale of Gogul, a young streetwalker.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was made in the 90s. It is an old fashioned gangster film.   I don't like this film because it is just a movie.  There is no story, but it is about a character named "Dre" who runs a crime ring out of a nightclub. The story has been told a million times by other people.  The only thing new about the story is the music. The music is by "Big Country" and was probably created by someone with no musical talent. It was just too loud.  This film is just an old-timey gangster flick.  "Big Country".  Big Country Music.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most interesting thing about this movie is that it has a lot to say about the future. What happened at the end of the previous two films was a tragedy. I would've liked for the third to be more about the aftermath as we saw an astronaut on the moon for a very brief time to be followed by an asteroid heading towards our planet and then a war with Mars which resulted in the destruction of the Martian city of Marana. But again we see the Apollo 11 crew being attacked and only the landing of the crew is shown in this movie. I wonder if the Mars/Moon thing is just for dramatic effect. The only other thing of note was that in this film the moon appears to have been hit by an EMP which makes it look like the whole moon has been obliterated. I can appreciate that the film was made in 1984 but I think they could have made a more plausible movie with an actual astronaut on a space mission from the moon to the surface of the Earth.   I'm sure that this film will be viewed as a masterpiece in the cinema history books as it's been shown in many places and it's a true classic.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Last Kiss is a "Hail Mary Pass" (an old joke about a suicide attempt). It tries desperately to be serious, the romance is too bad to be true and the plot and character development seem to be lacking. Score: 0 out of 10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this movie.  The concept is great and the movie seems like a great homage to classic horror, but the acting is terrible.    I'm not going to say I hated the movie. The movie is fun, fun, but it's really not that good.    I'm gonna give it a 6 out of 10 because for a horror movie, the acting was good, I'm just disappointed in the movie itself.                                      Grade: 1.5 out of10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A pretty bad movie and nothing wrong, I wouldn't expect a good story out of this but it's a pretty bad one. The action scenes are the most annoying thing in this movie. Even if the director tried to add some comedy to it by throwing in comedy bits and funny effects, the action is just plain lame. The characters also have little to no personality, I didn't know who all the characters were. The main character the bad guy has a creepy-looking appearance. The bad guy fights other bad guys that he doesn't know as well as he fights the other bad guy in the movie. If you don't like bad guys, this movie probably won't be a good movie but if you like good looking bad guys and you don.t mind the lame action scenes then this is a good bad movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie I don't mind that much, but I don´t really care.   It was about a woman who gets a job to get her husband back and is in a marriage of 3 years (1 year with her ex-husband and 1 with her son). But a long time ago her dad got cancer and she was always with her father and he loved her.  It doesn´t take long for her to realize that her father is no good. This movie takes time and you see her problems, you don´ t want to watch the whole movie, but there is a really good ending, you do not regret watching the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is very bad. I did not see the original movie so I do not have any idea of how bad it is but it is very disturbing. The movie takes place in a school in a far away country (Europe perhaps?) where a group of kids (the main characters) are in a game to get to the top. At some point in the movie a girl dies in front of the teacher, which is obviously the main character. At the end of the movie he is seen again holding the girl's dead body, she is then taken away by a cop and the plot then takes a very disturbing turn.   In the original film the character was a good looking girl who was played by a very nice actress. In this movie she is a pretty ugly woman and her character looks very different to what is in the book. She has no problem with killing and in fact prefers to do so because it keeps her alive for a while.  :)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My favorite bad movie ever!  I don't know much about movies (I know a lot about video games).  I'm sure this movie had tons of people sitting around playing it over and over.  It's really a short story about a couple who have their "divorce".  The man who left is a jerk (you don't want to talk to a jerk, do you?  His name is Peter "The Bug" Jones).  The woman has to get the kids back from him...but can't really find a job.  And the wife is a bit odd, she likes to do all her stuff around the house, do the cooking, and then goes out to the town where she has to work at the post office.  At least there she has a job that pays her.  There are no jokes, but at least the actors (they have to do the whole movie all over again) do a very good job.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** This movie is a good example of what not to do. I like good characters but this film has nothing to do with any of them. It tries to be funny but the writers can't write. The plot is all wrong. Every scene is just a bunch of characters talking in their own stupid voice. There are several attempts at humor but they are very thin and uninspiring. It is a very dull movie. The acting is all over the place so the acting is not that important. It also lacks a little blood. It was a very bad decision to make a movie like this. ************** (8.0/10)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is an anti-science rant against the science in modernity, which is in general a very well done anti-modernity that would be at home with the likes of The Twilight Zone.  It is well written, and even the bad movie jokes are good.   You should not expect a high-brow sci-fi movie with an intelligent and well-drawn story.   This is actually a very low-brow science fiction comedy.     This is actually the worst science fiction movie of all time.    The plot is quite bad (you know, the stuff that can make a great science fiction film).   The story takes place in an unnamed universe where the people have become very arrogant and the government has been replaced with a dictatorship.  All the science has been done by a little group of scientists:  A robot who has made himself look like a man in order to learn about human society.  At a laboratory, he meets a girl with a mysterious past.  He then meets the daughter of an old scientist who wants him to change the way that he is operating.  This is where everything goes wrong:  A very poor movie in every respect, with no plot, no story, no action or even a proper soundtrack.  The only good thing I can think of is that this movie is made by a very talented director:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole film is based on the novel of the same name by the English novelist William Golding. The film is a modernized adaptation of this old, dark but very entertaining story.  The film opens with a short flashback to the time the protagonist, a boy named Max, was abandoned by his mother when he was still a baby. Max grew up in the countryside and has a very sad and lonely life. One day, a woman named Alice (played by Catherine Waterston) comes to Max's town, looking for a man, who had been kidnapped by a witch, Alice suspects that her kidnapping was not an accident after he shows signs of being possessed by a ghostly apparition called The Devil. Max agrees to marry her and she promises to keep him from finding out that she is the devil. The film focuses more on Max and his family than Alice. He is very goodhearted but also very naive and immature. He tries to get along with his family, even if it causes some problems. He always has a happy heart and a lot of potential. As a result, we are treated with some great scenes where Max tries to prove his innocence but all of his attempts end up being useless. Max also seems to be a very intelligent boy, but he has a lot to learn. There are some funny scenes in the film as well, including a scene where Max sees a monster running about a street and tries to kill it by running into a wall. There is also a scene that is very reminiscent of the book.     The film was shot in 2012 and released in 2013. This means the film has aged very well, with very few visual errors. The story and the characters were well written with great performances. But the film does not deserve a 10/10. The actors don't do the role justice at all. Even the cast is not all the people you might expect. For example, Catherine Waterstone does an amazing performance as Alice, with a very sweet and sensitive expression on her face. But she does not come across that way in the other scenes and this has the most noticeable effect on the film. For me, the only thing that makes the film interesting is the supernatural element. Max has his own vision of a dark, supernatural world around him. I always enjoyed the idea that Max sees the world in a completely different way than we see it. However, the supernatural elements do not always work well with the film itself and there is a definite sense of disappointment to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a really bad movie for the first 100 minutes (well, that's what they tell us anyway), and it's very slow and unmemorable. I have a vague, vaguely-related-to-this-movie memory where I vaguely remember a character in a movie named Mr. Brown (played by a deadpan John Wayne, who also played the same part in one of the best movies of all time, Gone With The Wind), where they play with a toy soldier. This was before the movies had a reputation for being tedious and stupid, and it was before they had stars who would be able to sell the badness of a movie if they were given the right material. But I forget those things when I hear this, which is, again, the reason why I was surprised when I discovered that this was a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think everyone should enjoy "The Godfather," but the worst thing about it is the soundtrack. As far as originality goes, this film was the first to feature a truly original track, "Futuro" by Bernard Herrmann. What more could you ask for? Unfortunately it is not used well and is pretty much just a bunch of songs, which are very repetitive. The movie itself was good but I felt that the music was too long in length for a movie this great.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the movie and I still like it even after all these years. The script is well written and the performances are good, but it doesn't have a special something to make this the greatest film.   It's just another old school vampire movie that has that old school feeling to it that can make you nostalgic and think about the 90s but not much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To the young girls of America (if that's what they were at all), see the movie "Star Wars". This is a terrible movie and the acting is terrible. The movie is the "Star Trek" movie from the 70s. All you are to see is the bad guys fighting bad guys. But what the heck is the point, when the baddies have been killed. The baddies run around shooting people at the end, and the hero gets a hand grenade and kills the baddie...who dies in the next scene. If the movie had any story, it would have been better but it's just silly. One of those films where there's no sense of danger or danger at all. A few bad guys go up against the bad guy with some hand grenades and then, you get a guy in a tuxedo running around trying to shoot bad guys with a handgrenade. Really, Star Wars? Don't tell me this is a film about the heroes? I don't care how you put it.... It's bad. Watch it in the theater with some fellow fans and see how the bad actors make the movie not funny, but painful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I never realized how bad this was until the day I was able to buy it, and then I found out how bad it really is.  For someone who has never liked an action movie, this one is absolutely awful.    I've never felt quite so angry for someone else before...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the great failures of American filmmaking is that they have a series of movies which try to be the James Bond picture with all the spy gadgets and exotic locations. But they are all forgettable.    There are a couple of fun parts which are not too dissimilar from a certain James Bond movie with a bit of Bond-lite. It was also a lot of money to make a film like this when it would be so easy for them to get the rights to a TV show which they had used before on other TV series.  I thought "The Night Stalker",   which is just a reprise of a movie called "The Stalker". It is a boring boring movie. The movie starts off with a beautiful woman who takes a shower after being spied on by a creepy guy. Then she is spied upon again, this time by two sexy people who are not sexy at all.  There was a lot more to the original movie that did not have much relevance to this version.  In this movie, we are supposed to believe that a girl takes a night stroll home. Then all of a sudden a dark figure creeps up from behind, grabs her wrist, lifts her up in his arms and drags her away into the night. She is terrified by the man and tries to push her way free, but the dark figure is much stronger, so she is unable to do it. Then a black hand appears from somewhere and pulls her away. It is like the whole movie is a fantasy story, but not too original or interesting in its plot.  I don't see the movie much, but if you haven't seen it I don;t think you have seen much.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have so much respect for John Frankenheimer.  When I started watching this film I thought it was going to be some sort of western about the rise and fall of a small town sheriff.  But then I realized that it was more a comedy starring a group of badasses and one bad-ass who just kept getting better and better.   In the first hour of the film, all the baddies seemed so over the top that they just made me laugh.  But then by the time the film reached the town of Silverdale (which I found out was on the North side of New Mexico, because it was a lot closer to home than I'd thought) they were just like people who live on the frontier.  By the time they got down to the real deal, it was like watching a bunch of bad guys try to fight crime with bad guys in a very funny film.  After this I laughed out loud a number of times.  That is, until the first major baddie showed up: the leader of the bad-asses, the "bad-ass king".   I found it strange that a big bad was portrayed as a bad-boy who just needed someone to help him out and the leader was supposed to represent a badger who just wanted some peace and quiet.  Unfortunately this is all that was done by the leader for almost half of the movie.  The other bad-dies kept doing what they were doing for about half the movie (making good-natured bad-mouthing of one another).  It never seemed like they were really being evil; only bad.  In one scene they make fun of the sheriff for having a pretty young daughter, just to make his life easier.  They are even more bad than the sheriff. They don't even take care of themselves when they get injured.  Another character gets seriously hurt and the only thing he does is complain about having to spend more time in the hospital than he did in the last movie.   So there's a character in this movie that doesn't look like he's meant to be there.  This guy is supposed to be really bad.   I had to wonder if this guy was meant to actually be so bad that he made it through to the final act.  He is really, really funny.  You just hate him.  And while he is supposed be evil and a bad, he is a really good actor and that really gets to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is basically a remake of the classic  The Nightmare Before Christmas. It has all the elements that make the original such a classic. It's based off of a true story, and it is an adaptation of a children's novel. It also has the same feel of the original; it's full of humor, scares, and fun. And the special effects, while not to the point to be considered truly great, are still okay and are definitely better than the last film.  Plot:  The film stars the children of a family who are in the process of leaving their home on Christmas Eve to visit relatives in their hometown. It starts off when a young girl named Anna is being haunted by a child she killed on a train. It isn't long before her father is trying to help her exorcise the child, even though he knows she is dead. It is at this time that the mother and father's relationship starts to become strained because Anna is starting to show more and more signs that this curse isn't going to be good for her.  The rest of the kids get involved as well as the neighbors. They run away from their home when an odd noise is heard coming from the house. A small boy sees a woman in his room, and tries to stop her from leaving but she manages to get out. The next thing he knows he's been taken into a world of evil where the evil child is hunting for him.  This film is a simple adaptation of the book of the same name, and for that reason is a wonderful film. For one, we get to see all of the famous characters from the book, and the film even uses this as a chance to highlight some of the more memorable ones like Snow White. It brings the classic characters back with a twist. For the most part, the film's quality is pretty solid. There are many scenes that could have used improvement.  It's not a great film by any means and the last act is not as well written as the first.  However, there is still a great plot and plenty of scares that made the film a lot of fun to watch.  And while it's not one of the best Christmas films of all time, it's still a fun movie that's a great entry in the classic Christmas film category.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The last minute introduction to the plot and the way it is told gives me an impression that a movie is almost finished at this point.   This may be the case, but it seems like this is the work of an amateur with some basic knowledge of science fiction or fantasy.  It is more or less a parody with a story about a ship, the U.S.S Endeavor, carrying a cargo of water.  The ship is attacked by a group of space pirates led by a woman named Marley. She gives the group a gift to fight their battles: the ships' catapults. Marley gives the catapult to a child named David, who is a huge fan of her and shows it to all the others, including Marley herself, who decides that the catapult should be used by the pirates.  I don't want to spoil the movie for you, because the final scene is very disturbing.    An example of what I mean: the girl, Marley, who has this "gift" that she wants to use and who seems to be very happy about it, who uses the catavolts to destroy one of the ships and the pirate ship, and then leaves with her men on a different ship. What a nice character, right?  What a sad ending!  How is it possible to tell such a simple story?  It seems that the only way to find out is to watch the movie.  For a couple of minutes, the girl takes the ship out of dock and then sets it on fire, and is very happy when she sets the ship on fire again.  We do not learn what Marley has done with the catapsalutes, whether she will use them again, or what they will be used for.  She does not seem very happy and so we understand that the ship will be destroyed.  That's it, then.  After a quick fight with the pirates, I have to say I think I'm going to throw this movie back!   There is a lot of nonsense about magic, the Endeavour having the ability to teleport between planets, and about a man named David who is so fascinated by the catamults that he doesn't even notice that they've gone out of control.  And there is lots of nonsense too.  What I love about this movie, as a person who enjoys some fantasy and science fiction, is that it makes us forget
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a generic generic monster movie.  The monster is a giant red-nosed bat with a long and slimy tongue.  It is used for the first time to drive people to a certain place to get something.  When it is not used for any reason they are driving.  There is no suspense and no fear.  And they drive into the forest to get it, they find that it is an old castle.  Well, one of them has a gun and shoots at the monster, then the other dies and they leave it there.  This movie is just stupid.  For a monster movie this is the least stupid and most boring.  I have seen much better, but I am not gonna go there.

I had fun with a few of the characters like Jack and his little son Jack-Boy. I laughed a couple times but when they were talking about the story in the movie and it all seemed kind of pointless it sort of stopped being fun for me. And then when they said that "the old guy went mad again and the movie ends" I thought "oh good that is interesting". That is the only good part about it and I didn't like it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't have a lot of feelings about this film...it's bad, I know that by now. The writing on the DVD is pretty good so I'm hoping the DVD will be better. I guess it can't be bad, it's so bad it actually has a good plot, but it still needs to get a second opinion...I think the producers didn't realize it wouldn't be a hit since we can't trust anything they say in front of the camera...just like the movie itself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm still struggling to get used to this movie.  This movie doesn't make me sick.  I'll be interested to see what they are going to do with the kids as this movie is going to be one long "woe is us" scene, but it still manages to keep things light.   But, seriously, how long has it been since I've seen this film?   It's been 4 years since this movie was released.  Let's see.  1.0.3.5.6.9.10.13   This film is all over the place.  One movie should not ruin an entire year.  And then, of course, there is the plot.  It starts off with a father and son having a conversation in their car, which happens to be stolen.  They are trying to find their way back to their father's house where they live.  The guy that they are trying find, a "fugitive" (don't get me started on fugitives).  As the father and his son are talking to him, he is getting closer to the son.  As he comes closer, he gets a gun and shoots the son twice in the chest.  Then he turns on the father, shooting him once in the back of the head.  But no.  You thought I was gonna say he had the father killed?  Not quite.  He just shot the father from point blank range.  Is that enough?  Well, yeah.  What?  I don't get it?  Why would he shoot the son?  He couldn't do that?  How is that enough to kill the father?  This guy is trying to get his kid back to him?  And what is this "fellow"?  I think he is supposed to be some sort of drug-addict?  That's cool I guess.   The son, who is a mess, is shot twice in this movie to be sure, but the real reason he was killed is so that the man he is looking for can shoot him twice.  Yeah, I'd go for that.  Now if he was a bad guy, would you have killed him? That would probably have been better for the kid.  So the man, now being chased, pulls out a pistol and shoots again.    Is this the same person he shot before?  The shot he took from point-
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As much as this movie is enjoyable for those who enjoy movies about the war, this movie really doesn't fit a war movie. This movie tries to add realism but it really lacks that. I can't believe that even after twenty-five years people still don't realize that the war was really boring and that it is more about the American people getting killed.  All the characters are pretty much a group of idiots who want to kill or at least get the money in a stupid, dumb, yet entertaining way. I was a bit disappointed when there were a couple of times when the movie was supposed to tell us the actual story. The main thing that this movie does well is the shooting. But that isn't the whole story.

What's the point of a movie like this in the first place?   It was a little boring and a little predictable.  It did not even seem that I knew the rules of this movie, nor did they seem to tell me that this was an "action" movie.  If I could take the good out of this I would, but this was just a boring, predictable and over the top movie. I don't think I will watch this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My wife wanted to watch "Chop Shop" on Saturday night, but was not pleased with the movie. My wife, who has never seen a movie in her life, said that the director was too lazy to learn the language of the Indians and the movie was completely uneventful. It may not have made it to the big screen, but it did make it to cable TV. If you have a few minutes to spare, and need a movie to do for the 4th of July, and do not wish to watch the new "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", then try "Chops Shop". A fun film that has some good laughs and action, but is far too long. It is worth a viewing if you have not seen it. If it is the only film you have seen that weekend, then do not waste your time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie  of this movie has a good idea, a good story, but an unbelievable script and a horrible acting. It's not very good, it's not terrible, but it's certainly not the first time it's been done and is very far from the best the director could've done with the material.  I think the movie could have been better. " I didn't like it. It doesn't do anything new or different and it's a waste of money. I can tell that this movie is going to get a negative reception because it's so bad and it tries to do so much, but the script is so amateurish and poor that it's just ridiculous. " I loved this movie from the beginning, it was an absolutely brilliant start to a very, very, wrong movie that has absolutely no ideas whatsoever.  I was expecting a more entertaining movie about three teenagers in a gang, maybe a little romance, a love triangle, etc, but this movie comes off as some kind of sadistic nightmare.  It's basically some gangster who gets killed and the surviving members of the gang pretend to go crazy to make up for the man who died.  They're in the movie for no reason other than they're the coolest characters out there, and they're pretty easy to root for because they're fun.  A great premise with little to no development, and the acting is awful.  I found this to be an interesting film because it had so many things that are wrong with it, and yet I could not bring myself to dislike it.   Overall:    4 stars  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. This was a terrible movie from the start. In the beginning, the plot was very basic, but it was entertaining and kept you interested. Unfortunately, when it got to the movie that we watched (well, not watched), the movie went downhill. The movie was too long and a lot of it was made of scenes and jokes that the audience already knew. The plot also seemed confusing and the actors did not appear to be on their A-game. The acting was horrible. For example, I was in a movie theater watching a movie and the movie was about a guy who has a bad dream. After this dream he gets drunk and loses his wife. He is then attacked and almost killed. He then wakes up in a hospital bed with an angry wife. After talking with her she is angry with him because she knows that he was in the hospital for too long. He wakes up from his nightmare and his wife, who had been very happy when he came home for some food and his TV, is back at a hotel. After that he goes to the mall for a little while and tries to find out what happened to him in the dream. We see a man who had a horrible accident and it makes him really angry and wants revenge. After he finds that a man named Bruce is the one who did it he tells him that he has the answer to his problem and then it was over. I guess someone would say that the ending was a lot better than the movie and if they could add a bit of humor it might have been better. There was a scene with a guy that looked to be a model who was getting his teeth pulled and this was supposed to be disturbing but I don't think it was. The scene with the lady getting her teeth pulled was a real shocker! I thought that they were trying to scare the viewers. I really didn't have a bad time with this movie, but I really thought the script needed a lot more work before the movie could get good ratings. There is a review from "Movies and Memories" that I think is a bit more honest about the movie than what I have told here. It is a good review that I read from a couple of years ago and it says that there are things that were really dumb in this movie and they could have handled that much better. I thought the movie ended very badly as I thought it would. I did enjoy watching it more than reading the "M
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high expectations for this movie, I mean I like horror and this would be a fun movie.  However this movie is not very good at all.  The acting was weak and it's a very bad movie!  The gore is very gross and graphic.  I hope that the studio can do something about this movie because it's so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To the people who thought the film was too much a rehash of previous adventures of Captain America. I hate to tell you but that's not all. We are introduced to the mysterious Dr. Samuel Sterns (played by Michael Shannon in his third starring turn) who turns out to be a very dangerous man indeed and the film is full of it. The film begins by showing what we have been wondering all along. Why are super powered beings called "Sterns" that look human? I am sure that there's some explanation for that, but as it is, the film just felt very forced and a bit contrived. I understand, the reason this is a "re-adaptation" is because of the previous films, but why should we expect that there will be no more references to them? The "sequel" (to the "Silver" series) is actually much worse as it tries too hard to be edgy again, but it is not very good at it. I know there were other stories out there about this character before and some of them were pretty good, but we need to move past those. The only reason the film works is because it takes what made it great in the first place and brings a more conventional approach to it. But in a "sequels" sense of the word, we are not going to get that kind of fun again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen, and I'm watching it over 4 years after it was released. When I first watched it I was like the film is just about an alien that just pops up and starts eating people, no more than 3 minutes. Well as it turns out it isn't the Alien, it is a guy (who looks like a guy) that just shows up out of nowhere and tries to kill all the people because a girl in the hospital is about to get a liver transplant. No, he has no motivation, no cause, no plan, and NO DEATH SPIRIT. The thing is he doesn't even care about getting killed by people! He just keeps coming back, one more time, killing the people he already has killed, and when she dies it's not like he even tries to save her, just walks up and grabs a knife from a guy who's already dead! That's all the reason the film had left. Not to mention he has NO IDEA what the heck is going on because he keeps going in circles and never knows where he's going! His mother is also a total jerk, constantly yelling at him to get away from his mother and not be around her. She's so mean to the guy who just comes in and just kills people like he's some kind of butcher. Her husband is even more creepy, he just keeps watching from a distance and never even helps her, instead he just stands in his house drinking some kind liquor (which doesn't have any effect on him) and just looking at the television, like a total creep. He's really creepy. Now as for the movie itself, the alien just pops around with a creepy smile and starts picking people off one at a time. No plot develops whatsoever because the movie just keeps telling us that the guy is going to get into a room full of people and kill everyone! And that's it! Well at least he looks scary. And as for why the alien was only 4 minutes long? Well that was the first cut of the film. The director had it cut down to like two minutes because then it looked really bad. If you had a chance to see the film a few years ago you would have been shocked that there is nothing even remotely scary about it. If it looked like it was cut down for a reason then the movie would have had more to give, and actually be decent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story follows a guy named Johnny. He is a junkie. He has been clean for so long, he has almost forgotten how he really feels. When a girl with a drug problem and a lot of money decides to throw her party for Johnny, things get out of hand. And then there are the zombies. They come at random, they swarm from nowhere, and they eat the junkies. And the zombies don't just eat him and his friends; they eat everything that gets in their path. So that's what Johnny calls his best friend, Tommy. And there is a girl named Karen...   Plot is a little bit too slow for the action sequences. Also, the story starts to fade away after a while. The main problem is the bad acting in this movie. There is so much bad acting that it makes the movie seem like a bad version of a horror movie. The action scenes are mostly over in 5 seconds. It gets hard to tell who is actually dead or what they died of. But even those are not that scary. Then there is the ending which I found hard to accept. You will need a lot to enjoy this film.   Overall, I can't give this movie a higher rating than a 1 or a 2. The story is the main issue and the acting is way over the top. It is a bad horror movie and you will probably feel the effects that you see.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have heard that the movie, "Sleepless in Seattle" (1930) has been made into a silent movie version. I found the movie quite good in fact very good in its way. If you're a student of the silent cinema there's a good chance this movie is going to be the one to make you look at a movie of that era as a treat.   This movie is more of a horror picture. It's very scary in that I'd bet you'd have to watch it to be certain about it. There are a couple of scenes that will have you on edge.  I'm going to leave you with a little taste of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! It is bad, it is bad!!!!!! Do you understand what I am saying!? This movie, the only good thing about it, and in which we will see two pretty boys with little to no chemistry, a couple of girls trying too hard to act tough, some ugly girls on bad behavior, I mean really ugly (well, one of them at least), a couple "dramatic" scenes where the lead actor is acting like the bad guy, a few action scenes but nothing much (other than it is funny sometimes), a girl talking about her boyfriend, his body and what he is wearing.!!! If you are into this kind of movie, read this book or at least give it a try. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ "I was a good sport. It might have seemed like I was doing all I could to annoy him. I don't think he knew I was there. He was laughing in my face, and I was being funny! I didn't mean to upset him. But I knew he felt bad for the girls because, after all, it was such a bad day for them. They had a lot of fighting and fighting and the other boys had to intervene. I was trying to help them! I was the reason they'd never have to go back to that school! I knew they would still want to go. I didn`t mean to make a mess of it! I just had to find a way to help some of them. I think I did."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw " The Big Lebowski " once for the first time the weekend it came out and I knew nothing about it at the time, just that it starred John Turturro and Paul Giamatti.  I thought that the movie was a pretty good comedy, funny and good as all get-out with a good story, however, after reading through the reviews here I was wondering why I was so surprised when I had watched the movie. The story is simple, the Lebkowsky family is traveling to New York City from New Hampshire on a train on a rainy Sunday afternoon. However, they have lost their luggage and are forced to hitchhike back through the snow to Albany where they find a homeless man who has a sign that reads "The Big Lebowks", his house is located in a "no trespassing" zone and the road is so rough that the train is forced to stop. The Lebksowsk's are so desperate to get their luggage back that they take the homeless man up on his offer to fix the train so that they may continue on their trip. The homeless man also sells them a car and offers to pick them up and drive them to where they were originally supposed to pick up their luggage. Unfortunately for the poor couple they get lost along the way and the car breaks down and they are forced by the homeless mans kindness to hitch back to where he gave them shelter. On the way the couple makes a number of hilarious jokes about the car and the homeless who is so friendly that the Lebsowksk's have to give him a hug because they are so impressed that a complete stranger would help them out.  The train eventually makes it back to New Hampshire and the Leblowsk family finds themselves in an old fashioned diner at the top of a cliff with the train crashing down on top of them.  John Turelro's character is as you would imagine, a pompous, rich, uptight, self righteous asshole who is the type of person who thinks he is above the law.  He is a jerk and he is the typical anti-social that the audience is all so used to. This character is probably the only one that I found myself not laughing at and I was disappointed with his character. I did think the scene where they walk up to the homeless guy and give him their money was funny, however I didn't feel that it was in the right place. The film was funny and interesting
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I've seen in a long time: it started as a good comedy and then degenerated into an action movie that was made in the 30s when Hollywood was more interested in the story about a guy with a magical axe and his wife. I've been trying to find out what this movie is about and I couldn't see any hint. It is also too long so it's boring and the script seems to be a mess. You'll end up hating this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really liked this movie.  But it could have been more.    There are definitely moments when it felt like it was not really for me.  It was very slow and even in the last third there were moments where I didn't know what was going to happen.  But when the first part of the movie is over it was great.  There is a lot of violence in it and I really like it.  I am a very strong believer in violence and I love it. It seems like we can't get enough of it in movies.  This movie was very violent as well.  That is something that doesn't happen all the time but this is my favorite kind.  You get to see the violence and see the pain and see a couple relationships turn sour but I would have liked to see more of it. The violence is also very well done in this movie and you really get to feel it. I really liked the ending to the movie too.  Some people may say that this is a sequel but that isn't the case.  The ending is very different.  As far as this movie is concerned this is the third movie and I am glad that there is a third movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a mediocre attempt at an epic epic fantasy.  If you're a huge fan of Tolkien this is a great movie, but if you're not Tolkien fans I'd avoid this movie.  There are a lot of references that people will find odd.  This movie is so over-rated that it will only appeal to fantasy fans.  The characters aren't well-drawn or realistic.  I wouldn't waste any more of my time on this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I found the movie really interesting and the art is very nice. The movie feels like a children's picture book. I was very curious about the story of the movie. After watching the movie, I found out that it is true. A couple get trapped inside a house with a strange man. The strange man takes the man's wife and son hostage and tries to take the life of the couple. The story is told in 2 parts. The first part (the part in which the man escapes from the house) is really bad. After that, a new version of the story is added. What is new in the movie is that the man who is trying to kill the man is really ugly (well, he is like a monster). The reason why we watch the movie in the second part is that after the bad part, there is a cute part and a funny part. What this movie does well: the story, the art, the cute part, the funny part, and the cute/funny part.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was my first attempt at a Sci-Fi movie but I'm a pretty big fan of the genre so this movie is very disappointing, for those who enjoyed a bad bad movie here is another crappy bad movie!  It's a sci-fi thriller that focuses on one man trying to discover what is happening in a small hamlet.  He is assisted by a small group of people who seem to be in a position to tell him what is really happening.  We then meet the man who is in charge of the hamlet and his girlfriend.   They then become involved with a woman from the outside who is also a bit strange and who we think is an American, maybe a white guy.  We then meet a man who may or may not be a man, at all, or a creature but he also has very strange powers.  This is a very poor Sci-fi movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this film was interesting, fun and entertaining. It wasn't long after it ended that I was ready to watch a different movie. This movie is called "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" and it was written by Michael Gross who did a poor job directing this. This film has an almost pornographic quality to it and it is certainly dirty in some cases. I guess it should be noted that I am not a fan of "dirty" and I was not impressed with "Dirt."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a bad sequel with a poor script. It was really dumb and was not funny at all. I think the director should be sent to prison for trying to make this sequel. It is no wonder they were unable to make it work. There was nothing funny about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If I could give this movie just one bad review... I would.   The screenplay is a mess. I don't even know what the movie is about.  The acting sucks, all of the actors are very good, however, none of the characters are any better than the others.  I can only imagine that this movie was written just before the Civil Rights Act and to deal with the racism.  It was written for people like Robert Ryan who thought they were doing a very good thing for their kids. It was also written as a satire and is not.  At the time I saw this film in the late 60's I had never even heard of the Civilrights Act and I'm sure this movie played a big part in the American thinking about racism. I also don't understand why all of these young actors decided to act a complete fool as if they are a bunch of heroes.  Not so funny anymore, even more ridiculous than the first film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not expect much with this movie. What I got was a story about a child that doesn't fit in with everyone else in the world. I also got to see a few of the things about the real world that the other characters in the movie are so fond of.   If I can only give the kids in this movie a 5 star.  Helpful the other children's story lines. The story could be cut of and a lot of the scenes could have been used. One of the biggest problems is that a lot has to go through the mouth of a child before you realize its a story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Let me be perfectly clear about this film. I do not find it as funny as the trailers, the first time I watched it, but in hindsight I'm surprised how funny it is. It makes light of the whole matter of rape (well, maybe the first 15 minutes were, but by that time I understood that it was meant to be a comedy) with a bunch of guys dressed up as women, then one of them gets his penis cut off, and while his friend watches, he puts a new one on. I can't tell you how funny this movie is, even if it was supposed to be that. I think it's a very sad, funny movie but I can see why some people would find it depressing and depressing. The story line is very poor, especially in the second half. The ending is very bizarre and I don't understand why it was even made.   The movie is a comedy, I can understand that. However, I think that even this very poor movie deserves some good reviews. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie opens with a nice and creepy intro to its story.   We meet an old man walking towards his house with his dog, and then we get a brief introduction to the setting, which is a very rustic small town with very old buildings and lots of woods surrounding it.  In the middle of a town like this, this old man should be able to enjoy a relaxing stroll through the woods. But instead he gets followed by a dark masked man (and we're not sure how old this mask is, because it is very obviously not old) and his dog.  One of the scenes is a long shot through a dark room, with a lot of dust scattered all about.  The masked man is in the very first shot.  There is some sort of noise and some scratching noises, and at one point the dog barks in an almost angry manner. Then the masked man enters the room, but his evil is not revealed until the camera pulls back (you're still in the woods).  The dog turns around and stands on its hind legs, and its eyes start glowing red. The dog starts to bark, and the masked figure appears behind it. Now there is a brief scene with the mask in the foreground and the dog to the right, both with their foreheads showing.  That's all we get.  This is the whole movie.  You don't get any more action, and no other weird creatures come out of nowhere to show up, other than the masked person (this is probably a reference to a famous horror film from the 70s, where a masked character is just a part of the atmosphere).  This might have been a good movie if it had a more action oriented plot.  Also, there was not much of a mystery at all to be solved as far as the mask was concerned (at least, I couldn't figure anything out) and the little dialogue did not get me much enthused.  Overall, this movie doesn't seem to have anything very interesting about it.  This is a pretty lame movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an action movie and it has a few moments where it shows that it can act.  It features great action, and a lot of running around.    It has a female co-protagonist who is the main love interest.  The action scenes are not as good as a lot better movies, but a decent one.  It is a very funny movie with a great action scene.  If you like action movies then I would recommend this one. It is also rated R for some violence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My girlfriend and I saw this on the weekend when it was showing at the Vue Cinemas in Burbank, CA and this was a really good movie. At least it wasn't a bad flick, it wasn\'t. It wasn\'d very bad, but it wasn \'t so bad it\'d hurt your eyes, nor would it make you wish it had been a remake of the other 80\'s classic ''Super Fly'' or some other cheap movie made in the 1970\'s. ''Superfly'' was a more recent movie about a guy named Barry Bonds playing baseball and he did run a great batting average. ''Duck Dynasty'' on the other hand played with that old fashioned family movie feel in the vein of the family-friendly films that played in the 1950\'s, such as ''Hoosiers'' (also starring Phil Conners). ''Super-Fly'' on a more ridiculous premise was about a pilot called David Dunn who got his ''superfly'' as a Christmas gift and had to use it to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco to get a new job. This movie was set during a war in which there was no airplane to use and the plane had to be refueled several times. So the pilot flies low enough to avoid the enemy planes, but as soon as he gets close to them he decides to fly as high and as fast as he can, but his superfly keeps getting damaged. He then finds a small American fighter plane which does have a jet engine, and gets the jump on the enemy and escapes to a small island off the coast of California. From this island, he finds a bunch of survivors who tell him they know where the airport is, so he takes them there and takes off for the airport. As he flies over the water he notices a plane from a country whose leader called himself President Joe Wilson who is making a stopover, and ducks into the runway, but the plane is a torpedo and flies down at him, sending him to earth. However, the pilot has found a spare engine and they fly around searching for the fuel until they run out and the fuel goes out, and the aircraft starts to land. The pilot and his men run back to the beach, only to discover that they have been captured by the Japanese, who have set the whole island on fire with dynamite. Fortunately, the plane was so damaged that they were able to get the airplane up. This story is a ridiculous one, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending is stupid.   It's been stated that this movie is an animated series and that's how it will be presented.  It isn't; it's a movie that takes place after the animated series. It doesn't change any of the characters but it is still stupid. It's about a man who is so bored with his life, so he decides to go back in time to see what's changed and what not. Unfortunately, he ends up in the past to find out that he has actually changed a lot of things in the future as he never remembered anything...except the name of a dead baby (the one that was the first child that was born in that time period).   I'm not going to explain why it's stupid, but it's simply stupid. I'm sorry, but you couldn't have been more wrong if this movie had been animated. If it was animated it's as dumb and boring as the rest of it (though at least the characters are interesting) and the only reason I can't give it a lower grade than a D is that it doesn't have any redeeming value at all. If you're looking for a time travel movie to pass the time, then I don't think this will be the right movie for you.

It is a little repetitive and it is really a movie about the family and how the family copes with a lot of things around them.  A little overrated? Yes, a little over rated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I wish I had bought this instead of the original. It was a very different story that was about two people who get together and then have sex without condoms, but without any of the romanticism or comedy that made it great in the first movie. In this one the man is a virgin so she takes him to the doctor who gives her a diagnosis that he has had a very good year but is now beginning a depression. But she knows how to take care of him and so they become intimate, and that is just what happens at the end when a truck explodes. So basically it is a depressing and sad movie which I didn't much enjoy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was hard to enjoy this movie. It seems there was no effort made in making the characters likeable. I didn't think it was a very good movie, there is one character who could have been more likeable, there was also one plot device that really made me roll my eyes, the final scene. I don't think my opinion is out of line, I just think it did not need to be there. I mean, what kind of message does this story have? How much money could you get out of a baby? And, oh yes, it has a baby girl with a gun. All in all I can't say this was a good movie and it's not as good as I expected, but I'll wait until next week before I review it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is the end of the day and we have a party.  Myself and some other friend are going to the beach and I will be there at 11am.   My friend is planning to drink some beer and I'm going to drive to the place. I'm waiting for a light so when the party time comes I park my car and head to the location.  When I go there, there are a lot of drunk guys and girls and a few girls are already there.  It has nothing to do with that I don't want to go there anymore.  I go to the bar and sit down there and watch a movie.  We have to play basketball there and a little while after I started to play it the same guys came back to the car.  They are not a group of friends and I was really annoyed.  The guy at the time was like the leader and he decided to take a good shot.  He missed a layup and fell out of the game.  Now these guys are trying to tell me that their group is not that big?  The man is the leader of the group.  And I don\'t think they understand that.  One guy got my phone number because he thought that I am pretty and he wants to take it from me.  My phone is my lifeline in this city.  If I don' want to do a certain thing and I can't do it, I get scared and run.  But he can do anything he wants as long as he is going to be in the club.  A few guys and two girls want to hang out with us in the parking lot.  Anyway, my friend is like, \"It\'s a bad decision, we can\'t leave.  Why don\' t we just go home, it is almost 11:00. \" And I, my friends and the leader are like: \"We can\' t get to our car in time.  Do you want to wait??"  But they will not leave. The leader is drunk, doesn\'t remember who is leader and doesn\' t know if he can make it to the club in time, so he tells everyone:  When a drunk guy starts saying that he wants his car, what is the first thing that comes to his mind?  Getting his car.  He gets on his motorcycle and tries to drive out to the parking spot but it is too
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's one of those "I have always been told that this is the best movie of the year" kind of films. There is a plot to this movie that is good but it does little in the way of actual character development, a couple of characters get a lot of character development but it is all a bit rushed. I'm not sure why anyone in their right mind would go out to see this movie. For the most part it was boring. I thought the movie should have been called, "The Year Without a Woman" or something because most of the movie takes place in a bar. It is pretty obvious that this movie is a product of the 80s. I found myself wanting to throw up after watching this movie and not being able to believe the amount of times that someone would talk about the "evil" evil corporation, The Corporation. It was so obvious to me that this film was made by an executive producer of one of the worst shows ever on television, Saturday Night Live (SNL).

This movie was just a pile of bad ideas, bad acting, bad dialog, a whole lot of people saying stupid things and a completely pointless battle.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!! How can one of the most brilliant actors of all time make such a bad picture? I don't even want to be on the same side of the theater that I had a 2 year experience at. To be quite frank, I was more than disappointed when I saw the beginning of this movie.!!! (I guess that all the people that loved his work with John Travolta, will agree with me.!!!!)!!! In the beginning, John Taggart is played by a young actor and he is just not ready. He looks weak and not even in shape enough for his first appearance as the detective "Taggart"!!! I was totally taken aback by him. The rest of the actors are not any better. A man who is supposed to be the most powerful, and intelligent person to ever be born just shows no real emotion, and seems to enjoy the fact that a young boy just tries to get some information from him. In a way, it is almost as if the director did everything he could to make the movie interesting.!! This movie is a joke of the highest order. At times, it looks so very good that I was nearly jumping out of my seat...But then, something very odd happens. The story moves from the first scene with John, to his father, and finally to his young son in a very strange way. It seems that the story was made to be as funny as possible, and so the actor playing John Tippetts looks so good that it is impossible to resist a bit of laughter. The director of the movie did not know how to write a good story...It is very much in tune with its subject, but somehow the end was a bit more disappointing than the beginning. So I won't give this movie a bad score. !!  !
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film itself is a bad one, but it is funny. I found a couple scenes funny. There is an old lady with a bad temper, that she can't control and she just laughs all the time. The old guy is a bit funny too. One time, he's talking and his voice changes so much. It's funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For as much as I adore the cast, it really was a let down.  The writing was bad, not great, but bad, and it had nothing of the original source material to bring it up to where it should be.  I don't know if it's because I'm older or because I have better taste, but a lot of movies I like have aged well over the years.  It's a little on the dull side and could use a great director like Joe Dante.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would recommend people who don't care for movies about bad people to think twice before spending any money. For a movie so filled with bad jokes, the plot is nothing special. There is one bit that is worth mentioning, a character's girlfriend gets killed. One of the characters says "No...you can't kill your girlfriend. A girl's life is her own"... but he isn't right. I guess people who hate the movies must like people like that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw this movie I was expecting a good time. I was shocked with it's sub-par acting.   The best part of the movie is when this girl shows up and starts beating up the losers. The movie was awful and I'd avoid it at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A lot of people have heard of this movie. And I hear it from the same place many people have seen it: a bar. In fact there is nothing in the movie that has nothing to do with any of the other movies. I'm not a movie fan but I am a fan of this man. He was the original guy, the great actor who was a bit out of place in the rest of the cast. As he said himself, he "was born in Hollywood". He was a man who was born with two heads. It was a strange situation. When the film was shown in the early 1950s, there was no way he could be the only man there. Even the director, John Wayne, didn't like him and felt there had to be more. Wayne, as everyone knows, would later become the greatest film hero the United States has ever seen, which is saying a lot. He knew that he had to find someone good to go along with him. And that man was John Wayne. They put the two head in different roles, the first to deal with the big, dark, and dreary movie world and the other to do the comical, light-hearted, and fun scenes. The second head didn't take it so well with it and became a bit of a hero. His name is Fred MacMurray, and he is a comedian. The film is funny because of its humor and its characters. The comedy is great because they use the comic strip style and have MacMurray talk about the silliness of everything. A lot like the way one plays poker. MacMurray even says "I'm a comedian." He is a funny man with a bad accent. The actors all have funny voices and sometimes you can hear the laughter of the crew from the background. This film has no romance or romance at all. It is just the funniest movie on the screen. There are no beautiful women or beautiful men. Everything you see is in a funny, stupid, and hilarious way. I loved it and I love all the people involved. I even love this movie to the point where I bought the DVD because I thought it might be a fun watch in a bar, but to my surprise, I watched it as I am writing this review.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. It is very slow paced and slow moving with only the occasional strong scene.   I liked the main character and the way that he played him.  It was a shame that this was such a slow paced movie, but in the end this movie was a good look at the man who would one day become the governor of California.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's bad.  That's my first thought when I saw the title.  The story takes place in the year 2099, a time when humans are beginning to colonize other planets.  While exploring a planet, the crew and colonists, named the "Carnivora", are attacked by a gigantic carnivorous animal.  It turns out the creature was once a woman, so the men of the crew put her on a pedestal to make a better life for her and for their own, not realizing she's a killer.  When she goes berserk again, the men decide to kill her in order to stop the killing.  As the story progressed, we learned the reason she went berserking.  She was pregnant with the child of a fellow Carnivora named "Cris".  Cris was an only child and was sent to Earth to be cared for by the crew's best friend, and future husband, John.  Cris and his mother had a bad relationship.  Unfortunately Cris killed his own father, and he grew up to be an alcoholic.  He also became the prime target of a man looking to avenge his father's death.  John and his mate were trying to figure out how to get home.  A local Carnivore named "Slack" was killing people for sport and had a taste for Cris.  Slack and his friends wanted Cris for themselves, so they took him off the ship and dumped him on Earth.   When a girl named "Fem" saves John, they go back into the ship together to save Cris.    In the next few days, they discover that Cris is pregnant.  They find out she was in labor at the beginning, and the doctor had told John and Fem to go back in the ship to get her.  There they find the body of Cris's father and see him being eaten alive.  "It's Cris' child!"  "No, he's our child!"   John, Fem and John's friend Ben, find themselves forced to kill Cris to save her.   After their escape they discover the rest of the ship has been invaded by the Carnivores.   This is when the story changes.  This story really isn't about the "heroes".  It's about the humans fighting back.  We find out the Carnovore invasion was planned by an alien race who wanted humans to be the next food source on their

"Look at that." "Are there clouds?" "You mean you've never seen clouds?" he answered, smiling. "Oh!" I shrieked, my whole body shaking. "Hey," he said, "you don't have to be such a baby. What do you want?" "Hey! I want a hug!" he yelled, trying to pull me up. "Look, no one gives a f*** about you, you moron!" he shouted. "But you're just a kid," I objected, "I've been there. Don't you remember anything from that time?" "Yeah, what about it?" "Well then, what kind of a life does a vampire have?" he yelled in anger. "What kind of life?" "To live forever in fear. I could do that, you know, but there's so much other work to do. Besides, I do love you." I said, squeezing his hands.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a really bad movie, with the lowest quality acting I've seen.   The plot is poor, the dialogue is bad, the acting is bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a bad film, but like most horror films in the 90's it has little sense of character.  The character is an obnoxious little cunt who spends most of the movie shouting at the main character to shut up and not say what you are.  And when it comes to saying things, the main characters only say "fuck" and "shit" several times each.   And it's only after they are shot that they change.  I was a little upset that there was no actual horror elements in the film, there's a few people who are dead or are infected, which makes the film more of a slasher film, and it's not really scary, it's just annoying.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a very, very stupid. It is the movie that gave me the 'Cake' meme, as my Facebook friend asked if I wanted to watch the sequel that didn't even work. The 'Cakes' are a group of high school students who make their own "cake" and then "eat" it. One day, a couple of school girls get a little too friendly with a few of the Cakes, who, to put it lightly, aren't what you'd call a group in the right state of mind. Not only that, the Caves have a nasty habit of breaking out of jail one day, and the "Cakes" quickly run afoul of them. And they all die, except for a couple who run away, and are found by a mysterious woman, who gives them a second chance at life. And I do mean second chance. She says that if they succeed, they can leave their hometown and live a better life, but they have to do three more things: 1) Eat a cake of their choosing every morning and night. 2) Not go to a party on Tuesday. 3) Go to a movie the second it comes out...   But there's no party on a Tuesday. The movie becomes even more bizarre from there. It has a very low budget, and a very bad cast and crew. One might also call it a "giant, stupid rock movie." The movie has a lot of very strange, out of place jokes. It's like a kid's birthday, except that the cake doesn't come with a "party" card. There's even a big "No Cake" sign on the outside of the cinema. There are even two different types of cakes: a "Fruit Cake" and a "Plague Cake." The latter has the same appearance as a "Cake," but its color is purple, and it tastes terrible. But there are good points about the movie. A good amount of the movie takes place on a small farm where several "Caves" live. They get attacked by a giant fish that lives in the river. They also have to deal with a man that's a "Witch" that wants to eat them, as well as an old man who wants them dead. There is a part of the film where the "Witches" attempt to have the "Rats" eat them. The only problem with the movie is that it just seems like a bad
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish I could give this one 5 stars. The fact that we're treated to so many bizarre and outlandish scenes in this film is just as funny as it is creepy. One of the best acting performances ever.  The sound is the best that I can describe it. The actors aren't in awe of being in front of a movie camera. They do what they are told, they keep the cameras rolling, and they do it well. It's almost as if their minds are in the hands of a puppet master. I'm almost afraid to watch the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a real travesty from beginning to end. It's a bad bad bad movie, it makes absolutely no sense and its all wrong. One of the worst films I have seen so far. It just starts off and its a terrible disaster and it doesn't stop after that. In the beginning, it gives you an impression that this is a documentary but it's really not. This film isn't even about a child soldier. In this movie, the main character is a child who goes and becomes a child assassin. And in the end there is one of the most annoying and annoying movie heroes that I have ever seen. This movie has all of the wrong things about it, it's one of those movies that can't stand alone, it has to be watched with others in order to be enjoyed at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie sucks. Every scene was bad. When the "good" guy is about to take an ice shower, he takes out the gun and his penis pops out and runs off. When he's all naked he gets a towel to wrap around himself before his mom says he needs a bath. At the end he's just walking into the bathtub and a towel falls off his back. His mom says she's going to get his clothes to wrap him up in, but when she does she sees the gun is still there. She gets angry and says she won't put a gun away when they talk about her. I think it should have been a scene from a bad sitcom called "Lois and Clark". I just don't get it. I don't understand why the bad guy is taking a bath with a gun pointed at his back! That just makes no sense. Why does he need the clothes when the hot bath is up at the end of the scene? I think I would rather watch a cartoon like "Rugrats" or "K.C. Undercover". I don`t understand why my Mom would say that. What happened to being a girl and all that? I mean sure she can be a strong and independent woman, and she can take care of herself. But she doesn`t even think she should be able to take care her own family? She thinks she should have a man around all the time to care for her. This is really a depressing movie. It just seems like it has no point to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a sense, this movie is a good movie - and a good comedy. The problem is that the film's plot and characters are badly written and badly acted. The movie's bad movie premise is that a group of five people in a house (four are played by David Carradine) are trying to sell a painting on the Internet and meet a wealthy client named Mr. J. After selling the painting he receives the following message from Mr. R: " I bought the painting from you in the late afternoon at $50,000. I am going to send you an envelope by courier with $10,000 in cash. If the painting looks as good as you say it does I will pay you $100,000, or I can go to court and get a $1,000 per week royalty. " The five are:  1)  Bill Samaan - who plays the role of a very rich man who wants to be rich again (which is the movie's main premise). Bill is in love with his wife Jane. He is a very good looking man. Jane is very smart and witty. Bill seems quite intelligent too. 2) ik the man who plays Mr. L - a bad looking rich man. ik is a terrible liar. ive never seen him before. 3) ive seen the girl (played by a beautiful woman who plays by Mary Lou Retton) three times but she has a bad singing voice. irl she sings about a man that lives in a lake and is trying to get a boat to his girlfriend. ick is jealous of the man because he sees him taking a boat away from her. ike he thinks he is cheating on her by being with other women. The film has poor acting. ight. the actress who plays Bill's sister Jane is not good looking either. ime she is supposed to be quite smart. 4) ike the girl in the apartment next door is supposed ike a very clever girl (and she is) and i thought i was going to fall in love. She and ike are both in a relationship. igh she ike rich, iike very smart, ike beautiful and irl very hot. 5) igh the man playing Mr. T. is a bad actor. irstly he is a pretty good actor but he doesn't have a great voice and he really shouldn't be in a film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A new director was hired to revive the old "Night of the Living Dead" series. Unfortunately, the new director failed to live up to expectations and the series got off to a rather poor start. The story follows a college football team that takes a cross-country trip to New Mexico. The movie is supposed to be the story of a bunch of college students that find out that they are not who they appear to be. This is where the movie is at its worst. The film is a mess and all the characters seem to have very limited roles in the story. There are several cliches that are used throughout the movie and none of them are very good. The writing seems to be in the vein of "The Naked Gun". I mean, it is just a bunch o' football players being murdered by zombies. It is a very weak movie that I don't understand why anyone would go see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film that just takes you into the minds of some poor people who seem to live a very simple life. The idea of a group of people with money going out and coming home is simple but the way they do it is not. The people are not very well rounded. This makes it hard to connect with them. There's nothing here to connect to. They are just living in an apartment and doing whatever they have to do to survive. I would have really liked to be on that journey with them but alas, it's a hard film to enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have no clue why this is rated "R". I think I found my absolute least favorite movie of 2016 so far. It's pretty terrible, and it has an extremely annoying score. I don't know what went wrong with this movie, but it is not a fun, easy ride. I think this may be some kind of parody, although there is nothing wrong with that either, so I guess I have to give the benefit of the doubt.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **************************** If you've seen the new "Spiderman" movie you probably know that, like all sequels, it's only marginally better than the original. And it's just so bad it would make a bad actor like Kevin Connolly seem good. The first "Spider" was a comedy, an amusing one, but not really very exciting. It was also, by the standards of superhero movies at the time, not bad. The new film, however, is all about Peter Parker and is not only badly acted by actors who seem more interested in selling their lines, but it's also terribly filmed (see the scenes above, with the camera peering over the top of a building to shoot into a dark alley, and the scene above, which is the most ludicrous shot in the movie. I was so annoyed by that scene that I couldn't watch the rest). Even worse is how the film feels like it's trying to be like the comic books, but the comic writers and artists have been given the reins on the new movie, and they've made the same mistakes that they made in the comics in creating a character that should never have been created in the first place. (It's funny that a guy like Stan Lee, who's been making movies for a long time, would want to remake the old comics. This is what Stan Lee did when he made the movies. He tried to make a "Spidey" that seemed like it belonged in the "Spider-Man" comic book, not a "Spider-".) So the "new" movie does all the things that the original "Spider," (which was already pretty bad), should have done: it's a superhero movie with a "happy-go-lucky" attitude and a big, bright superhero suit. But this new film is very bad at it. Spiderman, like most superheroes, has always been a very complicated character. He's got a history of being misunderstood by his own people, and is also someone who was originally created, (by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko) as the "man whose power is his webbing." (Yes, a Spider has a history, in that the comics often take place in an alternate world where Spiderman is much more powerful and is able to fly, or is able, depending on the book and the artist.) It's also not at all clear what, exactly, Peter Parker is. There's no real backstory. This new movie tries to create one by having

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was the worst movie I have ever seen, even though it was supposed to be a remake of a movie about the Holocaust.  It was the story of the SS and how they were going to transport all the Jews who had survived the Holocaust to the Pacific Ocean to escape from the Nazis.  I would say that is the reason for my bad review, but the badness of the movie did not come from the story.  The plot was awful.  First, it was about a bunch of Germans who want to escape Nazi Germany to get away from the Jews.  Then, when the SS are about to carry out their mission, the Jews revolt and throw the Germans off a cliff, so that they don't become one with their captors.  At this point, the Nazis are all dead.  They then make sure they never make it to their goal of moving all the Germans to the ocean.  So, the SS must go on the attack and they attack one of their own who was on the beach and he becomes a Nazi.  All of these events take place in a couple days.  For some reason, there is an Israeli villager who is captured by the SS.  He is not taken to be put to death, but he must perform a Nazi salute.  This leads the Germans and the villager to a confrontation where the SS take him away and send him back.  But he can not keep himself from doing his Nazi salute when he gets to the ship where the Jews are.  And I don't think I can do a better description of the plot for you: -------------------------- What I hate about this movie?  The movie begins when the German Nazis are planning to kidnap the German-Jewish villager.  To be honest, I have had a bad feeling about this entire film since the first scene.  What if the SS captured him before the villagers did?  And there was no one with the Nazi-villager on the side of the Nazis to lead them?  There would have been lots of fighting and a lot of deaths before the SS would have taken him to a place where the Nazis could not capture him.  We never see any of this on the movie.  Now, why would you have a Nazi villager instead of a Nazi Jew?  He could be a good ally to the SS, but we never find out.  There is a German-Israeli who was captured by Hitler in 1939 as

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't even know why I picked this movie up for two reasons:   1) I was looking forward to seeing this as I've seen a few "sneaker-shooting" movies about this type of thing - and I haven't been disappointed yet. (I liked the first movie with the little girl, but the second one was a big bust - which might have had something to do with the ending.)   2) One of the movie's stars is a real badass, and the other is a pretty decent action movie heroine.   The movie is the story of a girl named Elle, who wants to be a bad mother and goes into the "skating factory" to be one. There are a lot of bad things about this movie - it's slow, it's repetitive, and they don't seem to have done much research on this. The only thing I can think to criticize is that the girl's character doesn't seem really developed - even before she turns bad, she's just not a likable character to me. It's also kind of weird that the whole thing takes place on a playground - I don't think the kids on this playground are exactly known to be all that bright or smart, but it's the only place the story takes place. If there's a reason to put a movie like this on the schedule, it is for the skating lessons. They're fun.  , about a kid named Elaina who goes into a skating factory to be trained. (The "Skating Factory" was a place that existed in the early 30's that was known as a "skate park" for a while. It was a kind of carnival/slide/stunt park, and was the place where skating was supposedly practiced. It didn't seem like a place where kids would learn how to skate, but instead be taken by the local kids (or sometimes the police) and trained to be professionals in this (sort of) illegal activity.) This movie is really about how this kid (Elsie) was supposed to turn bad, but she didn't - it actually didn't take that long for her to change from a happy-go-lucky child into a nasty, mean, mean person. At this point I was a little concerned that they were setting up Elle's badness as a metaphor for the person she is. And the character development is just okay - it seems to be going pretty well for
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ _______________ ________ _____________ A lame and pointless science-fiction horror/sci-fi movie that isn't worth a crap. I'd rather see a better movie than this. It's like watching a movie about a boring scientist who has to take care of his child (who is a monster) all through the movie so he can continue his experiments (that are boring) which end up with him accidentally becoming a monster and then the scientist's kid ends up becoming a scientist also. It all goes a little downhill from there because the monsters seem to be getting more and more annoying as the movie goes on so there's really no reason for me to continue watching this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is what a terrible movie should feel like:   -The acting is terrible; the two leads are bad at best and they seem to try all the time to be in sync.   If someone tells you they want to be a good actor (they did), then why would you go along with their stupid act? That's like having two people go along singing "Bennie and the Jets" and then one of them starts dancing backwards to "Jail House Rock." If that's what you want to hear, then don't bother with "Pompeii" or with the "Vinland Saga." It's a piece of crap. I'm not saying it should be seen by anyone who has any sense of dignity and is not too stupid to pay attention to what goes on in the background. It doesn't deserve to be seen at all. I'd like to know what the heck this is supposed to be about. Is there any actual reason for the Viking Age? Why should anyone go out and do anything? It's pointless and boring. If you have no idea what it's about, then it's no good.   to the cast: I'm sorry, but I don't believe this film is going to inspire anyone to be an actor. They are both awful at best. The poor girl looks like a child from a sketch that was drawn in the seventh grade (because the little girl is all over the place), and the guy doesn't even know his own name. I thought he was playing some kind of old man for a minute. Also, one time he's supposed to do a speech, so he stands there with his arms over his ears. There are a couple of other lines that need improvement, and one or two that are really funny, and the music is just terrible. The voice talent is not bad, but they all sound so much alike (no one has any distinctive tones). To make a long story short, I'm still not convinced this is some kind  I have to admit I had been looking forward to this film for a long time. I loved the first movie and felt like this was an opportunity to see a little more of the Viking lifestyle. The movie does a great job in showing what life was like as a Norseman. For example, the Vikings do not live alone. All of their family is with them. They do not have a wife and a man in charge of the house. They don't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is lame, with a cast of characters that is pretty much interchangeable. There are a couple of decent special effects (the opening credits of course), which is nice, but the actual plot is pretty bad. The hero, a tough cop with a big gun, has been arrested for rape, and after he is bailed out by a sexy, pretty blonde, he escapes (by a miracle) and joins a band of desperados. When they capture some Russian gangsters (all tough guys), he starts a gang war against them, which goes bad after a series of events in a bar (in the middle of a bank heist), and he ends up a prisoner. He is taken in by a female gangster, and we are introduced to a bunch of other prisoners with the same name. None of them get any development, and one of them is played by a guy with a bad voice who doesn't seem to have a good acting career. The whole gangster plot never ends.   One of the most unoriginal movies in a movie genre that is full of unoriginal films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were many good things about this, but the acting is the one thing that really killed it.  That, and the story itself was too much like an overpriced children's fantasy story:  There's an old lady who has a magic ring on her finger.    The ring makes anything that happens to her become real.  The most popular and successful magician is jealous of this ring and is going to try to steal it from her to make money.  His assistant is a fat, greedy, arrogant witch and she loves all things fairy tale.    But they are the only things in this movie, that made me cringe.  There were a couple of decent fights and we had a good chase scene, but I never felt like it was a true chase.  I know that it may not mean much, but it just didn't make sense and I wasn't interested in what was going on with the characters.  Also the acting was awful, and I was never able to make out any of the lines except for one thing I heard.  It was a joke.  And, while it has its good points, if a child is in this it will probably be traumatized:   I won't go any further, but if you read the reviews from those who I mentioned before the movie is terrible.  You know the reviews and if you don't believe them then try watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My God, the "Pumpkin Pimps"  sucks.  And not just because it's a horrible movie that's full of bad acting and awful plot.  I know I didn't expect much from a movie based on this book.  But I was disappointed.  This movie is based on the book by "Punkin' John," who's a "pumpkin patch boss."  The movie is very well made for a movie but it has no real story line.   The idea that these "pimp" pimps are good looking guys who just happen to be poor and black?   This is why I didn' like the movie the most.  These characters are all stereotypes.  They act like stereotypical black men.  All of them are loud.  Their eyes all look like they've been filled with water.  The other characters don't even look like black people so I could never take them seriously.  This movie is a "no, but it'll show you how good it is" movie that shows you how bad it is  The plot of the film is very poor.  At the end of the movie all of the pimps seem to be very rich which just adds insult to injury.    The best part of the story is the characters, they're all very flat.  Every one of them is a bad example of a black character.  One of them, Mr. Jones, is so bad at being black, he's a poor white guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To start off, this movie is not even bad by a long shot. I actually thought it was good, although it was a little slow going. It didn't take long for it to start getting really bad, but then again, there was no action, no violence, no drama. No nothing. And there is a good reason for that. The story is about a little boy who lives with his mom. He likes to read books but is often teased by his sister about his reading habits. One day, he decides to read a book about a wolf, but there isn't a wolf in it. This causes him to be upset and he doesn't like it. Then, the wolf in the book is actually a girl named Bambi. She is not just a girl, she is actually Bambini the wolf. (I really thought that was a good idea at first, so it wasn't weird.) Once Bambino is old enough, she and her dad move into a new home, which turns out to be the place where the wolf lives. I felt sorry for the Bambinos, they were pretty sad at times. The wolf has a crush on one of the Bamba's and she gets very jealous when that boy tries to be nice to her. The whole movie was pretty much a mess. So the movie ended with a pretty good song, but this is a bad, bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The script is awful. The director, William Fichtner, did a terrible job casting. He wanted to give one of the leads a very French name. She was supposed to be French. And he couldn't think of a funny name for her, so he just gave her French. If you're French, you're not funny in a scene like that. She's supposed to do the funny stuff (she can't) and when she tries to start off, it just turns into one long scene where she's singing to a choir. The music is great. But the other actress (Sandy O'Connell) doesn't seem to like the acting. She doesn't like anything. It's just awful. You expect the good to win. You don't get that here. The movie is about a French teacher who gets a kid who's been beaten for not showing a good time. If that is bad, what was worse was the ending. The teacher gives a kid a bad paper, and the kid is forced to take his own life. The scene is terrible. There's a kid there, and all he does is cry. And at the very end, the kid's in the woods, crying all over again. It is horrible.  The director was going to try his luck with some western actors... The movie has a little extra something. The score is great, and while it has its problems, it has that "Bing Crosby" sound. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You could call this a remake. I saw this when I was 6 years old and this was the first movie I ever saw about two boys who went to the forest to get wood. The first movie was the worst! It had terrible characters, no music, and no sound at all. The remake is good but it is not as good. The characters are more likable, the story line is more interesting, and the sound is better. However, it just didn't make my top 20.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went to see this movie on opening night at the local multiplex. This was the second movie I ever saw of him. I saw the first one at a movie palace and was not very impressed. I had hoped for a different story from the first movie but this one was just another cliched romance. I know he has a new look but the old man is still in charge. There is no story, no romance, and nothing to like about this movie. I think it has been done before. There are some very cute girls in the movie, who are all wearing glasses. Some of them are very pretty and have really pretty features. The one I liked the best was the black-haired one. When he says that she is the sweetest girl he's ever seen she looks like a doll. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing this movie with my dad when I was about 12 or 13, it is about a boy and a girl who are in a car accident, they are both in wheel chairs and the girl's father, he's a preacher, decides to take them to a local church for the first time ever since he and the mother got divorced and he is the pastor there.    The first thing I noticed is the girl is very attractive (in a young girl way), she has great body and is very petite as well.  The boys also seem really smart, as for some reason they always ask questions to the parents about how many kids there are (they are twins), the girl seems to be good at playing the guitar as well, I think that is how she got into this job, the boy is a little boy like I said earlier, I noticed that the parents seem to really love their son and when he tells them about how he lost his arm in a rock fall, I was amazed.  As for the story, the movie starts off very strange, they start out getting in a very weird car accident and then a few days later the girl (played by a very young Jennifer Love Hewitt) wakes up in a hospital, she has no idea who she is nor where she is.  Her father (played pretty much by Michael Wincott) and her brother (played a little kid by a pre-teen Kevin Bacon) are all there to visit her.  When the kid asks to go to a party they all go along, the one thing that stood out to me was how the father treated the kid while he was there. The only thing I don't understand was the fact that it was very clear that the girl was his daughter since when they met she was very young.  The father had a whole thing about how they should not have a party and they shouldn't come along, but all of a sudden all of that changes, the kid and the dad decide to go on a road trip to get away from the pestering father.  They stop at a motel and a homeless man stops the car and asks for help, I'm not sure what happened but the homeless man gets a little too close to her and they both start kissing.  I really liked the part where he started getting drunk, he went a little berserk and starts trying to kiss her, she pushes him away and he starts getting pissed, but then it turns out
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is like "E.T. The Extra Terrestrial" on mushrooms, with the good acting from both sides, and bad acting from the other... This is what happens when one is an idiot; bad acting, bad script, poor directing, and a lack of quality. The only good thing about the movie is that it will get you laughing, not only is the acting good, the comedy is good, and the script is actually good, though the story is terrible. - April 25, 2005WTF?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible. The writing is so bad its laughable. The actors are not good. They are forced to act as one group of guys that is trying to kill another group of people. It's really not an action movie. It is the story of three high school friends who live together, who decide to spend the weekend by themselves to kill each other. One day at a camping trip they get to talking and decide they should kill each others parents. It turns into the most unenjoyable movie you will ever see. There are no stakes. Nothing happens. No danger to anyone. The bad guys are so stupid. The main bad guy (the good guy is always dead when he does something stupid) is so stupid and over the top. The characters are all the same: over the dumb, over the annoying, over everyone talking about everything they think they know. And that's all there is to it. I give this film a 4/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When it comes to films like this it is no surprise. This is an evil, corrupt, wicked, depraved, and disgusting movie. The most disgusting character is a woman who makes a living stealing babies from other mothers. They are all in great condition and taken to a place of torture where they are killed, cooked up, and then eaten. You can almost hear the screams of the babies in this film. The other characters are a bunch of ugly, ugly-faces. They all have little hair, ugly teeth, little noses, and small feet. When they are alone they are usually hiding, and when they are together they're all hiding. Even when they're walking they're hiding. No wonder they call this "the ugly sisters" movie. When the big villain (who looks like a little old lady) has a run-in with a little boy, and the big nasty woman's son (who has a tiny little girl) comes up and slaps the little girl hard, the little boy gets so mad at this that he kicks the big ugly woman's child in the teeth. What are you supposed to do? A man is standing up for a little girl and getting a big slap in the face. I can just imagine little girls being made to watch this kind of thing on an endless loop. The main bad guy has all kinds of terrible and evil powers. His biggest weapon is a huge club (which he throws over his shoulder) and he can throw it with his eyes closed. This makes it one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. If he gets angry or upset in a scene, his eyes shut like a light and the next thing you know he has his club up behind his back. I didn't see how he could do that because you don't have much room over your head in a movie like this. It's a big and scary, evil, and evil film. I'm sick of these movies. And I was sick of this movie when it came out.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a good movie. I liked this movie the first time because it was a nice little story about two kids in the woods who are just doing their thing. But after one of them gets abducted and I think it could have been a little more of a twist and I thought maybe there should have been more of the "good" stuff in it because you could tell that both were just doing this for a while (one of them I think was just testing the waters by trying to get a little too much of a high with a pretty young boy she was flirting with in the forest) and she got really excited about the other boy she knew was there too which got a little bit boring. But I liked how they were doing this stuff in the backwoods. It was like a fairy tale to me. I guess I don't like fairy tales as a rule but it seems like a good idea to have these two be orphans and then get abducted by the same old evil wizard. Then you meet some of the other good people who have nothing but good intentions (and good hearts) who just happen to be bad (and bad) people as well and this thing just gets worse. They get captured by evil wizards and then the wizard has a bit of a "mad scientist" type deal about them because it would seem like they would have fun with their new toy. I don´t know what happened to be honest. There is no ending and it's really kind of a waste of money. That´s why I gave it only 2 out of 4 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In order to get a good laugh out of a bad film, you'd think the director and writer would have looked at the worst possible roles to play (a young man in his early 20s, an old woman with a long dead husband), a bit more thought would have been put into the casting of the two actors, and maybe, just maybe they would have had the guts to take the screenplay into the realm of comedy.  You can't write a joke that's only going to get one laugh. _____________________________________________________ I saw this a while back on a Saturday night.   It was in the same theater I saw The Best of the Best (another terrible movie).  The only real difference between these two movies is that the one in a theater was about to be shown on Sunday, so people in the theater were watching it earlier.  This was the first film from the director of Bad Boys  and as far as the writing goes, I found it to be as bad as I remembered it.  It had lots of funny scenes and jokes, but a lot more of these were done by a young actor who was a bit too stupid to carry the picture, and a great big old man was playing a character who was not all that different from the one I remembered from the best of the best.  A guy and his family are watching TV, when he sees something that causes the old man to go into a rage, and the kids are terrified.  While this movie was awful, it wasn't as bad that the Best of The Best was, but it was as embarrassing as ever.  The dialogue was terrible, and most of the humor is pretty generic.  I can't say anything bad about the picture; it has nothing new to offer except a laugh, and I don't think this is a picture that can deliver much humor.  I just saw this in the movie theater.  My wife told me that she just got off the plane.  One of the last pictures to get picked up by a movie theater on a Friday. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really don't understand what the author was trying to do with this story. I read the reviews and found them so silly. I just don't think that the author took any real steps to write a good story. This is just a series of random actions to try to be interesting. And yes I know it sounds dumb but the author should not be given credit as a story writer for this one. This story is not worth your time. Just a waste of your time and money. I hope you all like it!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a good movie with a bad story. A young woman is raped, by a policeman and her boyfriend. She gets a gun and tries to shoot the police to prove a point. She does it, but a soldier shoots at the bullets and kills the girl and her new boyfriend. And the cop, the policeman tells the girl that she should be ashamed of herself and that she would be better off killed than going on living and being raped. The film is about a young girl who has a gun which she wants to kill a policeman who has been raping her. I enjoyed it, it is fun.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a very simple but very funny movie. The humor seems to be mostly derived from the title's wordplay: the film is about a little boy who is an expert crooner, who is playing a performance, in front of his schoolmates. There are two bullies, and a girl who tries to bully them. I've never seen a character so pathetic: he's a sad-sack, with an absolutely awful voice, and is constantly trying to get attention from others. The school principal is an even more pathetic character: he tries to ignore the bullies, but there is a moment where he tries unsuccessfully to take the kid to the principal's office for a report. In the first place, this is quite funny: it is funny to see a principal get annoyed by a little kid! (Actually it is hard not to get bored while watching this). In the second place, it is quite pathetic how the kids, who are supposed to be all very different from each other, constantly try to look like each other: the little boy always tries to look young, the girls are always a bit prettier, while the guys are usually a little more muscular. But of course, the joke doesn't hold.   The most stupid thing in the whole movie is, that all the kids are wearing the same clothes every single scene, with the exception of the principal: he is the only one with a different outfit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was so bad, I wanted to throw it up, and then I went home to find it sitting in front of my door.  I don't even wanna think about how much work goes into this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! I thought I had heard bad things about this movie (I was thinking of the reviews by the critics who rated this movie 4 out of 5 stars and wrote about its great cinematography) - I was really surprised when I had this movie. I had a great time watching this movie - there is a few bad moments and this movie is a little repetitive but still has a great sense of humor. This movie may be a little too violent (there were a lot of scenes that would be considered hard to watch in any other kind of movie) but I was able to laugh during all the parts that I was supposed to feel disturbed by. I like to think of it as a combination of a western and a war movie. The only things that are a bit strange are the "clap and holler" scene and the fight between two young men in which one of the young men gets his head broken and there was nothing funny about that - it was a bad fight! I think it was worth at least a shot (like The Last Temptation of Christ, which I liked a lot).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I will admit it's not a great movie, the acting is terrible and so is the whole scene where they have to kill a guy with a lawnmower that's a piece of junk that's been around forever and nothing has changed about that, I didn't realize until I watched the video online that the man was killed by a lawn mower which is a real piece of crap, I guess it was the director's idea of a cheap shock but the poor actors failed to impress. A typical "filler" movie, it was fun at first but then I found out that in order to keep the movie going, the actors have to stay in character throughout the whole movie, that is, the same every second of the movie, but the acting really takes a nosedive during the last 20 minutes when the characters really go too far and make one-liners. This kind of movie is the worst thing that a person can watch. Watch it and see it to believe it. I think if any other movie were to be made like this, it would be one of my favorites on the list, a great flick with bad acting and bad script, the only one that comes close would probably be "The Dead Zone" which I love a lot.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is not that good, it's really really bad. It's all about a young girl who is being possessed by a spirit in her apartment, and she goes to the local church, and there's this really sad, sad scene where the pastor asks Jesus to stop him and to go away. The film follows a long shot and a couple of shots of the girl's face and back, and the last shot of the film is her face again, still possessed by the spirit.  The film was actually made in the 50s/60s.    I have heard there are some bad versions out there, I've seen them, but this is not one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing about this movie is the voice. And I'm not sure if that's because she didn't do any research on the show or because she simply hasn't come up with a better voice for her character. The worst thing about it was a lot of times the movie didn't need the comedy to work. It didn't even need the jokes. It just wanted to be funny. The only thing that can get a laugh out of me in this movie was when a guy with a giant mustache walks in on this girl and a little boy playing with a big stuffed cat. He tells them he wants to help. They're surprised. We get this guy who is an evil ogre that is going to take over the world and the guy with the giant mustache who is a good guy. Then we have another person that the little girl is dating. And he is this ugly ogre that walks in and tries to take this girl away from him and also a boy that is about to get married. Then they make some stupid fight scenes so that the kids are scared so that he can make his big move on them. The big move is getting on top of the building and then he gets a huge explosion on his head so that they can both die. They fall to the ground, and the girl gets her eye knocked out, and then the little boy falls down into a pit. When the two boys come back up, they have lost both their parents. Then one of the boys gets out of the pit and says, "How can we get away from that guy?" The other boy says, I don't know. He just got hit by a car and he's lost his momma. Then the other guy comes in and says they must escape him. And then they make a run for it. And you're thinking, "I don't see why they had to go to all the trouble to get away. Why didn't they just leave the guy alone? How can he possibly get any more evil? You're supposed to feel bad about him getting more evil and more evil things. I don no see how they're going to catch this guy. If they want to have a little adventure and make a movie about being an ogre, then go for it, but the movie isn't even good." This is probably the most poorly made movie I have ever seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** Bad movie with a terrible director. The plot is very dumb and is poorly written. Not funny at all. The characters are horrible and some of the jokes are offensive. I've seen it so many times and still can't get a laugh out of it. There is nothing funny about the movie. It's just bad. The ending is extremely unsatisfying. I guess I won't be looking forward to this movie as much as I used to.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "In the year 2014, a group of friends set out to find the perfect party to kick off New Years Eve.   It turns out that the perfect house party would look better in person." - The New Yorker   Well, at least it's a good looking movie. But then it seems this movie is an excuse for the director of it to go through with his own ideas about how to tell a story. A story so bad I can't stand to watch it again. It's about what seems like a family of vampires who have all but conquered the world. The vampires make their living by collecting human blood and turning it into drinkable blood, they are very violent with their vampires (although most of the movies seems to be like the best part of a vampire movie. It gets a little more interesting when some vampires begin to take their jobs seriously. As it says, most of it is just blood suckers.)   But the bloodsucking vampire hunters are not all that interested in their work. They prefer to kill human prey (usually just for the fun of it) and enjoy to tease the vampires about what it would be like to be one of them. A vampire hunter is a vampire hunter, a vampire has to be able to kill or be killed, so being one isn't a fun thing. It has become part of the routine with the vampires. The first person to die in one of these vampire hunting parties is usually a human hunter. He is a good guy who has his own set of problems that he faces with this job. One of these problems is that the vampire hunters find their prey very entertaining, the hunters themselves are quite entertaining. If nothing else, they play around with the vampire's prey.   is the first part of it. It opens with a nice prologue to the story. It shows us that the vampires have all of the technology and supplies necessary to dominate the world of humans. But there are still humans out there, they try to hold onto the little that they have left of civilization and use it to keep from falling under the vampire rule. One hunter has a little luck when he is able to capture a vampire and has the opportunity to interrogate him in human form.  I was a little hesitant with what I thought of this one. It seems a little too much like a bad film to get me excited. It also seems to start right off with a bad guy killing the protagonist, then we are introduced to the vampire
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would rather spend the rest of my life with my dead wife, and a good one too.    I thought I knew my wife, I thought we were a great couple and she was an excellent cook.  I don't know what it was that was so wrong about the movie, it had a good script, good acting and the romance was hot.  But there was no love in the movie.  I was laughing throughout, there was nothing funny about it, nothing that made me smile or even want to know if it was really happening.    It was like watching a porn movie, the only funny thing was when she was wearing a diaper and he wasn't even the least bit surprised or happy that her daughter was born.  The movie left me thinking that I really don't want my wife to have sex with another man, what would her life be like?   This movie really didn't bother me but I have to admit that I had to stop to think how the movie even got approved to be released.  How many movies get approved that I am forced to watch?  But I gave it a go and I think it is a bit creepy for an adult movie to try to make me smile by having a hot wife with a big dick.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "In a world ruled by evil, a boy named Luke (played by Hayden Christensen) sets out on a search for the magic sword of Justice." I love this flick, especially the action scenes.  It's almost as if it is a real sword-fight; it's a battle with the villains, as well as a battle between good and evil.  I've always been a fan of martial arts.  The fights are well choreographed, and it seems that Christensen is constantly switching weapons.  It's a little over the top, but it adds to the fun.   The only thing I wish was improved were some more cool costumes; I like how Luke's outfits look, but his clothes are a little bit too skimpy.  I was also a little disappointed that Christensen doesn't have any other lines.  Luke's girlfriend, Gwen (Rene Russo) would be a great addition, and this is one of the rare movies where the girl is a good girl.  Her character seems to have some problems, but she is a fun character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I had to pick one film that was worth saving, it would have to be this one. For me, the film was not bad by any means; it was just a sad story of a woman who was abandoned at the young age of 6 or 7 in the middle of an open-casket funeral, and she has been raised by strangers ever since. She goes through a sad life of trying to survive on the street and make her family. It was actually one of the first films I watched that had a strong female lead, but this one is definitely the one to go to if you want to see how a mother really looks like when she is a drug addict. There is a lot of violence in this film: one of my favorite scenes is when the mother is chasing after the man with a knife (after she throws the knife down and knocks him down).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the kind of movie that I've been dying to see since I first heard about it at a school show several years back.   This is an interesting story, and while there is a lot of violence I never expected the movie to be so intense. The violence is mostly from the characters, mostly involving the women of the team.   I was also a bit disappointed in the women on the team, as we are not given enough time to get to know them, and we see very little of their personalities. Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but only when it's for the women.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would give it a "C+" but with a very short running time that was too short, it was rather boring for an old western movie. If you're a fan of Western movies and you like the old Western movies of the 50's like "Rio Bravo", "The Outlaw Josey Wales" and "Wild Bill Hickok" then this is a movie for you.  The plot: The story starts with two characters, one is a western soldier who's looking for a missing horse which has eluded him for a few days, he finds it in a ravine but it turns out to be just a dead horse. He finds the woman who was riding it, an outlaw named Josey Williams who is very sick, but he's willing to help the man find the horse in order to find the people who killed him. This isn't your ordinary Western movie, it's a film about a dying outlaw who just wants to survive.  The other character is a young woman named Lottie who is on the run with a runaway young man named Frank. They find a place to stay in a small village and Frank is able to find a horse for them to ride, so he sets out with Lott-Ellie. They stay there and find they have nothing but bad luck. After their troubles the young man gives up on Frank and goes with Lett-Ellis to find out the reason that his horse was so ill. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A young boy, the son of a well-to-do Jewish family from Cleveland, has a dream that one night he will be the son-in-law of a rich and famous American tycoon. He is sent on a mission to become the president of the United States of America. I think the movie was well-conceived, even if its plot is a little ridiculous.   There's a bit of humor, a little music and quite a bit...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Weird! The characters are ridiculous and the plot is nonsensical. I would not be surprised if it was an hour long movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If the movie had some potential, it fell flat on it's face. There were way to many "I told you so's" in the ending that made the movie almost unbearable. I wish I had seen the director's last 2 films.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts with an eerie music that sets the tone of mystery and intrigue. When we first see our protagonists, they are at a train station, waiting to get off. They are having a conversation with an old woman and she speaks of the "hauntings" she's seen on her journey in the country. I liked the premise of this and I found it very interesting. I've read about the haunted houses and I can remember them clearly as I'm old enough to remember them. This could even be a modern remake of 'The Conjuring' as in the beginning the old lady says a spell and everyone at the train station goes mad (the movie even uses a similar style of ghostly music). However I found this premise a bit cliché and it's an old wives story. I found the characters were generic and didn't interest me for much of the time. For example, there were lots of guys around as it seemed the only character in the movie was a man. I wish that more could have been done to differentiate the characters and give them some personality, but the film didn't get very far so I won't dwell too much. 8.5/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~ So. This movie is bad. The characters are not very good. The acting is awful and the story is a mess. The special effects in the movie are horrible. The soundtrack sucks. And the ending (as I said before) is bad as well. I'm not sure what the point is to the movie since the movie doesn't even try to give anything to an audience. All it does is take you to another part of the movie. I didn't like this one. I would have preferred a better version of this movie with good actors. I know some people will like this. I don't like it. I gave the 3 rating because of the good acting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was about a man whose son, a marine, goes to Afghanistan and gets killed in a bomb explosion. He returns, and decides to kill himself. His wife has an affair with the local Taliban leader, and he has to go on a killing spree so they can get back together. The only problem is that his wife is about 10 years younger than him and they're both too old to be married to each other. This leads to some funny moments, such as when he gets a tattoo of a female head on his back and the movie ends with him looking at a picture of his wife on his lap and looking sad. It wasn't that bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most terrible and boring movie I ever saw. If you think it's funny, you haven't been paying attention. The film starts with an elderly woman, (that's me) and her boyfriend making love. She's very sexy and her sex appeal is a huge turn off. The old lady is dying and the boyfriend convinces her to do everything for him for their last couple days. The sex never happens again.   Well I thought that was it, this movie was as boring as can be and the old ladies sexiness (if that is even a word) was such a letdown.  Souvenirs from a failed movie: I am so glad that the remake didn't turn out the way I thought it would...the first movie I saw was an epic mess that I really don't want to sit down and watch again. It's one of those movies that is just too bad to last even one second. It has the usual bad acting, the acting being so bad that it was actually funny to watch and it has that kind of cheesy ending that will make you cringe when you watch it again.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The film I had in mind was The Matrix (1999)... but they took all the good parts from it.  The worst aspect of the entire movie is the ending.  It was a perfect twist ending to an already predictable movie...but it didn't feel like a true twist as it was only a reenactment to the first movie."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After a few laughs I had to turn it off...it had lost its funny value as if someone in the studio had been drinking. There are far better movies out there, and I wouldn't have any more than two minutes of my life wasted watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can't think of any better ways to get a bad review than to review the bad movie of a mediocre director!   The director of this movie is a very good director, but there is NO WAY in HELL this is gonna make it to the big screen!  The movie is not that good and the plot is pretty bad as well.   It is pretty boring and nothing happens, which is a shame because this is supposed to be a movie that is supposed be a parody of movies that are made today.  This is a stupid movie for a stupid director! I can see the whole movie, and that is enough for me to give it a bad rating! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an okay film.  The story was not overly interesting and the writing is not as crisp and clear as it could have been.  The script is the same crap we have seen countless times before: a young boy, a group of friends,  but this time in a village with a lot of trees and a very dark past. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was a waste of time because it was made as a promotional stunt.   A man (played by Mark Hamill) and a woman (played in her movie by Jennifer Jason Leigh) go out for a romantic weekend.   They get in a fight and the guy's gun goes off, fatally wounding the woman.   This was all done for the movie to get a decent amount of press when it was released.   It didn't work at all.   I found the film to be uninteresting and the romance to be contrived.   There is only one scene at the end in which he says to her: "But I love you" and she says "I love you too."   I guess that's something.   Mark HamILL was wasted on this movie.   (For more information, see my review of The Lost Weekend.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!! This movie is nothing more than a rip-off of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The Chinese actress in the lead role, Wang Li, has a bad accent, but you can tell you're in the movie because there are only 2-3 scenes with anything worth talking about. Not a whole lot to say about this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The script, the direction, the acting and the costumes. This is a very bad movie. The actors don't do their jobs well at all and they're all just mediocre. Even the director and the writer should be fired, if the movie was made with talent, no one would pay to see this movie. Not one movie in the last 10 years was so bad that I would see it, and this is one of them. Watch it for the scenery, and the bad acting, it's pretty good scenery.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a good bad movie, and it's really, really fucking hard not to like it.  Holly Hunter is a really attractive woman with a great body that is pretty fit, and very well set to look great in the role of a sexy blonde whore.  She is so perfectly cast that her part feels real and real like a real sex scene.  The acting is good and the whole movie is a lot of fun.  It is really about a bunch of people in the military that are getting out of one of these little "special ops" ships that carry nuclear warheads.    The ship gets hit with a little earthquake and the people are trying to escape.  They need to stay where they are for a very long time until some people get off the ship and the others get off a lot sooner.  When everyone gets off they're all very, very, fucked up.  There is the usual military bullshit which is sort of a parody of bad military things.  But it's also a very dark and intense movie.  This movie is good at being funny and at being sad.  I wouldn't say it's a great movie, I would just call it good.  If you like this movie then you really should check out the next one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "A young boy discovers a magical, mysterious island with a mysterious, evil queen on it. She's pretty smart and wicked in a cute little way." I love this movie. So cute and cute and so cute and then there's the badness. This movie takes a good thing and mashes it together with something else. The Queen in this movie is so cute but is really a bad person. Her evil deeds are so obvious that it makes you think twice about anything she does and there's also something about her voice that makes me very uncomfortable. This is a bad, evil, ugly little movie. Watch the kids, but be careful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A little over one hour and a half in I just got tired of it.  The writing is terrible and so is the acting.  But this is not a bad film but if you want to watch a very slow and boring horror movie then this is a good start.  I am not sure why this is such a great hit in the horror genre but I did like this enough.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! I am very upset that this movie will never be made at all!!!! I watched it on VHS about 10 years ago. I used to be in the movie theater on a regular basis. The theater was so popular that every year the owner had to sell the theater to a larger one. They built the big theater in 1982. I loved this movie. It was really good. I am glad that I saw it. It is one of those "must see" movies! I think that they could have made it in HD as well. I wish that they still had the DVD of this film. I believe it is still available!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this about a year ago and now that I've seen it a second time I'm less impressed and I think I liked it more then I should have. I don't understand why people thought this movie was worth a movie ticket. It's boring, predictable and over-the-top. The only thing that's going to make me watch this movie again is the story it tells. I guess they were trying to capture the excitement that a good "Avengers" movie can bring and I just don't believe it. It really doesn't make sense why these people went to the moon but who cares because we're going to Mars?  This movie is a remake of a film released in the 70s by the same name. I think a movie that I have seen this year that I can rank among the best is "Mars Attacks" which is similar but just not as good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, not sure how to start this review.  I saw "Horseman" last week at a theater in downtown Los Angeles, and it was terrible.  In fact it was so terrible that I went to the restroom and cried myself to sleep.  Even with all that being said, I still watched it because it was pretty interesting.  I will say that the ending left me confused and a little worried.  But overall I enjoyed it. I saw a few trailers for other films that have gotten similar reviews, but this one really is a miss.  My Rating: **** 1 star:   Disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would just like to say a big thank you to all of those people who took the time to leave me a positive review about this movie.   The movie is not bad at all.  It is a comedy with some drama.  While there is drama a little too much, I think that could be due to the fact that the director, Chris Columbus, had just been hired to direct the new film in the Indiana Jones franchise.  To have a great movie like that, even if it was not the best movie in the series, was a great achievement for Christopher Columbus, and I am sure it will stand the test of time as long as it is seen today.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is about a family living in a small city in a rural setting. The father has a hard-working, smart, loving family. His wife is a very intelligent woman. They are also good people. There is an uncle who works as a farmer's son who has a great life, but is a total loser in the family. A son who loves animals as well. He has his own ranch, which he also works on, he makes his family very wealthy, he is very nice to people, who he thinks are nice, he has a loving wife, who is the head woman in the whole family. The husband is a loser as well as the father. The only two good guys in the film are the uncle and wife, whose wives also love animals. The rest of the characters are all stupid. Their wives have no sense of humor, as they are all in bed all the time. Their uncle has no money, but the family is still good. This kind of movie was popular as far back as the 80's. It just needs to be done better. That is what I hope to do with my review!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a disappointment.  I could have cared less about the characters because it is clearly a terrible movie, but then there was a bit of weirdness with the aliens, who are actually not aliens.  they are called "hippies".   This makes for a nice story about a hippie named Jack and his girlfriend, whose name is not explained.  After the events with Jack and the hippies, it's revealed that Jack is really a high school teacher.  He tells the kids about their parents, and they have bad dreams about their fathers.  The ending is very unsatisfying and I hope that they don't do anything with this movie.  I had to sit through at least 5/10 of the movie, because it just dragged.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The director is quite a talented person. However, his direction is often bad and uninteresting. Many times the character actors are in bad situations and the acting is pretty bad. The story can be funny, but the plot doesn't go anywhere interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I was a kid, I'd spend all day playing computer games. As a kid in the 90's, playing "Crisis On Infinite Earths" was a great way to spend my time, and this game was pretty good too. I remember getting to play with the aliens and their abilities in the early stages and it's pretty fun to play as them. I had no idea what was about to happen. The game has a lot of different levels. It's pretty hard at first when you don't know how to do anything. They have many different kinds of weapons and power-ups. You have to learn how to use them. There are a lot more levels than in the original. It also is a lot better when the controls are not so complex. But still, it's not very fun when you have to memorize things, when you can just play as yourself. The soundtrack is pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's so much I want to break down and cry. I wanted to see this movie to start to finish, it started and ended like crap. What could possibly go right in a movie like this? A little kid (the little girl) is sent by her mom to live with her father on the big island of Hawaii after her mother is killed. But, the mom (the older) doesn't seem to be around. The little girl is taken to her big family's compound and lives there with her step-mother and two brothers (all older than her and a little older than the little girl). Her father goes to work and the other kids are all out doing stuff like it's their job. One day the young girl (the big girl) meets an old man who seems very nice to her. When the old man goes home for lunch, the old girl meets a boy who she decides to play with since he's been a big help for her in the past. The boy turns out to be the villain of the story, the "little devil". The evil little devil wants to kidnap the big girl (in the picture) and keep her in his huge tree house on the side of the hill. The big girl has to try to get away from him by fighting him off with all her strength and cunning. She makes it to the top of the tree house, where she sees an old house full of old people. She's pretty sure that she can escape from them by climbing up there and out onto the roof. But she can't climb down to the bottom, and one of the old people gives her a stick that will help her get up. As she's climbing up, a bunch of guys come and throw the old folks out of the house (in a very brutal manner). The other kids (youngers than the girl) go off and try to find the big child so they can get to her and help her. The girls get to the roof, but the big devil has an iron grip on her and is trying to pull her down. The whole movie is just ridiculous. The movie starts with a bad song and a slow moving dance number by the "dancing boys" (they have nothing). They have an opening number where they dance, they sing a bad, unoriginal song, they fight a bunch in a bunch scene, they have a dance number with a couple of girls and a boy, they all have a few jokes (just a couple)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit that I was a little disappointed with this film. Not enough special effects or effects that were necessary to complete the story. The story is a typical story that you have seen many times before. It is very generic that we are looking for a woman who has a dream about her dead father. She wants to find him, but the man isn't dead. He does not like her and tries to keep her from finding him. At the end we get another story with her father, this time it is sad because of a fire at the house that his wife was killed, and then we have another story of the fire with him again. The ending was a bit forced and the ending to the first part made me a little annoyed. We have a story that is not too complicated that you can tell it from a picture or you can skip it and just enjoy the good pictures. It would be great if the producers would have made a special effects for the third story, but then again, we have had this story for about 10 years. We had a very good movie about a person who keeps dreaming about death, but sadly his dream never comes true.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My wife's (we have a daughter) wedding day was the day this was on, we watched it with my daughter, she didn't want to watch it, she was crying and my wife wanted it, well we had it.  It's very bad.    The guy who did it does have a good sense of humor, that's for sure.  It's about this big man who has to clean out some caves and he's very big and very powerful, so of course he's not going to be too easy on the other men who are going to try and take down his power, so one of the men just sort of runs his horse and gets off to go clean out his cave.  They're fighting and one of them is very, very strong, and one time when he was fighting off all of them he was about a mile away, but this time he came running back, he had taken out his sword and was slashing at this big guy and one side of him is broken from the fight, so he's getting all pissed off and he decides to just knock him out and then he goes and grabs a big guy by the shirt, holds him up, he's like 'I'm gonna kill ya' and the guy, who was the guy's brother, is standing there, he says 'You don't understand what it's like to fight a man like me, you're a big, strong big dude and I'm not gonna just stand there and let you get by me'.   So this big dude is being very tough and strong and he is knocking out these guys, so they run off to get the princess (one of their lady guests), and then this big fellow just grabs that guy by his pants, he gets a hold of him, he starts to choke him, and the whole time he's saying 'Oh I thought you wanted to die' and this big brother starts to have a mental breakdown, all of a sudden the princess comes running up, she's the princess, she has a sword and she's about to kill this big tough guy, and she yells, 'Stop it!'  She's yelling at him, 'I want you to come out and show me your true worth'.  And when she screams out, this dude just stands there like he doesn't hear anything.  And he starts beating on him and finally this big strong guy breaks free and he falls down, and he gets up and he walks off
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was excited to see the first part of this movie for some years. It's an all-ages flick and if you're into the kind of stuff I'm into (which is very much the latter type), you might like it (and I sure did). But the writing is just plain boring and the acting is just mediocre. There's nothing special about the movie, although there's some nudity for the sake of a joke.  And I wouldn't go so far as to claim the movie's humor is bad.  The story:    As my friend mentioned above, this is one of those "comedy" movies where they're poking fun at bad movies. So the story is about a woman that becomes fascinated by an old man she meets on the bus. They hit it off well enough and she asks him to take her to a movie with her.   The plot is basic, except that the old man doesn't go with her; instead he tells her a good story and then starts to tell her that bad movies are so much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like, this is one of those movies that you'd rather watch a second or third time, just to watch some people do the same things over again, in a different costume. It's just a dumb movie.   I'm sure there are a few people out there who love this kind of cheesy 80's action comedy, but I find it really dull and unoriginal. It might have been better as a bad science fiction story (like Robocop) or an alien horror movie (like Invasion of the Body Snatchers).   Overall, the ending is disappointing, and I don't even like all the characters... at all!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cant watch this movie.  The camera cuts away from the girls and the boys are making out on each other's butts.  This movie should have been a parody of that shitty tv show "Saved by the Bell."  And no, I'm not joking.  The girls are in one of those "we can do anything" highschool cliques, that everyone loves to hate.  There are 4 girls.  They're all in band together, the other girl and the guy are in a band, the guy's a virgin and the girl is a virgin.  I think the only girl actually likes this guy.  If you're a real "B" fan, you'll be disgusted to see the other girls try to steal his girlfriend.  After they broke up, he is invited by the band and they decide to get together again.  It's about 2 or 3 months later, he says to his girlfriend he loves her a lot and that she would "make a great girlfriend."  This goes on for a while and then they get engaged.  And then a few weeks later she's killed in a freak traffic accident.  So they decide they need to move and they start the move to the west coast.  He's a good, but not that good singer.  But he manages to win her affection through his good looks and he gets an apartment with a very hot woman in it.  She tries to kill him in his sleep one night by putting some poison in his sleeping bag and he is saved by the police.  What a hero.  Unfortunately they are moving on, again, and their new house is a dumpster and the other person in the band (who was still alive) tells their drummer to get them out of there because they are going to kill the whole family.  As they are leaving he decides to go to a bar and gets a woman to follow him in the car.  All the band members, including the drummer, are killed by the trashcan people.  Now they are in Los Angeles and he wants to write a great rock opera and they go to play a gig and then he finds a girl and they get married.  These are the things I wanted to see in a movie about people's rock opera.  No musical scores.   This is pretty much what happens! I'd give the movie a B- if they would not kill each other off in the last 10 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this was one great movie, it was just that no one could make any real sense of what was going on in the movie. There was a lot of crazy stuff happening, the whole town was fighting with each other and the main protagonist was a little kid who was also a witch and had a huge, weird, magic staff.   And then there was the whole'magic is real' thing. Then there's a little girl, a little woman... a really, really weird little girl and a really weird, really beautiful man.  What was so awesome is that all the people in this film were just so likable and kind of stupid and funny at the same time, and also it was so well directed and well acted.

In every scene they go from bad to worse to worse, and it's just so slow that I think the script could have been improved by a day or two. But since it's so bad, I guess you could say it's better than a bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!    The plot is about a boy named Gia (Carmine Falcone) living in a poor and depressing part of town. Gia was raised by his alcoholic grandfather (Roddy McDowall) to be a street sweeper. He does all he can to please his grandmother (Gloria Grahame) who can be really mean but he just loves to hang out with his friends. One day the bad neighborhood thugs (David Keith) break into the house to have some fun. GIA finds it hilarious they are in the same gang and they even get to dance and dance and drink together. G. Grahames granddaughter (Bella Devaney) was the one who invited them. But G.Gia's mother, a prostitute, doesn't approve of her daughter having a male friend. They come to Gia's townhouse to find his father (Clifton Webb) and uncle (James Gleeson) all dead. His mother leaves and Gia gets into a lot of trouble and is in great peril. He must make his escape through the sewers. His friend, Dwayne (Joe Spinell) must help him get to safety. G! Gia is one bad movie with a cheesy plot. It's supposed to be funny and even the actors were funny in this one. Unfortunately the movie is over too soon and G. Gieaus has a tough time getting the people to believe he's the bad boy and even that he's actually in trouble. This movie just falls a little flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie opens with a short segment depicting a beautiful woman being raped by a small dog. We don't really care about the woman, not really, we see her again a few minutes later in a bathroom where she is being taken care of by a beautiful girl who is a model for some magazine. The girl is a perfect 10, the movie is pretty short. After that we are in a small town. There is a boy who has a girlfriend that has a dog and she doesn't take it very well. She keeps trying to pull its tail. One day this boy's father decides to take the dog along on vacation for a few days. As the girl goes to clean herself up the dog bites her on her neck. The dog then attacks the girl with no provocation and does some real damage. They are saved when the father arrives with a shotgun and shoots the dog. That's all. There are only a few more scenes in the movie, but they are mostly in flashbacks. There's not much here, though, really.   As for the acting, the girl gets about as much as the boy does in the beginning. She has a nice body, and she's pretty funny as well. There isn't much development in the character, but she does get a little more screentime with the boy's dad later in the film.  , starring Michelle Pfeiffer (Crazy Heart, The Pianist, The Departed), is a rather forgettable film. There aren't any good performances, and the story isn't very original. I guess it was shot during the early 70s, and it doesn't look like much was changed after that. The film was filmed in the same style that was used to tell the story of a young girl raped by one of her pets: a dog. The movie opens early one day in a country cottage, and we don't know much about the girl, besides that she's gorgeous and that her dog's name is the same as her. The camera follows the girl as she walks around her cottage. Then we see that the dog was being used as a tool to punish the girl by tugging at her hair and biting her face. Then the dog's owner shows up, and he is not happy that her pet was being treated so badly. She goes away to the man's family's place, where he lives, and gets to know him better, and her father seems to be a really nice guy
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film had a strange tone, and at times even seemed like a cartoon. I liked the cast and the direction of the film, however the ending was a weak and not so interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst film I've ever seen, except for the worst part: the plot. I can't believe anyone would go to see this piece of trash. The movie's plot is to create a fantasy world, which will contain lots and lots of dinosaurs. In this fictional world, the two main characters, a princess and her dragon, travel through a land where they are forced to fight to protect the people from the evil forces of evil. Unfortunately, they are unable to conquer the evil of the dragons and they are captured. They are then imprisoned in a crystal fortress and slowly, slowly the evil is getting stronger. The main villain is the evil wizard, and he controls the dragons, which also control people, by making them fight each other, so they can have a nice little competition. I had a really hard time trying to figure out the plot in this movie. It's so confusing, and it's impossible to really follow what happens. I couldn't figure out who the good guys were, who the bad guys were. I don't really know who I like in the main characters. I guess I like the princess a little more, but she's kind of annoying. As a film, it's just bad. No one is impressed by it. If anyone wants to go see this, they really shouldn't bother. I gave it a 2, and even though the plot is so confusing to follow, it does contain some good action and I think people would like it. I just hope they don't remake this movie because it would be a waste of time. The Sound: 2/5 This movie doesn't have any real sound to it. There's no vocals or anything. It is just all ambient sound effects. You can only really hear the dialogue with the dialogue box or you can just hear a few of the monsters. The best way I found to hear the sounds is to watch the movie on the computer. I found the sounds by turning the volume down and then watching the video. My Rating: 3/5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's a lot going on here--in a good way! I'm a huge James Cameron fan and this is a true throwback to early films of the same ilk: dark, intense, and beautifully shot. The story follows a group of scientists and their efforts to create a "biological wonder" out of a group consisting of "a dozen or so human beings, each of whom has a different brain structure, a different DNA and an individual personality." I really like the concept and the execution is fine. It takes the formula of a low-budget sci-fi flick--with all that comes with that--and turns it on it's head. It doesn't feel out of place in that era. I didn't care for the film, but I liked the idea. A couple of things I really disliked: the way the main character talks about how she can't remember anything, the constant narration and overuse of the term "we" in the narration, the ending that is just so abrupt and abrupt to the point where it seems like it's been ripped out of the script or something. I suppose we can understand that since this is an homage, they want to mimic the style and the mood of a film from their youth. I can understand wanting to stay true to it's origins, but there are ways to do so without using those terms and then just throwing everything out of whack as it goes. It's a shame really because I'd have given the film a B+...just to avoid the ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â"If the last film in this series wasn't so bad it was at least good enough to entertain the heck out of me for a while." Â A bad movie. There is not a lot of story in this movie. It is a mixture of many different genres, which I liked a lot. The music was a very nice touch. The only problem was the acting.  I had some issues with the acting of the kids. When this movie was at its best, it was very realistic. They were playing a video game.  "We're doing a little bit on our own. There are no other people out here to guide us through this adventure. Â We're going to take a trip into the depths of space and the unknown and we're going on our journey solo.  It's a nice thing to do when the kids are just kids. They're so innocent and innocent.  "    That is all I can think about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As in many other things in life, sometimes what's good in your life will always be overshadowed by what is bad. I like a good time so long as it doesn't cost more than $40. So when the producer announced a movie about an underground baseball team that played in a baseball park with an "underground clubhouse" in the middle of a city, I thought, I could handle anything. Boy, could I not.   I had seen the baseball movie "Trouble" twice (once a half hour movie which I watched when it had its second run in theaters, the second time to show it to a friend after I was able to view it at a friend's house because I had been out in town and I hadn't yet had dinner, but it was a good movie) and both times I couldn't really care for it. But here, this was something different. While this was indeed a very interesting story and some parts even a good comedy (the movie starts pretty slow but grows to a very fun climax about halfway through), at the end the plot was so convoluted that I felt cheated out of what was supposed to be so fun and good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's one of the worst zombie movies I've ever seen, not only because it makes no attempt to scare me, but also because it doesn't make any sense at all.  You wouldn't think it would be a hard film to make, given how many zombies have been ripped out of the headlines lately.    It's actually worse than the first Zombie: Resurrection, the sequel to the 1978 original.  A bunch of guys are out hiking when they get attacked by zombies.  So basically we have four guys camping, trying to kill zombies. There are many more things wrong with this movie, but I really couldn't go back and watch it over the years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first heard this, I assumed it was a one-shot. Then I realized it wasn't, and I was like:   Holy crap. This is a great horror movie! It is a slow, scary, but fun horror movie. There are some good twists throughout, and some interesting moments. It is also a very unique (and creepy) movie! I loved it!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think that the bad reviews about this movie are justified for two reasons: 1) it's a film that doesn't do any of it's own thing. It just has a couple of bad moments here and there but nothing to make you think it could be anything other than a bad science fiction film from the 70's. 2) It's kind of funny and it's not even that bad. It's a little bit too long (it takes a little over 60 minutes to get to the end) and some of the sequences are kind of silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie when it first came out and I thought "well, that's a pretty bad movie." But once you watched it a few more times, it started getting really bad. The story follows one of the three brothers who are trying to get to the top of the food chain. I like how this movie has a strong point of view - the whole story is told from the point of views of all the other members of the gang. I just thought the story didn't flow well for me, and it wasn't as good as the other two brothers in the movie. However, the other brothers are pretty great and there is a bit of action going on at one point, so I guess it isn't too bad. There is a scene where one of them takes a bath and the other brother (who is really ugly in my opinion) tries to kill him, and we see him go to the bathroom at different angles to get in better position. The scene is really pretty bad in my mind, it is really bad for a soap opera.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is one of those films that makes you feel that a movie cannot go wrong, and when you do, you really feel like it has gone very wrong. This is a film that is about the aftermath of a brutal attack on a couple. It is not a very good film in the sense that it lacks a certain quality that allows us to take in the whole of it. The whole film is full of violence, and it is just the way these characters are drawn. The film is very much not about anything or anyone that is a main character. In fact there is no main character and in fact there are two characters that do not get the screen time that is due to them being in love. These two characters are also not played by talented actors and they are just there as a means to an end. And that does not stop them from being despicable and in no sense of the word, likable. The entire film is about this couple being attacked by these two men because there is a man who has a vendetta against them. This vendetta is that they are married to somebody else and this is not what he wants, so he is going to get what he has wanted for a long time. You will see the couple being raped and beaten and even killed. And this is just a small sample of the abuse that these people take that is not shown. This film is not very good but it is also not bad. That is really all I have to say about this movie. It has all the makings of a good film that should have been so much more. I cannot praise it too highly but it at least has a lot going for it in the way that it should have. It did give us a good laugh while it was at it though.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "He did a very good job there. I felt very at home."   One day, I'm at a party and a bunch of friends come over. They don't bother me and leave the party, but I'm bored and I decide to go downstairs and have some fun. I see the bathroom and see a poster of the movie: "THE BROS... IN THE WINDOW." I say: "Well, I saw a preview for this movie. Why do you think that? The whole movie's inside the window! But you'll never find out, of course. That window has been shut and bolted since the last fire in 1959. I mean, the last house fire in the neighborhood. There used to be a big tree there, but it fell a few years ago. There was a movie theater in the building, I think. It burned down, too, so that is why we never saw an "A" movie in this theater..."  I leave the room and walk to the kitchen for a drink of coffee. At the other end of the apartment building, there's a great big window, and this movie is projected on it. It's supposed to be an aerial shot, but in my mind's eye, I see that the stars look like they're going under water, or a waterfall. The stars look small and insignificant as the rain falls upon them, and I'm glad I'm not alone there. It was a good, cheap movie but I don't think it was a great picture.. The actors just don't make much of an impression, like they don't seem very happy to be up there. I was only one of the few people who saw it. There's one guy in the movie who's great, and his name is Billy the Kid. I didn't like him at all. But that's no way to judge a movie, is it?   The movie is about a lot of things, but what I'd like to know is, how can a movie of this type make a lot more money when it has very few parts? The actor who plays the Sheriff, who is dressed up like a cowboy, was supposed to play him in the real part of a real sheriff, or at least as real as a real actor can be. And the actor who played the old lady who hangs around with the Sheriff's wife was supposed too play her in the picture. There wasn't a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just saw this movie at the local AMC theaters. I went because a friend told me about it. I loved this movie. This is a great flick. The story is about two friends that live in a remote ranch in Wyoming. They take on the job of raising a family on $9000. They buy a cow (I think it's a bison) and decide to sell it for $300. The family ends up winning the auction. They decide to open a saloon for tourists. A man named Mr. Lutz (R. Lee Ermey) buys a cattle drive (it's called the "Lutz" after the owner) and sets up the bar at the station. A woman named Martha (Eileen O'Hara) and her daughter (Lara Flynn Boyle) decide to visit the town. The "Lutzes" try to raise the family on the proceeds of the saloon. The son (John Wayne) and the daughter become friends while they are attending school. The wife gets in touch with a man she has a past with. The woman's brother (David Carradine) is a famous stage magician and makes a show for the town to get some money and to gain some respect from the townspeople. She makes her own show in the hopes of finding a man to raise her kids. This movie is a true comedy that will make you laugh and feel sorry for the characters. It has great acting from all the cast. Everyone was in fine form.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! THIS MOVIE!!!!!!! This movie is NOTHING but the "BONNIE'S BABY" MOVIE!. This is the exact same idea of "BEN'S BELLY" (which I gave the worst review possible). This is so funny and stupid. I HATE this movie, but I really want to see the kids in it again. They are always screaming and running into the screen. It is so bad the audience can see the camera. You would think someone at a family film would be able to pick up on all of these hints and clues. It's sad that we have to get a family movie with such a bad script. I will never understand the point of these kids, who have no real characters. If I were their mother, I would give them the stink eye and run out of the room.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't hate this movie, but the acting is really bad...the guy was pretty weak in the movie, and the women who looked like models at the bar were really not attractive at all...I saw the original movie in theaters, the re-cut doesn't really add anything new, and I don' t like the original film, either...It's sad to see that Hollywood does this a lot, especially when the original is more interesting...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have no idea what this is about, I mean it's not going to make your pulse rate skyrocket, so just go on to the next one. It's just a dull and unoriginal story, I think it's a bad idea to write a film in the first place, and for a man to have a'soul' at all, you wouldn't even have to do much. I don't see how he could pull of that accent (there is nothing wrong with that accent in my opinion, you just shouldn't have it done too many times), his dialogue is boring and not good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A really fun film, with a story that is really cool, and a good cast.  The plot is that two siblings are kidnapped by a man who can see everything. They must use everything at their disposal to free themselves. This does not sound terribly impressive at first, but it does get progressively better.  It is well-produced and has some really cool special effects.   The soundtrack is a great mix of pop, rock, and classical.  But the most memorable thing about the film is the use of the color red.  Red is often used to represent evil, but in this film it seems to represent something else. The film is really well shot with nice camera angles.  When watching the film, one of the things that really sticks with me is that the director uses the sound really sparingly. When a fight is going on it is mostly using sound effects, when a person is saying a line the camera angles are set up to show where the person is looking. This is really good for setting the mood and gives the actors more to work with.  If you can take my word for it, you are going to love this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can't blame the kids for getting themselves into a bad mess.  The plot was predictable, so predictable it was predictable for me to love the movie.  The "hero" who does what he does for a living.    He comes back to the farm.  He's not exactly heroic, but he has been raised to "fight the good fight" and that means going into battle against the bad guys.  This means making the wrong calls.  His father was murdered by some criminals.  It's a very dark place, filled with violence and a "hero"-like figure.  What I loved most is how the kids are just kids.  At the age of 14, I still don't understand how I can get away with such things.  I'm a firm believer that, in the end, the adults always get punished.  A few other things to love, including a great use of the "loud" in "boom".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is so bad, that the movie would probably make you laugh if it hadn't been so damn long and dull.  I mean the story is basically a bunch of high school girls getting into mischief and fighting each other with everything from giant robots to giant tanks.   They have to rescue a princess but they don't realize it is because they're having fun fighting around.  And then there is a big battle with the giant robots on top of a moving train, which they have to escape by jumping into the train and blowing it up with a big bomb.  Then the princess saves them and they go back to their little towns and live happily ever after.  It is a long movie with one of the worst plots I have ever seen.  My only enjoyment was the fact that I loved the main guy, Paul Walker (who, despite his young age, looks like a 40 year old).  I also enjoyed that these girls were all smart and would always help each other if the situation called for it, especially Michelle.  The only problem is that this movie could have been so much more fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have no idea what to say about this movie. It is so bad that you have to watch it without knowing anything about it. This movie is not just bad it is so badly done it is even better that it was intended to be. I am not kidding that this movie has been taken off the internet. The people at Youtube are not amused. If this movie makes you sick then please find somewhere else to watch this.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a mess, at first. The story is nothing like its been presented to the public. It's not good science fiction, it's a boring story about a ship with a bunch of robots that are trying to fix the time flow. The robots talk a little too much like children. If you have any respect for science fiction it doesn't make sense, and the idea of a ship trying to travel through a wormhole makes no sense. The idea of time travel is completely impossible. It seems they just wanted to give us a space adventure set in the future. This movie is nothing. Don't watch it, it won't make you think, the plot doesn't get more interesting, the robots don't get any more interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What an absolutely boring movie this is. If a man in a wheelchair has been hit by a car you would think it was a car crash. I know that this is a film about the Holocaust it is really hard to believe that there is no gore and there is hardly any blood as well. But it is all the same. This film is about a Nazi Officer who is in a hurry to capture a man named Maximilian who he claims is a German doctor who is doing something to a large mass of people in a gas chamber. The Nazis are planning to make a film of the whole story. Maximilians only saving is his wits. He has a large collection of old German books about magic and witchcraft. The first day he finds out that the German doctor is actually in hiding in a barn by himself. He tells the Germans about how the books are written and they tell him that he is a liar and that all the information that he has will get him killed. He also warns them that if they kill him he will release a curse on them. Well it turns out that they did not kill him but rather he killed them and his son to get his books back and to get revenge on them for their treatment of his mother. After that the Germans are taken off guard as they did in all the other films. They are only there to kill as much as possible. Max gets a lucky break in the form of one of his old friends named Dr. Mephistopheles. He takes over for him and they go with a special man who will help him escape them. He manages to get to a farm where he hides and he has an old woman who is his partner and the two of them are very good at hiding. The two people get back to the castle where the doctor's home is and the Nazi party members are at their best. Meps and Dr. Manilow help Max escape the castle and they try to figure out how they are going to escape the Nazis.  .They manage to kill a few and they learn the location of the castle from the German Minister of the interior who was there on a visit the week before. They get back and Dr Mep histopheles uses his magic to bring them to the place they know the Nazis are located. The only problem is that Dr. Morpheletes wife is at a very bad time and she will die on the way and they do not have enough time to do the deed
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My favorite part of the movie was the ending. After the main character's mother gets killed by an exploding fish (and then gets a fishbowl as a present for the mother's funeral) she meets an old man who introduces herself as his grandpa and tells her that he is the only son of the late captain of the ship that was sunk there. The old captain is a monster called the Nastys and they all lived together in a beautiful house (a mansion) built on a hill. They all had a horse that had died and were raised by a dog and a cat named Nanny. They lived happily ever after until the day they were sailing away, when a group of pirates showed up on the ship. They attacked the house, killed the Nasty's, and took everyone else. The only survivor was a man who went to a cave in the hillside and hid. The Nasties killed his dog and cat, and then took the Nanny and her baby. (He hid the baby and hid in the cave.) The Nasty got pregnant with another son of theirs. The boy was named Rizzo and the Nady gave him a big, long umbrella for a toy. The baby Rizzos went out into the world and Rizzio found a lot of people who liked him and became famous. He was even a hero for a time, but then one day he decided to steal an axe. When he got into an argument, some of the pirates beat him up and he lost his umbrella. He left the island with an umbrella in his hand. One day the Nastic's and their son Rizzmo had an argument with the Naughty's. The son of their Nasty grabbed the axe and cut a hole in the umbrella to see inside. He found Rizzimo alive and well, still wearing the umbrella and holding the axe. After seeing the reflection of the Naster's daughter in the axe he decided he really wanted Rizzimo and he attacked him. As Rizzi ran away the Naky's grabbed the umbrella with them and left. Rizziro went out to sea on a boat to find the Nastics. When the boat capsized he found Razzimo and all the other Rizzis there. He took Razzimo to the Natic's village where Rizzy is. The village leader was Nanda who nursed Rizzyo until he grew up. Razzi grew up in

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You know, I've found that many of the bad movies I've watched have been the ones that are just so bad, so cheap, so stupid that I don't really have anything to add except to tell them they suck. This one is one of them. I'm sure you've seen it... "Walking Tall" was a popular TV/movie of the late 70's/early 80's. In this film a man is forced to live a life as a handicapped person...by society and his own will. It's a pretty pathetic movie...it was written by David Lee Smith, a well respected writer of such films as "Trouble Man" and "The Wreck of the Old 97." In my opinion it was a pretty bad adaptation of a book...not as bad as "Mama's Boys" but close...but it was pretty poor.   "Wicking" is the story of a very overweight woman who is living with a family where she isn't quite accepted...by her mother who still hates her, by her brother...and her boyfriend, which has been her life for a long time. In "Waking Up" she sees a movie about a woman who had to live with that same family and she tries to find out if they had any feelings for her, which is a bit hard to do...but there's no doubt that at the end of the movie there was a definite "for her" feeling. This time "Woking" has some good acting, but it's pretty weak and the movie can't get anything right. The scenes that had to be cut and some lines that weren't added to the story were pretty boring and made no difference to the movie...as did the poor quality of the film itself. If you can find this movie then it's worth the effort just to see the ending of the scene and the ending to the scene...if not just a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My brother and I had to take the kids to see this movie with my parents. My brother was expecting something bad, something very, very horrible. The trailer sounded like a bad horror movie, very campy, bad acting, bad direction... everything. I was thinking it would be the same as any other bad horror film but i was wrong. Not only was this not bad, its actually very good. There was a lot of action and a lot is done really well. One of the highlights of this movie is the special effects. It looked amazing and even to this day this movie makes me smile. It had a good story and had an original concept to it. Its an action movie with a good feel to it, the ending is good and so is the ending credits. The only reason this is not an all time classic is because of the terrible acting. It has very bad performances throughout the whole film, every single one of them. The bad acting in this movie ruins the entire experience. The movie has a strong concept but the acting is so bad that the concept is ruined.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an old-fashioned adventure tale. The story revolves around a young woman named Mary who is taken prisoner by the Spanish soldiers in New York. She escapes them, and soon after is pursued by some French soldiers. They bring her to a French castle. There she falls in love with a French General and is forced to become his lover. She is taken back to France, where the General and her lover are imprisoned. One day, a Frenchman named Drouet arrives at the castle, pretending to be an Englishman. He is in love also with Mary, but he has had no idea that her real lover was already there. Drouett soon is arrested, but at the last moment is rescued by Mary. The two escape and go to London. They travel by night on the Underground. They get to England, and Drouent has the misfortune to find out that his beautiful beautiful beautiful daughter Louise has a very bad and unhappy marriage to a poor old man. Doulouet is so unhappy that he takes revenge on all the Englishmen. Finally he finds the English General and his beautiful daughter in bed with each other. He kills them both in cold blood. He then cuts off their heads. Then he cuts them up, and puts them on sticks around the room. Douls body is then eaten by a lion. The Lion is brought to France for some strange reason. It is at some point at a French inn. Dlouet returns to France in great disgrace. He tells the French general about his murders, and the French General is so angry that he cuts off Dloukets head. He keeps his body for himself. Ddouette then travels to America and tells some Englishmen who are there that she is the beautiful beautiful girl they have been looking for. But they all want to have sex with her. In the meantime Drouette meets a woman who takes the shape of an old woman. She tells Drouettes story and she also goes on an adventure. She also leaves a woman, a beautiful woman. Dourtt tells this story to a friend of his who is a British general. He takes her into his confidence, and tells her his story about how she killed the men. The friend tells Dourott that it is not a good thing for Ddrouette to tell him. But he also tells Ddourott about the beautiful woman he met. Dfouette says that she must not tell her friend anything about
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For an average story.   The film starts out with a man being attacked by a snake and it quickly becomes apparent that the snake has no respect for the laws of nature. After being bitten by the snake, it then proceeds to bite someone else, and then attack another person. The film then takes a turn for the worse as it suddenly turns into a horror film as the person being attacked turns out to be the main character, so instead of being attacked, the main hero is then taken captive by the beast, and he tries to fend off the serpent with the only thing he has. A sword.  , and you can see why its one of my favorite movies. You get the idea that this is the ultimate beast, but the guy manages to fight back, and I do have to give the guy props for that. If it wasn't for the film, I wouldn't be so hooked on this film at all. It has a good plot, and great acting, and it also is pretty fun for the most part. I mean, sure, there is some blood and guts, and some ugly monster things, but its still mostly the main lead getting up and fighting some monster things. The only thing that is kinda not awesome about this is that I wish that they would have kept the camera on the main guy a bit more, because it is kind of distracting when he is having all the fun. Oh well.Overall, it is a decent film if you can get past the film itself, but there are some parts that kind of suck.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie does not show anything of the sort of conflict in any way. The film's entire "plot" consists of a gang of thugs who kidnap a wealthy family. After being captured, they are held at gunpoint, then brutally tortured and executed in the middle of the road. Their last moments are as innocent as they come: a little boy sitting at a wooden fence admiring the sunset, then the sunsets down on him and he goes black. So sad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I saw this one the first time a while ago. It was a comedy and I thought it was quite funny. But now, I am a bit bored of comedies and this is about as funny as a movie that's actually a horror. I hate it because I don't believe it's a horror or a comedy. It's just a really silly movie with a very weird ending. The only people I liked were the two idiots playing the "silly" parts. They were very funny. I really had to watch it twice to really get the punchline. There is a joke in the movie where a person is talking with a person about a joke and it's funny. It has the same ending as other movies that have the same sort of ending. But I didn't like it. It didn't seem like a joke at all and I was a little surprised it was as bad as it was. At least one of the people I was with would have laughed at this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie. The movie was fun and exciting. It was a great movie for those that loved the movie Jurassic Park. The film was a remake of the movie the same name which was a hit film back in 1993 and is still a pretty great movie.   The only problem I had with the movie is the fact that they put on one too many dinosaurs to try and make a good story. I think the fact is that this movie didn't come close to the success of Jurassic Park when it first came out back in 1992 so in order for Jurassic Park to be the hit it was I would think the first Jurassic Park film would have to be pretty close.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The reason why I give a 4 star rating is because it is one of the better made horror films in recent history, it looks gorgeous in the original 3-D conversion, the special effects are good, and some excellent performances from several actors.   I give it a 3 stars for a very good story and some very well done special effects (even though this film is in 3-d).   One of my favourite movies! (October 4, 2005)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was all about the first meeting, the awkwardness, the tension, the jokes, and how stupid and terrible the rest of the movie is.  When is the last time you see a group of people laughing together as the bad movie they're in keeps getting worse?  Not even a couple laughs at the end, the ending, and the way to the next one are the only things worth caring about in the entire movie.   The opening sequence alone is worth of its own review, if you've never seen it or if you're a movie buff...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst film I've ever watched. It's so boring and it doesn't make any sense whatsoever... The actors and the camera guy don't help that any. The only thing that keeps it from being a complete waste of time are the 3 kids who play the part of two old ladies. The kids do a mediocre job of playing this silly story, but I think it would have been better off with a couple kids. This film is so bad I almost wished that it had been made by a couple of guys who think that the best way to entertain people is to make a silly film that involves a bunch of children doing silly things. It also has no sense of humor whatsoever and it's so bad it makes a sadder version of The Simpsons, so watch it at home with your wife or your kid!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to confess a love-hate relationship with this movie. I feel it has some excellent special effects and a compelling story, a nice, fun action-oriented movie. If only they did a remake or remake and re-work the story, I feel the original would be great. - September 7, 2005I love this movie, but I hate it!  Reviewer: Mr. L.S.R. - favorite favorite favorite - May 8, 2005  Subject: Not a bad way to celebrate May the 4th! I didn't watch this when it was being released at the RKO in NY. I have since. I saw it tonight on TV and I love it. The original version was better, not to mention the R-rated movie was better and funnier. This is a great parody of Star Wars and I was amused to see the "Ewoks" on the moon. I guess I would've rather seen this when I was a child and didn't know about the special effects. - May 9, 2005Not a bad  It was a great spoof at the time of the original, but a great film in its own right, even if its not for kids. - April 4, 2005Funny
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's an ok movie, but not great.  I think it was directed by the master (or some movie) Don Coscarelli.  The movie is made as a homage to "The Maltese Falcon."  It's basically a black and white movie starring a bunch of people flying through space.  It sounds fun and it is, but it's not very good.   The action scenes are poorly done and look like they were ripped off from the film "RoboCop 2."  In fact, the movie gets most of its violence from a few gun battles between robots.  I was surprised to see that the story was "based on" the book "Fool's Gold," by the novelist of that novel (Ralph Auberjonois).  This movie was originally released in 1973, just before the book was published.  The film is also not very funny and it has a few flaws.  Here's an example of a flaw that stands out:  At the end, when everything is supposed to be settled, the hero, a robot, is left with a girl who does not want to be with him.  This is all in the middle of the movie and doesn't make any sense, does it?   Another flaw:   There are a lot of plot holes.  These plot holes should not have allowed you to laugh at the movie, since there were a lot things that were funny.  There's a robot who says things like "my name is ROBOT MALIBU."  What the heck is ROBUT MALIU?  If the robots were so clever then why would they say that out loud?  I found that when the film ended, a "movie reviewer" who wasn't very knowledgeable wrote that the film was "too obvious to be good" and "inaccurate."  The movie wasn't "accurate" nor is it "too far-fetched" to be a great parody.  If you're into science-fiction or westerns, you will probably like this movie.  But if you just enjoy watching a bunch o guys flying through the air then this is just not the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a good movie that has some bad parts (not necessarily the bad parts as they are often so in the works of Robert Altman). First the main character, Richard Aronofsky who plays a character named Billy, is played by an actor named Robert Mitchum who is a very good actor. Mitchum is great in this movie and is able to use his facial expressions to help give the character a little more gravitas to him as he is a man with real problems. The movie begins with a sequence of pictures that is nothing but black and white that is very confusing and makes you unsure whether you're watching the movie or not. It is as though someone took a photo of a person with a bad haircut, an awkward haircut and a face that was always grinning. I did not understand why the people in the photo had that horrible haircut or what kind of haircut it was that they had. After that the movie starts as the film makes its way through the stages of a man named Billy as he tries to do the right thing (go to the police) while all the time he is going through the different kinds of people he has dated that have never made him happy. Eventually the movie reaches a good point as the woman that he had a long term relationship with is going to be arrested for stealing. The police come to the house and arrest her for stealing money from the store and she is then put in jail. Richard is on the case and is trying to find a way to get in contact with her and find out if she will let him see her before she is put away. At the same time, she is trying not to be in the wrong, so that is going on. Unfortunately, this movie also lacks the story that is usually found in a Robert Altmans work. This movie is really just about a man who is trying hard to do good and who is going about trying to do a lot of bad things to be a good man. As a matter of fact, this story is not that interesting. The character of Billy isn't very interesting, either. When he first becomes a cop, he has a pretty bad personality and is kind of a jerk to the people who he is trying so hard to help. In fact, he becomes a complete asshole at the end of the movie because he is now able to help the person who is the victim of the theft, as he did the time before. That is just my opinion though, and it is a personal opinion.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have no words.  No words at all.   There were two ways to watch this movie: a) you were there and the movie was pretty bad but it was hilarious.    b) you weren't there and you'll never see the movie again because the plot is as incoherent as a drunk's attempt at writing a letter to the editor.  I think the two choices here are:  a) watch it and laugh at the stupidity (as if there was any logic to the plot) b) watch it and feel sorry for the poor soul who wrote it. So many characters and so many scenes that the movie has gone to make me laugh so hard in its final act that I'll never find a time to watch the rest of the film again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was extremely disappointed by "Glorious 3" (2012)   As one of the most popular "buddy movies" ever made, it was easy to predict the story of a young guy (Rufus Sewell, not the one in "The Matrix") who is in love with a pretty girl and he is a member of the team who are trying to rescue his girlfriend (Laura Dern) from an evil villain.  When they are trapped, they need a way out, so one of them (David Thewlis) is given a special suit.  This one has a built in laser rifle which he can fire by turning his arm clockwise. He also has a jet pack that he uses to fly with his girlfriend, but it gets damaged and requires repair when they land in a swamp. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "This is a film for the people who like their films a little short, a little lowbrow, a lil cheesy, a lot of over-exposition, a bad amount of self-aggrandizement, a bit of violence (just the occasional slapstick), and some very pretty photography."   Well, that seems to be the movie they were going for. If this movie is low-brow, low-budget, crappy and under-dramatic, well then I guess it is indeed low-class and low-minded as well. There were not enough lines, not enough laughs, not only did the movie seem like it was just being directed by a few kids to make a quick buck, but the movie itself looked like it came from a video-game. It was a simple, short-lived, boring, yet very entertaining story about a group of boys getting into trouble at their local park. All the characters were just made up out of recycled characters. All we got to do was watch the boys make a series of stupid, stupid, and stupid-funny antics while the camera rolled and the music played. If there were any more funny scenes than these I would have laughed so hard I would never have stood up. There was also more than a little violence, but not enough to be very frightening, yet enough to make you cringe. There seems to have been very little thought put into the production quality either. Some parts of the pictures looked like they just came off a computer screen and some parts looked like the boys were going through a rough patch, not something you would want to show your kid to watch. I would not recommend it to my kids, but if I ever saw it again I would just point out the obvious mistakes on the screen. This might get a laugh or two from you and maybe even one or two smiles from your kids, though, I think I'm just going to pass it by.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "It is a story of a man who is not very good at his job, but is trying to do a good job. Then his boss gets mad at him because he hasn't taken up a case in a long time." This isn't what I expected in a "bad movie". If you are familiar with "Bad Christmas Carol" it's about two brothers who go to a Christmas party and decide to use a fake Santa to pretend that they're really rich.  Why are the lights all the same colour? Well, the movie is a comedy and in a comedy sometimes there are funny lines, funny jokes and funny things. Not to get too technical, but the film has a comedy script.   The problem is that they put too much emphasis on the funny lines and jokes. I get the impression that they made this because they had to make something funny and the "bad guy" is the one they thought would be funny. I can't tell if this is how they write comedies or if they just didn't care about writing comedy and just made this as bad as they thought they could.  I have never watched a worse comedy in my life! The bad guy is a big meanie who uses a very poor excuse to get out of work, and then his boss finds out and he takes him out on a "ride" so bad it might just kill him.  He is also so lazy at work that he won't do any work while at the party.  There's also one scene where he has to take a piss, and you know what? He pisses in the bushes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If this movie was a good one, why would so many people make this one?   It is a short but lame movie with a terrible and cheesy story, stupid and stupid scenes.   This movie was not worth to be shown anywhere but on badmovies and bad movie sites. It is also the worst horror movie with bad actors I can remember.   This was a really terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  Don't judge a movie by its title.!!! (1/2)!!! was a pretty decent movie. This is the tale of a man called "D.J." (Dennis J. Hogg) who is the chief of a small town called "Buckaroo." One day an old man named "Pecnik" (Joe Piscopo) who does not like Buckaroo gets a visit from his daughter "Claudia," who is an agent from "The Bureau of Investigation." Claudia's job is to infiltrate Buckaroo, find out what has really happened to the town and bring the criminals to justice. Unfortunately the local sheriff won't help Claudia. There are other people, a priest, a preacher and a couple of nuns and they too aren't going to help. So, it's up to Claudia to get the people involved, learn who is really behind the crime and bring them to justice! But there are many twists and turns to the story and to make it more dramatic the actors did a poor job at portraying the characters.!!!! (2/2).!!!!: "Dennis Pecnik is a tough old man. He has worked in the steel mills for 40 years and has always been an excellent employee. Even when he was laid off he was able to find work. He still has the same job. Now he is laid off again. He is a good boss but he has to learn to be a man again. Dennis is tired of having to take bad pay and working in a dangerous place. One time he found himself handcuffed in the back of a pickup truck by a young cop named Larry 'Lil' Wickerbottom. After Wickerbottomed arrested him in his own home he was taken to jail for two months. At that time Wickertop had a little boy. Little Larry Wickerwood had a really bad case of measles. Wickertops wife died and he lost everything in his business. As a punishment Dennis was to do 80 hours overtime for a year! But even with all these bad luck, Dennis managed to keep up with the work, stay out of jail, and live a happy life with the help of the Reverend Father Michael Tatum and his assistant Sister Margaret."!!!!!!:!!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is definitely not a good movie at all. It tries hard to be funny at first but it is really boring. The story is simple and stupid. You really want to laugh but not really. What really makes it bad is the actors are really bad. I am not sure if it is a case of bad acting or director or they just forgot how to act or something. I mean the movie is called "The Great Gatsby" and there are several scenes where I have to repeat myself like "I am so glad I met the great Gatsbye" but really this is so stupid that it is almost embarrassing to watch. The movie is not funny and not even sad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this movie to see it's supposed to be a "sci-fi" film set in a dystopian future. Instead, I found it very unfunny (and not very well written). The film has a plot that is not very original or plausible, and it never really leaves that dystopia. It really just feels like an adaptation of a book, because it is a parody of many of the most ridiculous sci-fi films and books.   It all starts out with the protagonist (played by a "dumb blond kid" and played by an actress with a pretty face, no surprise there) being rescued by a woman named "Kirra". She tells Kirra (and us) that her name is Kirra. She is from an advanced civilization whose people don't wear clothes. Kirra tells us that her planet is about to become uninhabitable and her only hope for survival is to find a man (the main "actor") on Earth. This is all she is allowed to tell us, and Kirra's appearance, the fact that she is the only female in the film and is only a child, all of this is so obvious and over-the-top (and very much an example of how much money was given to this film).   The main "actress" is played by a very unattractive woman (played with the worst "smiles in movies" I have ever seen). She is constantly getting annoyed with the main protagonist, who is completely useless and incapable of anything. He is so inept that he can hardly get food. And when he does manage to get a bite, it's cold. The movie was so bad that one could tell that it didn't even belong in the same universe as the original "Star Trek" series. The fact that "Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith" (the first of the Star Wars sequels) was supposed to take place on Kirra Planet didn't help either. This movie took a lot of elements from the "Star Destroyer" series, so it is unsurprising that it has been dubbed into Japanese.   to complete the awfulness, the main hero is played so stupidly that you start thinking how the director was paid to make this movie.   with all the nonsense going on, the movie is actually pretty good. I suppose the only way to explain it is that there are many aspects of "Star Fleet Command" in which the actors (some of them,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want to know more about the setting of the movie then you can read the synopsis: a team of soldiers are trapped in a bunker with a huge alien creature. It is trying to destroy the world and to take over it by any means necessary. The movie itself is well put together but it's a weak and silly movie. It shows that everything isn't quite so bad after all, if you can watch it with a smile then you might enjoy it even if you don't care about it. The story seems to focus on one team in the bunker at the same time and even though they are having a hellish time all it really does is to prove that they are all crazy people.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the fuck is wrong with me!  I'm so old I can feel it from here!    This movie has almost no value for its audience.

I will not watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I never believed this movie was a bad film; I was too caught up in it to believe it was a great film. The first thing that stands out is the art and sound, and it's all pretty good. When you see a couple of people playing cards the music is actually played backwards, and the dialogue is quite funny. Then you see some girls being attacked, and they say something like that would never happen to them, but it does; a guy comes in the room, he kicks the girl, but she doesn't like the pain; then he starts to punch her, and she says something like "I don't want to get hit". After that you start to get sick of it. What's really great about the film is the way that it's divided into six chapters, and each one has a different theme. There are some really good things that happen, and some things that don't, which makes each chapter quite enjoyable.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am very disappointed with this movie. If this is true about a man who killed the people who saved his daughter from a murder, why is he so good in a movie about killing? It makes no sense. It has a story but the plot is weak. The acting is not good. One of the characters can not do anything and the rest have the same problem. One good character is so annoying. It had a good idea, but it fails because of poor acting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is an interesting story here, but when a film like this is on so low budget it should have been cut out of the movie. I have watched a lot of horror films and have not seen a story as bad as this. This movie has some really interesting parts and some very good acting, but the story is so bad you cannot even enjoy it.  It is all about a man who is about to be killed (but not by a zombie, which I thought was a really cool addition.) The whole movie has so much tension, and it is a great thing to watch, just one of those scary movies. It would have been better if they had left it out to be a remake of a classic.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Trying to get a feel for the movie, I thought the movie was a pretty dull movie in the sense that it was very poorly directed and acted. The plot was as lame as the movie itself. The script was written in a very unoriginal and uneventful way. It felt more like a play rather than a movie. The acting on the whole was poor, from the very first time that they showed me that the guy's name was Frank, I knew this movie was not going to be any good. I wasn't really a big fan of the ending, but even that is very weak. The movie could have been better, but that's a big minus when it's a movie like this. The music was great, as expected. If you like cheesy tunes in your movies then you'll love this movie. If not, then don't waste your time with it. 1 out of 5 stars - November 14, 2015 The worst movie I have seen in a long time. So far the movie looks like it took a lot of money to make and it doesn't look all that good. The most disturbing thing to me though, was the way he did the shooting, just like a movie on a TV set. The cinematography could be done with a cheap camera if you took a cheap movie and put it on a crappy TV with cheap special effects and you're almost guaranteed to get one hit and out it goes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a horrible, awful movie.   It's a horror film, a very bad movie. I am sure that the only people who liked it were the very naive people around me (and there were some people who I think enjoyed it). It has a very low-budget story, the characters are very poorly designed, and the movie's plot is completely predictable. It has very little gore and none of the gore is real. Even the "real" gore in the movie was not very realistic.  I wouldn't consider it a bad film, it's just not very good. I don't care if you like horror, but I don:t think you're going to like this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bless my old age:   The only reason to watch this is to see a movie set in the old style of the old school (if you're old school).   I mean, sure, this is a classic of the genre--but it's not as old school as the previous movie.   So if you want to see how an old-school movie gets old, watch this:  What does this film have to do with today's movies?   It's like a modernized version of  The Wizard of Oz.   This movie is about a man who is about to marry an old maid, only to get her pregnant--she's a peasant girl.  His father, a traveling circus performer, is worried about the man--but the young peasant girl gives birth to a baby girl who seems to be like the boy.  The father wants the boy to become her husband (she can't keep the baby for longer than a year).  They decide to let the little girl stay with the boy in order to raise her to be a good daughter.  It has the kind of old school story we love to see--a young innocent girl that is raised into a great warrior.  I found myself really enjoying this as a child--and it's a great adventure for a kid.  Some scenes are very well done--we get to see the way a circus makes its living, and a kid has to be careful in order get through it.  While there is very little action, this is not one of those movies that takes itself too seriously (no "Spartacus" here).  I would say this was a good movie for my young age and I would not recommend it to teenagers and young adults.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good movie at first, but then it turns into a nightmare of an adventure movie. As far as I can tell, they wanted to create a story about a group of people looking for a lost artifact called the "Wizard's Orb", a thing that can only be found through a strange magic that only has been used since before the time of the dinosaurs and before even the dinosaurs were extinct. A young woman comes to look for this orb in search of her lost father. This is not exactly true at all, it was a man who lost it in a cave during a flood, the woman is very helpful, but not very bright. It seems as if she had always been very ill minded, and was in her 60's and is not very sure what the purpose of her search is, but she is quite certain she was born with an evil magic and this could destroy all civilization that may exist or is about to, I don't know what to call that. As she goes about her search, she gets help from several others (who aren't very helpful at all), and in the end, a creature that was on one of the lost artifacts that had been found before the flood becomes visible (although the creature is the "Ouroboros" of the movie). This is the most horrifying part of the story, with some really good acting and a very creepy sound effect that makes you wonder where the monster is. There were many things that could have been improved, but as a whole this is still a fun movie, for me the ending was quite a shock to the system. Rating: C-
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, like the whole franchise, is not all that good, but that's not the point.  The most frustrating thing about this film is that the characters are so bland and uninteresting that they're almost un-watchable.  What would've been so interesting is to have a character who's a real "hero" that is just as intelligent, and as funny as the rest of them, then having him be the one to bring a change in the universe.  I could tell from the start that this guy wouldn't make it.  You want to see some real fun, don't make me watch you do it. Watch "The Incredibles."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's hard to review a bad film. It's a terrible story. It is the kind of a movie that would've been entertaining as a kid's cartoon. It makes no sense. It goes nowhere. It doesn't have anything to say about anything at all. There are so many stupid moments in here that it's hard not to smile, especially during those stupid scenes that have nothing to do with anything. It was bad enough to get an "E" rating from the BBFC, and it got it because of how awful a film it was. Even the sound effects are bad, not to mention the direction of the actors. It should be called "The Adventures of Liddelle in a Stupid Movie".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a very long movie (1 hour) that doesn't seem to tell much. That's not surprising, considering how the main character, an unemployed guy, spends his days being harassed by people who want him to do the wrong things. He has to live his life like a dog, going out to work and being chased and harassed by strangers. That means that the movie has no plot, no twists and no big emotional scenes. It's the same story told again and again. That said, I guess it will be more enjoyable if you can suspend your disbelief enough to enjoy some of the ridiculous elements in it.   The only point that interests me is the scene when Mr. Pecola is waiting for a plane to arrive in his country. I'm not sure whether it is a dream or not, but a plane does come. It flies straight towards the building and is so close to him that he has a very brief moment of fear (he is in the airport). Then, a beautiful woman in a black suit (she is the president of the airline, by the way) steps out of the plane, stops by the building to take out a briefcase, and leaves. After that, she leaves only after one more man is coming out from the building.   I wish there were more than just a short scene like that.  - - - - **If you're looking for a nice movie about a crazy man and a woman waiting for their plane, check this movie out!** - - In case you don't know, Pecoli is a short, silly, but very entertaining movie. It follows Mr.Pecola, a man who is homeless and living on the streets. He tries to support himself by working as a waiter at a restaurant. It seems that his life can't get any better when he has to sit and wait in the restaurant all night, every night, for a very late flight. But then, in a dream he witnesses a beautiful, black lady and a man flying the plane to his country, where he is waiting. The main character is not only the flight attendant, but also a pilot, who flies him around the city and brings him to the airport after he lands. The plane has no pilot at all, so it seems that Pecolia is in charge of this flight. Of course, he is happy to be able to stay on the plane until it comes, and then he can finally rest... except that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In a way, you could say that my problem is that I have very little patience for the kind of low-budget, "one-trick pony" productions that a lot of studios have been making in recent years. I have been waiting to see The Mummy movies since the first one came out in 1996. But they always seem to suffer the same fate.   It was just a matter of time until they were all cancelled or moved to the bad-cop show/bad-cowboys zone of the big screen.  They are nothing but a bunch of mediocre actors who appear to be wearing costumes that they made themselves or bought off the Internet for $5.  The story is not well put together. I know they were working with a very limited budget, but why the hell do they need some sort of special effects for a tomb to open? It doesn't even show up.  It is all done with just a camera on the chest of a mummy.  In addition, there is no reason at all why we need to see the mummy at all. There is no threat to the audience at all except perhaps the prospect that someone will think he is a mummy, thereby creating more curiosity and demand for the next installment.  So let's just say that this is not a very good movie.   It's a sad thing that they didn't even try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be fair, it's a very poorly made movie. A bunch of kids that are all so much older than everyone else that they act like they are 12. There's so many mistakes in this movie that it's hard to take your time to enjoy it. In the beginning the kid goes with his mother and father to the grocery store, and gets a bottle of milk, which makes him sick. He then goes to the park to do some shopping, only to run into the police who are hunting the kid's father. The kid and the cops go at each other until the kid ends up being thrown off a building to his death. This is the end of the movie, you will think twice about the movie afterward. I think if you don't like movies that are terrible like this one don't watch it, and if you like movies like this don't go near it. Don't let the bad reviews stop you from checking this out though!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This review is not for a good movie. The story is simple, it's about two friends who go on a holiday and have a crazy adventure on a road trip with three other friends. This is where the movie starts to go wrong, it has an awful screenplay, terrible acting, bad directing, a completely different tone for the movie, and it doesn't get better. The entire movie is bad. There is no story, there are no characters, there is no drive, no direction, the dialogue is horrendous, the acting is horrible, the camera work is terrible, the set pieces are bad, the special effects are horrible, and the cinematography is terrible. I hate this movie and if I had it on DVD and had seen it a thousand times I would have never seen it. This movie is a complete waste of time, an absolute horror, a boring, boring movie, a bad horror movie, the worst movie I have ever seen. It is a bad, boring, unoriginal story, an uninspiring story, a plot for a horrible movie, there isn't much to the plot, but it's too bad they took the worst screenplay they could find and put it together. This was the worst, most boring movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. I really hope they don't try to sell this movie on DVD.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the first two thirds of the film, they attempt to be a couple, the story progresses along with that (for the most part), and we get some good visuals and it is well done, but then everything changes. In the third quarter the movie starts becoming more and more ridiculous, we get a female teacher who is just minding her business, when the man comes to visit, he seems like a nice guy (we get a couple of flashes of him as a little kid) then he has to go to work and while on the way to the bus stop he suddenly decides to have a threesome with the teacher and himself, which of course, it is a disaster. Then we are then shown an animated version of the teacher taking a shower with the man as well. And then a second threeway happens when they are taking a hot tub and it ends with the male and female students getting a little wet and all getting on their backs, and all the teachers have to put a leash on them. That's not all we have in store for us here, a couple more sexual threeways, with two of the girls naked on a bed and then the male students are in a pool of water and each of them having the male teacher fuck him on the back of the instructor's neck. It gets even more hilarious when the male instructor is having sex with one of the male student who is on his back so he can suck on the female instructor's tits! When the teacher gets all dressed and we go back to the normal scene of the two women taking a bath, then in the last quarter of the movie when the two girls are in the nude bathing, we see the female teacher is about to get it on with the two male students but before she can get naked, they all get naked too. The two instructors then decide they have had enough and then they take the two naked male students and force them into a large room, one of them has a dildo in his anus, the other has a little penis in his mouth and the man with the dildo is having fun with it as his wife watches and laughs. And that is just the first quarter of this film!   When it comes to sex in this film, there is nothing to be excited about. There is no penetration except from the woman's mouth, and no penetration from either sex other than from the male's penis, it seems like just straight up sex. There isn't much to
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â It's the last scene of a bad film. The entire first act is one big, dumb chase. The movie does have one great moment, when the main character, a wolverine, goes on a killing spree, but this is more about a wily, wise old man than a killer, because as soon as the wolverino starts getting ready to kill, a pack of wolves come out of nowhere, and just walk away. Â Â This is not even a chase scene; it is just a few minutes in a movie filled with chase scenes, and then the waffle gets eaten.  There's no reason for a waffle to be eaten:  it's a food.  An old guy and a young boy playing baseball.    (click the image to enlarge)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What can i say.. i really wanted a sequel to the movie.. but it was not.. I mean i never watch a movie without having a bad feeling about it.. but this movie is just awful! The actors are not likable at all.. i mean no one is likable.. they just act out stupid or lame scenes.. and even the movie makers are not nice to each other. Its just a bad film, one of the worst movies i have seen in years! i gave it a 4 out of ten because it was pretty bad! If the actors would act like a normal humans that is... they would have to give each other a hand.. they always do it in the bad parts... I am glad that i watched it though because i loved it in a bad way...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Dawson Leery had his hands full"        I will be honest, I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this movie. I knew he was a star, and I knew that a big movie like this was going to require some CGI, but I expected nothing out of the ordinary, I'm a huge fan of Leery and he did a fine job with his part. The special effects are not the best, but the CGI is a lot better than I expected, I am looking forward to seeing the sequel, especially if we get Leery as a lead.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this one for the first time in the theaters last summer in a long, long time ago (I hope my bad memories have faded). The movie is about a girl who gets her parents into bed after they run out of money. She starts doing strange and bizarre things to make them feel better about giving her the money. It's not very good. I don't really like this movie and I don`t care about the girl in it. The next day she comes to school and says she wants to stay home because she has a test the next day. Well we don't know what the test is but she is definitely not a bright, bright bright, but still, she gets in her car and drives around town all by herself. It`s at this point that I realize this movie is just about the characters in a car and not the plot. Well we have the girl all day long driving around town and not doing much. But she eventually finds the right apartment for rent, and she stays in it all day. But the day comes when the money runs out and her family is back with no money, and so she is alone with no place to live. So she decides she just needs a change and she decides to walk all the way to another town and go in a motel. We then have a shot of her leaving the motel, walking the street a lot of people are still around and that is the end. But why does she walk through the streets every day? I guess this is when we learn that this girl is the center of this movie. She walks around town for hours. Why is this girl not on a different movie? There is little more than a girl walking around town not doing very much. So where the hell is she going? I thought she was a bit of a joke here. I thought this movie was about her. So here she is, all day walking around all day and not having any idea where to go. So that`s the problem with this movie, you didn`t know who she was.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a great movie that started very slowly and had a lot of tension built up until it got to the climax, where things were resolved so well and the characters were so real and the story so gripping you couldn't help but watch it several times in a row.  In the end I found it too boring and one dimensional even with all the hype, I think that a big part of it's success is due to the fact the movie has great cinematography and the acting of the lead actors is just amazing.  The movie does lack a good ending, but not too bad a ending at that, at least nothing bad can be said about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! A good movie and the only "good" movie I've ever watched in a long time... But a terrible ending...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This was one of the first films I saw at Sundance in 1988. I liked it a lot. It has a lot of things going for it, the cast is great, the music is great and it's a fun little film.   I found the ending somewhat dissatisfying.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!! "The Lord of the Rings", as most people would agree with, is a great movie. But, to me personally, it wasn't that great. The movie was basically a combination of three short films: The Lost Tales of Bilbo Baggins, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, and The Battle of the Five Armies. In the first three, Bilbo is an adventurous character who lives in Hobbiton for a while. In all three, the Hobbit is a nice place to live. The only thing the inhabitants of the hobbit are concerned about is food, and food is very scarce. In The Desolate of Smint, Bilboa takes a journey to seek his lost treasure. During his travels, Bil bo gets to visit with the dwarves of Durin's house, the most renowned dwarven house in the world, to which his father once belonged. Durin, however, seems to have become an eccentric due to a curse that comes upon him from his father, and he soon becomes a menace to everyone. The Hobbit, the first part, is very charming, even though it has a pretty bad ending. As with all good adaptations of Tolkien's work, the movie brings all the events of the books to life, so the characters of Aragorn, Gandalf, the dwarves, the elves, the dragons, etc. all behave in the way that is most realistic. The second part is a huge disappointment. While The Hobbit has many good things, it is also a poor adaptation that doesn't work. The Battle at the End of the Third Age, the only part that is truly good, is simply dreadful. It is very bad. The fight scenes are very bad, the acting is so terrible that no one in the film really has any emotion, no one has any real emotions at all, and as a result you feel sorry for Gandalf and the dwarves. The acting is just so bad that the movie feels so pointless. The third short film, the one that introduces Bilbo to the dwarves and Bilbo's quest is a complete mess. It starts so good, but then goes downhill fast. The dwarves act like they hate the hobbits, the elf's act like elves and like they can't stand the hobbles. The hobbits act exactly as they do in the Lord of The Rings movies, but they act even worse. They seem to have no feeling and are just a bunch of kids who can't handle anything.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******** This is my first attempt at an English film and it is really bad. It has a lot of funny moments as well as funny lines but the plot of the whole movie is just very lame. I think I laughed a total of 3 times when we first saw them. There is a guy who is looking for someone to buy a pair of scissors because he needs a new pair. The man is so lazy that he doesn't even go to a store and look around but he finds a pair at a shop. When he tries to buy it the man says that the scissors are worth 100 yen (about $0.01 USD). And this is the funniest moment in the movie: The old guy who just bought the scissors is just watching all this laughing and he asks the man if it is worth 100 or 200. The old man then takes out the scissors and says it is not worth 100 and the man looks around until he finds another man who will give him his old pair of shavers for 100 (I guess he would have been happy to find that it was worth 100). And we all laughed so much. I guess that the whole idea of this movie is that you have to see it because it is hilarious. The only thing I don't like about this movie that is the fact that everyone is wearing glasses in this film, and I think that you would be hard pressed to find a good excuse to show someone wearing glasses. I like when I laugh I like how the story is made. I know the people are doing this movie for fun but I think it has been done better with other movies. Maybe there is a lot more to the movie (and I would like to see a trailer for this movie) but I really don't think you would enjoy this movie if you like movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's one of those things, you just know going into it that it won't work, but what makes it a bad film is the writing.   The script was written in 1984, I can't help it if it does come off as a dated script for 1987.  I guess I'm the only one that finds the script funny because I feel that it is the first time that the main character shows any emotion, the movie was going so well that I just assumed it would be a classic.  Now, the first act is one where I just felt like a dork that came to this movie because of the plot.  But once you get past that, the writing gets much worse.  The characters are all completely flat in terms of personality, the whole movie is just a comedy.  Why is that, what is the point of it?  It doesn't have to be like that to make it good.  So now I know why most kids of that generation don't like it, I feel I can relate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only real problem with "Naked Gun" is that its the only film that stars the legendary Charles Bronson as a cop. Yes, it's a remake of the classic "B.D.N.N." but it does not have the same charm.  Bronson plays James "Ned" Bronson who is a former Marine who is now a detective for the San Francisco PD. As we're introduced to Ned Bronson, we notice that the cop uniform doesn't quite fit him and this leads to an uncomfortable scene. This is because Bronson is so much taller than the guys he's dealing with. He also has a very big chin. Bronson also has an unimpressive figure (which is a good thing because he's a cop) and he doesn't stand out as much as some other movie stars of the day. The film is a parody of the crime genre with lots of jokes. This film should not be played by people with weak stomachs. Also, the acting is terrible in this one, including Charles Bronsons. For a remake you don't need much to make it successful. There is not much in the way of talent either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!...  I really don't know what the hell this is. This movie starts out very promising and fun, which it is. But the movie really turns sour after about 40 minutes when the guys start talking about how to get girls. After that, it's a bad, boring, cheesy, cheesy B-movie with a bad acting and no humor whatsoever.   I'm sure some people out there like this movie, but I'm not one of them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This one is a rip off of the first movie and, to be frank, the entire plotline is recycled.   What is worse is how many of the characters are recycled.  The girl was first played by Kim Ji Joong and, like in the movie, she can't act, and even her name is recycled too.    The other three are played by the same cast in the first film as well and the movie's plot is very similar.  I mean, you don't need to go out and see that film to know what is about to happen in this one.  The cast is all the same as well, I mean again, we go over the same stuff from the first.  All the characters just act like they are talking to one another when they are actually talking to the audience.  It's not really a bad film but it has all the hallmarks of a cheap sequel.  If I ever had a chance to see this movie, I'm not sure I'd see it again since I know all the parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great movie that never lived up to the hype but has a good, heart-warming story that's more than a little creepy.   The movie itself is fairly solid.  The plot is quite unique - a man is accused of murder, then the cops find some very suspicious evidence, so there's a trial.  There's some good laughs, the special effects are good, and the story and characters are both likable enough for me to recommend this one.  I'm glad to have made a movie of it...and I hope it wasn't so terrible that I'll never get a chance to again... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In a nutshell, the movie is based on the popular novel of the same name by Stephen King. It is about a high school group of kids that start their life together in a big mansion on a small island in the Everglades. A bunch of murders take place in the neighborhood that were blamed on one of the students, Peter "Spooky" Parker. One night, when his father and mother pass away, Spooky goes out to get some sleep and a strange figure is seen near the windows. In a way, the character is a parody of a ghost, although the creepy thing is not really a ghost. He is supposed to be a ghost who wants to possess Spooky, who is supposed be possessed by him. There is not a single thing that I enjoyed about the movie in the slightest. The movie is horrible, it is not funny, and it is an absolute train wreck.   The only thing that makes the movie a little better is the performances of the actors. They do a pretty good job with their roles, they give a decent performance as Spooky the character, and they did a pretty decent job with the performances in the other roles too. All the other characters are really annoying in the movie, and one by one they get killed off one by another, and there is nothing that I can really say good or bad about them. One thing that could have helped the movie out a lot is if it had a different writer than what it has got. There are a lot of times when I just wanted to jump out of my seat and leave the theater. If the movie were to be remade, that would be the only thing I could really expect to see in the new one.   on the positive side, I must say that when it is in full on gory detail, there is a decent amount of gore to be seen. There isn't a whole lot of it throughout the movie though. One scene, where Spooky has a dream where he is talking to his "parents," and his "mother" takes her shirt off, the body of a dead woman is hanging from the ceiling. When Spooky wakes up, he goes to the bathroom and looks around, and sees the same thing. There's nothing there. But, I don't like how the characters are portrayed in the film in a lot. Spooky is very bland. There just seems to be this feeling in him that he is something that exists to him, and that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If this is the best movie of the year for any one else, it might be for me. It was well written and acted and a great story.   It is a simple and yet powerful story about a couple who have decided to get married after being married for 8 years. They start out on a road trip, and while they are on the road, they get kidnapped by a couple of bandits. They are held in a cave for some time, and they get rescued by an Indian chief who teaches them about a cave that holds treasures. They set up camp in the cave. One of the chief's sons is a "witch" and has a magical wand that can turn people into animals. One day the wand breaks, and his father is forced to shoot the boy who has turned. He did not mean to kill the boy, but it was his only chance. The boy's mother comes and shoots the chief, and then the father turns the wand back to its rightful owner. The story then moves to another village, where there is a wizard who can turn anyone into a beast. The wizard wants to marry the girl who has a cat, so she will be his wife. A young woman who has been turned into a cat (the girl) falls in love with the wizard. The girl is then turned back to the human form. I did enjoy the movie very much, and it is certainly a great movie for those who are looking for a good laugh.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I'm just about halfway through this movie. There are many things that could be praised about the story. For example, this was based on a true story. Not only that, but the characters and the situation of the times are realistic in a way that's actually quite haunting. You get to experience that feeling that people get who have experienced a terrible time, and it's such a sad, but sad feeling. It's not a movie that is meant to be enjoyable. It is meant for those who want to experience the feelings that you get after surviving a horrendous ordeal. It has an almost ghost-like quality. You can't tell that the movie is being filmed. The characters are all so dead-eyed that there's a surreal effect in the viewing of the scene. One character is so dead, he's like a spirit walking around the film. It all seems so unreal, yet I found myself in such a place, that I could almost see myself in it. But then again, you can't believe what you're looking at.  There are other things I can commend about this film, as well, but they're not worth a description. I'm not saying that the ending was "hilarious" (as the film had a certain "sporty" look about it), but it could have been done much better. I felt that the film was a bit too much like a movie of the day at times, which I suppose could have worked. There were a couple of plot holes and things were a bit rushed. So, the "real" story is really the result of a movie made in the '50s, but it's not very good. I could see a way in which it could be "good", with a better screenplay. I can't get enough of the actors in it, and the story is very unique (I don't even know what the word means). The ending wasn't a total disaster, but I'd still recommend it as a good time. But it definitely didn't meet my standards.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, I can't imagine how this film would fare if it were to be shown in a theater, or even on the screen.  The story is so bad, that I'm not even sure why there are any actors in the film.   It is so badly written that it is actually hard to believe that there is supposed to be a story to begin with.  And this has to be one of the most over-the-top endings I've ever seen.  It has got to be the worst excuse of a film that I've seen.     The best movie of 2013 so far.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Oh, no, the evil spirit is upon us again.   The film is a combination of a low budget exploitation flick, and an episode of the TV series The Twilight Zone.   There is no way in hell that this film was meant to be anything other than a cheap knock off.  The plot is silly, the actors look like they've put on body paint to try to hide their awful voices, and the special effects are pretty lame.  What is there to "get" out of this?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am very impressed with this movie. I don't even know how it made it to the screen and I was at home and watching it! This was like watching a very interesting science fiction movie from the 60's starring Dr. Who with his friends and his assistants and his family and all kinds of other crazy characters like the robot girl. A very good story and a really funny part was in the last 30 seconds of the movie when the guy was talking to the girl. He wanted a date and this was his friend's response. He said yes. She says 'OK! Do you like to talk to a cute guy like me?'' What a way to end this film! I can not say that I liked the movie but it was definitely interesting and funny and it really was a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This movie has absolutely no substance. It's very bad at all times. I wouldn't call it a bad film because it has some good moments. There's a lot of shots of a big white space station and very pretty. It has a good cast and some interesting plot lines. The biggest problem I had with this movie was there's absolutely no story, it's just a bunch of space crazes. And then, the ending is stupid. Not the best movie I ever saw, but definitely a good laugh.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was the kind of film I like when I'm bored. It's probably why I like it so much. But not only is it not boring, it's really pretty and not a bad looking film at all. It really is well directed and edited, and the acting is actually quite good, the only one that comes off as really bad is the one character named 'A. D.' and she has to say all the lines. But she is a funny little girl, and that part of her is probably what makes you laugh. But the fact that she is supposed to be the "good girl" (and to a lesser extent she is) really doesn't make her any more believable. And when there's a girl acting in a sex scene in the middle of a busy street, that's just plain wrong and not at all sexy. But it's still a good movie and worth watching, it is a good story and not in bad taste. Rating: 3/5 About the Author: The above story and movie reviews are simply written by me, the actual title of the movie is "Babylon's Child" but I didn't want to go with that since the title of this story is Babylon's Child too. I actually didn't write the movie myself, and I actually don't mind that I didn"t write it as the movie I wrote is based upon my own story and I think it was good enough to be called a movie but I'm not even sure that it is the movie that was written by the author I saw it a few years ago in a film festival in a hotel, it was a decent movie but it was just really not me and if I knew then that this book was based upon the movie then it would have been a great movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The whole film is a parody of its own style, with a soundtrack by the likes of Elton John, Elton's manager and two other famous rockers from the 70s and 80s. The film takes a comedic approach with the character of the man, who is forced to be a carer for his son, an alcoholic who lives in an apartment. The characters are portrayed so well that it's no wonder that the film has a cult following."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was the epitome of the low budget crap that I thought was a rarity in the 1970's, a film of some very bad special effects and cheesy effects, and most of all it was filled with such a big cast that I honestly thought that the whole thing was going to go horribly wrong. When a guy like John Wayne is not even a good villain, this is the worst.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a great scene involving a young man's relationship with his mother. In this scene, we see that his mother is very loving and supportive. He tells her a lot about his life. At one point, she says that she loves him more than he loves her (though that's obviously something she'd never say to a boy). The scene is quite touching and the little boy says, "Well, I love you too mommy, and you're the best mommy ever!" That little bit of dialogue makes this whole film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's interesting that a movie about the Vietnam War can be such a mess, especially when the movie starts off with a nice little war movie, but it quickly gets boring. The movie focuses on a team of mercenaries, and they play their role in the war well.   I thought the action and special effects were awesome in a movie where it's really hard to see where the bullets are coming from. They seem to come from nowhere, almost all of them do. I thought the gunfights were awesome, the action is fast paced and intense.  The movie seems to take a step back after the initial set up, but I was still enthralled by the movie. I can't say too much more about this, besides that it is worth the price of admission.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!...I have to say it - this movie is bad. It's a good idea to make a horror movie about a woman who lives in a haunted castle. And it's great! The story is told from the point of view of the evil witch who lives inside the castle. The story doesn't take too long but it's good. The acting is great. The character of the witch is interesting. You'd like her to be in a good mood, because at the end of the movie her personality changes. I liked the ending more than the beginning, but I guess the ending doesn't matter as long as the movie is good. (October 10, 2004, 8:00 am)  Wow! This is one sickly sweet horror flick! The movie starts off with some good scares and creepy visuals that make the whole movie seem even better than it already was. But this movie's true beauty is the acting. For the most part you're getting a mix of real scary moments and some really cheesy comedy moments, but they were fun. This is the only movie I've seen with such a great and funny cast of characters that will make you laugh throughout the whole thing. It should be required viewing for anyone who likes a good and scary movie. If you like it, you'll love it just as much as I did. (December 3, 2004)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched a crap movie called C-Man:The Revenge of the C-man   before I had even seen the original C-MAN. This was clearly a rehash of the original.   It was like when you want to watch "The Terminator 2", and when you finally find it, you realise you haven't seen anything that's different.  In other words... This movie is crap, and I'm not alone.  The only reason to watch this is to find out what the CMAN was like.  C-Men were basically soldiers that went back in time to take down their evil counterparts in a way similar to the movies in the Terminator series.  It's interesting to see that a movie about the Cmen is made to look like an Action/Adventure movie.  These guys don't like it when you have guns.  They are much cooler in the past.  If you're a fan of the Terminator, you're going to hate this movie. It is not as good as the original and it is not the best time travel movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "He didn't say he was going to kill them all, he just said 'Let's go shoot the President.' You just know he's going to do it." This is a sad movie. It's an interesting look into the mental condition of a man who would go down in history as the worst President in US history. This President was so bad that even the people who had the chance to serve him were appalled by him.  A few examples are as follows:  1. He tried to use the US Mint to print more coins so that he would be able to spend more money.   2. He had the Army in the desert doing a bombing campaign to the tune of $150 billion dollars in just 4 months. He spent the money and never even got close to finishing it. He finally gave up when the Army told him to get off the battlefield.  3.  He had his Secretary of Agriculture in a box. She was so sick and feeble that he didn't even care, he was in a rage.  4. He used the US Marine Corps to run a failed bombing campaign.   The reason why this failed was because the US Marines were so tired from it that they were unable to fight.  5.  His budget was $90 billion. Of that $90b, he spent less than 4% of it.  6.   He went on a bender and lost all of his staff.  7.   His Vice President was in on it. (We need a new Vice President.)  8.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services was a complete bitch.  9.  One of his cabinet secretaries, the Secretary of Education, was a total cunt.  10.  When the Attorney General (yes, the Attorney Gen is a job, not a position) refused to turn in a certain file to the White House for review of illegal activities, they called him in. He didn't show up. When they finally got their man, they took him to a room and left him there. The file was in plain view.  11.  And one more:   "You might just as well kill a man now because he's got tuberculosis. And then you know he won't die from it." (I just wanted to add, you might just have more freedom now, eh?) The movie is pretty boring, at least the parts about the bombing campaign don't hold up.  I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not a horror movie, a comedy movie, or an action movie, its just a generic, boring, unoriginal, and uninspired sci fi movie (I mean, what is the point of an alien invasion in the future when the most interesting thing happening is how the humans look at it?) that had no point. The only things that kept me going for 15 minutes were watching some of the human characters having a bar fight and a fight between two aliens. The rest of the time the movie is just a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **************************** * This was a bad flick and I don't feel like wasting too much space ranting, but I guess I'm not supposed to talk about it because of how bad it is. * It's not like an awful slasher movie but it's more like a bad action movie with some good bad humor. The characters are all uninteresting, the plot is bad, the actors are bad, this is only a bad slasher film with bad gore but that doesn't really help the fact that it's very bad. * I donned my costume and ran to my car (I was told there'd be at least 100 people there and I needed a costume for my costume party. * Why did they show an extra in the crowd? I felt like they could have just killed the extra on camera. * ************************** * The last of the three movies was more like an action film with some great bad humor but it was still an action movie in a bad way. * The acting by a few actors was pretty bad and they didn't even try to bring the characters to life, in fact this movie is full of generic bad actors. * A few actors (like Peter Stormare and Michael Stahl) who aren't known for their acting made bad decisions to make it even worse * The effects were pretty bad but the special effects were awesome and the car chase was awesome. * That was my favorite movie so far * ************** * Not my favorite film, but a fun and action packed movie that I enjoyed. ******************

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So I haven't watched this much since I saw it as a kid, and I was very disappointed. It is not that it isn't a good movie, it is in fact a great movie, but it is not really a film in the tradition of "B" or "C" movies. Instead it is a movie for the old timers to watch. It does have some great visuals. The actors are good, and the movie is fun to watch but not a very good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, it's okay, there's a little bit of plot, they're both a bit too young for each other (I don't mind an older man being cute - but a teenager doesn't look that cute).  I didn't like the two main characters (she is the typical one where you can't stop staring at her breasts and she is really bad-ass)  All in all, I really liked the movie, a bit silly though.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is very sad and has some pretty bad effects on the main characters. One of the most depressing movies i've seen in a long time. The story is the least important part about this movie and i've watched a lot of bad movies before, so this wasn't much of a surprise. I found it annoying how the characters were all very bad and how the main character is too bad to exist. I hope the original cast and director do a better job of this movie. I hate how they reused an actor for a second time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******************* I really didn't think this would happen and I'm very pleased I was wrong. This is an ugly, uninspired mess of a film that only lasted an hour and a half. For the first 20 minutes of it there are some very nice looking shots, like the one where the alien ship hits the moon and the lunar surface, or when the spaceship passes an alien planet with its landing lights blinking and a light in space which gives off a soft red glow. The first hour also has a lot of good footage of the astronauts looking into the camera for camera angles. There is also a very good scene with the astronauts in the spaceship being chased by the aliens who try to blow it up and the scene is very scary. It's the beginning and the end of the film but it feels like a prologue and an epilogue. Then, at the end there's a bit of a cliff hanger. I was really hoping that there would have been a little more in the way of the alien menace, and it still has some good moments like when the astronaut meets a mysterious alien who he immediately identifies as the monster from the original story. The real trouble is in the middle when the film gets bogged down with exposition and character introductions. The film is about what would have happened to the astronauts had they landed on this strange alien planet, but instead they found a colony with a strange alien culture that's very primitive. The space colonists are almost completely robotic and not at all human like the astronauts. The movie is basically about the astronauts trying to escape the colony with some technology they find there but all they do is talk to a mechanical alien who never talks back and talks only when it's the right time. The final part is a pretty good little horror film with good effects and an excellent soundtrack. The story is pretty simplistic and unoriginal, but it's good for some scares and it's got a lot to say about the alien threat and the idea of space colonies. Not terrible, not great, but not something to be sneezed at.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so poor that it seems like no one cared about it and it was made to make a buck, which it did at the expense of what would have been a better movie and would have put a smile on the face of anyone who grew up in the seventies!  If you have even the most modest of taste you probably shouldn't waste your time trying to "get the truth" of a movie like this, or worse, you might even give it more than a passing glance to make you feel better about your childhood.  You might find yourself smiling at the bad-man-in-a-white-tuxedo joke that was always good for a laugh, but for whatever reason this story never becomes more than an excuse to show a guy with an accent doing bad things, so the whole movie is just kind of a series of awful events that make no sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a genre filled with so much trash and nonsense, I never expected anything good out of a Hollywood production. A few years back we had a film called "D.A.R.K.S" (the "DRASTIC ADVENTURES OF THE GREEN KANGAROO"). I was pretty impressed, at least that I thought, and while the main characters are rather pathetic, the production is rather well done.   I have to admit, the movie is so bad it is hilarious. The first "doubles" are quite hilarious, but I cannot imagine what kind of a life they live. I feel sorry for them every second.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, the most interesting parts of this movie are during the montage sequence.   It is interesting to watch the young characters getting old, learning about life.  The first time we meet, it appears that this is a pretty typical story of a girl who is abducted by aliens.  It shows the importance of family in a society.  When I first heard about the movie, I thought it was going to be a sci-fi drama about the space race to the moon, like so many sci-fied movies.  I have been disappointed with the movie from the beginning.  What I do like is the part at the end of the movie.  If you haven't seen this movie before, then you will not be disappointed, but it is a shame that you will only see it in the theater.   I wish they could have given more attention to the ending of the story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  One of the saddest I have ever seen in my life. A complete waste of film. Just to make the point: A bunch of idiots are living off of the land; when a new man comes in and changes all that, the idiots are totally outraged. When all of a sudden they discover the place is haunted. I thought the movie was a big fat joke. Not funny at all. The acting is very bad as well. There is no comedy. There are a lot of people who do not get what is going on. And some stupid things are said. At first I thought it was a ghost story. Then I realized that the people in it have all died. And all of them are now just gone. Then they found a bunch of money in a sack. They take the money and try to figure out what to do with it. They all decide to go to another country to visit a ghost. And, when they get there, they are all in great distress as the new ghost is terrible. There isn't much happening in this movie. When the film was over I walked away wishing I could go back and change all the bad choices I've made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great first impression of a young David Boreanaz as a lovable, naive, but a little "off" teenager with his eyes set on the big city with the same passion and energy that fueled his best friend (and eventual love interest) Harry Dean Stanton, and a love for dancing. As a young boy, David must learn to balance the needs of his real world and his love life. With its great visual appeal, wonderful music, witty banter and an overall enjoyable story, this film is the perfect "kids movie" that the younger generation will enjoy.   What I Liked:   • Great characters (David), music, dialogue.    "My eyes are up here!" David tries to convince a girl he likes that she is his type by dancing. The girl responds to his enthusiasm, telling him she's really a "tall" girl who is "really pretty" but that's it. So much for his confidence.   The best line in this movie is when David is sitting on a park bench talking to Harry Dean after Harry is knocked out for good by the police. David, having learned his lesson with the dance, says: "Now I know to look up and I know that I'm really pretty."   Hands down, the funniest dialogue I ever heard in a movie.  .  This is probably not the best film about youth that I've ever seen. I'd say that it is probably "okay." In that "ok" category. I think that my rating may not be very high. I would rate it: A- for a kid's movie, A- if you are a kid and you are bored out of your mind.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part of this film is the music. The original title of this movie was "The Sinner Strikes Back" and it would be a fitting title for the third film in the trilogy. This movie is much like the previous two except that it shows the evil and how they act. This is not a film for the faint of heart, as much as it's a film about how a group of people become evil. I do not own any of the characters nor do I own any copyright of any of their stories. My brother (the original author of this blog) is not responsible for any of this. I'm not going to do an extensive review on this. The movie was too long, the story was too incoherent, and there was just no reason for watching this film. It was too bad to be true. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie a couple of times back in the 90's and always thought it was kind of lame and the actor who played the bad guy was bad in the role so I was not very excited to see this version of this movie. I loved it better back in those days. You know what they say about all things "the good old days". The story of the movie is that a guy named Sam (Richard Tarnow) is on his own looking for help and ends up running into Mr. Hapstall (Robert Macdonald) and a bad guy named Frank (Robert Downey, Jr.) and they are both looking for that good ol' time where everything was great and the only losers were those who did nothing. Sam is just in the wrong place at the wrong time and gets involved with a young woman and her husband who is in a bad car accident. Sam becomes a mechanic for them and after they help him out they help Sam find a car. This movie has some really nice action, good dialogue, and a good plot. The bad guy is still evil, but he is more interested in getting the car than he is in causing any damage. It is still one of those movies you remember because it is good to see those actors back at it, but it will not leave you wanting for more as a viewer. It was not bad at all but it wasn't the "best" movie I saw in the early 90's. I also liked the movie better back when it was about a nice family and not a bunch of criminals looking for some easy money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I wish I had known that there would be a sequel!   What a disappointment!  One day we all had a dream and we were flying around the planet in a spaceship. Then suddenly a massive explosion happens and the ship starts going up in flames! That's all I can think of... I'd like to think that if the second film is more like the first then it will be a great movie... but no. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is basically a collection of bad jokes. If you find yourself having a bad day (with the exception of some humorous parts) this movie will bring you to tears. I thought the film would be a great comedy with a strong female lead. I was completely wrong! The film was pretty much filled with one-liners and came out bad to even the most seasoned comedy fan. The film does have a "cool" factor and has a few funny parts, but this film has so little charm that it is hard to forgive the film's plot. I do not want to think about this film to begin with because I hate anything funny and I will not do that with my life. This movie should be a comedy gem, just an enjoyable one, not a comedy I would recommend to most. I don't like comedy in this film and not much of any other film on this list.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- What I have to say about this movie is that you should stay the fuck out of it! It's a horrible movie about a poor little girl that goes to a party with a bunch of ugly people, and of course she is a total douchebag. Then the movie goes downhill from there. The bad guys try to kidnap the rich girl, but the poor little kid saves the day by blowing up the hotel (and then everyone in the place is dead, by the way). I guess I would've given this a 2 or 3 if the movie weren't so incredibly bad. I don't think you could write a bad film better than this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is terrible! It's about a man (who's not even a real man) who dies while visiting a friend. He has a dream. He dreams that he is his favorite movie character. He's a big guy, so he carries his body around on a giant trunk. He wears a tuxedo, rides a horse, and looks like a big fat movie star. The movie follows him in his life, a lot of characters come and go, and it's really like watching a bad comedy. In the end, he dies, and the movie ends. This movie was never funny, not by a long shot. Even when you see the death scene, it's just silly, so bad you can't take your eyes off of it. The main character is a complete wimp, and has some great lines, but the rest of the movie has very little to do with the main character at all. The only other characters are the bad guys, who never have any screentime. It's like there were an extra dozen or so characters, but only one of them had any scatology! It was a really bad film. So bad in fact, that the reviewer for the local TV station had to come out on-air and explain why it was a bad film, to a live audience. He said it was like one of those kid's movies with the bad actors, and a bunch of stupid lines, which they played like jokes. But the one line they really loved was the line that, "Oh, I thought it was about a girl's wedding!" This is the one sentence in the entire movie that was genuinely funny! It doesn't take much to be funny, but it took a lot to make this movie a total joke. It was written and directed by one of the biggest, most talented screenwriters in the business. But he couldn't even write a good line. He just had to write a bad line. There were way too many bad lines and no real plot! They tried to fill the movie with a bunch old actors who looked like they were playing characters from other movies. They even gave it a big cheesy "bondage music" score. It really didn't work. This is a poor little film. And if you don't believe that it's a low-budget film, just look at the cover. The "juggalo" with the big hairy body is a clown! That's right! I'm going to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is based on a bad horror novel (see:   ), written by a woman named Eileen O'Connor who I didn't care for but did enjoy it for the gory scenes. This movie looks a lot more gory than it actually is, because it takes its gore too seriously and overreaches a bit, with a few people in the background to try to be scary instead of using a real gory camera.   I didn't expect this movie to have so many people in it, and that they would all be bad guys. The movie was based on the book by Mary O'Brian, and it is pretty awful, in which the hero has to go to hell in a hand basket to fight evil spirits. I'd just skip this movie at all costs.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film about a boy who is sent to the school that he loves and gets caught up in a very messed up situation. This is the first time I have seen the director's name "Bertrand Bros." It seems he does not make very good films, or any at least. This one was a very long time in making it was also the only one he made and it seems to have run over budget and under budget as there were some major errors and mistakes in the script which would have cost a lot of money to fix. I will not give this film a 4 Star review because I think the director could have been a lot better. It was just too messed up. The kids were a great set but we got to see nothing more than the first grade in a school. The second grade I had a little more of a sense of the real world. I think this movie is the best of the Bros. I am a big fan of their films but I am just not a fan of this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is terrible. I'm not too sure where the directors are going with this story. The setting is a "shatterdome" where a group of "survivors" have found refuge from a planet destroyed by the aliens. Their goal is to become one with the alien and to take back their home planet. The aliens have created "gods" to aid them and they all have special powers. They are: 1. The Mother God - She has the ability to teleport herself at will from one planet to another, making it possible for the aliens to return to Earth. She has her own personal army of alien soldiers, including several warriors with laser-guns. 2. The God of Earth - He has an ability to heal people at will and a "stunning" gaze. His body is made of energy which he projects out in all directions. He has a human body with an alien body. 3. The Father God - He can use energy to shoot energy beams that can destroy anything. He's the strongest of the bunch and a warrior. 4. The Warrior God - The toughest of the group. He can't fly, but he is able to leap through spaces and time! He has his own set of weapons. It's hard to say which character is more irritating. There's no chemistry between them at all. They're all just there for the sake of the movie. I suppose they could have made one or two of these more interesting. The alien god is so much like the Hulk that I was hoping it would explode, but I don't think it did. And this guy: The Alien. This guy has no personality. No idea what his purpose is or why he came here. I can see him as a comic relief character. I have no real idea who the mother god is, but that's what she looks like. I was afraid this film would end on a bad note but it ended rather abruptly, as if to say, "Okay, now it's on to something a little more interesting." I didn't care about the aliens or the mother God until they actually killed the god of earth. Then, my reaction was like, "Who cares about that?" So, it really did turn out to be nothing more than a glorified children's movie with little thought put into it.  I didn't know it was a children's film until I saw the title! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is about a guy who gets a tattoo on his forehead that reads: "In the year 2000: We are all fucking morons." This movie is about his attempt to get an education after a lifetime of crime and his family's attempts to stop him from going. It is obvious from the title that this is going to be a very dumb movie. Even a kid would have to be stupid to do a movie like this. This movie could have been one line. The dialogue is very bad, very predictable. In the last line, the guy has a heart attack and a woman says "You have a lot of heart. You are a good man." This movie is so bad that I do not even know what to say. This is not funny. I think if the actor were more like John Candy, this movie might have been funny. There are a few good lines in this movie but I think they would have been better if made funnier. There is a lot more good moments than bad ones. I hope the producers of this movie go to film school because this is the worst movie I have ever seen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a good movie though:    The story was pretty much the same as the first:     A couple have a big falling out on the beach.  Eventually they decide to have a baby but things don't go so well.     The couple decide to take the baby into the woods but get lost.   They end up in a cave and find a giant fish in the pond.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a total train wreck, with no logic whatsoever.  It is not surprising that it was a disaster when you consider the writer(s) and director (both dead and gone) involved.    The lead actress is so bad that it is hard to see how this movie could have ever been made and how it could have possibly got any kind of release.  This is pure trash from the very start of the movie.  There is a scene where the movie has a scene in which the two main characters come to a casino that seems to be operating very well and they sit down at a table, and the wife starts to laugh hysterically, and she is really just sitting there, laughing hysterically.  But the funniest thing about the whole affair is that she is wearing an outfit that is so stupid that it seems that it would be comical, and yet she looks like she is trying to act like she has a sense of humor.  It seems that all the other characters in the movie can't find anything funny about the situation.  When the husband returns from the casino, the wife seems to have been having a terrible time, and he seems to want to help her.  And then the wife's daughter arrives, and at some point the husband goes off and finds a woman (who is not his wife) and when she leaves he starts to talk to her (who obviously is in the process of having an affair with her husband).  Then it becomes obvious that the wife is having an actual affair with some other man.  He starts having an obsession with her and has a dream about her, and when he goes to go find her he has to escape her in a way that makes him look like a complete creep.  Then at some other point he finds some woman who apparently has had an affair in the past with the husband, and a strange thing happens: he kills the husband.  All this is happening in just under a minute, and then the husband arrives on the scene.  The woman appears to be the mother of the husband and the whole movie is about their struggle to kill the husband so that they can save their daughter.  I think it makes no sense whatsoever that a woman would have to leave the husband because he is having a love affair with someone else!   This movie looks like it was made by some very bad people.  Every scene is very, very stupid, there is no plot or theme, the film
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very bad movie, that is why I won't review it.  This movie is terrible.   The actors are not good.  They don't understand that they need to behave in some sort of manners.  The way they dress is funny but what they say is not funny.  I will say that at times some things in this movie are amusing but most of them are not.  1.  What is the purpose of these characters?   They are all characters that don't seem to understand that there are real life problems in the world.  In a situation like that it is understandable that they would be frustrated but we're talking about someone who has a drug problem, not someone who is struggling to find a job.  It is almost funny in a way that we're watching someone whose problem is so ridiculous that I just laughed out loud.  2.  This movie needs the characters to make some changes.  We all do that sometimes when we're working with people.  Sometimes we need to let them go.   3.  All of these actors need to learn a little bit more about acting.  You should learn a certain set of tricks.  Let the character come to you.  If you have an audience or a character, then you should know how to make them feel what they feel.  4.  Please, make a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For the first 10 minutes we hear people calling each other "babe" with a smile on their face.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this movie and found it very good.  They could have made it less depressing as the ending reminded me of a bad nightmare.  Plot: A man named Jim has decided that he wants a woman's hand in marriage.    The one who does not understand the man is the man's wife.  It goes like this; Jim is married to another man named Ed. Ed is an artist and loves his woman dearly. Ed always talks about how beautiful she is and how he is going to marry her soon. But, Ed thinks that Jim will have to do some house chores, like taking the cat for walks. But Jim says that his family and wife is so busy that he can not get back to art.  The story was told to me from the viewpoint of Jim and Ed's wife who is very unhappy. The couple lives with their daughter in a cabin at a little cabin. One day, while Ed was taking the dog outside, a man jumps out of a tree and steals a book, an illustrated book that he thought would be interesting to read.  When Ed gets back, Jim tells him what happened. The next day, Jim says to Ed that he will take the book back to him because the guy's face was so beautiful and he wanted to marry him. Ed says that they will get the guy back by killing him and then making the book into a picture. When Ed shows the book to his father, Ed's family, the old folks think that his daughter will have a terrible time. But a picture is so beautiful that it will give the girl her perfect love, Ed, a perfect love. The film is not long but I think I made that up as I was unable to remember anything about it.  But when Ed shows Jim the picture, Jim asks what he did? Ed has his daughter go and kill the guy that stole the picture. The guy was named Charlie, as the book had an picture of him and Ed and their daughter. But the man saw the picture of his daughter, Ed. So the man wanted to take the picture and use it to get rid of his wife so she would be free to get the picture back from Ed. After the guy is dead, Ed and Jim make the picture a picture of themselves together. I am sorry for all the old people who read this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Bad" part of this movie is pretty much nonexistent. If you've seen the movies this is going to look similar to it and there's no reason it shouldn't. It is the same story as the others that have been done a lot and it's basically the same movie with a few new actors thrown in and most of the same cast playing new roles. I honestly think it's the best one out of the "tour" ones. It's funny, it's dark, the plot is pretty damn good, and it ends on a pretty high note. This movie will stay with me for the rest of my life. I can't explain to anyone why this is one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen, but I hope I will someday soon.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I would like to have a lot of sex with this movie.   At one point, there's a scene of a naked woman being penetrated by a cock and it feels so good.  I have to say that there's no way a chick like me would ever want to be with a guy like this,  because it's so  weird.  But then again,  I can't see it happening in real life.  It's  very  fucked up.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a bad film. The acting is atrocious, the acting is horrible, the music is atroceptible, the costumes are atrocious and the story is really stupid. The movie has a title like this because all the female characters are like they are in a 1950s movie called "Mother Superior". The plot makes no sense and just keeps repeating itself. The plot isn't even good at all. It's a movie I want to see for fun, not to enjoy. The best part is when the old lady is talking about her life.  "Mother Superior" - A real bad movie. I would definitely give it a bad review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - I saw this movie about a kid who finds out that his father is a zombie, then gets turned into one!   I don't know why the studio decided to bring this movie out so early, but it was a bad idea. This movie does everything that a zombie film is supposed to do and it does it poorly.   There are a lot of bad jokes in this movie and the acting is also very bad, so when the zombie dad and the bad jokes come together you know the movie is going to be bad.  The zombies in this film are not like the zombies in Z-men 2.3 or 5 which is also terrible, because this is a new generation of zombies which are more realistic.  The acting is even worse as well.  This film is a total disappointment and has a very bad ending that is really hard to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts with a cool looking helicopter as it passes through the air. The camera stays in one place, and there are a lot of small details you wouldn't notice if you just watched it at first. Then the helicopter starts moving forward (almost a full circle of a circle with an airfield in the middle). The first thing that happens is the helicopter makes two left turns around the airfield, and after the second turn a third one is made. This leads to an interesting maneuver to bring the helicopter down in front of the air station. The film keeps on moving forward, and soon the helicopter crashes into the ground near the air field. The next shot is from the air in front and side of the plane, which looks good (I can't tell what it looks like from the front and where the plane is, as the film has a lot more shots from behind). This is followed by more air shots, this time with the helicopter from above. The helicopter makes a turn around the next field, and the second shot is the same as the first one with the first shot being close up, and then it zooms in, and zooms out. The first shot makes the helicopter look like it is heading straight down at the ground. The third shot zooms the helicopter close to the ground and a close-up of the pilot, and it looks as if it has crashed. After that the plane lands in front, followed by another shot of the helicopter and a panning shot across the field, with another close-in shot of someone running toward the helicopter. The pan over the field is a good idea, as it's supposed to have some sense. Then shots of an air force plane flying away, and a shot of a helicopter in front at a close distance. Then a shot from the helicopter of the man running after the plane. Then another shot from helicopter of a man running into the plane (this was also done from a close range, but the angle is different). The next four shots all have the camera following behind the plane in a full orbit, one before it crashes and one after it crashes, but they're mostly from a distance. There are several close-ups of the same guy at a distance (two or three shots in total). There are some fast zooms, and they're done very well, but I feel like this type of camera doesn't go well with realistic depictions of combat. Also, at one point the camera is zoomed too far in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of my favorite movies of all time! When this film was released, it was like watching a dream come true! If you liked the classic movie, this film will be like watching the original on acid. The story was a fantastic twist in a classic tale. I will NEVER go to see another film in a theater. But if your a fan of this movie or any similar movie, it will not be a bad trip. I would say that even with all the flaws the film has, the art and music was great and the performances were excellent.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would like to say that the film is well made in all respects. There are certain scenes that were really impressive and those are the ones that really caught my attention, the camera work and the performance of the actors is very good. The only problem with the film was the way that it was presented in the theater. It was hard to hear at times and there was a little bit of noise on a couple of occasions. The film will still keep you interested even if you don't like horror movies at times.

Wonner and Rader are not your average child-abusers and they do not act like they are some kind of "kids". They are adults and, if this is true, then this may mean they need more help. This is not a story about one-off monsters or psychopaths. The story is an inside look at the lives of two men: a killer who kills when he has to, and a man who can't help but kill. The two men, who have a past history of abuse, have decided to break their families apart by killing their children. It is through these stories that we watch these men destroy their families, families who have been destroyed for the sake of one-time friends who are now, apparently, adults in their own minds. It may be possible that a family should be left intact, but there is nothing that makes it seem possible. This movie is a story of a broken man and a broken child.  This film could easily have been a film about a man being locked away in a mental hospital for being a child abuser. But instead the film takes a turn and ends up being the story of two broken people. The film is a tale about two people who have no hope left. The filmmakers have to choose how they want to show this, what story
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it looks like a movie about a kid who wants to become a baseball player, but he is caught in a bad situation and has to play against some really bad opponents.  He also finds out that he is a son of a famous baseball player and is playing with the famous "Randy Johnson."  The first half of the movie is basically one long baseball game, and the rest is a very poor attempt at making a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________Cinema in the United States is a difficult thing to do. The first feature I ever took a chance on, the one that got me hooked on a form of cinema, was The Outpost in 1951. The production, directed by Billy Wilder, was a big success and I still have a soft spot for it, even though it was not a great picture, but the characters were good and the set pieces were well put together. A big movie star in its heyday, it was a very stylish film in a 1950's aesthetic. This is a movie about an army platoon which goes off to the South Pacific to fight in the war against Japan, but is badly needed on the home front. While it is still a pretty good movie, as the title suggests, The Outposts is not quite as good as I was expecting it to be. The script is very simple, and the film suffers from being too obvious. The cast is good enough and there are a few decent performances and action sequences, but this could have been a lot better with an extra decade of age or more to improve it. If you are in the mood for a good story about the dangers of going abroad, you may like this a lot, but I don't recommend it to anyone who is looking for a picture with some flair and energy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!  1. THE BIRD: The Bird can be so fucking stupid. The Bird is the star. He has no purpose in the film other than to be the butt of every joke.   He is always seen watching television on a couch with a beer in hand. Then the camera panned to a kitchen full of dishes and a bird was seen pecking around a pot and a pot full of fish. And the bird said "I am very hungry. " What a dick! And then the Bird did an old man impression.  It was like a fucking joke. The idea of the bird in a movie playing TV and eating fish is just a big ol' laugh magnet that can be used to fill any empty space on the film. The only way it could get a bad review in the middle of a comedy is if it was really good like all of the other "Bird" movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A little bit like "The Matrix" meets "Lord of the Flies."   After a bad breakup, a guy with a high IQ finds himself in a prison camp with a bunch of retarded prisoners. The prisoners are locked in tiny cells and do the job of their wardens for a few weeks before the other prisoners realize that they can't stand them.   The film is a fun story of petty crime.  The movie begins with a woman sitting next to the toilet who is watching the "LordOfTheFlies" tv series.  They're sitting next door to a man eating a hot dog (the guy has a wobbly head).  The scene goes on for awhile with the man getting the "hot dog" and the woman sitting beside the toilet eating it while watching the show, but it doesn't really have a dramatic conclusion. It's just two people eating a sandwich. The only thing that really matters is that the guy is an idiot and the wife is beautiful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: -------------------------- I'll start with a little tidbit which is worth remembering as I read the reviews which, I must say are not bad, but a little light in the darkness, at times. This is the movie "The Dead Zone" starring Jack Palance and Robert Mitchum. Jack and Robert are the archetypes of movie stars. Jack is the over-the-top action man and Robert is the "stern older" type. You might think the two of them would like the same movies, well it didn't last long. I remember there was a scene where the two actors are playing a role that involves a giant monster with a head shaped like a man's. In the scene the head was moving and it was supposed to look like the monster was talking, I thought to myself: "What does the monster talk about? That's all I can remember." The scene ends, I had to go and get the movie and watch it again just to find out that the monster had an over the top bad voice which was totally unlistenable. One more example of bad acting that the movie suffers from is the scene where Jack and his wife are being shot at and Jack jumps out the window. As he lands there is a loud thump as if a bullet had just hit a rock in the middle of the street. I have seen worse. There is a scene in which a man tries to kill Jack because he got caught in a "crawl" and when the guy is about to kill him Jack grabs a big gun and kills the guy. As Jack turns around his back is turned to him and a small cut is visible as he fires. The scene was supposed also to be a flashback but when the cameraman turned around to film the back of the actor in the back it is obvious that the actor is not Jack Palances. When he looks the camera at Jack's back he is staring at someone else. When the director wanted to take a picture of the back Jack asked to turn it around and look at the actor and when he turned around the other actor was Jack Palancing and when Jack turned around he was looking at some other actor. I was really frustrated with this movie. The picture is okay as an action movie, but there is so much wrong with the acting that it would take an hour to list them all. That was it for me. This review is not a review of the movie: The Dead Zone: I won't spoil this movie, you have to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't go to watch this movie. It is so poorly made I just don't know why the studio thought it needed to be made. The special effects are pathetic and the script is horrible. I just hope it's just an old guy with Alzheimer's who can't keep up with himself. I don't understand why the movie's supposed to be about a scientist who gets married on the day of the solar eclipse? He is already married a half dozen times, he is 60+ years old, and he lives in Los Angeles? This is the only movie I would watch on a Sunday with friends.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is about a mother and father, their son's school buddy's dad has a death in the family. So her dad decides to move back to his hometown where his wife is alive and he has a new job and a new family.  The story follows a mother trying to keep the lights on in her new home. She and her husband have a good relationship with their son, they seem really close.  Unfortunately the husband is kind of creepy. He likes to tell his daughter all the secrets. They're at a party one night when her dad brings his new girlfriend, I don't remember the name.  He's in a band, but I don`t think that was mentioned. Anyway she's really drunk, gets drunker. In a way, she`s drinking at him, I guess it's like you get drunk with someone you love.  A very bad movie. The director doesn't know how to act, he looks like he's playing with a toy, like a child would.  When the movie ends I wanted to scream. I felt sick. I`m sure people will remember this film in a few years time, as it`s probably the worst movie ever to be shown on television. I guess TV-movies like this have become so common now.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main character, Dax Caine is just about the most bland character I have ever come across. I mean he is the character most of us are born with in the universe and yet he does nothing but sit back and watch the most boring life he could possibly imagine go by. You know this guy is going to be a loser, but not in the way most of the movie shows... he does the stereotypical dumb idiot thing of having a crush on someone in the first 20 minutes, and you know it is a total disaster. The most annoying thing is how the plot is kept under wraps. The plot for the last 20 minutes consists of him sitting around, having fun and then some girl comes running through his mind (that he never even met and the only two people he interacted with before this movie were the guy and his sister) then all of a sudden his brother shows up who also has a crush that never leaves his mind. What a plot! He was even more obnoxious when he went to his sister's wedding which was held at a fancy restaurant. After all that Dax is back on the street drinking and smoking and has no idea what he wants to do, I mean the ending is so cliché that I feel a little ashamed that I even bothered to see the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found The Little Prince extremely boring. I liked the movie so much when it was released in 1973 but now it feels quite stale.   The little prince is an unappreciated but very talented painter. His only talent is that of creating wonderful paintings but he is extremely poor at it and is unable to sell his paintings. So he tries to make up for it by writing and composing songs which are a big hit in Paris which has become a musical hotspot.  , is actually a musical drama about a little boy who dreams of being a famous musician. His mother is a little bitter that he doesn't know how to play the piano and this only serves to stress her out even more. So, she turns to a little shop where a well-off piano prodigy, an older man and an awkward little boy hang out in the afternoons to play. The three live a very happy and privileged existence with no money whatsoever. However, the two piano prodigies, the older gentleman and little boy become friends after one of the music lessons that they both have. Soon the little boy has to leave school when he has to do some singing lessons on the side. However he returns to show the young boy what he has learned. The older gentlemen is unhappy with this, for he knows that the young painter is capable of much more and is more skilled than he is.   the movie opens with the piano proggies in a café singing "The Little Prince" to a very delighted audience. As they sing it, the cafe owner sits in the front row watching this. This is where the movie starts to falter. This cafe is a real treat because it is a wonderful mix of the good old "good old Paris" with some modern touches. When the little princes have to leave, he asks them for their advice. They do not give it to him and he goes off to look for them alone. Soon he finds them but they do not want to be found, so he puts a sign up saying "The little Prince is lost" then they disappear again. The little prince, of course, finds a sign for a sign, goes to a bookstore and starts putting up signs in a way that looks as if they are being put up by a young and insecure boy. Then the book is stolen and this is just the beginning of the movie. The owner of the bookstore catches the little prince and beats him. When he is alone, the little Prince has to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Here's a film which should never be seen. No one should ever be made to sit through this film. No way, no how. This film is not only bad, its worse. The film does nothing more than reenact a scene from the first movie of the same name. The original scene, which was supposed to be the climax of the movie, is repeated throughout the entire film. That is one thing that a filmmaker can't do. Make something interesting that can stand alone. Make a great film of something that only existed for a season. But what is the point in making a great picture if you can't even keep the same thing from showing up in a different place? The best that could be said about the new version of this classic is that it is much less terrible and much more interesting. It is a movie about an aging actress who is still living the "old" woman, being beautiful, successful and having many admirers. Unfortunately, she is about to be caught by the police. The older man that she slept with years earlier, the guy that she dated for a time but ultimately dumped when his attention was elsewhere, is on the run for killing a girl who was involved in an accident, while the two were driving home. The woman is not at all happy about the situation, as she wants to spend time with her love interest. The old woman also has to deal with her father and a man who works for the film company who are trying to sell a script for her screenplay. She is not happy about being cast in such a film, and the whole film is spent in the old woman trying to convince the film executives that she should have the part in the next film. It doesn't take long to realize that this is the classic that no one ever wants to watch again. It gets worse each time you watch it, and has become a chore to watch. The last half of the film takes place in the police station and there are a lot of unnecessary characters being introduced. The acting in the film is horrendous, and that is saying something, especially when the actresses are trying such hard to be good. The scenes that take place in that room are particularly bad as it seems like the actresses have no idea what they are doing. The plot, while intriguing, never reaches its destination, which is disappointing considering the fact that a second movie was made with this plot. While it may sound like I am putting the film down a notch for being terrible, this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've never actually seen this movie. It was an obscure release. A friend who worked at a horror convention suggested I watch it because it looked cool. It really did. I couldn't stop laughing during most of the movie. The guy's name was Frank and he was a freakish old geezer wearing a black leather jacket and a pair of big sunglasses and a big fedora. He had these incredible eyes that I found out later were made from wax. He was quite the character, and quite the creep. I also felt a bit bad for his wife, who also appeared to be quite a creep.   The plot line was that he goes on a trip to Europe with his sister, who he seems to be on a bit of a date with. Frank and his sister are both married (in reality, Frank's wife was the one who actually seduced the old geezer. I wonder why she didn't seduce him? Perhaps because she had a lot of work to do, she just didn't have the time!) so Frank is going to stay and take care of his old mother-in-law who is ill but has recently turned a lot better. His sister has just been murdered by a strange man who I can only assume has some kind of obsession with his wife. Frank doesn't have time to deal with her murder, but his sister did in fact fall off a ladder and get murdered and Frank must come to her rescue. He ends up falling down a well after his sister is murdered. He gets up, and when his sister shows up he is still a bit comatose, but she tells him to go and look at what happened. She also tells him that there was another murder and it was his wife's sister. He is a little freaked out because he's not married. He finds out that another strange man had been in the house before his wife was murdered. Frank ends up going through the house looking for clues. He even finds a book of old photographs of strange people in the mansion who are all related to the strange family.  's own personal version of. I liked it, but I did have to laugh at a few parts. Frank was a bit annoying and I could not understand a word he was saying. I will admit he was somewhat annoying at times. I could tell he was going through a rough time and that he wasn't a nice guy. Also, after the fact it was a little hard to understand

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best story, but the bad acting and direction, the stupid romance and all the annoying people, I have no idea how a human being is able to make something so retarded, so wrong. But that is just my opinion. The acting is not bad but I was disappointed in most of the movie, it was so retarded I just couldn't watch it. I mean this is like a comedy about a kid who just died and is waiting for his soul to return to heaven. So this guy wakes up in heaven. He goes to visit his mom and dad and then he is ready to live happily ever after, but in this movie his mom is a drunk, her dad is a crazy drunk and he is in love with his own daughter, and his son is just a little kid who lives in the basement. And then his daughter dies because of some stupid accident and the next day he gets his soul back and now he lives happily ever, ever after.   And all the other stories are so much trash, the other characters are just like annoying people. There were no bad stories, just the same boring stupid stories over and over again. But the plot is so stupid, I don't even know what to say. But I can say that the story is retarded enough to keep me awake. Even though they made the whole movie with stupid jokes.   of course there are the weird and funny people that are always annoying, but I can't say they are much more than that. You don't need anyone for comedy in this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie twice now. It is the same story but a different version. In this version they don't go to jail after having sex but rather just walk out of the bar without doing anything. Why don't they take one of their friends who is a bouncer to help them take their clothes off. He just sits down in the backseat and they have sex without touching each other at all. I mean this is like the guy who is going to play golf or sit on the beach naked, but don't.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate that movie.  It's not bad.    It's not horrible either.  There is no humor, there is no horror and no horror is there at all.  It just is very, very dull.  I've been in this business for close to 20 years and I can't tell you how many times I have sat through a bad film.  And this is certainly not one of them.  For a minute I thought I was watching a low budget, cheesy, dumbed-down exploitation flick until I realized that the plot was just a way to promote the film for a remake in the United States.  Well that was that.  Again, I can get through one bad film in a day, but this one was just so dull that I did it twice in one day.  When you're bored you can blame the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________   As far as bad movies are concerned, there is not a bad in the bunch. This movie is a blatant rip-off of 'Jaws' and is also one of the worst'solo movie' ever made. The entire premise is that a guy who works at a resort, is in his thirties and still living at home. He owns a boat with a girl and a couple of her friends and is often on the water with them, but they just happen to be on the run after trying to rob a casino. Well, they get captured by a couple and the girl's dad who was trying to get to them to tell him where they took the gold. The guy in a big boat and the guy with the girl on a boat are then captured and the boat and two of the three go to a lake where they think the gold is because the three other girls were already on a lake but didn't realize it. The third one decides to go in, too, but when they see it is only water, they leave it and get the gold back, but then the third girl goes with them and sees that the gold was taken to a house in the woods, which had a big house and many people and things running about on it.  The girl's father has a gun that only has one trigger. So he has to take her and all the gold with him on a raft and swim through the lake. He tells them that if she doesn't come back by 6 p.m., then he will shoot her father. He then goes to a restaurant and tells them his mother was murdered by his father years ago and that he and his sisters have a thing that will make him a man. He says that if he kills his sister one more time, that he will not kill his mother. They have been on the raft for five hours when the girl decides to tell them that it is not time for them to go into the woods. She has no idea that he has the gun. He is not in a hurry, and he is trying to kill her and her mother in the next room.  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   They then get into some big fights and some funny hijinks and the one good thing is that the girl who has been with them so long, realizes that they will get back together if they are in a boat. Then she tells them how she will
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had just seen one of the best movies of the last decade in the form of The Social Network and didn't know that it was about a guy whose life was taken by a super-human. And what really surprised me is that this movie was about my life. It is a short film that starts with a young person sitting at home alone on the internet looking for something interesting to watch. He is not very creative in the beginning because he hasn't found anything that he wants to watch, but this guy just keep looking through the internet for what is cool and interesting. He gets a job at a company that provides internet service for people and he does it for a couple of years before he gets bored. Then he decides to move away from the city because he feels bored. However, it doesn't work out because he gets laid off from his job because his boss doesn't like him and he loses his apartment. The job is over and he's looking for another one, but he doesn't even want to move because he is just too fed up with the job. Well, all of this changes when a guy called Mark Zuckerberg sends him a message on the facebook site and it gets him so fired up that he decides he's going to leave his apartment and do whatever he wants with his life, including becoming a billionaire as well as making him famous. He decides to start his career by being a web designer but as he grows old and gets tired of doing that he is thinking about starting a blog to make more money. Then his girlfriend dumps him because she doesn't want him doing what he wants and she wants to be a famous artist like Michael Jackson or Beyoncé. Well the blog isn't great because people are constantly trying to ruin him. The girls are constantly being mean to him and calling him a name that makes him break out in hives. But all of a sudden someone calls him on the phone and asks him if he has a girlfriend. In the course of doing the interview he realizes that there is no girl out there who really wants to become famous and he starts looking for a girlfriend of his own. At the same time he is getting bored of his life so he wants a girlfriend who is very cool, a smart, beautiful and rich girl who knows everything about fashion and music. And then he meets a woman who is exactly the person he is looking for in his life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Halloween is not that bad, but it is very disappointing and boring. The only thing scary about the movie was the clown. It's like he was trying to scare his mother by coming out every year. He never was scary at all. I thought the clown was very silly. But the scary part was actually the killer. The killer, as you remember, had one very big problem: he had to get rid of his girlfriend. The problem? A very nice, caring, and beautiful girl named Julie. She had been with the killer since he was 14 and was his everything. But when Julie went to work one morning, she was shot in the neck and died immediately. I mean, how could he have gotten rid of her? He could have simply killed his dad. But he didn't want to do that. This movie is full of inconsistencies and it is hard to see the point of it. It is very, very dumb and I do not feel like I got a chance to laugh. I had a chance when the killer was eating a girl's eyeball. That really killed me. I can't even begin to tell you how much I wish this movie didn't exist. If you want to watch a movie about a killer with very big problems, this might be right up your alley. But you won't get any laughs or any scares. Just a bunch of stupid jokes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film begins with a dreamlike sequence of a woman walking along the beach at dusk. She is surrounded by the eerie sounds of a lighthouse with a dying cat. This is followed by an animated sequence with her at the lighthouse, and then a sequence of her walking down a long, white road leading into a swamp. There are no monsters to be seen in this segment, or any monster that can be seen. It is a dream sequence; a strange and strange dream; a dream with no explanation. In some places I felt it was a film in the form of a dream. And when that film is combined with that strange and dreamlike ending, one can only be left with that conclusion: a dream, an absurd and absurd dream.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen all the movies listed above. They were so bad I couldn't even stomach them. The badness is overwhelming. The writing is atrocious. The acting sucks. This is not a film to watch but to show off to your friends. The cinematography is terrible as well. This movie is a low budget flop.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Somewhere in China, a family is having dinner.   There's a boy who is very smart, who likes to play the piano and likes to draw.   His dad and mom are very well-to-do.   One day, the boy is at school, and he sees a movie being shown by a Chinese film company called "Tianmeng."   The movie,  The Emperor Has No Clothes  is about a group of kids who steal an emperor's clothes, and a bunch of guys try to catch them.   The kids get away, but the emperor is furious.   He sends a group to get them, but they aren't able to.   This is a very good movie, but it has an unfortunate plot (I mean, there's a bunch a kids and all of them try to kill the emperor, except for the one, who gets caught.   It's a really cool setup, and it's well-drawn, but as a movie it doesn't work well).   The Chinese cast is pretty much all American (well, except  Jim Cummings ), the acting is pretty bad, and the ending is... really stupid.   I think I would rather watch a Japanese movie or one from India.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- I was disappointed with this movie. It wasn't the worst I've seen but it wasn't quite right for the most part. There were no real action scenes in it and nothing to make it memorable. The dialogue wasn't really interesting either and some of the scenes just don't make any sense. I didn't even mind all the action that happened in the movie because there wasn't much action except for the scenes that they had to film. For a film that was supposed to be about a "cursed" sword in the hands of a demon, the only "curses" involved are the ones the characters have on them. (and sometimes even their pants) This film had no redeeming qualities to me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I read a review that called this a sequel to the original. The first one I loved but the sequel... The movie doesn't follow the book too closely, it ends on a cliff hanger and that made me feel cheated. The sequel I don't enjoy that much either. The bad guy is not nearly as evil as in the book, he is a little stupid. I liked the first movie much more, I have to admit.   What I think: I am a HUGE fan of the old West. I don'se a great admirer of John Wayne, one of my favorite actors of all time. I also like westerns in general, so this has a lot of appeal to me. The book has more than a bit of romance, and the movie had a great mix of action and comedy. I didn't think the movie was that good though. It didn't feel all that interesting.  Recommendation: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film opens with two characters, John and Sarah, standing in front of a television set. John is dressed in a short-sleeved shirt, jeans, and a baseball cap. Sarah is dressed as a schoolgirl; she is in a tight, tight-fitting outfit, with black stockings, a black skirt, and dark red shoes. The children are standing at the back of the house and listening to music. The screen is showing a news program called "The New York Times". John is talking to the camera.      The story starts out with the usual "man shoots woman" story. Sarah (Sarah) is at the bar with her mother and step-father. John (John) is a college student living in Brooklyn who comes down to visit Sarah every weekend.     John is the typical 20 something college student. He is tall and very attractive. He has a thick neck, a big dark blue eyes, and long black hair.      Sarah is a good looking girl with a long dark blonde hair. Sarah's father is a famous film producer. It's his daughter's step-mother (Elizabeth) who is the bad girl of the story. The father has a girlfriend with whom Sarah doesn't get along with. Sarah and her mother argue a lot.  She is extremely jealous and wants to be the wife of John's friend who is married. The mother has a history of physical abuse and it becomes her weapon of choice. She beats Sarah and makes her watch pornography. The scene goes on like this. The camera is slowly panning through different scenes:  Sarah and John sitting in a car at the movie theater, a street brawl at the street, a movie with John playing the role of the man and Sarah acting as the woman. Sarah goes to John's apartment and watches pornography with John's mother. John's father arrives. John leaves the apartment while his parents talk. John goes to a party in a restaurant. Sarah comes to the party with John and goes with him to a bar to eat. When John goes into the bathroom, Sarah finds some pornographic books on the bathroom counter.  The scene ends with John walking into a park and leaving Sarah in the dark behind the park bench.         The movie is pretty much the same as the beginning. There isn't anything really new in it. The main difference is that Sarah doesn no longer have any interest in John's character; she's just a little slut. The movie also
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At it's heart this is a bad film. Nothing will ever make it any better, and you should not expect it to. The movie tries to be "adult" by having some adult sex scenes and a sex scene between 2 actors on a beach, and is just terrible. There is nothing to look forward to in this movie. Everything is wrong. The story is nonsensical, it's boring, the performances are not good, the dialogue is bad, the sound is bad (there is a sound editing in this film), the direction is bad. I can't believe this movie exists at all. I don't know who gave this an R rating, but I think I'm getting the hang of things now...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I am really disappointed with this movie. I've seen some pretty terrible movies in my life, but this has to be my least favorite in the recent memory. The story is boring and the acting is bad. A lot of the characters are stereotypical, especially the older guy that takes a younger girl away to make her a "drama queen", while the girl is just a bit too innocent for this and her father is always going through a midlife crisis, even when he's not being completely crazy. I liked the music of this movie, but I've never cared about the actors in a movie this bad, so it just didn't make sense for anyone to work so hard on this movie."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie with good production values, a good story, and interesting characters, so what's wrong? I'm not sure. The ending is a bit strange. There are several problems with the movie's execution: 1. The writing is weak, especially in the first half of the movie. 2. The acting is weak. There's little to choose between the actors. 3. The sound was very well done in the movie, but it's the only element that can be called good. 4. The music is not memorable or anything. 5. Some of the dialog is extremely cheesy. 6. The special effects can get really bad. It's not hard to see where the movie was trying to be, but not as good as you'd expect. And that's the best part: the whole plot is really a waste of time. It took me about 5 minutes of sitting through the movie to find out that something was seriously wrong with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________   This movie is a total disaster. From beginning to end, the story is just a joke. It's just a bunch of characters trying to get a good high. The story follows their attempt to get some "magic" into their lives. Each of the characters had at least one great line, but no matter how well you are cast in a movie, the jokes are just not funny. The movie seems to take the most random things that could possibly happen to the characters at random and stick them onto a list to make fun of. There is no connection between the characters, as none of them are actually important to the story and no one is even interesting. Even the best parts of the movie are not funny at all and are even less memorable. The worst part is that none of the jokes made are even funny. It is only funny because it is not a good joke. And I have never been a big fan of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. I have no idea why a movie like this is even made. I wish the characters would have been allowed to be in any other movie. I even wish a single bad joke that is supposed to be funny is not even a single joke. I am just sickened that I have to watch this movie. It should be a documentary about the "Wizarding World", but it is a comedy instead.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *************************** The story begins with a murder. A mysterious blonde, played by Cate Blanchett (whom you might remember as a bad babysitter in Pulp Fiction), appears and says she will take care of the "tomboy". That tomboy is the daughter of a former circus performer named Sam Spade (played by Sean Connery), who now uses the name of the dead clown, Spades, to avoid any sort of legal problems. He is married to the blond, who seems to know a little something about people being murdered. It gets stranger as the dead people in Spades' circus act are being turned into ghosts and demons by a little guy in a black suit named "Ginny" (played here by a young Melanie Griffith, whom you might know as the mother of Tom Arnold in the movie, Predator). One of the ghosts called "Boris" becomes possessed by the spirit of a girl that he murdered a long time ago, in a circus freak show in the same way the young Sam killed an Indian in the "Honeymooners", but instead of being hung, the ghost was turned into a ghost girl. He becomes even more of a freak than Spades has ever been and gets very drunk on gin. Eventually the girl is able to exorcise the evil Boris and he is then forced to admit that he is in fact the dead Spades. That only gets worse from there, when he is confronted by a girl named Mary who is determined to get back at him for killing her dead parents who were circus performers. He tells her that if she can catch him alive, she can be the one who gets him. He then tries to hypnotize Mary, but she has the last laugh. She finds a bottle of "dementor's kiss" and begins to dance around on it, slowly suffocating him. Finally, after a little while, she sneaks up behind him, grabs him, and smashes the bottle against his face. As it bounces off his face, the bottle opens and the glass shatters and releases the little spirit of his mother that he was possessed by long ago. In the end, she is killed by his ghostly ex, and he gets his revenge by being turned back into the very dead man that he killed in his early life. But what are the odds on that happening, especially without any of his old circus people there to help him. ******************************* I am a sucker for a good

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched "Hercules Lives"  recently. I had heard that it was good, but never saw it because it is all about the sex and the violence. This film is just awful. Hercules (the actor who played Hercules is a good actor, but I am sure he did not get the role due to the nudity issue) does not have sex or nudity and there is no violence whatsoever in this film. A good actor could have made this movie more enjoyable. A shame that the movie can't be rated higher than a D for the amount of sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The thing about The Mummy, is that it's just a good old-fashioned mummy story. There's nothing to see here, or here for that matter. The movie is only five and a half minutes long. It's as if they wanted the movie to be as long as possible so they could put up some pretty amazing images, and that's what they got. Not much happens here, except the mummy doesn't die when he gets stabbed in the belly. He has to get out of there before the sun gets too hot, and then there's some really stupid CGI that looks a lot like the stuff in the movie "The Thing from Another World" and it's still bad. The only thing I remember from this movie is it being pretty much as bad as a bad cartoon. If I ever went to the theater again and saw The Mummified Man I would not like him one bit! It's not very long, but that's just about it. It is as bad and as silly as all of their other movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie because of the title. I have seen many horrible movies. This one was the worst. It has all the worst tropes of a bad story: the young boy who's just found a magic sword, the evil witch, the wizard who turns people into stone, the ugly girl who's a big dumb girl. The bad girl is a good bad girl. I guess the witch is evil and uses magic but she can be a bit evil. I also dislike the movie because the main characters just kept on falling down stairs. And then the hero came and fixed all the problems. It was a terrible movie that made me sick and I couldn't take it. It could have been so much better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a great movie that is entertaining to watch. Unfortunately, there are some bad choices from the director. It is funny, but it is also ridiculous, stupid and stupid. There are scenes that are so stupid, it is almost impossible to understand what the main character was thinking. The worst part is the ending, it sucks so much.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I haven't seen the movie that this review is referring to, and I can't really give much away. I'm guessing this is a parody of the 1980s '80s "Sell the Koolaid" (think: "Cinderella"). I'll give it that it does have some comedy in it. The "bad guy" is really not a bad guy. Instead, he looks like the kind of guy you might see in a "Sailors Row" episode - except that he's not wearing a shirt and has an orange headband. It's kind of creepy. This is really just a funny film with a very slow build up (in terms of plot) and a few funny scenes. The film itself is quite good, with some great performances and an amusing ending. But it's really not one of the greatest horror films ever made. And to be fair, this is not a film I would choose to spend 15 minutes in. I wouldn't have had enough patience for such a thing. But if you want to see a "real" horror film, then this might be one for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just a lot of bad. It has all the right parts - great story, great music and the characters are all very lovable and very realistic. Yet there is so much wrong in this movie that one would feel sorry for the director, the screenwriter and the scriptwriter... I know there are a few movies in this category that don't work, and I have to give it to the director for getting a movie that he could have made about the Vietnam War (my guess is it was just one of those movies made by directors who thought the War was so funny they couldn't resist it).... and the music? The music in this is really bad... I mean really bad. I was surprised to find a decent film at all. There is absolutely no energy in it - it's a real drag! The plot is silly and it takes an hour and a half to get to the good part which is only 10 minutes long.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Heaven's Gate is like a bad acid trip. It has a strange sense of humor about the whole thing. It is an excellent movie but it is a bad choice to make. The music by John Entwistle is terrible but it doesn't help the movie that much. It also has an ending in which the protagonist goes mad which is quite the story to tell. A film that is not bad in any way, but it just seems that too much thought was put into making this movie. I wouldn't recommend it but it could pass as good TV program. - June 25, 2013This movie is crap
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a nutshell: A group of college students is hired as guides on a tour of an amusement park that has been destroyed by an accident and now serves only to make them more depressed and anxious. In a rather comical situation, they are offered the choice of either returning to their dormitory which is surrounded by water and rotting, or continuing on to a haunted amusement park. They make the best out of the situation but end up getting lost when they are caught up in the water-pumping machine.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would've loved to see someone bring us a sequel to this movie! The characters, story, and ending are so far off from the first movie, and the acting is very weak.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a great movie, a movie that makes you sit back and watch, the great characters, the drama, it's got all that you love, it even has a great ending, but there is one thing that gets in the way and that's the pacing. The film only goes for 2 or so hours, I don't think it's a long movie but the pacing does seem to be more then 2 hours. When you do get to the parts where the story takes off, it is very enjoyable, and is great to watch a film and the acting is always good, and it's hard to describe the plotline of the movie in just a few words. When I do say that there were a lot of characters involved, I mean a lot. I didn't like it, I can't do that with a great cast. Overall, this is a good movie and I will watch it again, but I doubt I will have much to write about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like the first three Star Wars  films then this is a decent follow up, it has a lot of good ideas, it is fun to play a lightsaber duel in a space battle, it gets really exciting when they fight in space and there is a cool space battle that does not overstay its welcome. The only problems with this movie are the characters do not develop very well, there is no clear villain, the villains do not want to destroy the empire but they want to rule the galaxy by force.  It has some great moments and a really cool ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is the worst movie ever.   If you haven't noticed it already, that's because this is actually a parody of all the movies that have come out lately.    This movie does a great job at parodying movies that are already great, while having that "it's-funny-but-in-a-ridiculous-way" quality, which makes it more humorous than the other parodies, as a group of kids come home from school one day to find out that the neighbor's puppy has "run" away (the dog does run away a lot).   The kids try to scare the dog, but in an act that is the pinnacle of self-indulgence, each one is given a "knee" to the head that turns out to be a toy rifle.  When they catch the dog it turns out that it's been playing in a small pond for all this time, with the puppy only coming out to play around its parents.  All of this occurs in about 20 minutes.  The next morning the parents are all over each other yelling at the dog and the kid who scared it.  There was no comedy, no funny jokes, nothing funny at all.  What a waste of time.  No one laughs or enjoys this movie at all! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a good idea to mix the world of the film with a more realistic take on the world. A great idea. It's just not very good. It takes about an hour or so to see what's going on; the whole thing takes about two and a half to three hours to see it through.   The concept is a well thought out one but is executed terribly. The film opens on a group of people at a bar. The bar is set up like a bar in the old west. The man is a "Tall T" and seems to be around the same age as the group of friends. The "T" wants to help them and help himself but is in the middle of a fight with the other drinkers at the bar. That's when the film starts. It follows the life of a "J" who, while on his way home from a work meeting, is chased by a man dressed as a "S". The film follows "J's" actions to a large extent and the man "S" who is chasing the "T". Things go poorly for "J". After an accident in which "Js" body is almost destroyed (the man is apparently the only one who can walk in these days; this might be because he is a tall man) "J''s wife comes home and calls for help. The next day "J"'s friend "H" comes over and tells him that "S"'s wife wants "J'S" help "somethign" and so it's "S'"s idea to bring "J'"s "Jobs" over from Kansas. "J"-Jokingly informs his wife that the "J work is in Arizona and "S"-Says he has to go to Arizona too.   of course, it does not go as he said and now both his wives are in the hospital, and he is in jail. He has no job but he does have a "wife". "J," a guy who seems like he has never heard of a phone before, has a very hard time. He is in constant trouble and the other characters all seem to hate him. The story is told very slowly and with such ease, one can't believe that there are so many different ways one can go wrong. I do think it's funny how the group's wives keep giving the "H-man" jobs because they are worried about him. They don't know about the man

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________________________ _____________________________________________________________   You have no idea how much of a fan of the original Lord of the Rings movie trilogy I am! I have been wanting to see a proper theatrical movie since I was a kid and this was the perfect opportunity to finally get the chance to see the trilogy on the big screen. I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone who doesn't know how much I loved it, but I will say that if you're expecting a great movie with a solid acting, plot, and music you're going to be very disappointed with this one. The acting is sub par, and a lot of the dialogue is stilted and uninspired. The musical score is quite forgettable and nothing about it really stood out to me. I have read a couple of bad reviews but don't really think this is one of them. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys good, classic fantasy stories, and who enjoys seeing a Lord of The Rings on the silver screen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The idea of an android named Jax that is a robot but also is a little boy is very interesting. The plotline is really bad, the android Jax is on a quest to find a mother and father. The android finds the mother but is not able to find the father. He becomes angry and has to find his father before the machine kills them both. The ending is really sad, Jax and his father both die and Jax decides to get a new father. I feel like the movie could have been more interesting if the robot were not as stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending to this movie isn't the ending to a movie, it's a one-note joke.   For the life of me, I cannot see what exactly was funny about it.  A bad guy (who looks like a cross between a bear and a panda), and a good guy (a blue shirt) both have different things they want in life. The guy wants to get married, and the blue shirt wants to become a better man (that's him at the beginning, which is an amusing scene). The bad guy says: "I'm not the kind of man who's good in a fight. I'm good in bed. I can fuck a pretty woman until she screams. That's my problem. I need a woman to be like a dog in heat, and I need her to be afraid of me. Like a dog."   I don't know what I was laughing at. The movie was over in 20 seconds. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this is a bad picture. It is made very cheaply and it doesn't have a lot going for it. The movie is made so that the kid with the green hair can come up with a plan to get back at his big brother who has hurt him. That plan comes across as so childish and silly I thought that this is where the movie goes wrong. The plot isn't bad but it is so generic it is hard to take it seriously. There is a lot of talk about the future but there is little going on at all. Some funny moments but nothing that sticks out for me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really don't need to say anything about this movie but the ending just seems really contrived and out of place, I mean really. I know this is a horror flick but I just think that it is just not the kind of movie that needs a horrible ending.    …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The good:  The set design is unique, and I like that there is a bit of a "Hollywood" influence. There's a great character actor, who gives a lot of fun in the role, the actress is good. The action is excellent, and there are some great stunts. However, the story is pretty dull, and if you can get past the fact that it's just a bad idea that was made into a terrible film...then it's pretty much a boring story.   The bad:  One of the reasons why I didn't like this film was its music, which was very, very bad... I mean, the movie is called, "Gore" but it's so bad that I don't think it even has "gore". The actors were all really good, but no one stood out enough to get the film any respect from me... I also liked the way they made the aliens look, but I really wish they would have done a good job of making the movie look realistic...it really looked like a poorly done CGI film. This is why the sequels did poorly for me, they didn't have the right budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing wrong in this movie is the name.  I mean really the name of this movie makes this movie look like a bad comic.  It is really a film about a very bad man with a very very bad wife who is a widow who has a very sad story.   The problem is that he is too stupid to be a comic book villain.  For a movie about a comic strip villain it was a very poor movie to watch.  It was a bad excuse for a movie to make a few bucks.  I would give it a 2 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason this movie isn't rated a 9/10 is because it has a few things that don't work and a few bad things that make it so much less than a great movie.  Everything that's wrong with this movie, all the bad things in the story, are things that are made to be bad and that's the point the movie wants to make.    It's made to make you feel like you're a child and in this way it's not good.    And what is the point of any of this?   The point of this movie is to show you how dumb and stupid people can be.  It's meant to make fun of stupid people who have no idea about the world in which they live.  The story is also stupid.  I don't really need to go into all of the details of this story but what I want to mention is that the people who are supposed to be "heroes" in this story are really just trying to keep their kids from being killed.  And this doesn't work either.  But then there's the characters themselves.  This is not the most likable group of characters that you've ever seen in a movie. There are no real leads in this movie either and even if the writers wanted to give you a story of a couple that have a kid they could have made a better one.  They come off as completely stupid and are not very realistic either. There isn't any character development or real character interaction.  Some characters, like Mr. Shminkowski are a little bit too cool, some are a bit too stupid and some are just a little too obnoxious and some, like the two little kids, are too annoying.  But the people that are the most annoying in the movie are actually the kids because they are stupid and only make you wish that this movie did not exist.  When I read the script I thought this was some kind of a comedy but when I watched the movie I saw that it was actually not very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Evil Dead"  (1978) is probably among the worst horror films ever made.  It's like watching a kid's movie or a kid on speed, with a young Brad Pitt and an aging Tim Curry as the actors playing a bunch of bumbling teens on a weekend camping trip in the woods.    I loved the campfire story from the beginning, but it just got stupid and nonsensical towards the end.  This movie has the potential to be great,  but the writing is terrible, and there is no direction or suspense in the movie.  The movie was released in 1978, and has never been better than in the re-release with new special effects,   but there are better, and cheaper, horror movies that come out these days.  I would love to have seen a full-scale remake or a remake with new actors.  In the movie, there are about three (3) deaths.  One of them is the young girl, and the others are the teens and the campers.  There is some good horror footage in this movie, but none of it is particularly scary.  It's just a bunch  of people walking around on a Saturday night in the middle of the woods,  and watching a movie that they all just laughed at.  And they are still laughing at the end of the movie!!  The campfire scene is ridiculous - there are bats flying around, a bear attacks a girl, and there is a girl crying in the forest.  If this movie were about a group of teens who go camping in the late 1970's, or any other time, you would have no fear of it, but this is not a children's movie, and they are not acting like teenagers and getting along. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the type of movie you expect to get when your mind is on drugs. It is full of clichés: the people are in a rush, the cars are like a roller coaster; the cops look like a "puppet show", the people go to the police station, and the people in the police department are a bunch of clowns. It even has some humor, like the cops "saying" things that you find funny, and one character says "it's not a war", and you laugh. In the end, they get their way and are going to beat up some kids, and after that, they let them go, so it's an easy win and the movie ends.   I am going to go out on a limb and say this is a movie I would not have wanted to go to if I thought it was going to be good. It was definitely a waste of time, and that is not the type I expect from a film about cops chasing down bad guys who make a lot of noise.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to give it to the director for keeping it real and never going overboard with the silliness. This film was actually pretty good. There were a few silly moments, like how in one scene all the people are running around the streets looking for a lost sheep and are interrupted by the "suddenly real" sound of an old man crying for a lamb. But even if it's a goofy old movie, it's still a fairly realistic look at the world of prostitution. You don't have to feel sorry for all those whores, as they do what they do because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time. They are a desperate people, and all it takes for them to be taken advantage of is the fact that their clients pay very little or don't pay at all. It's a bleak world, one which has no place for heroes, unless you're willing to do your job for free. I wish I had more than one star for this movie, but I only gave it two because a couple of the prostitutes looked awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The only thing bad about this movie is that the first half of the movie could have been cut off at a good part. But then, this film does have a lot to offer and what it gives us is a good old fashioned horror film. I like this type of movie very much! ___________ A great idea is put together well but there is no real story. The action scenes are a bit shaky but the horror scenes are good enough for me. ______________ Overall:    I am a fan of both the horror genre and of the supernatural. I also like the way the film depicts the character of the killer. If you like horror then you will most certainly like this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies that, like most bad films, is over in a few minutes.  It opens with some good dialogue and some good character acting but it doesn't last long... it was one of the first films I ever saw on television.  The plot isn't very complex.  A girl named Mavis (Dorothy Dandridge) moves to a new town in the mountains.  Mavis gets a new job with a local newspaper.  She gets invited to a party thrown by a rich man (Harvey Keitel).  Mavi has been dating this guy for about a year.  One night as he is playing his guitar, Mavi is taken away by someone to be a bride.  That's just the plot of the film.  As the movie progresses (I can't remember how it goes) we find out that the bride is actually a rich guy who is in the process of divorcing Mavis.  We also find out more about Mavis' past and what happened to her sister that she left on a train in the woods.  Now Mavis is determined to do something about this guy who she loves so much.  At this point I was just watching it for the dialogue and the acting.  And the acting is really good for what we see.  Well the bad thing about this movie is that it doesn the first half really good and is just really entertaining.  Then at the halfway mark it completely fails in everything and then at the very end it just kind of ends.  You can't get mad at this movie.  I guess the only way you can get mad is if you haven't heard it all before.  This movie is only for people who want to get their mind blown (but you are not really getting your mind blown).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film that really doesn't care about what it is trying to do. The plot is basically "how much of an idiot can a human being be who kills someone because he doesn't like him and then turns him in to his parents to stop him from doing it again." It's hard to follow this because it has this weird, "I am the bad guy and I do evil things" angle to it. What was so bad about it was that it only got worse the longer it went on. The movie starts with a flashback to what happened in this town a few years earlier, when a boy named David (Celeste Holm) was shot in the leg by a man he saw as a monster (I am calling him a man monster for this film is about a man killing his own dad because he is weak and doesn't deserve to live.) The story continues for a few episodes, including David's life before he was shot and his mother's love for him and his father. In a few of these episodes David and a friend of his play a computer game (as the plot calls it) called T.V.D. (The Terminator: Deadly Deception) in which they try to convince a girl that they are the bad guys so that she won't run away with another boy. In one episode, David and his friend are killed in the game by the bad men they are trying to entrap. That's when the story really starts to go off the deep end. When David is murdered (it's his dad's idea to shoot his son, but he really isn't a bad guy) his parents are arrested and the police are out looking for the man who is responsible. I felt for the parents and I thought the cops did a very good job at the beginning but, as the movie went on, I felt more and more uneasy about everything they were doing. I'm not a detective by any means, but this movie was all wrong in so many ways that it made me think that maybe the police department did a bad job. It doesn't take very long until the bad dudes do something to get David's body out of the house because the police don't know that he is still alive, that is until they track him down. So, once again, the cops don't trust each other and they are all making mistakes. The bad guys are now out to capture David because he killed his dad in a game they created in his memory. David is

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â I was a huge fan of this movie back when it first came out. It was a great take on the old fashioned "good guy" and the bad guy. Now that I was reading up on this movie, I'm not sure why I did. Why did they cast John Hurt? Why was he the badguy? Why do we all want to see him go down in flames? I mean it's not like he's the worst actor, he's no Al Pacino. So...why? Why does he do it? And this is the main issue with this movie...it's just not a good movie. The performances all are average. The jokes are weak. Most of the comedy is just the same sort of stuff we've been getting over and over again since the start of movies. It's very unoriginal. I think this is a film that would be great to watch with a friend. You can either laugh your ass off or cry while you listen to the dialogue and watch the actors playing the characters. It is definitely worth watching, but you could do a lot better.

When he sees a movie starring the famous actress, he becomes entranced. But when he starts to think about the girl, he thinks less and less. A chance for him to meet her and make love to her, with no regrets. A movie that is too good to last. So he meets the girl and her mother (an older, but a very smart and educated girl), his friends and his father. One thing is clear: The family is a very rich one, but the mother is not a mother and her daughter is not happy. He has a feeling that it will not end well. He starts the work on his relationship with his girlfriend, but he realizes that he's not good enough for her. It will be very difficult and he has to change the whole way to feel with his wife.   Director: Ishan Akhtar   Starring: Saadat Hasan, Mahesh Yatra, Ashok Kumar, Rajiv Kaur, Manoj Kumar, Durga Parashar and more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Worst part of this movie is how poor this story is, nothing happens it just keeps showing the main hero (Shiokawa) in a terrible setting to make the audience love him. So this movie was just not worth watching, I'm really upset this bad movie was made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "We are not just a bunch of strangers. We are brothers and sisters. We were born together. And we die together. We will always be together."   So there you go:   The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that it has so little heart and humanity that it's not funny at all.   What is there to like here?   Oh there is the good: the humor of the movie, especially when it's going good and when it makes use of it's many characters (at least 2 that we really get to know in the first half). Also the story of the film, which, despite having more bad moments in it than good, still manages to be extremely well done. The best of them is the ending, which is, to my mind, probably the best ending to a movie I've ever seen.   (I'm not gonna pretend that I like movies as much as most others, but this one really touched me as an emotional rollercoaster through the most difficult of experiences. So good that if I had to pick the best, I'd choose this one over the other two that I saw.)
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** There's a reason it has been called "The Greatest American Movie Ever Made": it is indeed great. And while "The Great Escape" was never made for the most important audience in America, it is the greatest American movie about life in war. It shows the true heroism of our soldiers and the great courage of the great leaders who made it all possible. It tells the true story of what made America the greatest war and the greatest country ever. It makes you believe that we won the war and that there are no limits to our courage. It was not possible to film it on an enormous scale and show all the scenes exactly the way they are portrayed in the movie. But the scenes were filmed on an old sound stage in an old film company building that had stood there since 1916 and had an excellent sound system. There were also the original actors: Humphrey Bogart played General Patton, who would be the movie star forever after. The movie opened in cinemas on May 27, 1940; in the first day there were 7,000 people waiting for a chance to see this remarkable film. There are many things that make "The Americans" the greatest. One of them is the superb direction, which is all the more astonishing when the film has been made and is already in the theatres. It had not been directed before and the director, William Wyler, had not directed since 1929. The film is directed in the style of "Horse Feathers", but the atmosphere and the drama of it is very different from "Horses Feathers". This is one of those films which have to be seen: you need only watch "Horsin' Around", "I Married A Communist", "The Big Sleep", "Lonesome Dove" or "Cattle Chase" to know what this movie is about. What really does it do to you: it will make you want to do all the things you can think of to help the war effort in Germany, just as it will keep you from falling asleep. When you have finished you will look back on this movie as the greatest of all American films about American life. It is a real gem. I would recommend it to everyone; it is a genuine masterpiece.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The bad movie is based on a book series called The Dresden Files. Although it sounds like it's based on The Dresden files from the 1980s, the movie actually borrows heavily from its source material: "The Girl Who Lived" by Robert Galbraith. I'm not going to write about the terrible characterisation of the main characters, the plot is weak, the violence is over the top, and the acting is pretty poor. There's only one thing that kept me watching this flick. The sex. There are about twenty minutes worth of sex scenes in this flick and it gets pretty darned repetitive pretty quick. The characters are pretty bland. All the main cast are bland and stereotypical. There were times where I thought "Man this movie really sucks" and I still kept watching as it kept giving me the same old plot lines. At one point in the movie, the main villain is talking about the "real world" as we know it. He says "There are all kinds of people who go to school like this... people who can't take a joke or don't take their work seriously," and then he adds this "People who play it in a way that is funny but it's not serious. That's how the rest of the world is. I guess we're all alike... We can't even get a laugh." The film has some good elements however. There is a strong and likable cast of lead characters. I liked that the movie had more action than the book. It also had a bit more drama and a bit less sex than the books. The movie is quite good with its comedy and its drama, but the sex scenes are so repetitive that the entire film becomes a drag. If you want a crappy comedy about the police force, a police detective who is just a good guy trying to save the day, and a girl who goes to school with a group of kids that don't understand the situation at all, this is the movie for you. There isn't much romance in this film. I'll be honest, I can relate to the main character's characterisation. He's kind of a loser and he doesn't have a lot going for him. I would have liked him to have a bit of chemistry with the girls. The writing is very bad. It seems as though this movie was written with an adult male in mind, and therefore the dialogue is not very good. The main characters often sound the same as one another and you get the impression
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story follows a young lady called Laila (Amancay) who is the main character. She is a normal teenage girl and wants to make it in the music industry. She has a crush on the leader of a big band in a small town but he doesn't like her. She's the only girl who is able to keep the audience in her thrall during a live show. After she gets her dream audition, she decides to leave her friends and her home to pursue her dream. Her dream is to get on the stage as a singer on the big stage in the city of the Middle East called Beirut. This leads to the inevitable fight with her best friend. She falls in love with the handsome, tough and charming drummer named Samir, played by Ahmed Maher who is also Laila's boyfriend and she falls in his arms. The story is very much a love story between Laila and Samir but it's a lot more than that. Laila has a lot of issues with her parents, her husband, her sister, her brother and many more. In the end, she's a tragic heroine who learns the hard way not to give up on what she wants. The music scene here is pretty weak, maybe because it's just a bunch of guys doing a lot less than they are capable of. It's just fun to watch these two get along on stage and get caught up in each other's lives. If Laila was a little more realistic, maybe she could get a little better love scenes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I got off track in my first review:  I will not say that I didn't like the movie!   It is funny and quite enjoyable, despite its shortcomings and a few bad parts.   But it is not a comedy, and it is no good at making light of the serious problems we have right now.  I think there are too many characters with too many different personalities:  the good ones are funny, and I enjoyed some of the scenes.  But they also get in the way: in a few places the movie seems to get on to something else and then returns to the original subject.  It does, however, succeed in its main objective, that is to remind us how stupid it can be to waste time and money on useless projects.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!The worst movie I ever saw. This movie is a nightmare. The plot is terrible. It is not funny, it is just plain dumb. This is a movie for people who likes this type of movie and does not like bad movies. It has a bad sound track, the whole story is stupid. The characters are a bunch of wacky idiots who just dont know what they are doing. The only redeeming feature of this movie is the movie's ending. I can not believe how the movie ends. It makes no sense. There is no hope in this ending. The actors are not even there in the end. So what does this movie have to give to any one? Nothing. It was a total waste of time. You should not even show your kids this movie. Why anyone would waste their time watching this movie I would rather not know.

This movie is probably the funniest horror movie I've seen.  I was about five when I saw this movie because my mother is a huge fan.  It's still funny.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One can't help but be disappointed when you're expecting a bit more out of this one:  One of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. The movie is about a girl named Margo (Jena Malone) who is trapped in a creepy house when she's stalked by a demon (Peter Green). She finds herself in a bizarre world where creatures creep into her bedroom through her wall, and it appears she has contracted some kind of disease.  The pacing was extremely slow and repetitive, and that's not just because it had a bad plot. It's just that the character and plot never grew up.  You could tell Margo's mother (M.C. DeVane) wanted her to be a good girl, and Margo never once tried to escape the house. She continued to be nice to her mother (the best part of the movie).  The only thing she did for herself was to be good. In the next scene, she's in a room with her mother and she's being "fucked" by a "demon".  Then we are shown another "demon" who's about to take Margo. When she tries to leave through a window, she runs into a wall by mistake, which is probably the most important part of her life.  This whole movie was simply a series of jump scares. The first one we are given is the most simple of all. A little girl (Margo's sister) comes to the house, and then Margo gets scared.  Then, some guy comes in to the front door and asks if she needs anything.  And then another guy comes into the room and says "You've been a bad girl."  And we are supposed to believe all of this as a result of a single moment? Really? How about going out for a walk to see if you run into a person who makes you think of your sister?  And it's implied that this whole situation is the result of something the two girls have done.  I don't think the movie needs a better plot, or more plot twists. You can't even call this film a horror movie.   The special effects were awful as well.  When something is cut with a knife or is burned with a fire poker it looks like it's supposed to.  It's really hard to believe that they had to go and hire special effects experts to make up a plot that involved monsters that look like they're crawling with mag

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not sure if I saw this before or not. I saw it twice and I'm still not really sure about how I feel about this movie.  It starts off with the story of a boy named Danny who has an alien looking machine that makes him look like a superhero, which is cool.  I don't know what the plot is supposed to be but the aliens and aliens' children have been attacking the city.    There is some fun stuff going on and the story kind of slows down when the aliens attack and the city has a bad week or two.  You get a pretty good idea that they are aliens from other planets that attack the city when they are on the attack.  They start attacking cities by flying from city to city and they have the same look like the creatures in Star Wars.  The creatures only attack human cities or that's what Danny thinks but they don't look like humans.  That's it, you have the aliens, you don't have a lot of time and it seems like a waste of time if you're not a superhero.  There isn't a lot going on.  This movie does not really help its future as a science fiction movie. The special effects are bad and the acting is terrible.  If this movie was in theaters now people would say that this movie could be good.  But if you don''t have a big budget, you're going to be disappointed.  I don't recommend this movie and it sucks.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The originality of the idea and concept of this movie is what makes it unique. The writing is pretty straightforward, and there is nothing too exciting going on in the story.

There is nothing interesting going on with him throughout the movie, but his reactions to the different situations do add some variety.

The only "bad" part was that the movie got really boring right when the girl was in town.

I just want to tell everyone that this movie is full of stupid. I'm only rating it 3.5 stars. Maybe it is due to the fact that I grew up in Florida, but I can hardly believe that a movie has scenes with people being burned in their own homes and the person who shoots it has a big smile on his face. It makes me sick, not for the movie or for the people who got burned, but for the idiot that was in this movie!

I don't know what to say about this movie I just find it very distressing. This movie was a long time in development, and I had high hopes of it being an interesting and original sci-fi horror movie. Instead, it just shows up as another generic movie which tries to be too "sci-fi", and the story is bad. It had a decent concept of trying to explain the human mind, with the main character having a lot of trouble understanding his own life while he is trapped in the past. Unfortunately, it didn't take, it shows all of the other characters trying to solve their own problems which make this movie seem more like a "comic" rather than a true movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As mentioned above, there is so much wrong with this movie that I can't even write about the bad.  Not enough dialogue, not enough plot/plot twists, and not enough special effects.    For a movie that had the entire thing planned out on a screenplay by Michael Mann and starring the greatest actor of all time, this is not the movie.  The movie starts off with a scene where a black man takes some black women as his servants.  These women work for a group of people that look like aliens from outer space and speak through giant metal beehive heads.  While this isn't bad, it really sets the tone for the movie to come.   The movie then switches to a guy who has a spaceship, and goes around looking for the missing black people from the previous scene.  They all end up in a building and the black man shows that these aliens live off of human souls which then go in the soul containers and they are eventually killed.  So, now these aliens are all dead?  So the movie switches to the guy who is supposed to be the good guy.  He finds the soul container and turns it into a man with the ability to fly around the galaxy to fight aliens.  All this sounds fantastic, except, it's a terrible movie that doesn't feel like a good idea at all.  If this movie had just been set in space and not on the moon or in outer space, I might have liked it, but it is so out of control that I am disappointed.  After all, I love Michael Mann movies, so why don't they have a chance to be amazing like some of his previous works?  This movie is not a good movie. I give it a 2.5 out of 10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was absolutely terrible. I was really excited to see this one, because it's a very different take on the Indiana Jones concept, and it seems like something completely new. The action scenes looked cool and there was a bit of that "Indiana Jones" stuff. The movie isn't good because of the acting, or the story, or even the plot. It was a bad film because of its stupidity. And it was especially awful in its special effects, which are completely ridiculous! There's a long fight sequence in a ship with a lot of CGI that looks like it was put in a 70's science fiction movie. The most memorable scene is when the ship crashes. It looks like some kind of space shuttle with some sort of robot inside, with a small girl that's not a character (but looks like a character). Then it turns out that the pilot died in a fire or something. This is why I don't like this movie: there was so much CGI in it it didn't even look like a space ship, like they used a low budget computer generated special effect that looked like it came out of a 20th century science fiction film. It's so bad it actually looks like an Indiana Jones film, except it's called "The Indiana Jones of the 21st Century". If it was a good movie, it would have been great. The special effects have aged poorly, but this wasn't that great of a special effect anyway. I wasn't very interested in this movie and didn't know what I was going to see. My advice to the producers: you've made a terrible mistake here. There is nothing good about this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hollywood -  The Manchurian Candidate  (2000)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My favorite part about a terrible movie is how the director is completely inept.    He is a professional filmmaker, but he is an amateur at directing.  I hate to break it to you, but it was his very first film.  He didn't even have a great cast.  The movie is a very poorly edited mess of bad acting and terrible plot line.  It's so stupid that I am left with the feeling that they wasted an expensive movie for no good reason.  Some people are more talented than others at getting laughs out of a bad story.  There is only one thing I can say for it.  My favorite movie of all time was The Last Picture Show.  This movie is way to close to that.  5 out of 5   The Last Picture show.  A picture show that takes the audience on a journey through the lives of a bunch of children as they go about their day.  Each episode of the movie features a different set of characters and the audience is taken on a trip through their lives to see all of the joy and drama of being a kid.  For many people it is the perfect combination.  If you loved those movies, and enjoyed it when it first came out, you will love it even more now! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not funny in the least. There was one moment that was so over the top it was beyond ridiculous. The movie begins with the main character, Dr. J.E. Johnson (played by a young Bruce Willis), waking up in a hospital in Los Angeles with amnesia and a mysterious black eye that had not healed. He's having a panic attack on the way there, and his daughter, Margo (played wonderfully by Jennifer Beals), takes him to the hospital. The doctor at first says she won't treat him, because he's amnesia, but he eventually agrees to a blood test. When he sees he is missing some of his blood cells, he decides to get a whole blood transfusion because it doesn't look like amnesia. He takes his blood and gives it to Margo's father, a doctor that he never meets. But it turns out that this doctor is working for the mob boss, Vito Corleone, who is planning a heist on the hospital and the main characters' lives. The doctors, who are very angry at Dr. Johnson for not telling them about the heist, decide they can't keep him any longer and force him to give his blood to Vito. But a doctor at a bar called Dr. Frank Semyon (played brilliantly by Gene Hackman) overhears the conversation and sees that there is something more going on than that. This is a great movie. The acting was great. I don't want to give a rating but it's a 5 out of 5. If you're a fan of '80s action films this is definitely a must see.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie really got lost in the mud in this one, its not bad, its just really dumb. I liked watching this movie as long as I could though.  Well at least thats not a bad thing since most movies this big fall flat.  I didn't think it was so bad it was like a bad re-edited version of the tv show "Home Improvement" with the same characters.   Its only a bad one because of the fact that it has such low quality music,  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________ _________________________________ This movie is a total clusterf*ck. I didn't know what to expect, but I was wrong. The story takes place mostly in a mansion in the woods. Two old men, one from Germany, the other from South America, are having a romantic evening in the mansion. One of them, the German, falls for the beautiful Mexican girl. There's some drama with the Germans trying to get the girl to stay for good, only to have her run off, and then they make love, and she leaves him and returns to her country. A few years later she has a son who is a little boy, and they live in the home she had in the movie. Well, my friend, there's some real good stuff in here! You have the typical old man and the sexy girl that's having a bad time. There are some great dialogues, and an interesting take on the German/Mexican love story. The Mexican girl's scenes are almost always quite sexy and it just flows. What makes the movie interesting is the old man is so unbalanced. He's in love with a woman who is also in love, but she's only interested in his money and not his heart. They have this beautiful and happy relationship, and he's in charge of her life. And then this other guy comes along who is totally unbalanced and has no interest whatsoever in either the German or the girl. He just comes into the picture to stir up trouble and then leaves. This guy just goes for any woman, and if she's with him, that's where she is. It's just so...unreal! And there's even more tension and romance when the German meets the girl in a museum. She's a Nazi and it's almost a love triangle. Then the movie ends with them being alone together. The ending is weird and doesn't make any sense. It just leaves one feeling, like they were just walking down the street, and now we've gotten them out of their misery. I don't understand why they're in love in this movie! So if you're a fan of any of the Disney princess movies, give this a miss. I wish I could give this 4 stars, but it just fails. If you want to see the real world end up destroyed, and you like the Disney characters, give it a try! But you will not enjoy it, and it won't be a Disney Princess ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the biggest mistakes one can make is to judge a movie by its cover.  To do so is to give up on the movie before it even begins.    This is the story of one of the most popular superheroes ever made - Superman (Kevin Conroy).   He is an ordinary man with extraordinary powers.  His home city of Metropolis has been ravaged by a natural disaster that was started by a meteorite impact that killed millions.  Superman goes to Earth to help the city and people get back on their feet and rebuild.  This movie gives you the best parts of a movie: Superman saving people, the battles he has to face and the fact that he has a really cool ring.  One of the main problems with the movie is it just doesn't work.  It was made on a huge budget and the special effects are not really convincing.  For every great scene Superman is put in, there's a scene that can only be described as cheesy.  The movie just gets boring fast.  I had trouble enjoying this movie because I found myself wishing it was more like the previous Superman movies rather than it's own thing.  My wife and I both had a good time at the movies and we were happy with the result.  Don't listen to the critics.  If you loved the first movie, this one won't be a disappointment.  Just buy it if you want to be amazed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never thought about the fact that I will die when i look up at the stars.   One year ago, the great and powerful Lord Krishna spoke of it to Arjuna in the Kurukshetra battle.  I was only a small boy at that time.  After a few years, this idea came to my mind.  When I was a little boy and reading about the battle, I was quite impressed by the sheer courage it took by the Lord Krishna to walk to the hill and face such a fearsome enemy, the Kauravas, without a shield.  In the battle itself, Arjune had to face a few hundred Kaurava men and women armed with bows, daggers, axes, and stones.  What the Lord had done in those few years is not entirely known.  It is said that there was an incident where he was caught up in an argument over a woman.  Arjunes reply to his opponent's argument was to say  "I know not when I shall die but I know not what day, for I may perish on both days together and never be able to die on one".   That is the way I feel when I watch Lord Krishna and the mighty heroes at the Karkardooma hill.  The Kauravis seem to have a long memory for the times when we are not present.  There are two Kauravi brothers who claim the mantle of kingship over the hills that once belonged to the Keralavas and are now the only source of water for the Kothis.  A brave warrior ArjUNE, Lord Krishna's son, now a young king of the Kalki dynasty is about to face the two mighty Kaurvan brothers.  I know this is only a movie but I am not sure if I would be in the mood to re-enact the battle of Karkhooma in real life.  My son may need some time to adjust to living a life of noonday sun and noonday night. I was not impressed by Arjnu's performance as the hero though I was very excited to see the movie when I first saw it at the cinema.  If I had one complaint, it is that this movie left me disappointed. The movie never made me feel that I was watching a real story about the Kuralis.  Sure it is a story about a warrior who takes on the great KaurVasu and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film takes place over a period in the life of a college student, John McClane, who has moved back to New York from LA after his college sweetheart, Linda (played by Angela Lansbury, was murdered in a terrorist bombing in the airport. He was the perfect guy, a man with a very thick skin - "A New York City cop from Queens, a New York Jew, a good father and a good man," he says. So when terrorists blew up the World Trade Center, he was at a friend's apartment - "I'm at home. I have to get something to eat," he recalls. However, John does not go hungry. He has a bag of money in his pocket, money that he gets to carry, in which he keeps a diary, one that tells the story of his life as well as his relationship with Linda: he goes through a lot of emotions: his heartbreak at seeing her again after twenty-three years is palpable. He goes through periods of doubt and he has his moments of despair, but, when a job comes up for him at a hotel, he takes it, because he has some money in it: that is, when they meet with a bad client. It is the one job that John never wanted, but one that is a real opportunity for him. When we meet the client that is the subject of most of John's diary entries, it is a guy who is "really a genius" and who is interested in John's writing skills. When John gets his job as a "guest" in his client's hotel room, everything is set up perfectly. "Oh yeah," he thinks, "this is a great job. I'll give that guy a good talking to." But things don't go as planned: the client does something strange and John, being in the middle of some sort of attack, has to get away, and so he walks his client to the airport, so he can get a ticket and get home. In fact, John decides to stay in the hotel, which is in the New Jersey suburbs, rather than risk a fight. When he arrives back home, he immediately sets out to find the man who killed Linda, knowing that he would have to do some digging. Of course, this guy is not who he thinks he is: he is the "supergenius," a guy named Ivan Stangerson (played with no small degree of exaggeration by Ray Liotta), who is a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a fan of movies that have a lot of sex scenes, but this one took the cake!  I don't know what to say, this movie is a nightmare, it had me scared to death from beginning to end!  The story takes place in an apartment complex in a city in California.  The movie begins with an older man that had died. His girlfriend and her two teenage son move in with him because their father is gone. When the family decides to go to their new apartment, they have sex in the closet.  One day the older man wakes up to find that they had all died except the son.  I could not stand it, this whole thing is unbelievable.  All the sex scenes are not enough to get a laugh out of me, and the ending is really stupid and cheesy.   It is a movie that should be a movie on T.V. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film makes it impossible to take anything seriously.  This is the most boring movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't even like comedy at all, but I am actually entertained by this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film that I didn't want to see.  I was just too damn hungry to sit in a theater with a stranger (and me), and so instead, I watched it at home on TV.  This is not good.   It's bad on every level, from the poor dialogue to the bad acting to the cheesy soundtrack and the poorly edited and cheesy editing that keeps coming out.  I thought it looked great in the trailer, but in real life, it is a big disappointment.    You can't see why they would ever show it.  There is nothing funny, nothing appealing, and nothing of substance.  It seems to be a one-camera comedy with the occasional scene cut to "the other side". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I know this is not a great movie, and the acting is awful. If you really have to have someone say a bad thing about a good movie. I guess you could say it's a movie that everyone thinks is just terrible. However, if you can't think of any other reasons why this could be awful then watch it, or if you like bad movies that is, it is just bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved this movie and was sad when I saw it last week, but I've come to enjoy this one even more.   The original ending was very good, however it was changed so many times since then that it's just a mess. This version was supposed to be "about the real life of Michael Jackson", but we never really know much about him, we only hear some stories from his childhood. The actors seem to be having a very enjoyable time, even the young one. It's easy to see why people like him so much, he has a very strong personality and he just looks like a young boy who just wants to fit in. He has to struggle to fit into the group of kids but it is a struggle for him that is hilarious and hilarious. We get to see how he thinks and he is pretty smart at times. There are plenty of scenes where you can see how much he cares about everyone in the movie.  , which could be a real pain for him, and he does really struggle at times (though he never fails to make them laugh). We also get to really see his family, they are just such a small family, and their struggles to fit, fit in, fit into and fit in again. His brother makes a couple of funy sounding comments about how he doesn't have to learn a thing, to which Michael responds, "You have to work a little harder to be great". There is just a lot of comedy in this movie, which is the best part about it. I think it is the second time Michael has played with the music thing, which he also does with his "Black and White" and "Michael Jackson's Greatest Hits", but it's more funny with the songs.  'the Michael Jackson Book of Friendship' is also really funny. We hear the story and we just love it. It could actually be one of his best songs. The song "Rock With You" is good as well, and Michael loves it.     This movie is pretty good. I'm not a huge Michael Jackson fan, but there are parts of this that have me laughing so hard I can hardly stand it. The cast is very good as is the music. I just wish there was more of his family. Maybe they will appear in a later movie. Overall, it's a good movie with a lot good laughs.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never watched this movie, and I didn't understand what was going on until I got to know some of the characters, which didn't happen until I'd already watched the movie. I've seen it multiple times, and never understood how it was supposed to be taken seriously. I also thought the movie had a kind of weirdly sweet tone. Not very strong characters, and no real sense of danger. It's one long, awkward, dull, forgettable, cliched, stupid film. It doesn't work at all. It just goes from one thing to another, nothing happening for a long time, and the plot was more for the sake of the story than anything else.  You can't blame a good plot for being boring, or for having a clichey sweetness, because that's all it is.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------ This movie was awful, it didn't even have a plot to speak of, it was just a bunch of people who don't know where they are or where they're going, there was one main character who was pretty cool but it was really hard to follow why he was trying to find his family or why he wanted to find a way back to his former home. And there was just no way of doing that. It was like watching someone try to figure out how to get a train back from the station, and it was impossible. I don't even know if I'm allowed to say that this movie was "fun". If this movie were a movie about a group of children in a summer camp, I guess that would be fun... It's not. If this was a movie that was about a big old man on a quest to take his wife and daughter back to the home where he was born, I'm not sure I would ever watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  I didn't expect any better from this movie. First of all, it's a movie that you can't get through unless you're already a complete idiot. No amount of swearing or "Hooray, I'm gay!" will make up for the complete stupidity of this film. This movie was supposed to be a parody of gay propaganda movies - where the hero is a "bisexual male" who uses his homosexuality to seduce women to get them pregnant - or so the film's premise suggests. Not only is this a total waste of a movie, but there's just as much of a point to this as there is to "Dangerous Liaisons" (another terrible movie). The hero is in prison, but he has a lot of contacts that will help him. He seduces these women. He does all the things he's supposed to do. But what he's actually doing here is not seducing the women but seducing and killing their fathers. If it weren't for the fact that this is a film based on the writings of "Lesbians" (which are not really "Lesbian" at all) then this might seem funny and funny it is. But it isn't funny at all. It's actually very sad. It also has a "Wanted" poster of a boy who is actually the murderer of a father who has been accused of something very serious. The film's ending is pretty pointless. A "homosexual couple" gets arrested. Their lover (actually a woman with long curly hair and a large, furry "stache") is taken away. The cops are afraid that the woman is a lesbian, because her own father seems to have died in a strange car accident. The lover is released to the lovers, and the film ends with two of the lovers getting married. This is one of the dumbest, most sadistic films of the '70s. It has the "C" rating from the MPAA, but it's actually not even worth the rating, because it has the dumbiest script and the dumbstest characters you'll ever see. The only reason to see this is if you were into the earlier gay-porno movies that were popular in the late '50s/early '60s.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie once and then I couldn't get it out of my head. That's the kind of thought-provoking movie I'm looking for. I mean the people in the movie don't say much and the plot seems weak but at the end it's a good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Don't you get it now? We have been here before. This time it's worse." I don't think so. It's not as bad as The Last Seduction. In fact, The Last Time doesn't even work as a story at all. We have the seduction in the first act, which is good, but then the movie is set in the next scene in the hospital where, after a few months, she is not only unimpressed with his "new" woman-friends but also gets to be annoyed with their attitude to him; I don 't think a movie can be "bad enough", but The Last Day is at least a semi-decent movie, and the fact that it takes place in a hospital with lots of "old" patients is a nice touch. It doesn't have enough characters and too many of them aren't that memorable. It is a good enough movie to be worth seeing, but if it wasn't for the fact I already saw The Last Supper a few years ago and had to see a remake (I saw it twice with different names) it probably would have been a good idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie with some pretty bad acting and a terrible plot. A few years ago, during an early career transition, I moved into a small town. Being from New York, there had been several movies set there in the past such as The Man Who Wasn't There and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.  We had a new sheriff in town who loved the local kids (of course!). He was very much a loner and had a big crush on a hotshot young woman named  Linda. One day, he is arrested by the cops for a crime he didn't commit. The trial was  a big waste of time with Linda being there for most of it. The end title of the film says "Linda".  That's it. The only thing of value in this film was one of the girls in the movie who played a little girl named Lisa. It was really interesting because she had an accent that was very stereotypical of the times.  She looked just like a lot of the teens from the '50s.    The rest was not really well acted.  One of my friends called me up while the movie was airing in the local television station and said " You know it was great that Linda was in this movie.  "  The '50's.   A nice, old fashioned film...until the ending...it had a very strange ending..It has a great ending in the end..just an amazing moment with that old fashioned look.. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So I read the movie about a group of guys and I am sure one thing is certain, they love to play video games in all their costumes and makeup. I was not surprised at all by the "sex" scenes but I did not like them, the sex was awkward for me as I am not a big fan of sex, I am more of a "let's just see if this guy is able to keep up with my pussy" type. That said, the movie did have some funny moments and I thought the whole thing was very funny. I also liked the fact that everyone was dressed as superheroes from the 50s.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ****************** The idea to make a "true" crime movie is bad, it's not even believable that a couple of guys would go missing. And they would go to a remote cabin, get in the car with the husband and he will disappear. ********************* The acting is terrible, even for a movie like this! I would not call this a good movie. I would call it one of the worst movies ever made. The story is unbelievable, and very boring. I can't even believe it's made by the guy that made the first "Pee Wee's Big Adventure"!!! He seems like a very boring movie maker. I'm not sure if he is making his movie for fun or to pay some bills. I have to give a good review to the music.

Even to this day, I can't find the movie.  The only movie that was funnier was  The Devil's Rejects

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love the original films, especially the first one.  But with the second entry I could not stop laughing. I loved the idea of it so much. This film is so ridiculous. I mean there's a giant turtle swimming in the ocean. The turtle has to eat the fish to survive. What else is there to do but to follow the giant turtle? There are turtles, dolphins and turtles. So who is more ridiculous, a little turtle with a mohawk or a huge turtle in a sea of fish? The turtles, obviously. This is what I call a comedy of errors. So this turtle comes across this little boy. He calls the turtle a pudgy little thing and says that it is not good to eat fish. This boy then asks the turtle to tell him about fish because the turtles don't eat fish, only animals. This little boy goes into the sea and tries to get a fish. I guess he is just as stupid as his turtle friend, because when he opens his turtle's mouth he can't catch a fish! As soon as the turtle leaves, a huge fish jumps on to the turtle and eats him. Not quite hungry enough for its own good is a lesson to a lot of young people today. I can only hope that if they come around again next year they won't be able to do as this poor turtle did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is horrible, I have not watched any other bad films. And when I watched it a few years ago in a dark theater at an old theater, I did not like it and it made me sick. I have had it and not watched it for a long time, but have been thinking about it. It was not a very good movie, a waste of money, and a waste a the poor actors. A must see for the young in the late 90's.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of those "bad movies" that everyone says is "not bad" so we don't hear or see anything bad about it.   As I said it was terrible.  I thought it would be much better after the first 5 minutes when it started showing some promise but after all that the whole thing gets bogged down in stupid "shooter-jams".   The movie has the kind of script that only a first-timer or a complete amateur can understand so I thought the bad script of this movie would be a good idea for a first timer.  The director is really not a good director of anything except this movie.  It has one funny scene but that's it. The rest is just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My husband and I have been trying to read "The Last Castle of the Wyld" for over a year. This is one of those books where there are so many wonderful things that I kept forgetting there was any bad stuff, other than the fact the castle is really, really old and creepy. I had never read a book like this before, the castle and all of it's amazing details is just incredible. The writing is incredible as well, I loved every word. However I really had to get this book for my husband to read, because he really enjoyed it too. The first page of this book is really interesting. A boy is trapped inside the castle, the only way out is to find a treasure map and a magical book to help him escape. The book itself is one long story, but we read it in 4 chapters. Each chapter of the book is a different part of the story of the Boy in the Castle. The last chapter is the end of the third chapter. I really enjoyed this book, a really good read and I think it's a fun read, however i would suggest this book only for adults. I didn't really like the story too much, however my husband liked it a lot more. I just read one thing too much.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe how much I hate this movie.  This is like a movie version of the cartoon "Futurama", but with a lot more "F" words (I wish the producers of this film knew how to use those) I would have hated it just as bad if not more.    This movie really is just about the "man on the moon" that has a heart of gold and is willing to try anything to save his son.  I loved the original cartoon and I hope that this movie will live up to the cartoon and come out in the same year.  In other news, how in the hell did I finish "The Lion King"?   Now I'm really feeling guilty.

I really felt like it was too much of a waste of time, and not even worth the price of admission.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   Let's begin, shall we? It was good.   You know I was kind of bored of the "Star Wars" movie from the beginning when the bad guy was a huge slug with a big "U" on his back. That's a bad thing for an alien, or any creature for that matter, except the ones that are really nasty in "Jaws". I'm not a huge fan of "Jaw" (and I'm a "Star Trek" guy), so I was going to wait and see how a "Jabroni" (I don't know what a "jargonoid" is) like this was going...   Well, it was not. He did an okay job on the whole, but the best part was his "trying too hard" to appear more "alien" than "Jabba" and "the Empire" (who were pretty well-known for not giving a fuck about the Jabba) were. And his voice was good, but there was no substance in what he did. And that "U"? Well, I was glad to see it off.   The only other bad part was that it really showed how bad a movie this is, even for a bad bad movie. There was very little, if any, story. Not a single scene. There were some scenes, such as the "I don;t understand what is going on" scene that didn't come out that well. And the bad alien who is so easily able to take a shower and a nap, had him all tied up. No joke! And then he says a few words that the audience was too stupid to pay much attention to. There wasn't even any plot. A lot of scenes that seemed to have been taken from the last "Star Tours" movie that were just there, but no real purpose or substance.   to top it off there were the horrible special effects, and the bad acting! It was bad, and it is not a "star wars" movie, it is really a movie that was made by "an out of touch director and a script" that was not well thought out. And it only took 15 minutes to show that.   I did like the "Jakku" character, but they only have two characters in the entire movie, and both of them are in a pretty funny scene. I am a big fan of both Jabba the Hutt and the Sand People, but I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a typical 'fantasy' film but the plot has no depth and the acting is appalling. It is obvious that this movie was made without any care or intention to create a good movie, it is a rushed, poorly made movie with terrible acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 20 minutes or so are awesome, but then comes the worst part: a bunch of crazy, stupid scenes. Not only is the movie boring and predictable, but there is no sense of a plot. The movie is so cheesy and silly that it doesn't really have any depth at all. I mean, the whole movie is about some weirdo kid who is a "magic user" of some kind or something and does some stupid things around a magical object, all the while trying to get rid of it. The scene with a kid who gets the object and just wanders around making his own thing with it is the most stupid one I've ever seen in a movie, and even has a "fucking" moment in it. I would not recommend this to a single person, and I don't think I will be watching more of this one either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I have ever seen!!! I would not recommend to anybody!!! I watched the trailer about 3 times before I went to see it. I will never watch this again. The people are awful!!! Not only they did not care about the people that were in the movie but they also did not try to give the audience a good time. The story is terrible, I thought it was going to be funny but then it turned into very depressing and the people who were in this movie were awful. I could not believe when I looked in the mirror and saw how ugly the people were. I was afraid to be around the people and was in fear when I started to see how many people were in there! I felt so very uncomfortable watching this movie!!   - December 3, 2014Funny, but Terrible
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Here's a story. After a few hours of watching this movie I was exhausted from just watching a dumb movie. I'm sure the premise of this movie will be enough for anyone to watch. But, with this stupid plot I just had a hard time watching it. The only good thing about this movie is the actor that portrays this role has the most annoying voice in the world. If I ever see someone with a voice that sounds like that, I'm gonna punch him in the mouth, like I did to my TV screen. And, for the love of God do NOT let these people play Batman's sidekick. No way. This guy is bad. If you are a guy and you have your mind on the Batcave then I would like to show you around. This is like the movie with the green guy in the bathtub. It's not a good movie...well...it is if you're a Batman fan. If not, do NOT waste your money with this film. Just don't go see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a horrible mess. The story is a mess.   What makes this movie even more of a horror movie is the acting. The worst of any of the actors is Paul Thomas Anderson. I can't stand the guy and never will. Anderson has no talent and never is really great. I don't have the patience to see his acting. I guess some will love him and some will hate him, but I am not one of those people. There is a lot to love in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very bad movie that doesn't work at all, there's no effort on the part of the directors of this movie to be anything but a copy of any other film that has already been made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't think it was possible to make a terrible movie more terrible than it already is, but this one is.  The script by Jeff Pope was so inept that even the cast wasn't spared from the film's failures.   The film starts with the most horrible and stupid opening.  It's supposed to set the story.  I'm not sure who the "bad guy" in this picture is, which is a bit ironic considering who has been "making a mess" (according to his "employer")  But I guess that's what happens when you start a production by talking about the past.  Then the film starts, with a black-and-white animation from a man who has somehow managed to make me sick.  The "bad guys" are, if I'm understanding this correctly, the "good guys" who have been "murdered" by the "Bad guy," who (apparently) is a "pig".   Now that doesn't seem very convincing to me...  The film does have a sense of humor (for a little while, anyway), though.  But it's so over-the-top that it makes me cringe.  And I'm used to a lot of the over-acting from this film.  When I saw the picture I laughed, then cried because of this over-extension.  For a cartoon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â Â The movie was pretty good when it was first released. Â However, it has since become a bit dated and now has an annoying soundtrack and is overrated. The story is kind of lame and is kind too predictable.  This movie should have been a comedy for the adults, instead it is a film that is about nothing.    In summary, Â This film is about the relationship between an older couple who live in a small town that is overrun by a horde of Â monsters.    The couple is a little old, their daughter is ill, their son has a crush on the young girl, and the old woman is not really that great of a mother, especially the part where she watches her daughter die.  There are a few scenes at the beginning, but they are very weak.  To sum up,  Â There is a great deal of potential that was wasted.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was the worst movie I have ever seen! The only problem is that the movie had no value or value that I can appreciate. No one cares if a bunch of people die in a stupid way and there is nothing more to the plot!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Takashi Miike's adaptation of Dostoevsky's The Gambler is a disappointment.  What makes The Gamblers such a tough movie to watch is the way it uses its camera angle.    It creates a sense of claustrophobia in the space.     I'm not going to spoil anything for you since there is no way to do so with the way the movie cuts.  This aspect of the movie is quite clever.  The Gamblier features numerous scenes where we get to see the characters in a small space,   and yet the camera stays in shot, allowing us to get a full look at their faces.  You can't really tell what the characters are thinking.  In one scene, a drunk walks up to a young man and whispers to him to take another shot at him.  He then grabs the man by his throat and starts choking him. That seems rather unfair to us, but to a drunk it was pretty funny. The Gamblers also has a great scene of violence and I'll never forget it.  During the opening scene of the film, a bunch of men come out from a church and start to beat up a priest that has been harassing some young girls.  One of the men pulls out a knife and starts to stab the man, but the other man comes up behind the stabber and throws him down.  We then see the man stab himself and it's quite a mess.  There's also a lot of blood and the film is over fairly quickly.  It's a shame, because the film should've been a really good horror film.   It's not. As for what you should expect:   Dostoyevsky did not live in the era when we have computers and instant messaging.  But, with all of that said, the film manages to be entertaining.  I found that some of the actors were just great, and I liked Miike better than Dreyer.  At the same time, it's hard to say how much this film is a copy of the novel because it feels like an amalgam of the two.  Perhaps this was the first time I've seen the novel and Miike did a decent job of adapting it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was so bad, I have to give it a C. It was boring, boring, and boring. The character of Rene had just enough charm to make it good for his time, but not enough to give the movie any kind of personality or a plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is probably my least favorite of the original trilogy, but at least it's interesting and not so boring to watch. The story is kind of weird, as the main character's sister is missing in the forest, so she comes home from school and has to learn how to use a sword and how to handle a bow. However, it takes a very long time for them to learn anything.   I had some trouble watching, because most scenes looked boring and the dialog was kind of annoying. But the good thing about it was the way everything was done - the scenes, the characters, the sound and the voice acting. There was a LOT of detail put into everything, not just the swords and bow. The fight scenes were awesome, just great. I hope they make a new 3D movie out of this series (or maybe a TV movie) just to complete it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would not recommend this movie to anybody, but that is not what a lot of people like it for...I mean most everyone, I don't see a lot in the movie that I would enjoy, so it is just a dull, boring, overstuffed, not-fun-at-all film!    This is not the worst movie, but it is not an easy watch either!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you know what you're looking at - a little girl who gets her face ripped off and her body mutilated in a cheapo horror movie - then it'll be okay. I can't think of anything negative to say about this.   I saw this at a friend's house, with her younger son in the house with me. At first it is a cheesy horror movie. They use a lot of fake blood, and when they cut to the front door where the girl is being tortured - you see that the picture is actually a mirror. Then we have the girl being taken to the house of a wealthy couple - but they just sit there, staring at the mirror and laughing.  I found it very hard to stay awake, but I found the first scene to be the scary part - the child's head is cut off, her neck is cut, and she is put in a glass box to die. The real horror comes from when the glass box was opened, the blood from her face begins gushing out of the mirror. I thought the glass was real because the blood would splash on my face, but it was so realistic that it made me sick to my stomach.  It was all a lot to take in - it's like one of those low-budget horror movies where you can imagine it happened, and then imagine how they pulled it off.  After the scene where the mirror shows how the child is mutilated, they open the mirror again and the blood still gushes from the girl's face.  There are some scenes with blood where you have no idea what it is - but it's pretty bloody. They say it's from the "hanging" that was used in ancient Rome. I don't know why they didn't try to make the film as realistic as possible.    There are a couple of "horror" movies about children that have a bit of gore, but this is by far the creepiest one I've seen - and it doesn't get any scarier as you're watching it...  It also has a disturbing soundtrack - which is pretty much all the more disturbing because you can hear them laughing over it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The second movie in the sequel trilogy is a great story that is a good and interesting start to a trilogy, I'm glad that I watched this film back in 1991 since I loved this movie. I'm a big fan of the original series and I was very excited to see this movie when it came out. It has been on Netflix since 2012 so I thought I'd give it another go, this was the first film where I was really taken by the character of Gormuz the son of the king of the country. I don't remember much about the plot but the two brothers really go all out to prove that they are really a big shot brothers when they first enter the palace, and their father has a very funny line about how the king is not going to see another movie. There are more of a good movie than a bad film and the characters are likeable, as far as acting they go from great, like the whole film is a comedy but it is very real.   I give it a B 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot because I normally don't give a bad film a bad review.  I was looking forward to seeing this, since the trailer promised a good plot, well the story in fact is a total mess, in fact what happened seemed a little unreal at first, but I can't say I was surprised at all, since this is just a rehash of a popular story from the 50's and 60's.  The acting was laughable.  This movie was directed by a bunch of "comedians" who don't know how to do comedy, it seemed they were supposed to write a comedy, like a sketch show, but instead they used the same characters from the same sitcom who were supposed be funny, and they do nothing but insult each other for 5 minutes.    It seemed like a "comedian" would make it better with a good script, but this is a bad script.  The only thing I enjoyed about this movie is the bad music.  I really thought this would be better if it was edited and the actors were rehired to make it funnier and better, but then the bad editing and bad acting ruined it again.  What I don't like about this script was the lack of suspense, and the fact that it was a parody of a story.  Even though I thought this might be funny at first I had to put this in my trash can. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those rare movies where every single line is perfect. It is as if the actors were so excited to get to work and they just made up a lot of lines and just went out and did it. The action is awesome and the movie is a blast to watch. But the dialogue, although amazing, is not as good. It really falls flat. The entire movie makes you want to kill all of the baddies, the bad guys are all very one dimensional and uninteresting. The one bad guy is named 'Doomie', this Doomie is a huge, ugly, purple monster with no discernable personality. There really is not much to say about this character. As for the other bad guys, I can't find anything to say except, they are all just boring villains. The whole story is not very good and it really feels like a rip-off of a bad '80s movie. I hope that a remake was made of this movie, I know there have been bad'superhero' movies but this one is the worst!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't give a rat's ass about the plot. The director seems to have no idea how to do it. I really don't understand how a guy can make a movie like that, with no action or even plot to begin with. What are the characters doing? No one moves, does anything, or acts, or doesn't act. There is a very brief bit where they take out some animals at the zoo, but it's not long before the movie stops being funny. I don't have the patience for a joke that's so bad, that I want to vomit. They should have put out a movie called "Cows at the Zoo" and the guy who makes these movies should have quit. It's like he doesn't want to be a director. I'm not sure why I enjoyed this more than any other movie. It really is a sad movie. Maybe I just get more enjoyment out of watching a movie that is bad than out of seeing a bad film. If you are looking for the latest bad movie in town, I can't think of any better ones, as this movie is not good but sad. I didn't mind watching this, but I didnned't enjoy it as much as I did the other bad movie I saw on this list. See at BOTTOM:  See at TOP:
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is nothing special: "Cecil the lion has escaped his cage with the help of some friendly neighborhood boys and he must go on the run to get to Africa to save his cubs!" Well, okay, so the "cubs" are a lion's cubs. But wait, there's a monkey cub involved! That's right, a monkey. And an elephant and a giraffe, which means the movie is full of animals. Anyway, Cecil the lion is in a zoo with other lions when he gets locked up in his cage. He manages to escape and gets a ticket to Africa with a bunch of friends. What's that, a crocodile shows up in the zoo?! There's a little girl who needs to help rescue her mother, who is held prisoner by the croc. She and her friends travel through a jungle and find a crocodilian who seems to be holding onto a boy who was thrown into a crocodillias mouth by Cecil. This is where I started to not care for this movie, because it was a bad idea all around. The script is just terrible. The movie had some good actors, but the writer never figured out any way to make this movie work. This movie doesn't take place in an actual jungle, and the dialogue is stupid. Every time you turn to look at the main character, it just comes out a little bit stupid, or funny, or stupid. I mean, the whole movie seems to revolve around a man who is trying to escape a crocodilians mouth. And the crocodiles really don't want to get in the way of this, but they can't escape because they are all stuck together (except for one crocodile who gets freed). If this movie wasn't the most boring thing ever made, I wouldn't say anything about it. I was really upset by this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a bunch animals and a silly story, but you have to understand that this movie was so bad that it made me hate the story of this movie as much as I hated Cecil the Lion. This was the worst movie ever made in my opinion. If you like animals, you'll probably like this. If not, you should avoid this. I have rated this movie 5 stars because I didn't love the story, and I didn no want to go see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The last 20 minutes or so is a pretty unspectacular mess of a movie. The film is set inside a military prison in the Philippines and the main characters are a veteran and a prisoner. The former has just got out of jail for the murder of a man he had been charged with shooting. A few days before he gets out of prison he is caught trying to steal a horse, that he had planned to use to make a living in Manila. He gets his wish when the old man who runs the prison wants him to do a job for him in a small town where his brother lives.  Unfortunately a stray bullet lands in the former's head while he is trying to do the job. This is no accident as the main character is a war hero himself so his head isn't the best place to be if you're looking to impress the general, although the film doesn't really have that kind of urgency about it that it sometimes has.  The main character in this film is played by the great Jack Lemmon who has to play a variety of roles throughout the film. In a bit of fun there is a scene where a couple of the old men are playing chess and one of them has the upper hand and they end up hitting the other with a piece of chalk which splinters off into two pieces and they start to fight over who is going to take it. It's this kind of humour that is what makes The Outlaw such a good film.   Although it does have some decent acting here it does feel like there is something missing. The dialogue and acting in the film is great but there are some really cheap effects like this and there is very little emotion in the characters' and it's all pretty monotonous and dull.  There is no reason for the old guys to be running around shooting people at these times.  The plot is simple enough but there is so little to it that the plot feels a little like a middling episode of The Sopranos.  At times the actors look pretty good here and at the end there is some nice little fight scene with the old guards. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** THE LUCKY GUY is a bad little movie.  The plot was poorly written, the characters weren't memorable, and nothing interesting happened.    The worst aspect about the movie is the ridiculousness of the plot.  In a plot where the hero and his girlfriend have a "love affair" they are attacked by a group of thugs who try to rape them.  I love this movie as it is very funny, but if you are a big fan of this particular movie then this is the worst "movie" of the year. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a good movie but not a good science fiction movie. It takes a lot of shortcuts in making up its plot. Some things are explained very easily but others take very long and complicated explanations. There was no action in this movie and the fight scenes are very one-sided. This movie does not give any good characterization of its characters. I like a movie with a good plot with some action scenes. This is a movie you cannot skip.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting something from this movie. This movie takes place in a future that is not a distant future. In this future, the humans are the only species left on the planet. This future was created by a computer known as the "Buster" that has become extinct. This is the movie. The story takes place on a spaceship called the "Hatch" and it is in this ship that a group of humans called "Hitchhikers" are trying to find the last Buster. As you might already know, this movie has a lot of "HITCHHIKERS" and I found this a little funny. You see, the film has a story of a guy who is being a hitchhiker because he has a car wreck. The crew on the ship decides to take him back to the ship as he is their best shot at finding the Buster. What we get is a whole lot of funny moments throughout the movie that made this movie enjoyable. This film has great character development and good humor in this film. I did not care for the character development though. The humor of the film is good and the story is pretty cool. I was excited for this film because we get a lot in this one. It has great characters, great humor, and I was looking forward to more from this film from the characters to the story. There were a few parts that took a little while to get going, but overall this is a fun ride in the "Danger Zone."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie takes itself WAY too seriously.   It is filled with people that seem to think that they have something important to say about history, but this film lacks any of the credibility to make the point. It does however, contain enough "horror" to have you jump out of your seat.  It has great performances (and even better acting by those in the film) but it still manages to be a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________ The good: The main character is a great lead. His past doesn't seem to be a problem. It is great to have a strong and well rounded main character. This is a must watch for everyone. The bad: The dialogue is not well done. Some words are just stupid and pointless. The acting is good. The movie does not focus on the most important character. I think the ending is not great. The ending is predictable. The action isn't great but it is close to it. I can't think of a better movie to watch now.  Helpful to learn how to deal with a past that may or may not involve murder and torture.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's kind of like a movie that was made back when there was a lack of female action films. Most of the action scenes in this film is done by two guys and one girl. These two guys are really dumb and make the whole movie. I don't understand why this movie has been made by such bad people to be seen by us. This movie is a piece of trash that was only made to be a film with only bad people in it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first 15 minutes or so where we get a bit of a flashback to my friend who has been killed in a car accident. The movie takes place in the year 2055, a decade into the future. In the year that this movie is set in, people live on Mars. You would think this makes for an interesting future, but it is an alternate universe and doesn't even give us a hint as to the origins of the aliens who live here. The main character is a young, pretty, white girl (the white and pretty in this movie are two very different concepts). In this movie, the white girl is a member of a team who are trying to protect a small settlement of settlers on the planet. They are known to be extremely tough and are constantly going on missions to protect and save settlers from whatever the aliens might come up with. In this mission, they discover that they have been taken over by a tribe of aliens called the Sirens who have taken the settlers prisoner. They want to turn the settlers into a slave race so they can work their planet and they have a group of alien slaves who do their bidding (think slavery in that they wear a mask and act a certain way to the audience). The film does have a very good pace with the fights (which are surprisingly awesome) and a great ending.  Overall it's a fun action movie, but definitely not worth watching again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie like this has to be seen to be believed. It is a great time.  The movie is a mixture of horror, action, adventure, and comedy.  The movie was shot in black and white so that it is not obvious what the characters look like.  They also use some special effects which are pretty damn cool.  There is a scene in the movie which is about a boy who is about to die.   This is also where the movie begins with an awesome fight scene between a guy in a motorcycle and a giant monster.  At one point a girl is playing with a sword and a guy jumps on her.  So it is pretty easy to see what type of movie this is.  It was a great adventure.  I would give it a thumbs up.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The second half of this film has a good plot, but it just does not work very well. You have to be a bit clever to get into this plot, as the film is full of twists, surprises and turns.  Most of the characters are a bit dull, but this is not an easy film to follow.   It's certainly a good film that doesn't get much of the credit it deserves.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this with my wife, a friend and myself and had a blast. I thought I was going to watch a really funny comedy when it started. I think the movie has a really great humor and it's easy to follow along with the characters. The acting is really good. The only thing I don't like is the stupid name of the movie. It's just so funny! This could have been the best movie of the year. But, unfortunately, there's nothing to compare this movie to.   Overall, this movie is pretty much nothing good. It has a ton of heart that's never really explored or used. A lot of time is taken up with talking and with all the characters having fun. The movie seems like a real waste of the viewer's time. It was a good laugh and it made my wife and I laugh. There's an ending though and I'm not sure it works. Maybe it just doesn't really fit the mood or something.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horrible bad movie. The story is good, but the characters are stupid, a big problem in this movie: the only man who can save his daughter is a retarded idiot (think the guy from "Dumb and Dumber"). The rest is stupid, like a bunch of teenagers who want a ride, but are all too stupid to understand that they have to buy a ticket, and if they don't they get punched. The action is pathetic, and it takes me several scenes to realize they are fighting to the death. The movie is almost too bad to be true. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I never knew I was gonna see this.  It's like I have a fever and I can't tell if I'm watching a movie or a documentary.    At it's worst the subject matter becomes a bit ridiculous at times.  I'm sure that the producers have a long list of other movies they would like to produce.  The film does provide the opportunity to learn about a subject that is important to all Americans. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was the first "Star Wars" movie that I ever loved. It wasn't even that great. It was just a bunch of boring characters who didn't have anything going on, not to mention they couldn't speak in English anyway. I was looking forward to this film because I wanted to see the last film of the trilogy in a different format so it could be compared to what "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was to "Star Trek." If you had seen the first one you knew it was going to be boring because the only person in the "Star" galaxy who knew how to talk was a Jedi. "Star Waaaaaay" had the best opening and most memorable scene. Unfortunately it sucked so bad that "Star Warriors" was born. The movie ended with a bad joke that the only thing I can say to this movie is, why is the director using "Star WARS" names instead of his own?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another one of the lame zombie movies. As someone who has been to many, this was not a good movie. There were no zombies or special effects. I could have been watching "Ghostbusters". I had to watch this after my first viewing of the "Dead Poets Society". This movie is a comedy with no plot, no plot and no plot. The main characters are idiots that make good comedy. "Lose a leg, take a ride with the man with a funny name" It is supposed to be about a boy in love but it ends up not being a love story and is really just a comedy. The special effects are laughable. "Geezer" is an obnoxious character, "Lift" is a dumb character. I felt like I had just watched "Zoolander" but with zombies and no special effects, no costumes or special props.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie. A stupid, dull movie about a guy who tries to find a woman to love, while not doing a hell of a lot of thinking in the process.   In case you haven't caught on that it's a romantic comedy; it's about a woman and a womanizer who try and fall in love.  The thing about this movie is that the writer wrote this as a joke, and it seems the joke has worn off as a result.  There's a plot about a couple that fall in, have a baby, break up, and have a child who's about 4 and a half years old.  In the meantime, their kid grows up to be a very bright, intelligent child who wants nothing more than for his parents to get back together.  Unfortunately, his mother does break up with him, and his father decides to put a stop to it by giving up his baby and moving to a new home.  This is the first point in the movie where the movie really starts to go downhill, or should I say, the plot starts to become a stupid joke.  After all, there's no reason why their kid wouldn't have wanted to get together with his mom. But, no.  Her father leaves his baby behind and moves on.  It goes downhill from there.  They try to get along again and eventually reconcile, but when the divorce lawyer comes they meet for the first time.     And it's not just in that brief meeting they have together that their relationship starts to fall apart.  He doesn't like being married to a woman who wants to be in a relationship with a man she hates and is disgusted by.   This doesn't make sense; why would he hate her?  His son grows up and his wife dumps him so he goes off on another affair, and this is the point where it all collapses.  I guess he's trying to get rid of everything that doesn't fit with him.  Why would he want to get married, when he has a wife he doesn't love?  I mean, his wife can't stand him. She'd rather go out with a stranger than spend time with him who she is disgusted with.  How come it doesn't bother him more that she doesn't understand him?  This isn't his fault!  He's just a selfish, sick, selfish person.  So he ends up getting a divorce to get away from his wife, who
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So there's this giant giant robot and it's called MegaBots and they're supposed to be the best!  So what did this movie do?  They do a scene at the end that looks like they took MegaBowser's arm and took off all of it and built a giant robot arm from it!  They made it very cartoony because they didn't want it to look like this was real and they didn " t care!  The music is cheesy and the robot looked so stupid!  I was ready for a good fight between MegaBot and the bad guys but it just looked lame.  The first movie had fun fight scenes so I don't think it did that in this one!  Why do people like it?  Maybe because it was so old that it was a great robot and MegaBOT was awesome! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Boom, what a film!  I was expecting a mediocre film with bad acting and a generic plot about a gang of bullies.  But noooo, this was a bad film!!! I thought it was going to be a very good movie and I would have been happy if the acting was that of the actors.  But they weren't, they were nothing at all... I never saw a film in such an amateurish state.  I didn't even care that the kids had a great plot... They weren't funny!  The acting was so bad that I hated the movie when I watched it the first time.  As for the movie, it was mediocre with bad animation and bad music.  There was nothing funny about the film... This is a movie I would not recommend to anyone... There is some good music but this movie didn't work.  If you see a film and think it's a good one but it wasn't funny, think again... This was a stupid movie that didn't make any sense!  This movie has nothing to say...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In this movie, which sounds like a cheap movie about a gang of burglars from New Orleans who go to an old plantation house in the woods and rob all the property there, the burglars find there way to enter the house where the master lives with some servants who give them money to go away. Once they are done robbing he allows them to stay, but not to get rich, as in most of the rest of the movie they are not satisfied. In a good movie there would be no money given to the criminals so they could rob everything, as is usually the case with these films. I have seen better ones like this. A good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember thinking I was getting an early start on the good stuff! The first few episodes showed the great promise of the show, with an awesomely creepy story line and interesting characters. However it was not long before they stopped having any kind of plot, and they had just turned the entire thing into a giant slapstick comedy routine. I never saw a better ending to a horror show, let alone any better slapstick movie. There was a lot more going on in that show than just a slapstick show. It was creepy, weird, hilarious, and I got a kick out of it. I loved it! I could write a whole review about how much I enjoyed that movie! I didn't really expect a great horror movie, but that was a good one! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good movie!   Rating: ***
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As I thought, The Matrix is the closest we get to a realistic cyberpunk/cybernetic world. The world of the Matrix seems to be based on the real world as it is possible. This would be a great idea if the film was not so rushed. The only reason why the film works in a short time is because of the amazing acting. It is the perfect time that it is put together, if you have never seen this film then I would not recommend to watch it because the movie doesn't do any things it is supposed to, the acting is great ( I did not see any other actor who can be considered as a good actor), but the movie is just too short.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was fun to watch, and I liked the idea of the idea. It was also a nice way to end a trilogy. It is a shame that there was no real plot. It had a great beginning with the main character, who I thought looked more like an alien than a human. At the end, it was clear that the Alien and the crew were just following orders from Dr. Who himself.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time I saw this movie, I knew right away that it was going to be a pretty terrible movie (I'd seen more than a few bad movies over the years, most of them terrible), and I'm glad I saw it. The premise is pretty silly, the acting is just bad enough to make this a decent bad movie (not a terrible bad movie though; I liked it a lot), and the story is just...not worth your time.   Well, this film isn't bad. It's not a bad bad movie. It might even be a good bad bad film if I were to rate it on a scale of one to ten. I'd say it's like a 7.5.  Here's the good things about the movie: 1. The acting.  Most of the acting in this movie is pretty awful. I mean, it's pretty bad.  It's actually pretty bad and has really bad acting. But the thing is, I do actually like most of the actors in this film, and it helps that there's a fairly good amount of dialog in this piece.  This movie really did have a pretty fun time, I'd watch it again if I had to. I like it a little bit because it's not the first time someone has made a "space/adventure" movie, and there isn't as much dialogue, though I'm sure it was a big difference from what other directors like Robert Wise or Charles Band had done before.  For example, there's not nearly as many "action-scenes" in the film as there is in most of Wise's movies.  The movie does have some really good fight scenes, though, and those fight scenes really bring it together.  But for all the dialogue in this, you'll probably want to get your popcorn ready to go and watch the credits roll at the end.  A lot of these things are just silly and silly and pointless.  2. The music.  There are three tracks in this video that I really, really, like. They're a little too much together and you can't really hear everything in some parts, but they work well enough.  3.  I guess the thing about this movie that I enjoy so much is that the characters are all really pretty. There's a group of guys and a group (or maybe two?) of women, and we get a lot of dialogue from them, and that's a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to like this movie, but for some odd reason I didn't. I mean, I did like it from the first minutes till the last (at least if I am being honest with myself), but I can't see the point of this movie. For a start, I don't know, who is that man?   So there is this big guy who is trying to kill us and he takes over an airplane, and then his henchman takes over a yacht and then he puts this guy on the helicopter. So basically it looks like a big guy with a bunch of henchmen and a helicopter, but it is actually kind of funny.   Then he has these stupid people flying around in his helicopter and he is on top of them, and the guy has to pull the helicopter off the man. I don' t know what the point was. I guess you could say that the helicopter has a really powerful engine which does some really funny things, but you know, that isn't the point.  In fact, I just could not understand what the movie was about. I know, I had to watch it several times to really understand what was going on.  The story is really stupid, but the characters seem to be able to do absolutely nothing about it.  Now I can understand that there was a guy with powers in the story, but why he had to be the lead guy and why they wanted to have him appear in the pilot of an airplane?  Sure, he is pretty and can do all these cool things. But where is the fun in this? I mean if he is the bad guy, he isn't really all that bad, he just needs to stay in the background and give the other characters a chance to do what they want.  But then I just don't see why they have to make him be the main guy. What would be the point?  Also, what did the guy who was flying around with him have to do with this? Did he just appear out of nowhere? If so, how did they know that the guy would have to come with them?  Now the guy on top is really annoying.  If he was so special why didn't he use his powers more often?  And I am thinking that the other henchpeople didn't really seem to do anything very well.  Why didn't they attack him when he was flying over their heads? The guy in the helicopter just stared right
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In this film, a group of high school girls are stranded on a desert island when an air tanker crashes into the water, killing a man. They decide to take the tanker and flee, but the woman of the ship is determined to find the group and kill everyone, even if it means killing the girls! In this film the filmmakers don't seem to have any interest in telling their story, instead focusing on an outlandish plot about killing people, and this film has a really bizarre, campy feel to it, with a cast that doesn't look anything like normal people. There aren't any real effects in this film that are worth mentioning, but it is still interesting to see the crew of the tanker, and there are plenty of silly situations along the way, such as the character "Mrs. Shafir," who can't stop speaking in an annoying accent, the bad guy with a giant robot arm, and the many strange things that happen during the film. One scene stands out to me as an example of the lack of creativity and imagination in this movie. While talking with the characters, one of the characters is asked how she can get out of the swamp, to which she responds by saying, "I'm too pretty to drown!" (Although I'm sure there are a few other lines as well.) I don't remember the rest of the lines that were spoken during this scene, but if anyone remembers, I would love to know!   I would give this film a C+ and a B+ (B+ means it could have been better and a C means it's still very bad). This film has very few redeeming features, and I can't think of a single reason to watch it. If you were planning to watch this film on your vacation, just skip it!   and here is a link to the actual film: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0340122/ (The actual film is entitled "Savage Beach")

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a pretty straight to the point little movie about a boy who is trying to find the treasure and the dragon that is guarding it, and the trouble with that is, of course there is also a girl that is trying too. I thought it was a nice idea and I like how the girl wasn't stupid, she didn't give up and just went with her and her dog, so she would just walk the road and keep on going, it's a good idea I thought but the rest of it... It's a boring, slow movie, the animation is bad and the animation quality in general in the entire movie is pretty bad, the character designs are nice and it has a good soundtrack, but the animation in general is pretty much terrible, all the kids are a bit annoying to look at. I'm not sure how good the story is, it could be great if the characters were more interesting, but in the end the film does what it has to do and doesn't do much else. The ending is really bad, I could tell that there was going to be a sequel, the idea of the hero going on a journey with a girl, I thought was a good way to go but I guess it was not enough of a sequel. It's not terrible it has its good parts too, and if you haven't seen it, then you might as well go watch it because they don't make movies like this anymore.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First off, this movie is actually quite bad. It starts out a lot like the other zombie movies you see on the channel, but then, it just doesn't stop being a bad film. The story is horrible, the acting is awful and the special effects are horrible. There are things here that should never have gotten to the screen and the movie never ends. If you hate zombies and want to watch a boring film that has all of the classic things about zombies you could ever want, this film will be right up your alley. I think this movie will end up on my bad zombie list next to a bunch of other bad films.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a very bad movie and i would never recommend this to anyone. A few years back a movie called "Lucky Luke" was released on DVD which also featured a guy in a funny bunny suit named David Arquette and i thought it was a very good movie. Now this new movie "Lloyds of London" is a sequel to "Lukes of London". Now this movie doesn't even come close to the original. There is no funny dialogue and very few jokes (i know i say that a lot but i know it really is the case.) In my opinion this movie is not even worth a minute of your time. It features a bunch of talking heads talking about a bunch about things they want to do and talking about something else about something called "Sleeping beauty". Well it is a pretty good movie and the ending is pretty great. But i would rather be told by someone who is really funny, than having to listen to talking heads with no funny lines.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ 1/10 I'll make an abbreviated review. _______________________________________________________________________ There are a ton of things that need to be done with this movie.   The story, the characters, the acting and the special effects were all a mess. It feels as though this whole thing was rushed.  In a time when they could've waited, they rushed. So that everyone could be saved at the end, instead they leave everyone on the ground with half a brain and a severed head.  This whole movie is really bad and has a lot of poor acting, poor story telling and a terrible acting style.  The film is only 80 minutes long and the only thing it really shows is how crazy this movie is, the special effect are so poorly done it has to be put in a movie, and the acting is as bad as you would expect from this film.  And what's worse?  The ending is the worst of the bunch.  It's like they shot all of the movie at once in a trailer, with a bad editing and they then edited it together to make a nice little flick.  I wouldn't even watch this on video.  They didn't even bother to release an R rating to make it seem "normal".   I really think that if they had waited and tried to make this movie as good as they could, it would have been a better movie. The reason why this film is so bad is that there was so much of it to show that they rushed it and the movie is very poorly acted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie with a really bad review in The Times. The reviewers were saying that this film is a "stereotypical" film. Well it has the "stretching" and "structure" of a Hollywood film. But it really wasn't a striptease.  There's a man trying to make a big movie about the death of a baby.    The "stretch and stretch" of the film is the reason this movie is bad.  But I think it is better than the usual Bollywood films.  Also there's a few good songs.  A good movie should have an amazing soundtrack too.  This review does not count for a great movie.  The worst of Bollywood: This movie is not "horrible" it is a complete  disaster   Crazy movie: If you love Bollywood then you have to have this movie. This movie makes you feel like you've gone crazy with pleasure.  Don't let your friend see this movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know this movie will not get me to like movies.   It is a "what if..." movie.  This movie was inspired by a very dark comic book called Sin City.  In a way it is very close to the movie Sin City, even the movie looks like Sin City to me.  The story is so horrible.  There is a young man who starts at the college to work at the library.  He is a very nice guy but has an attitude problem.  At the same time he is starting to fall for a blonde coed with a very bad attitude problem and a very obnoxious attitude.  Their relationship is very awkward and it is really disgusting.  I cannot give a positive review because this is not a movie to watch. It is so depressing it makes you want to hang yourself with a noose on a tree.  And you know what?  No one will care about this.  Why am I rating this movies as 1 or less.  My friends would see this movie. This is very bad.  If you like the movie 'Sin City' then this movie is similar to it.  But there is nothing to do there so if you want a bad fun time watch this, if you don't like to hang from the noose then do not watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace" is a movie that takes forever to start. The opening cut is a long and awkward introduction that seems to be supposed to be a short film, but ends up being more like a half hour, and then the actual movie starts. It's pretty obvious that Lucas is trying to cash in on the success of the first movie, so he's not as good a filmmaker as he was, but still, he gets it done and the movie is a pretty good ride.   The action is pretty good. Some people have accused Lucas of overusing the Force, which I think it is an overused trope in sci-fi, but that doesn't really hold a lot of water. He's used it a bit in the prequel, but then there was a great deal of it in "Episode I," so it wasn't used to much there either.  In any case, I don't think it's a huge success, but I like it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've had this movie about a dozen times before, so it's only fair to give it a quick review as well.    I'm sure a good number of people will find it interesting, I'm not one of them.  This movie is based on the true story of a man named John Paul Jones who was supposed to be on a rescue mission from the Italian army in an area between the Italian and British occupation zones.  The mission was supposed take place on a night that John Paul was supposed, and all that happened was that he crashed in the Italian area, and was found dead three days later by a man and a woman who had gone looking for him.  As expected, the woman is more attractive than the other two.  It was a long shot in Italy, and a long road for the two men.  If they did make it there, the weather must have been a total nightmare for the Italian troops as they were told there were no planes and couldn't possibly make it.   They did make their way through Italy to the British lines, and got stuck for three days.  That night, the two decided to go look for the pilot.  Unfortunately the two have no plane on them, because they only had enough fuel for two hours.  They had a map of the area, but there's a mountain in the way.  When the two finally found a small valley with no other than a small hill on top, the first thing out of John Paul's mouth was, "I'll take that hill."  After a brief search of the valley they noticed two lights coming from the area.  These lights seemed to be hovering, and they didn't look like planes.  One was much smaller than the last, it seemed to have a different type of engine.  John Paul began to follow the lights, after which he took off to investigate the lights.  After about a half an hour he decided to come back, and discovered the other man in the other valley looking for the missing man.  While the two were on this mission it seemed that the German's, whom the Italian Army was defending against were making their way across the valley towards the two.   At the same time, the other German's were advancing up the valley.  With no other choice but to shoot at them, the pair continued on. They did get the German pilot at the end of the hill, and made it back into Italy, but John Paul never

I guess in a way that it is a remake of the great film of the same title from 1988 called " The Thing that Should Not Be."   As such it's a remake that tries to change the characters so that they don't act like typical horror movie villains or mutants.    Well, it's not a remake.  The Thing is, at its core, a true horror movie that is truly terrifying.  At the end of the movie when the monster is finally defeated you know that you will never be in fear again.  It's true horror from start to finish.  In fact the movie will make you afraid of the things you don't want to be afraid of.  But then you turn the camera around and it's the end.  This movie would have had it's time in the box office had it not been for the fact that it was only played once.  In the end I had to watch The Thing again just to see what happened.  Why did it have to be a remake?  I don't know.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really looking forward to this movie, I had heard a lot about it, so I was kind of expecting it to be kind of like a good slasher movie, but there were some really weird and out-there things about this movie that I just can't get off my mind about it. The film starts off with a woman walking to a house, this woman doesn't even know the man and it's really weird to see the woman go back and forth through the house, and while it's going on a car is being stolen. The car is in a field at night, in a forest, with no headlights.  It's just dark and scary, so creepy.  I'm sure this movie was made to be scary, I mean I love slasher movies and this was really well done for an average film.  I'm going to say that my favorite part of the film is where he kills the guy outside.  The opening of the movie is very nice to watch, you're in a creepy movie and you're creeped out, I feel like a zombie, the movie starts with a person and I'm just like, what is this?  I really have to get in a good movie like this one, it's so well made and scary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To get to the bottom of how this film managed to get approved as a feature film in the first place is, well, kind of amazing, considering that this was a pre-Hollywood film, written by a man who used to be a cop, and written on the set of a Hollywood movie. It was a film of bad guys trying to rob a bank in the middle of the night. There's not a lot to it, there's not much to the story, and there's just no interesting character to speak of to be found. What you have here is a bunch of thugs who just don't seem to have the slightest idea of how to go about their business, and so they just shoot the shit without a problem. It's like some kind of bad Western, only without the humor. There were probably hundreds of people on the train, and a number of policemen who could have possibly arrested them, and yet we're expected to believe that all of them went home happy because the bank is robbed, and without having any of the characters say anything more than "I'm tired" or "Where's the gun?" There was nothing that made me laugh, and I don't know how a film can do something like that.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If this is a good movie with little to nothing else it shows us a world where the good guys always win. I like how the good guy has a "tombstone" where he was buried. There is nothing sad about this movie. It's just a normal day. The guy gets a job and goes to work. Everyone is doing well and things are a very easy life. One day there is a fire and people start dying. The only survivors are the three men and the bad guy. They are all out for revenge and have each other to back them up. It is not a terrible movie, but there is nothing that makes it feel really special. The acting is average and there is no real action in the movie. The bad guy has an electric chair and it is pretty interesting. I liked this because I thought it was a funny scene. But the story is a lot of nothing. There's no emotion at all in this movie except the story. I don't know why this is made this way as the story could have been much better. It seems like there should be something else to the movie other than the bad ending. If they make more movies like this I would recommend watching it. Rating: 2/5

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was thoroughly disgusted by this movie. It was about a young teenage girl, Jessica, who has an addiction for plastic surgery. Jessica wants to become a nurse so she can take care of sick children. Jessica takes advantage of an injured child. This child has a broken arm which makes the doctors think he is mentally disabled. The doctors then give Jessica a cosmetic procedure and they give Jessica the false diagnosis. But, Jessica does not want to be a nurse. She wants to be the world famous plastic surgeon that is making a million and half dollars a year. When she is in surgery she decides to steal a small plastic knife from a surgeon named "Dr. Bob" because Dr. Bob is her idol. When Dr.Bob gives her the plastic knife, Jessica accidentally stabs him in the face with the plastic blade. He tells Jessica to leave him and she turns back to her normal self. Jessica becomes very popular with the kids. However, in the end, they realize that Dr. Robert Bob is not mentally disabled after all and Jessica ends up in jail.   The movie starts off with a little girl with a broken wrist that is the victim of a car accident. This accident causes the girl's arm to be in constant pain. The child is taken to the hospital to have the arm replaced. It seems the surgeons are successful in their job. The plastic surgeon, the famous Dr.Robert Bob, goes to Jessica, a young girl with an addiction to plastic surgery, to thank her for all her work. This is a nice scene. The next scene shows Jessica with her arm in a sling. The hospital staff gives Jessica a plastic wrap and a band-aid. The scene ends with the mother of the child, Sally, trying to comfort her as she says, "This will be my new arm," as she holds the arm in her arm.  I thought Jessica's motivation for this was so terrible. What could be the motivation to steal from the doctor, an extremely well-known plastic surgeon (Dr.Bob) and to steal an inexpensive plastic knife? She wants the money! What kind of a selfish, self-centered, spoiled girl would not want an extra hundred or so dollars a month for medical expenses! The ending is so stupid and cheesy. How do people ever get out of jail again with a plastic knife in a plastic wrapping?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are certain moments in which the film really shines, like the scene where Lila is talking with her mom and the mother has a conversation with her daughter on how her daughter will live and what she wants her to do once she turns 18. However, the movie has problems with its acting and its writing, and the movie is just a mess.  The writing was a mess that made me think that we had been watching an early 2000's remake of an 80's comedy, with an annoying kid.  Lila is a 13 year old girl living with her mum in the countryside. Lila has the ability to read minds, and she loves the power that she has. However she has never used this power and is terrified of it. She likes reading children's stories which is why she spends her time in the village playing with her cousins. She tries to use her ability to talk to her auntie because she was told by her aunt that her Auntie had died. She also tries to talk with her younger cousin who is living in the city.   Unfortunately for Lila, she is surrounded by a bunch of mean people that she never had a chance to meet in real life. Her auntie has died from an illness and she has also lost a friend that had been living with the family. She has been having many problems with her family because of this.  One night, after a night when she was trying to convince her mother to get the books she had been reading from a young girl called Marge that she is afraid of for years, she thinks that she's going to die. When she realizes that she isn't dying, she decides that she wants to leave the village to travel away.  When she asks her grandma for the money to get money to go to the city, her grandma tells Lila that she can go where she likes, but that she must have a permit from the local head of the country to go.  Unfortunately for Llaire, the local official is a mean one, he thinks she wants some money so that she will go to a bad city so that he can give her money and she will have a better life.  After a few confrontations, Lila goes to get some papers to prove that she need not get a permit to leave her family and her aunt.  Lila doesn't know how to find these papers in the book she found in the library and instead, we see that she goes to a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the sequel to I am the Villain (2009). The movie starts off okay, but that doesn't make any movie okay.  It's the same movie that everyone likes, but in a totally different context. It's basically a group of kids in the park fighting bad guys. If the movie were in a different place, it might have been okay. As it is, the bad guys are much too strong for the kids and they're too strong to just give up. They take the kids hostage, take all their stuff and leave them for dead. It turns out the baddies aren't so bad after all, as they go on a quest to "find the villain" (i.e. destroy this movie).  When we first start with the bad guy, he's very threatening. He threatens us, but is too strong, and his voice isn't convincing enough. He comes off a little creepy, and it makes the kids nervous. Then he gets really creepy. It doesn't take long before we get our first glimpse of a demonic face, which really puts them at ease. When they try to fight back, they're totally unprepared. It would have been a great way to start the movie, as these kids are completely outclassed. When we get to the main baddies, the movie starts getting very silly. They go around looking for kids to kidnap, and when they get a chance to make some money off one, they immediately snatch him. This makes for a fun little chase scene, but when they find one the next day and start beating him, they make no effort to rescue him, as if he weren't even worth a single drop of their blood. In fact, you'd swear they were just trying to kill him.  They can't be bothered to look for him, and they aren't even afraid to just pick him up.    I wouldn't recommend this movie to kids. It only has three very cute kids who can fight and make funny faces and you will quickly forget they're children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a remake of a movie written by the late Roger Corman  in 1967, which in reality is only a rehashed adaptation of the French movie by Jean-Luc Godard. Godard made a very good film with a very bad script. It's based on a novel by Eric Rohmer, and is pretty good. But the movie's real problem is that it never has a single interesting plot. The whole thing is about a boy, who's mother and father are both dead. He's then abducted by a mad doctor, who tries to teach him how to be a doctor. Unfortunately, his teacher's wife gets killed by some sort of animal, which the kid is pretty much powerless against. A few more hours and I was ready to throw my copy of the book away. But it's too late. This movie should never have been made, and it shouldn't have been released until well into the next century.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has not got anything going for it at all. The acting is terrible. The music is terrible and sounds as it is not much more than a few notes from a cheap plastic song. The cinematography is terrible, it does a lot of bad things to the story but is still the worst film I have ever seen. Not that it matters. You have heard this movie before!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought it was a bit cheesy when the two villains (and a boy) got caught eating chicken legs and other "unclean" meat. I was going to give this one a 3-2/10, but for some reason I got a 3. It didn't seem that bad at the time I found it. It just made me cringe a bit from the bad special effects, and it was really hard to watch it. But what can you do? - March 29, 2005Not so fun

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a horrible film, in my opinion.  The film tries to have a heart but is only a hollow joke, and the performances of the two lead characters are pretty poor too.    I will see this movie only if the director, Michael Keaton (Gone Baby Gone, Animal House ), is able to reprise his role as the lead character (which he did in the first one, starring a young Clint Eastwood).

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ __________ _______________ I enjoyed a lot this movie, the actors were very good and I liked the plot of the whole movie, but the ending is a mess. First the film is set in the 19th century, which is a perfect time for a ghost tale (although this isn't the best in that genre). There is a man called Martin who is having a dream. Martin's wife, Evelyn, has gone off with a man named James. Martin is not pleased with this fact. He has a housekeeper to clean his house. Evelyn does what she can, but she is still in love with James. This was a rather interesting movie, it had the right amount of scares and a great script. As a ghost story though, it isn't good at all. The acting was really good, even the main character Martin. The problem is that the film does not take any time to breathe. Once it starts it is going to keep going. The story of this film is very confusing. What seems like an innocent couple going about their day turns out to be a horror movie. I found it a little slow, which could have been helped by a few more scares. There is plenty of scares however, and a lot of them are well placed. The special effects are also nice, and the ghosts are very well done, although the best part of the film are the ghosts, as they're very believable (although a little overdone). Overall this film had a very interesting plot, and good acting. I would give it a 3/5, but it is quite confusing at times.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a total waste of everyone's time, from beginning to end.   It starts out with a young man named William (Kirk) with a wife and daughter. He finds himself drawn to a young lady by the name of Dorothy (Julianne Moore). At first he is drawn to her, but she is not attractive. At all. He says he's in love with her. This causes him to be attracted to her and eventually has a sexual affair. Unfortunately she is an alcoholic. William is not even drunk when he meets her. It appears that she just wanted to spend time alone with a beautiful stranger. She's a drunkard! She's also an irresponsible mother. After all, she has no idea about responsibility!   Now a couple of days later Dorothy is having a party in her basement, where all of her relatives are invited. Dorothy is in love and she has been acting a little wild with her family. Dorothy wants to be with William again. She can't believe William would actually go through with this. But he does.   is this film good? No. This is a terrible, pointless, and boring movie. It's a total failure from start to finish.   The story is ridiculous. There are several incidents that would be funny if they were a little less ridiculous. In one scene, a young boy takes a pencil and a paintbrush to a house and he accidentally kills his mother with the paint brush. Why? What is he supposed to do, paint the wallpaper? The movie seems to be written by a man who lives for nothing but to watch films about the horrors of life. And he tries very hard to make his movie scary. One scene in the movie where a woman is attacked and has to be cut up because her throat has been cut is so hard to watch that I could barely watch the movie. And one of the scenes is so over the top that it's almost unbelievable.     The acting is horrible. There is no substance to the acting. Dorothy's dialogue is one long monologue, her voice has nothing to do with her actions. And the way this young man is supposed to be drawn to his wife is a disgrace to every woman's life. What in the world is with this film? You can't help but laugh as the people at the party are all scared, frightened and horrified. I wouldn't watch this film with another person. The plot makes zero sense and it just goes on
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________________________________________ This is not a bad film in any way, but it is a movie of so many cliches, the only one that works is that of the American detective-style, and that is not the best style to take a story. The acting is generally acceptable. The plot has no development. The writing is very bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie doesn't have the best of actors, but it has some good ones. Unfortunately, the script isn't as good as the acting. The storyline is basically the usual "young man wants revenge" story, but the script has this awful "why are you so angry" feeling. As one of my friends recently said, if it wasn't for all the bad acting in this movie, this would've gotten an R.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very skeptical when I saw the title of this movie. I've been a fan of the Indiana Jones franchise since the first time I saw E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. There has not been a bad installment in the series. The original Indiana Jones was fantastic. The sequel was a bit more of a disappointment. The problem was that it was an Indiana Jones movie that just didn't feel right at all. This movie just did not feel like the same Indiana Jones film that I had grown to know and love. This was a very disappointing movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********************** It's a little hard to see a movie in a theater. The movie isn't all that entertaining. It's basically a collection of short stories of a different style. I feel like it's trying to find its footing in a genre that it doesn't know how to fit in. There aren't any great characters and there is nothing that will keep you from thinking about the movie as you watch it. **************************
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a bad film. I was expecting it to be like "Shaft," but it wasn't. And if "Shrew" was the film to get into old Hollywood with its outrageous and unedited footage, this is the film that tries to tell the bad taste of those years. The director is a very talented man, but it was all done for the money, and the poor movie was only good for that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Carmen Sandiego is a poor cop. It was a fun cop-sheriff movie, but not much else. It's a story about the adventures of two young lovers, a boy and a girl in their thirties who have just been married and have moved to a quaint farm-town. The movie has a lovely ending that is very reminiscent of the classic story "The Kid From Oz." It's not a bad cop film. It can be funny, and they have some very good gags, but you have to be very careful when you watch it. The cast of characters is full of stereotypes of the people of the time. The kid (J.P. Williams) is pretty much the exact kind of character that we saw in the old cartoons.     There are some interesting characters in it, especially the town folk who are just as silly as the characters. They do have a very sweet love story, and a little romance in the end, but I wouldn't describe it as anything more than that. It seems as if they were cast in a movie about a girl and a boy who get into all sorts of trouble and have to get their stuff together, and then have to find their way back to civilization. I like it as a throw back to the old films about the little old lady and her talking parrot, and the little boy and his teddy bear, etc. This film is a throwback to the cartoons of the fifties and sixties.  It has some good acting, especially by the leading roles, and it has a simple plot. I don't have any real problems with it, except that it's pretty unoriginal. That's really no fault of the movie, because this is really just a throwaway movie about the two young people who live on a farm. This is a very pretty movie with many beautiful flowers blooming in the fields. But I'm not a big fan of pretty films, and I didn't really enjoy this one either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not bad, but it's definitely not a good movie:  A group of high school kids try to get home for the school dance. They meet some new characters: a beautiful girl (Sara Jean), a guy who says he is from India (Om Prakash), and a mysterious girl who claims to be a boy (Shiva). The guys then meet the girl's father who was killed by one of the gangs. And then Shiva says he has a plan: that his "family" will die. But he won't let his kids die.   The movie isn't a long one: almost 90 minutes and a little bit of a funny scene. It ends with Shiva's sister, a girl whom Shiva claims to love. She is the one who made him decide to kill all his family, and then she tells her dad to run away in order to be with Shiva. That night, Shiva and his kids start to drive away from his house...   And then the movie ends.  , it's a good-looking movie. It does an ok job of bringing out Shiva's personality: he is a selfish, angry kid who likes to get into trouble...he is also a big jerk who kills. But the movie also gives us a good glimpse of the family Shiva's mother, father, sisters, and cousins. The movie is definitely worth a watch. But it is only a 90 minutes movie!   Recommended for: people who like a good, bad, violent revenge movie! I recommend this movie for the revenge.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie begins with a young boy named Max being picked up by a truck driver for a job on an oil derrick. The scene opens with Max being brought to a small, secluded area to clean up a large explosion on the other side of the derrick, which he's sure is from an explosion caused by oil workers coming on the roof to fix a malfunctioning pipe.  The scene shifts back to Max in the truck, now being held down by two burly men who are looking out the windows. They are clearly police officers but they look like soldiers too, maybe marines. The men are armed with machine guns. Max is told to get his hands behind his back, they are going to shoot him. He is told again to get back into the truck. He refuses to do so but when he begs a third time he is dragged to the ground and he is hit in the shoulder with a metal bar.   His life is saved by a female officer, who tries to calm him down. The officer starts a conversation with Max but Max keeps saying it's wrong. Suddenly, they hear shots and Max is brought to an ambulance. When the ambulance arrives, Max can't sit down because of his injured shoulder. He manages to sit down, and the officer helps him back in the ambulance. The ambulance moves quickly but Max still can't move around. The young man has been shot in the upper body. An ambulance crew arrives and they move him to the operating room. There he is strapped to a table in a hospital gown. The crew tries to get the breathing tube out but his face is still hot. Max gets a doctor to stitch him up and then gets a nurse to check on the wound. She comes to find him and tells him to keep it down because it's bad.   is what I thought about this movie when I first started watching it. I thought this film would be about the young boy who is hit with a bar on his shoulder by an armed police officer for refusing to get into a truck in a secluded, deserted area. He then has to sit there and take a lot of treatment. We don't hear what happens to him after this, only the shots of the explosion and some description of the place. When this guy was injured, he was taken to a nearby hospital and then to an operating room, where a doctor was assigned to him. Then the patient was sent to the ward, which is the main part of the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The second one, for those that don't know my reviews (the first was the first, so it's a waste of my time, no pun intended), is a remake of a movie called The Killer, and it is the same exact movie, only now we have a little more plot that we didn't have before. I did enjoy the film and the cast of the movie was amazing, but this movie is really only a remake because the original was very good. This movie doesn't live up to the original and doesn't do a good job of telling the story, though there is some decent scares, the ending is a bit out of place to say the least and the acting is also a bit off.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story starts out pretty interesting. A group of young children learn how to use a new machine that turns back the tide of the sea. It's a pretty neat idea if one could live a life that was a few hundred years in the past. It seems the world is a better place because of this invention. The only problem is the machine starts to malfunction, turning everything to rubble and causing a wave that kills most of the children. The movie doesn't have much of an ending. It only ends in a sort of 'curse of the century' like plot. It isn't all that bad at its conclusion, but at the beginning it makes a very strange statement that the past is not all it seems to be. One can see that there are a few good ideas in here, but it's not a very entertaining movie overall.   When it comes to the acting, it isn't nearly as good as it could be. It goes from pretty average to downright annoying at times. The character of Mr. White is the only character that was enjoyable to watch at first, but he quickly becomes the complete opposite of his book counterpart. He's a bit of a jerk and seems to not really care that many people are dying. There are a fair few moments where he yells and yells at the kids. I would like to see more of his side of the story, but then again, it may be the only good part of the movie, because by the time the movie got good, it was already too late.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******************** I don't know what my expectations were when I first read about the movie. I saw the trailer before I went out and after it was over I was kind of annoyed. The story is that a cop (John Malkovich) takes a group of young kids on an ice road in a sleigh which is stolen by an evil man. This seems a little cliche to me. They ride in the sleigh while Malkovich tries to talk to a woman who is the owner of the shop who owns the sleight. I did like the trailer. The movie did not go on to be bad and even though it was a little short it had a nice ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of this was ok, a fun action adventure film, and then it got really weird!  The lead character, a super-genius, who works in a company called 'Astro-Tech'. It's run by a guy called Doctor D. (I'm not joking) who is a bit... over-the-top in his ideas about what humans can do with robots, and in one particular film, he had a little robot, which went around smashing things to bits.  The plot involved a big space battle with the aliens, and the scientist who's trying to take over the world with one of the many machines at his disposal. This was all fairly standard for a science fiction film, especially when you consider that this film has been made in the mid 80's, and it's pretty tame, it doesn't come out and say anything new. But I still thought the film was a bit strange.  I have to say, when I was watching this film, I found myself thinking it was some kind of sequel or prequel to one of those films I've seen a hundred times: the movie where you're in a spaceship and there's one black guy, one white guy, and one Asian guy.   I mean, who else would have the idea of having a robot that's basically a flying machine?   It's quite entertaining in itself. But at the end of the film, the robot gets destroyed, and a bit of a mystery is left behind which we don't get anywhere.  But the film could have been more interesting than it is, but it was an enjoyable adventure.  I guess I liked it because I don't have a huge fascination with anything to do with science, or with robots. The fact that this movie made me think about it for a couple of hours did get me thinking about science a bit and that's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________ I've been in the audience for most of the 'Lilith' films, but this one is the worst. It's not bad for the first half but it definitely picks up right after the first act and never really gets going. There are a few interesting things going on with the characters but most of all there is an obnoxious, shallow, lazy director who just wants to make it seem like he's "creating an all new mythology". It's like the guy had the idea for a film about the birth of Christ, the end of the world and the first resurrection but he couldn't really think of anything else that would go with that idea so he just decided to tell a bunch of stories about a bunch demons who want to get in the way of a group of little girls who want nothing more than to go to the lake that Jesus used to pee in. ________________________________________________ If you want a really bad movie, go see a video of a baby being ripped apart. I don't care if it's an adult. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No, I haven't seen it yet (that's what I do when I'm bored), I can tell you it's not a comedy (because that's exactly what it is!), it is a depressing mess. It is a very slow movie, to be honest, about a person who's trying to be happy, because he believes he's the most intelligent person alive, but when he meets the one he believes is smarter than him, he ends up suffering a horrible fate. He also has a girl he falls for who tries to be all romantic and nice, but that girl does nothing but make things difficult for him. There is one other girl in the movie that is like his ex-wife, but nothing changes with her. As for the story it's a complete mess, nothing makes sense, nobody believes in anything (except for one person who is a total moron, so there's that), nobody cares about anything (even if they don't want anything, that's their problem!), there is no story to tell, there is only a bunch of people living a bad life in a bad place, that has no plot, no characters, only bad acting and bad writing (not a mistake on anyone's part)! I am giving this a D, because it's probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time, and probably will be, and maybe that's a good thing! But then again, I am a cynical person (I'm not a fan of comedy movies, that much is certain!), and I've come to like a good movie when it is just a bad one!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie last night, and it does not hold a candle to its prequel. The movie is a very silly affair, set mostly in a college (and, sadly, a high school) and starring two students (the one in the red jacket, and a couple of other people). A couple of the characters are kind of silly (the red-jacketed boy and a young girl named Rachel) but the rest are completely out-of-place. I was also a little disappointed with the ending (as is usual with most "studio comedies" -- the ending doesn't make a whole lot of sense, at least at the beginning).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not a bad film.  Just not one I will re-watch or see again.  In spite of the name I did enjoy this movie a lot. The film was set in England in the middle of the last century and the events were set around 1875 and they're basically based on events that took place in London. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't wait to watch this film again. But it's hard for me to give it a 3.5. The story is pretty good, the acting is ok but not amazing, the camera work is bad and the movie does have a lot of problems with continuity. I like the setting, I liked the main character, I enjoyed the action but all these problems add up and make this film a very frustrating watch. For me it's like watching an episode of "Criminal Minds", a very good show, a show that has it all: funny characters, interesting scenes, intense action, amazing music and great acting. But what a lot those show have in common: they're good at being entertaining. So much fun and yet, they have a bad camera and the story is inconsistent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I have seen the original Star Wars films but I don't think I can say I was excited to see the movie Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope back when it was being made. It looked really bad. It really reminded me of the awful "Special Editions" of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, just so horrible, terrible. I didn't like it either at the time or in the end. But now, after being spoiled by Star Wars Episode VII, I am happy that this movie made it out in theaters and it was good. Even though the film is a bad one at best, I had a wonderful time watching it with my son and nephew.   And I really hope the next film "Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens" is much better than this movie was.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So the movie itself... I mean, it does have all of the trappings of a great zombie movie: zombies, a bad guy who keeps wanting to destroy us, a guy who is trying to live a normal life, and lots of stuff in between.  I guess that's pretty much the gist of it.  But like every good zombie movie, there is so much more to it than that.  And what a good movie it is!  The acting is great, and the story is interesting.  What really sells it is that it does what it does perfectly.  It is well told, and I never had trouble remembering what was going on.   And the zombies are really cool.  They're very much like the ones I grew up with, as you can see in the trailer.  This is one great zombie flick that I can't wait to see again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Blessed with a strong story and decent acting from every character, this is not a bad film, but the film is a poor excuse for a film because of all the clichés in it.   I was told by friends that a movie like this exists in France, and I had just seen another film about a group of people on a trip to Europe. They all fall in love and the film ends with the three young people falling in love with each other, all three having grown up to be the same age and have always hated each other. This movie is not about the love of the three characters, it is about the hatred of the other two. The story follows two groups of young people who are all attracted to each other but who always hate each other - the women are jealous of the men's success with women, and the men resent the success of the women with men and even resenting the fact that the women love to get men drunk so they can have them do things for them and they can leave later.   "My brother is a terrible drunk, and he is always playing tricks on my sister and my mother."   The plot is really stupid and is just a cheap way to tell a story about three people who hate eachother. Everyone has to go on a vacation in a foreign country and everyone hates the other three and everyone is jealous of everyone else, and it is all so predictable and uninspired. Also, the three people seem to change their roles in a movie that is supposedly about their trip - they are initially portrayed as three people of different cultures, but later on, they become three people with the same culture who just hate each one of their other friends and want to get each other drunk and then leave for a vacation and spend all day fighting about things that do not matter. Then the women who are the main characters, get caught cheating on their husbands or boyfriends and the story ends up being really stupid because they have to try to make their husbands go on the vacation and then get caught and then go on vacation and fall in deep depression over it. And the women just want to have fun, and make fun of their partners who are not enjoying themselves. I could go on and on about how stupid this film is, but I don't want to write a negative Review. This is one of those things that people like to write and then not realize how bad a film it is. I don`t want to waste my time watching
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________________________________________ A movie to watch at Halloween when your parents tell you to not go to the circus.  I was born and raised in the US, and I've heard the tale many times and in many ways; yet this movie is no different. It's more like an American Idol type competition of the "fairest of the fairies" type...but with a dark twist.  What made this "Halloween" was the movie stars, John Belushi and Lisa Marie Presley. It was a good look at two talented performers who had a good time together in the end.  It had a few good jokes and some pretty good acting.   I have a daughter, and one thing I've learned from her is that every mother wants to have her sons and daughters at her home for Halloween and Christmas, and this year, my daughter and I thought we'd bring our son in for a visit while his step-mother's were over. As luck would have it, it was Halloween...and we'd made a special trip out to New York just in case, and we had a blast! This movie was fun to watch with my girls, and while I don't think a little bit of evil is gonna hurt me in the future...we'll have to live with this "Gothic" movie for a long time to come. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***************************** I don't usually like sequels to bad movies. I like a movie or a series as a whole, not individually. ********* So when I say that I really didn't like this movie...well it's not a bad film, but it really didn' make much of an impression. It was more like a mediocre sequel. The movie centers on Michael and his mother, it takes place in the 1940's, Michael is a kid, he has a bad case of attention deficit disorder and is bullied at school.    There's also an older boy and a girl who live in the house, they get along very well with the kids, so it really shouldn't be that hard to see why the kids want to get rid of them, it just makes for a really bad family.  When Michael gets sick, his mother decides to take him to the hospital.  The hospital is run by the local doctor, named Dr. Doolin, who is a really nice man.  He takes Michael in his home, which has a little green house with a tree in the backyard, which is where Michael and the doctor spend most of their time.  As for Michael, he likes playing on his electric guitar and has a really special "trick" with his guitar that has never been seen before.  Doolins' family doesn't seem to like him, even his mother.  This is what makes the movie so bad. Michael is an unruly, immature child who is being bullied, and eventually kills his own mother, I mean it's really not something that happens to kids these days, especially not in this day and age.  After his mom's death, Michael goes on his merry way, he gets a job at the local high school, I believe it's the same high school from before. Dr. John F. Dix is the headmaster and is known by his students as an easy going teacher.  John F Dix was actually a nice man, he would put up with his students, he really didn`t care about them and in his defense, that was probably part of the reason he was able to be so good at his job.  At the end of the day Doolino is happy, he finally got his perfect little boy and he doesn't feel any bad about it, and Michael isn't around much.  Michael gets his wish and is sent to a boys camp at his father's. I have
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "There's no better, and certainly no worse, film than this one." - Rotten Tomatoes.com -   "I am glad I finally watched 'The Haunting' and I am thankful to the makers of this film because they have finally answered the unanswered questions." -  This movie is absolutely brilliant - I have loved the classic novel and had heard about it for years. The first time I read about the Haunting, it sounded so plausible that I was almost afraid to go watch a film based on the book. And boy was I right! The film follows a man from California who comes to the small town of Dunedin, Florida in search of work. He is immediately attracted to the mysterious woman who lives in the local pub, and after her death he comes to be haunted by some of the events that transpired that night. This is a well put together film that will keep you in suspense through the entire film. The acting is fantastic as does the editing. This movie really captures the feel of what is so perfect about the book and then adds something even more chilling. The Haunting is a must see movie and I highly recommend it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      If you're looking for a quick and funny flick, this is a good flick for you. If you have the patience for a few minutes of boredom and a few hundred bucks, it's a great "bang" every couple of minutes. If your looking for something better than that, please skip this movie for now and see "The Good, The Bad & The Ugly".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film.  If it was a "good" movie, it would've at least been well written.  I just don't know what the writer did to get his book published, I never liked it.  It was just dull...  I can't see a reason for a good movie with the bad characters and story (in my opinion, they should've kept the same names and changed the names of the characters from one to another, but I guess that's just me).    Plot Summary:    The movie follows a group of students from a school in a small town in the Czech Republic.   In order to gain popularity and become famous, they dress up and act like aliens.  The plot is mostly just a generic teenage teenage teenage girl's story.  A girl who is looking to be cool, has the bad luck to end up getting kidnapped by an alien while wearing an alien costume, and is forced to play an alien, a sexy, slutty, stupid and annoying alien.  She decides to help the aliens find a planet to live on by dressing up and doing the alien's job.  This is the story of a stupid and boring girl who gets kidnapped and forced to act like an alien in order to be popular. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this film, but I have a big problem with all the bad things that happen to people in this movie. I think that if they would have stayed with the plot, and the characters, it would have been one of the better films of the year. I also liked the soundtrack, and I really loved when one character came into the scene for a little and got an old guy to say, "Hey man, what's up. Are we cool?". I really enjoyed the whole thing, but it just kept getting worse and worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has a horrible ending.  I feel like they should have had him just go back to the past as he left to try to find love, but instead the movie ends with a weird love scene that is a bit forced.  The film isn't bad, but I wouldn't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie ever. It's a complete mess and makes no sense. It is a movie that does everything it can to shock the audience. The director is a complete maniac and there is nothing he won't do to make his movie even more shocking to the viewers. The story is very lame and it has nothing going for it. Everyone is screaming and running around the movie to get to the climax in time. The sex scenes are extremely disgusting and there will be a little bit of blood as well. The ending was quite lame and did nothing for the movie. I can't believe this was made in 1989, it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It did not deserve to be made, but a lot of people were enticed by it and probably loved it. I would have avoided it and left it alone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a city where no movie could go wrong, we have a terrible and utterly pointless film that is the most inept of a long running franchise. There isn't a single good character or scene in the movie, there is not even a good plot. There is no sense of humor, nothing exciting happens. It is a terrible waste of our time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would recommend that the reviewers of this movie read up on the real-life exploits of these two guys; they're a real-deal, the real deal.  And they played that role pretty damn well. It's a very entertaining movie.   ...it is pretty difficult to get a laugh out of this; it's a pretty bad movie that I've seen a lot more of. So, it's not my favorite, it doesn't give me the kind of chuckles that I look for in a bad bad movie, but it's OK.   the film does a great job of mixing comedy with dramatic moments. The actors are great; the humor is pretty funny, and the action is good. It is a pretty good movie that has some good moments...but nothing great, so I'd recommend you skip this one. It doesn't add any real meaning to your life.   he does, however, add a lot to the internet. Thanks, Mondo!  ...read all the reviews on this movie! The movie does a bad job of giving a sense of who the characters are. They look good, but they're not good actors! The actors seem to have fun with the movie, they're goofballs...but...a few times they act like they're in the movie but they've come out to play some action film. They're all over the place...like they were just walking around outside with their movie posters. Not really a good movie. You'll not get any laughs out of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a terrible movie, and I loved it. The actors played by Will Ferrell, Megan Mullally and Kristen Wiig seem so awkward and awkward that it's hilarious. The first half of the movie involves Will Ferrel, Megan in a tiny blonde wig and Kristen in a very tight mini skirt, and all these girls are in a car. They're all looking for something to do in the middle of nowhere. It's funny and sad and weird and it's all so silly. It has a few great sequences and I don't even know what happens in the second half because the movie goes off the rails pretty quick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have not seen The Big Lebowski (1998)  or maybe even if you have, it's time to go back, it was one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The plot, which is based in Colorado, does not rely on one thing to move it forward. I'm pretty sure that it is based on the events in the movie and was actually made as a movie for the sake of making a film: it is not a great film but a good one. It tells the story of the Dude and the Big LeBowski, who have a deal where the first guy is going to pay for the second guy's trip when it is over. They are both the same person, which I thought was a pretty funny way to work, but it doesn't last long. They meet and then he takes the first dude to his hideout, the LeBowser home, where we find out that this is the same house that the Dude lives in and he's an accountant. When you think about it it is pretty obvious that this dude is the Dude from the movie! But why?  Oh! Because he's really bad at acting. Not as bad as Don't Look Now but he's still good for an actor. But I have to say, the first time you watch the movie, this is just so absurd. There is no plot or story, nothing happens, but I still enjoyed watching it.   You'll enjoy it too, if you're a big fan of the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is not only good but it could make the best film of this year. It has more action scenes, more dialogue, more drama, and more romance than it needs to be good but that is a good thing for a movie this good. It doesn't have a "final" ending, but it has enough endings to make up for it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first five minutes were pretty great. I loved how the characters were put together to tell a story. I can't say much more than that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  This is a horrible movie. It has no plot or anything at all. It just goes out of it's way to get it's own laughs and then, it turns into a total disaster. I was expecting a movie like this, but I had to sit through this piece. It is so boring and is made even worse by the fact that no one is trying to be funny. A bad actor does everything wrong. It's all about the jokes and is so bad that it is hard to take anything else out of the movie. The acting is terrible and the writing is just wrong. This is an extremely low rated film. I'm surprised the director thought so little of this film and made his directorial debut here.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went to see the first trailer, I was in my early 20's, when I heard my mother talking about her friend's dog who could never get anything to eat and now the dog was dead and she was asking me "where are you going? You should go there!" I went and saw the movie and I liked it, but it was pretty bad. I would not recommend the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a couple who are trying to get a divorce in a small town in Texas. As they are trying so they can separate and start again. But, as the story goes on it gets more and more ridiculous. The actors are bad, the script is bad, and I guess, the entire movie is bad. It makes me think the whole town of El Paso would not be so bad if this couple was married and had a family, a home, and a business, but they don't. They are really just on a road trip from a few days ago, which is when they were together and now when they are apart. The other character is a boy that is also in the divorce and tries to get involved in the relationship. Unfortunately, he is just a boy with a bad attitude.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------ This movie is bad. There was so much going on in the trailer: a beautiful city, a gorgeous young heroine, and some fun romantic comedy. I never thought any of that would be a problem, but it is. I love a good rom-com, and this is a fine one, except...I just can't stand the guy. He is boring, too bland, not much to say other than his name: J.J. But that is all. The plot is fine. It is a very simple love story with a very pretty young heroine that gets caught in the crosshairs of a psychopath. He's the kind of man that goes in for a girl because he is lonely and bored. He looks at her, sees she is a pretty thing and he is smitten. After a few hours of flirting, he is ready to go home. She knows this and she doesn't give him the time of day. He goes home and he takes the keys out of a safe and locks the door behind him. He puts his clothes back on and goes to work and starts the day. It doesn't take long for him to come home and get all dressed up to make his way into the house. He gets inside the house and the door closes behind him and there is a woman he has fallen in love with. She is his sister and they don't talk a lot. She comes into the room where his brother is reading and gets him drunk. She sits down on a chair right next to him and starts talking to him. I'm not sure what she says or what she looks at, but she's talking and he's just listening. He hears her and he listens too and there's a pause. She leans over and says, "I love you." It was her voice. He doesn't get it. He says, no, no I don't and then he grabs her by the shoulders and throws her to the floor. She's a very, very pretty girl. They fight a little and then she leaves and he goes back to work. He has a job and his sister goes off to college and everything is quiet and the sun comes up and he gets out of bed and gets dressed and leaves and starts his car and drives off. There's just a pause after he's gone and then the movie ends. It's a fine rom- com but it's very boring. A woman just sitting alone in the room of a handsome guy talking to herself
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Heavenly Creatures" is a story about two men who are attempting to kill a god.  They were all very good in their own ways; the hero in particular, a young soldier called Will (who is played by David Hasselhoff), is an extremely likeable man who knows how to fight, but is not very bright. The plot starts with the men's lives being turned upside down when he gets a job at a resort called Heaven.  He is one of the few who actually enjoy living in the real world, and this is not a bad place to spend one's time: there is plenty of amusement, food and drink, and even a small library, although there is only one copy of a book, and it is actually a very boring one.  The men get a lift to Heaven in the night, and when they arrive, they find that they have been invited to attend a ball, and will have to kill the god in the hope that a beautiful young woman will fall to her death.  Will and his brother, a rather awkward guy called Jim (played by the late John Cusack), take their job very seriously, but the young woman, named Julia (played with great sizzle by a great Laura Linney), is also quite serious.  She's a little strange, and there's lots of discussion about her sexual prowess and her father having died and her wanting to know more about her dead father.  When Julia falls in love with Jim's brother, she becomes very attached to him and the two of them form an oddly affectionate bond, something that isn't always welcome or expected in this strange environment. There is something quite sad about this movie: there's very little that makes it different from other adventure movies.  It has lots of fight sequences and lots of fighting, and some of the fight scenes are very very good (the film is set in Paris, a city where there is a lot of violence).  The characters are somewhat like the ones you would see in "The Fifth Element", and the film isn't really a bad one, it's just about the same.  There is no real reason why the young couple should go to Heaven, except that the father who brought them to Earth wanted them to.  As for the other people, it seems to be like a "Where the Wild Things Are" with a little more of the "The Lord of the Rings" and a little less "The Princess Bride
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a story about the birth of the great American actor, Harry Belafonte. It is an interesting story, a young man who had an amazing career with The Taming of the Shrew and The King of Kings, a show that was loved in New York. Then, the show ran the course of years until its end due to the loss of a star, the star that Harry Bela was. The legend is that he had met a young girl on the street, he saved her, he kissed her, and they began a great love story with the young girl, the young Bela. He was soon to change her life, but not quite yet. A few years later, he married an American actress, but his marriage ended in acrimony. After a long absence, he returned home with his young son, now a famous singer and a new wife. Now Harry Beli is at a crossroads with his career, with his new family, and with his wife's new romance. What will it be? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this flick about a young girl who, on her eleventh birthday, learns that her parents are dying, and that her younger brother is going to become a vampire.  She knows that her best friend is about to turn into one as well. So she sets out to find her brother and to find out what she's going to do.  This was a really fun little kid's movie, with some silly humor and tons of heart.  The action set pieces are a lot of fun and make this flick one to watch every single year around the holidays.  I was reminded of the animated movie in which the princess's brother turns into a dragon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: -------------------------- I saw this movie, it was a very bad movie, the story was very bad, the characters were weak, the plot was retarded...it was a bad idea to use a very old movie for making a movie...it is hard for me to believe that they wanted to try with this movie...the character I hate the most was the guy who killed the little boy, why, I do not know, he was so stupid, he wanted a real dog, why a dog...it all makes me hate him...what can I say, if you want to make a movie on the "Sylvia" then use the old TV series...I'm telling you this movie was just a waste of time...the special effects were bad, I hated the dog and I thought he was a stupid dog...all in all, a bad joke... I was disappointed with the movie, but I guess you are not supposed to be!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was the night of the big night for the best of the best, the movie: The Greatest American Hero. This movie is based on a novel by Richard Ford and it was made by Jack E. B. Judd and Victor Fleming in 1937. In this story the hero is a man who has been in the army for a long time, who wants to go to Paris to see some of the sights. He meets a beautiful woman, he makes a mistake in the middle of the night and in the end he gets hurt. This is a good movie, but it is really bad, because it is not a good action movie, it is just a bad comedy. Also in the story a man is killed and a woman is raped, so the movie ends really soon, but I guess this was the movie the producer wanted, because he did not use any of the good things in this movie, he used the bad scenes, the scenes that we can see in the movie. As it was the best.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't like this movie. It seemed like an average low budget horror film (not a horror film, just a movie) that just kind of got in the way of the movie's goal of being dark, violent and disturbing. The ending is just stupid and the movie doesn't have any real message other than the fact that if you don't give a shit, you don  If you liked the TV show "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," or any of the comic books about Buffy the Vampire slayer, you will enjoy this movie, but be warned that it is more of a "dark" version of the TV series. The only reason I even saw the movie was to see "R" (Riley), but he isn't much of an actor, and I couldn't get behind the role of the murderer. I would rather have seen some other actor play the part of the killer. Other than that, the film is decent.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a big fan of the movie. It was a good action movie with a lot of action. It has some good dialogue. There is no good dialogue in it. The acting is not good. There are just a few characters in this movie and they each do well as far as I can tell. There may have been a scene where I was like "who the hell is the villain?" Then I realized it wasn't the villain but a character who did his own thing who wasn't a bad guy, but a weird character who was a bit out there. The bad guy was a character that was in the movie for about 20 minutes but then he was nowhere to be seen again. The story didn't have anything interesting to it. I'm also a big fans of the comic book that was inspired by the movie and that was very good. This movie will not have a happy ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What?   It is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting and the sound don't even come close to it. The plot is just stupid. I know that it is based on a movie but it's a really bad one.   The film starts off with a great deal of drama because of the situation the protagonist of the movie, a man named Koko, finds himself in. A young woman (Shiho) who's about the same age as Koko leaves a message for her. But at that very moment a plane crash, which is somehow blamed on him, strikes. It is believed that he died, but a few months later a mysterious man (Kuroneko) is able to get Koko's old address and to find out what happened to Koko. What's even worse is that she is now in a psychiatric ward, due to the fact that she was too weak to leave a note. Koko thinks that she's been having an affair. But Kuroneko has already gotten a new boyfriend. So she begins to suspect a plot to destroy Koko in revenge for the fact she lost her way when she left the note.  The plot has all the elements of a good "noir" movie, but unfortunately is not a good film, as it suffers from some of the most egregious faults. I won't bore you by the bad acting, the bad special effects (especially the one when a big explosion happens), the bad directing and the bad editing of a film that should've been better. This film is one that should not be watched, and anyone who gives it a chance will end up disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie should have been called: "Dogs and Dogs, Why do we have to eat dog food?".   This movie features very little story, not even a subplot to be fair, not really even a plot to be more specific.   The story revolves around two dogs, the old man who lives next door and the owner, a nice dog she has named, who lives across the street. When the owners move to a new area, it happens that a dog gets out and attacks the old men family. This dog will not stop until he has killed him (the owner), and he has done it without warning or provocation (which is rare in this type of movie). This dog is named Bambi and he will not leave the owner alive, he will even kill his best friend. The owner has to come and get her from him. And you can guess what happens next. The dog is a big bully, and he doesn't like to share anything, but he does give to the owner a small toy dog which she must keep from the dog (well that's a small dog by now, is it really a toy dog??). The owner tries to keep Bambii a very close to her, but the dog is very strong, and she doesn't want to get into a fight. But the dog's father and mother have a different idea, and that's to try to capture the bad dog, and they have a great time. The only problem is that they have only been able to capture Bambini for a few moments and he seems to be back home again. The father takes all the good things from the mother's house and he tries to send a letter, and as he goes to put it on his porch, he turns around and the dog attacks him and he falls to the ground. The mother rushes up to him but the mother is bitten by Bambin and she dies. This leads the son to try and find a way to capture this great beast. The son has a special collar with a button that says it's a gift from his father. His first trip is when he gets the collar, as it's all he really owns, but now he has a real problem! This is not a dog movie and nothing about Bambani will make you happy. I really didn't want this movie to end, because the end seems really weird. The movie had some great music, and it did have some nice special effects.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Noise, as it is in this instance, is a problem. It is a noisy problem. To a man, the men on the stage talk at the top of their voices. It seems to me that the idea of playing with noises was not part of the program of this play." The only redeeming quality of this production was the cast. The story is a good one, with some elements that worked and some that did not. The characters are quite interesting, and they all seem to be a good fit for the situations they find themselves in. There is a great deal of drama between the two young lovers. They seem to fit the role quite well. The performances by the lead couple, Robert and Martha (who are played by Pauline Parker and Mary Rissette), are very good, but they do seem a bit too much in love to play their parts. They are both a bit over the top, and the acting is too exaggerated. The action scenes are very well acted, and very good quality. It was a very interesting play, and I liked it very much, but it was a bit on the over the shoulder kind of play. It does have some funny moments. But, I thought the play was somewhat slow paced, and a little over the shoulders in some places.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this about a year and half ago, and now it is so horrible. It's a bad-movie, as I have been through a couple. A bunch of people, who come into the city on a motorcycle, are picked up by a bunch of corrupt cops (who are really a gang of crooks, as most of the movie consists of them all having a "drug" bust, or a robbery.) They are put into a trailer, where they are all tied up and forced to watch a movie. This movie doesn't work at all for me. This is one of those movies that were so bad they were so funny in themselves. You know the one. It starts with a guy going into a place, to get something (or to get someone, which happens), and then has to leave, and there's a fight, and someone gets killed. Then we get a short scene with a girl who's been raped and then she's raped some more. It was really disgusting. When they all get out, they have to get to somewhere else to get what they need. So they all go to some place called a "party" or a "concert," I don't remember, but it is really lame. It is at a really expensive venue (where you cannot dance), and the DJ is "singer" Steve Miller, the son of a famous singer. The song he plays is just disgusting, and it's not funny. Steve Miller then sings something about his car being a "bratty little car," then goes and beats up a lot of people. You could tell he was trying really hard to give us a bad, bad laugh. As they drive away, they get caught in a storm, and we hear the song again. Then it just ends. This one is also extremely poor. This guy tries really hard, but he just can't do it. I wouldn't give it to my kids. Just a bad bad bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion the worst movie. If you like any kind of comedy then it is a good movie. But don't watch it unless you are not a fan of comedy or you are going to laugh the whole time. This movie is a big, big waste of your life.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ "This is how a bad film looks. An action movie. You can't help but be entertained by these kids' antics while trying to get out of a burning building. And the movie doesn't end with a "goodbye" and the kids running back home; it is a chase sequence that lasts a couple of minutes in which the kids end up chasing a woman around the city. And it is all done by the kids alone. No guns. No blood or gore. I wouldn't have paid to see this anyway. "
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â Â this is simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. When I started this bad movie I expected a decent story about a gangster with a bad past. I should have known better. This is just a terrible film. The acting, directing and cinematography are all awful and the dialogue is very poor. The plot line is terrible. The characters are extremely stupid and the movie is poorly written and filmed. Â If you like to watch people die and be chased by bad guys, then this is a good movie. If you only watch bad movies then this one will turn you off for good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! What the eff, is that a huge fucking tank?!!!!   No, it wasn't "a big fucking tank" but just a big fucking turd.!!! It was the only film of its type I had ever seen in the cinema, and that is the reason it should be called a movie, it was just a horrible, gross, pointless piece of shit.!! How could they have gotten the name "Tank" from such a small thing?!!! And it was the first time I watched something so awful that my eyes hurt.!!!!! I don't know, it's really hard to be shocked, it feels as if they were mocking us as if to say "This is what we do".!!! The film was also so stupid, it made no sense at all, not even a little.!!!! The most unbelievable part was to find out that the people in the film are all wearing the same outfit, you can easily miss someone if you're not looking close enough.!!!!!!!! The only positive part was the big, red "L".!!!!   "Tank" may be the worst, most pointless, and most annoying of the films I saw this year.????????   This is why I say that this year should be "The Worst Years" of Film, because in these years no movies will be even a tenth as bad!?????!????????
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After a long period of silence I found this movie to be a rather bland and mediocre action flick which is why I didn't find much appeal in it. I guess some people like that sort of thing and I guess my tastes didn't differ that much.   It's kind of like a mix between an over the top and overly dramatic action film, so it has a sort of action/comedy balance that some may find a tad boring but I found it to be more or less tolerable. The action is the weakest aspect of the movie which is a shame since it was really a lot of fun to watch. A very enjoyable action movie for a while, and if you like action/comedies then I'm sure you will like it. R.I.P.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film about a mother, a father and a son. The father is a "hard nut". He is very violent and he is very controlling. The mother is a manipulative person and she is a drug addict. They live alone together but the mother has a big "toy" that she likes to give to the son. This movie is good but I felt like the writer tried to be too much with this story. The son is a tough guy and he doesn't like his mother because she does nothing for him.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish I could give this film a 0/10 and I would have been wrong...this isn't a good movie, the acting was bad, the story was poor. It's not great, but it's not bad, it's like a movie that's trying to be great. I wish I would've known at the time that it was going to suck, I think it was released a year too late.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing really to say about this. The characters were poorly done, there is nothing to say other than it is a low effort, low budget, low impact effort that has none of its elements working. It is boring and there are things wrong in it that would be very un-interesting if not for the way it looks. It has no story to speak of and the whole movie is just a big boring mess that is nothing but an annoyance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is about a woman who loves her husband so much that she wants to go out on a date with a young guy that she only just met and then ends up having to keep her husband from cheating. It looks like a simple, yet fun and interesting story, but it is much more like it. The only part that I liked was the fact that when the guy was about to have sex with her, she asked him why he had to be so greedy about sex and if he had enough money to pay her back. And the answer was no, because he didn't even have enough money for food for two months. And after three hours of sex in a bathroom, the husband was so frustrated that he started to leave and she asked her boyfriend if they could get out of it, but that boyfriend would only give her a "kiss on the cheek". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: s is not a bad film with a great cast: ive only seen a few times of this film, and i did not like it at all: i think this is the first movie i think the studio should get rid of it: it was too slow, it was very uninterested in the story, it is quite boring; and it was a very boring film for the kids.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was excited to go to this movie because it seemed to be a good movie. I was not disappointed at all. The ending is not the best (it was not written very well). I am not a fan of the original, which is an obvious point. I would rather have seen a different ending, and the writing did not improve by much, as it should. I have nothing against the director, the actors and the other performers in the movie. My problem is not with the movie but with this writer: she tried to put in her original ideas into this film but she is clearly not an adequate writer. What could have been a decent movie got ruined by her inability to express her ideas well. It would have been better to write a good story instead of ruining it with her poor ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best part of the movie is the amazing soundtrack by Paul Shaffer which really adds so much to the movie, and is a wonderful surprise to hear a movie of this nature being made at all.   However, this has a few problems and has no real interest for any of it. The main problem is that it has to set up the plot so that it can become a movie for kids. The movie has a good message of acceptance of what has happened to you. In this message the girl loses her baby because of an accident.  However, her father is a terrible man who is in love with a girl.  In a fit of rage he leaves a baby girl in a truck with an open window.  The mother is never seen or heard from again, and the mother never told anyone because she felt guilty because of her husband's infidelity. The baby girl is also said to have a broken heart, but the movie takes it much too far to make the story realistic.  This is the only thing that bothers me about the movie.  You don't care about the woman and her daughter and you don't really get why they have to be in this car.  2) "Caveman"   Another short, cheesy movie that has not much to offer.  It takes place in the past and the main character is a caveman that becomes a modern man to survive the world and become a father. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   I know that people love to go crazy over bad movies! That is what I've always wanted to do! However, I'm not going to lie to you, when I watched this movie, the first thing that happened to me was the horrible smell. It was so bad it was horrible! My mom was sick and I had to stay home from school! I know that sounds like a bad thing, but it was not long before I was sick from this awful smell! The film really was a joke! But I thought it was going to be funny. I was not prepared for how bad it really was.   What I do not understand is why this movie needs any acting talent at all. A girl playing a bad role is just not enough! In this movie the only actor who looked even slightly human was an older woman! That's it! She looked like a walking corpse! If the acting talent was really so great, she would not have had to be acting and looking so much like she was. This isn't a bad film at all, it has some pretty funny parts, but the acting on this film was pathetic! The worst part about this film is the ending! I have no clue why the girl went into a room, then she walked off screen with a guy! That guy actually died! There were a few other things that were not funny in this film! The movie is over so the next one would have to be worse!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is very poor science fiction movie. It's nothing but an old fashioned story about a guy named Mikey Smith (Gene Hackman) and his friend Steve (George Nolfi).  They go to a planet called 'Zeta', which has been discovered to have some sort of intelligent life. They go there to help the natives there and discover that there's a big problem going on and it's pretty evil. It seems like a typical sci-fi movie, with an interesting plot and good acting.   There are a few really weird things in this movie, like the aliens have a very small brain, and they get angry if you look down at them.  And a really weird creature in the movie that I never saw before and it looks like the guy from 'Wolverine'.    So I guess this movie is not a bad sci- fi movie. But for some reason the story is just too long and not interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not bad for a remake, but I wouldn't recommend this over the original.  As usual, the actors get little time to talk.   They make up the dialogue and try to act as if they are in their own movie...  Then there is a lot of acting.  There are some funny scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm sorry this movie is so bad I had to rate it 4 stars instead of 5. I think the reason most people hate this movie are because they think there's no way this movie could've been so awful! There were several things I hated about the movie and it's just ridiculous how bad it is. First of all it has a scene where a woman is talking to her dog who has an ear infection. The dog then asks if she is a real doctor because she can treat him with an ear plug. I mean come on this is a joke to most people right? There's also a scene at the start where a guy comes out of a restaurant and says "it's good to have a hot dog" to a girl in a bikini. The movie then cuts to the woman in a pink bikini being carried by the guy into a house to have some hot dogs. When she walks out of the house she says "this is hot" in the voice of some of the stupidest movie characters ever. I didn't even think this movie was going to be this bad but the whole plot was stupid and it was so boring it's not even funny. There are multiple bad characters like an obnoxious couple that don't speak at all and a bunch of other characters who are just annoying. The ending of the movie had one of the worst endings of any movie I've ever seen. It's literally just a bunch more shots of a lady on her knees in an old fashioned way. I hate how there's just like a bunch to a terrible movie. Not only is it bad it has an even worse script. I'm a fan of bad movies but I'm amazed that this movie even got made in the first place.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to go back to the 90's to think about a good movie that can be enjoyed without seeing the whole movie. In case you don't remember: It's about a boy who grows up to be a hero and saves the world. There are explosions and people falling from buildings, and then... there's a bad guy who kills people, and one of the other heroes has to stop him. But how do they get past him? They make a portal to a different world (with a castle!) and go through! If this were a cartoon, it would be hilarious, it's not, it really isn't. I won't spoil it for you; but trust me when I say that it's pretty bad, really bad!  Not funny in any way.  It's so bad that it is just plain stupid.    It's pretty hard to explain why it's so poorly done.    First of all, they try to make it into an epic fairy-tale. It's a good idea to make your story more epic, but why not just make it a typical fairy-tales with the characters being in an epic fantasy world, not a world that we can actually imagine?   A good epic fantasy story has a lot more than just fantasy, it has all kinds of historical details and characters.  And this movie takes everything the hell out of those things!  And I don't mean "take everything" I mean "puke every single thing out of every single one of those characters."   I could give you many examples of all the bad things they do, but the movie is way too long to give a good example.  I'm not even going to make a good long version of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! (or is that not a good movie???)!!! is a terrible movie that has absolutely no heart whatsoever and a great deal of silliness. It follows a bunch of teenagers who decide to get a job as janitors in a mansion that the owner of the mansion bought for his family. However, one night when the family goes to sleep, the house blows up, killing the family (except for the maid) in the process, and killing his mother. They all think they are dead because they were never told how to die (that's why their eyes turned blue for no reason. And yes, it was the same in the movie). Anyway, the janitors, who were also killed, decide to do one last, "desperate" rescue of the family. This turns out to be not so desperate because after the explosion the house's "walls" blow up, crushing all the occupants of the house and their families, including the janitor. They manage to get out with a fire hose and a ladder, but the house catches on fire again before they can get the ladder to the top and rescue the january families. The kids decide that since they are not dead, they don't have to save them, and the movie ends. The house was just a house. It had no power. It just blew up. It's funny and stupid and sad all at the same time. It really should never have been made. It may have sold a lot of video tapes, but it's not a really good film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why people say this movie is so bad. It's not bad by any means, but it has a lot of problems as you can see in the movie. I thought it was very entertaining, though not especially well-made. I had trouble getting through it. I found some of the characters to be a little too shallow and flat, and I really don't understand the motivation for the people on screen. I don't think I would be able to get through the movie if I took a nap beforehand. I wouldn't recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing worth noting about The Dead, is that it has two different endings, one is not that bad, and another bad, a bad bad ending, bad bad, good bad bad. But I do not know what the original ending was, I cannot find a copy anywhere, and so I am just going to describe the endings with which I found them. This is the first ending which is actually a decent ending, but the third act just does not work at all.   The film has the following story: In the beginning there is one of the dead lying in a pool of blood, while his family, friends, and all his friends stand around him, shocked. But then, the other dead show up, each one a man, a father, and a son, and the whole family gets into the pool of dead, but it seems like the father wants to kill them, but then the son, who is standing on his father's shoulders, stops him, saying "Wait, let me" (which is a very funny and dramatic line), and then the father turns and leaves the pool, and when he does, his wife and the children leave too, but he leaves the house and the house starts falling down, and then he says "I'll be back" and he doesn't come back. And in this scene the woman in the pool tries to jump into the dead man's neck, but she is stuck, and soon she stops, and there is nothing she can do. Then, a black cat is seen. It is a black, and ugly cat, which is called the Feline, and it is a creature which is not a cat at all, but an old black cat, and which lives in a hole in the wall which has a hole into the world outside. It has a big, big, black, ugly head, which appears like a human face, and its big, fat, ugly, and dangerous feline ears are attached to a long, curved tail. It runs on two feet, and you must not even imagine that it does anything else, because it just watches and watches, with a sort of look of pure, deep, murderous curiosity. The movie goes along like this: First, when the father and wife come to the house, they can hear the F. Cat running on its four feet everywhere, and they try to kill it with stones. But they do not work, and eventually they come to a strange part

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is like a kid's game:    The premise:   "You can't trust the girl!" screams the narrator, in a rather comical tone.   I don't know if this is a deliberate parody or not, but I don't think this is funny, and I know it's not a good idea. I don�t know what a girl who's a bad liar would be doing in a film with such a plot. It�s ridiculous. It isn�t funny, it's annoying and I don��t see the point in watching this.   the movie:     It begins with a girl, called "Vivian," who is a very smart and beautiful girl, but she doesn�t have a life. She has a bad boyfriend who doesn�T trust her, and that�s really the reason she joins the army. I do understand her reasons, since she wants to be rich, but that�ll work out when she gets her first boyfriend.   of course, in the army you have to make up lies to make your commander like you and make yourself happy. Well, I don?�t think Vivian is smart enough to be trusted at this point. She doesn't know how to lie well and she�s not very brave and she does stupid things. I guess she got her job in the military because she can get a little bit of money, like it�s free and it�ll give her some freedom. Then she is assigned to a unit that doesn't really get along.   I don' like that Vivian ends up having to get into some kind of fight, so she joins a unit where she can become more useful. The movie is about these two young soldiers going through a hard time with them and their commander, the evil Major Rufus.   The two young girls are actually quite beautiful, but Vivian still does the stupid things and is very stupid. Rufian is really the villain of the movie and he�s kind of an annoying villain, but he's quite cute and I liked watching him get his revenge on the two girls. I could have watched this all in one long shot (and I did).   My biggest complaint is that the movie tries to make this the "good soldier" movie, in which everything in the world is a horrible lie. It's a terrible idea and I just don't like it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many things wrong with this film that you can't help but smile for a moment after every laugh.   This is a horrible movie that has made a lot of money but nothing was accomplished. The acting is awful, the plot, horrible, the characters boring, and the music is cheesy as hell.  The worst thing about this movie is the soundtrack, it is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I've ever seen, by a long shot.  What the film did was to give a really bad, boring and stupid action movie.    Why?   Because the producers gave zero attention to plot and really nothing to it.  There wasn't much reason for anyone to care about anything that happened.  Instead, we watched the same people in this boring story over and over again.  What was the point?  The biggest problem I had with the movie, was that I felt as if there was only one purpose for any given action:   To show the power of the gun.  The whole movie was about how the gun could overcome many forms of weapons, and how good the gun was as a weapon.  Sure it was fun to see the bad guys try to get the bad guy and the bad girl to fight in order to win, but the fight scenes were all about the gun, not about the two girls.  I mean, there was one fight between the bad girls when they were trying to escape and the gun had nothing to do with that fight.  In addition to having no storyline, the movie was filled with ridiculous characters such as:  Bugs Bunny: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â It looks like a  very good film    (in the sense that I know the characters and get along with them very well) Â But it was way too slow and uninteresting.  It was about 3 months in the making and when the movie finally came out, it was very short. Â There is not much of a story.    What I really liked:   (5 )   The story:    Well, the story was good.    There was a couple of nice story lines.  The characters are well-designed and interesting.  I like the fact that the characters are not all  white guys that can't speak in a foreign language.  They do get along better as the story goes along.  And that is a good thing!      The bad:  (8)   That is a long list.  My biggest problem with the movie is the pacing.  It takes almost too long to get through most of it.  There were some really good moments but the pace just wasn't consistent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film that tries to tell a really good story. The actors are great as is the music. It's a fun romp about a couple of guys that have an affair (that's right, not really) but the problem is that you don't even know about this until very late into the film. The story is rather boring with a man who's trying to convince his wife that she's not crazy. She thinks this man is crazy for all the time he's hanging out with her and she's a good wife. That is until they finally meet with an attractive woman. The whole movie is about the woman's family, family history, family drama, etc. The woman is a bad wife with a tendency for jealousy and being a horrible mother to her son who is quite normal. When they finally have sex, that's when this becomes a whole new ball of wax. It gets interesting pretty quick. It ends with a quick trip to the local graveyard which doesn't feel like a graveyard at all. Just a bunch of cemeteries. The only good thing in the film, in my opinion, was the fact that there was a song that was about how there was an old couple of two that was found dead with their bodies buried together in a little hole in a wood. It was creepy as all heck to watch and was a great song. It ended with a nice music video too.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It started out as a fun movie about a man who gets stuck on the other side of a mountain for no apparent reason. It is very fun to watch as a guy gets his butt stuck on an edge for no reason.   A man in the film is forced to walk up an incline so he can rescue his pet monkey. When he finds the monkey, they do a whole lot of silly monkey stuff, but he is pretty sure it's a monkey. As the guy climbs the mountain, the monkey gets a bad haircut, and they are forced to leave the area by the locals who claim that monkeys can never live on a mountain like this one.  That said, the film wasn't a complete flop.  The action scenes were very entertaining, and there is a scene that has everyone on the edge of their seat.  It is pretty funny, and the movie is a fun ride.  But, I think the movie does have one fatal flaw, and this was the biggest flaw of this movie.  This film has no redeeming quality.  For a bad film, I give it an A-.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I read the book in order, reading chapters at a time, to make it a more linear tale and I was glad of that. I enjoyed the story quite a bit but I had a lot of problems with the plot and it was quite predictable at times and that was very much a problem for me. There was a large amount of exposition which was a huge disappointment in the case of a short story. However, the story did have some great moments in it. The art was also quite good, I really liked how it seemed like the people in the city were all trying to be different while the people outside were the same. I did like the music a lot too, it fits in with the story and I think it adds a nice bit of color.   This was a story about a man who is not like most men but is a rather unique individual, he is a writer but he isn't a great one at that, he's not a poet, a short tale writer, or even a novelist. His name is David Bowie and he is the King of the City and is a kind of a king to his people. David is a man that goes around to the corners of the city, asking to write a short little story about the day and how he is in this city. He gets his request and he does and the tale it is... isn't... well it isn't, he doesn't quite do much and has a really terrible plot and a really horrible character. I wasn't really pleased about this book as a whole, at times the plot really was predictable and the plot didn't have enough twists and turns to keep me interested, I had to go and re-read the book several times to really get some sort of depth or depth to David's character. The last few chapters are a bit lackluster too, nothing much happens and I really didn't want to read more so I put this book down a few days after I began reading. I can't really recommend this book since it is such a short book, only a few hundred pages, and it is very much not a novel. It's very good as a short novel but it is not a very good story, as a stand alone it isn and I wasn  I really didn  This book was a short read for me though. I was looking forward to reading a story that was more focused and I had no problem with that, it was going to be a short chapter read but I was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film has been released in a few different countries. In Canada it was known as 'Fruitvale Station', in the Netherlands as 'Rise of the Warrior' and in Germany as 'Popplepen Klapp'.  The USA has seen little of this film:  On the 20th of July 2012:  the movie 'Ferrari' was released in the USA in 2 theaters, at noon on a Thursday night. The only reason why the movie was shown in theaters (therefore no release in the theaters of the Netherlands) was that the distributor wanted to make the movie more widely known. And what better way than to show it in theaters with the very highest praise it could get in the cinemas. The movie made its way into the cinema market, even though it wasn't even one of the best films of the year: it was a good film, but not a very good film. To make up for the lack of quality the director of the movie has made some very good marketing, which is one of his strengths. But if you're not a fan of the director or the material, don't bother.  From the review: the movie is not a bad picture but not really a good one either: although the production quality in most respects is very good. In the story you are forced to accept a story which, however, is a very long and boring one: it features an almost perfect cast (Koenenberger, Schurrle and Kuchro) and also contains the one and only great performances of the film, Kip Thorne in 'Fate' and Jean-Pierre Dardenne in 'My Best Friend's Girl', also very good performances, but unfortunately they are not enough to give the movie its strength: all the rest is basically worthless (and the whole movie). The dialogue is also lacking: the film is set in a very dark and gloomy cinema and dialogue is almost completely uninteresting: you are basically forced to watch the actors in silence as they talk about absolutely nothing at all: not a single word of them is interesting. In addition to that there is a huge amount of exposition about how the story is going to be written from the point of view of the police force and the journalists: this leads to the film being extremely boring: the same story is presented with a different perspective. There are also a lot of repetitions of the same scenes: this is a shame, since the actors
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst part of this movie was the story of the main character.  His mom and uncle are going on a long holiday and he's told not to make any noise in his room.   This is the third time I've seen this movie and it's getting old.  The only reason I give it three stars is because of the music.  If you have heard the theme from "The Phantom of the Opera" for a musical play you will know what I'm talking about.  This movie had the most terrible musical numbers ever made.  But as long as they didn't try to play them like a rock opera I'd give them a five star.  I really didn't care for the plot of the movie.  There's a lot of characters and they're all a part of a story of a little boy that is going to be in a little house with other little boy kids.  One of the kids is evil so the bad guys are trying to destroy the house and the little boy gets caught up in the fight.  To sum this up:  The bad guys want to kill everybody and the small kid gets caught in the middle.  It is a bad old movie.

I simply do.  Why did I not think of this movie when I was a wee lass?  It is simply so funny and such a delight to watch.    It is a wonderful movie which really teaches you to enjoy yourself.  It has many moments of humour and is a very funny movie about a group of people who don't have the best time.  But why is it a favorite?   Well I do like the way the movie starts and the humour that the lead actor brings to the table.  I love the fact that in order to win the love of the beautiful, he does a bad thing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you were hoping to see some big names (e.g., Will Smith, Morgan Freeman) or even a couple of big action scenes, you will be disappointed. The "action" is all just a cheap thrill ride. This movie is the movie that a young movie star gets his first big screen appearance and I can't help but find his character quite shallow.   If you are looking for a good comedy, this is a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I got this for free from someone's ebay. It had a good start, but the end just sucks bad. The movie didn't seem to know how to end. There is a big fight and the bad guys fly away. Then at the end the bad guy takes a gun and shoots a guy for no reason. I was like wtf is that? Then the bad dude goes after the girl who did all this. She fights back and knocks a baddie to the ground. At the end there is some dude on a bike coming out of the woods and he turns around and looks at the girl and then shoots her. Well what the hell?! If you didn't love this movie. Get another one!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the movie would have been better if it had the good actors back, i loved it before the bad acting and the terrible music, it has an amazing story line i can't believe it's been 20 years, i would love a remake, would be nice to see someone make this movie now.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This  is not a good movie.  Yes it's  about an evil vampire who steals a heart from a young boy.   It's a great story and I would watch it again.  But   it    is a terrible   vampire movie. The character does not seem to have much depth and they do not develop at all with him.  It seems he is a normal guy who can't get an erection.  Then   something happens to change his life.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!! A stupid and lame comedy! It takes some really funny dialogues which can be interpreted a few ways (mostly in a positive way) and then adds some random elements which don't fit together and doesn't make sense and then puts a lot of stuff in a completely nonsensical way. The movie is nothing more than a bunch of very bad jokes with an uninteresting story and an extremely long and stupid ending which has no real reason to happen at all (which is why the film isn't that bad)!!!! This is the worst movie I have ever seen! I would definitely never watch it again!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When you think of the horrors of childhood, and the unending nightmare in which they had to endure it, it's hard to think of a bigger, more disturbing horror for a kid than The Pit and The Pendulum.  There are so many different ways this movie manages to make you feel like you are in the same kind of hell we lived in. From the very first moment when the little boy watches the monster he will become a little creeped out by how realistic it seems.  What a clever idea.  That little boy (and his mother) just happens to be a psychic - so of course they'll get some bad readings, right? This is the kind of movie that doesn't get old.  I am glad my little daughter and I can laugh and laugh and talk about it.   Get it while it's hot:  We're going to keep the ratings as simple as possible:  A) - I was very sick this last weekend, but this film made me want to take a much needed break and get my mind off the hell I had to go through.  B) - If a kid in the 70's could write a movie with this level of horror, a lot of kids will now be terrified to death of ghosts and goblins and all that nonsense.  C) - There are some very creepy moments, but it's nothing compared to other movies of this genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so eager to see this movie. I didn't think it would live up to the hype. I was expecting something a little more intelligent than the "Shark Tank" movie. It did not live up. It was a good movie, but I would not recommend it to anyone. It didn't make me laugh.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- I thought this movie would be bad. It started with a good idea: an abandoned hospital with a bunch of zombies. Now, I know people hate being told how stupid and ridiculous everything is. I thought the movie tried to be a little more original than that. In fact it almost worked. There was a guy whose family got caught in a zombie massacre. What a tragedy! I mean, who would want a son to die? He had no money to get a better weapon. And so he tries to find a good source of energy, as a zombie. The problem is, you would be able to tell that the movie was not good. The special effects look very cheap and the plot never really caught the audience. And then there is the guy. He is like a typical action movie guy, running around killing zombies. And I mean that as a compliment. As for the actors, they did a fine job at acting. I mean I thought that was fine, but nothing amazing. There is a very well written story about these guys, and it was interesting enough to keep my interest. But, when the movie stops being interesting and turns into a bad action movie, I was done. This movie was bad. No matter how bad I thought it would be, it really sucked. ---------------
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had to wait for two days to see this movie and that is a very long time for a movie about a couple of kids and their crazy teacher who is also a little psychotic. When I saw the movie, I was amazed by the story and the graphics and I was pretty sure that the movie would be good, because it had a good director and they used good effects with some nice music.   My issue with the movie was the acting. I was sure that I didn't just see a bunch of kids in some weird school because I saw a couple that I had never seen before and I did not recognize them. There was also a bunch that did not seem to want to play. I found it really odd that I could not recognize most of the principal characters and it was hard to figure out what they were doing when they were in class. But to sum up: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had really high hopes for this movie. I loved the TV series of this show. I've always loved the concept of the show. It was interesting to see the various episodes from that series. It started out pretty fun and fun for a couple of episodes. It had a nice ending though. After the first episode, it got really tedious. If this show had a season two, it would have been even worse. The second season got so bad that I wanted to just throw my television set out the window and run screaming with my hands over my ears. This show got so ridiculous that it turned me off from watching anything for a good while. It kept showing the same set of characters and things that they did in the first season. There was an almost too-easy to hate main character.  My thoughts on this show:  I really do not see how a movie with such low production value can get a PG rating. I was never into the television show (or the manga). I thought the premise of the TV show was interesting. I liked a lot of the episodes they had. I guess I was really happy when they got to the point that it seemed as if everything would work out, and they just got a little too complacent. The first story was funny, the second was cheesy, and the last one was the worst. I think one can only do so much for a television series and it got to a point where it was just silly.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is full of plot holes, lies and a plot that doesn't work. A character in the movie is described as a "dumb blonde who thinks she's a movie star." I'm sure they could've gotten one or two people in the background to make it look more real, but you can tell the whole story is staged and put on for the camera. And even if the background extras were real actors, they would still not be "dummies". What makes this movie worst is that it does not even try to be interesting or even interesting in the first place. It just has one gimmick after another. It is hard to follow the plot, it is hard for the director to get a story to work. This movie has one of the worst, most tedious, boring, dull, forgettable stories you'll ever watch. I don't even want to know what happens to the character. I just think it's the worst movie I've seen in years. I can't believe I saw this movie!

I'm not sure why he was cast in this. It was pretty clear to the people watching the tv that this guy had a few movies under his belt,   The first was probably his worst, but it did a good job of introducing the idea.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I am not sure what this movie is about. A group of friends take a trip into the city to celebrate their graduation from college. They do it by partying and hooking up for the night. When they wake up, they have each other but the guy who is supposedly supposed to be sleeping with them is sleeping with someone else. He keeps trying to wake her up until finally she's awakened by a pounding on her door. She's naked and is very drunk when the guy finally awakes her with a blowjob. He does not like it and decides to leave, telling her she's the one responsible for her own bad decision."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out very well and then goes downhill from there.  I think it was a pretty decent movie to start with but the more I think about it, the more it's like watching someone else's movie.  At first there is something to like with the movie, and that is that there is a pretty good story but once the main character is revealed it's a mess.   His father is a big time mafia boss, he is a cold blooded killer but also a cold hearted father who seems to be very protective of him.  But he is also a manipulative man who puts his son through all sorts of horrible things.  He puts him through terrible training (it is not much but it's something, I've never had to go through any training for an adult movie), takes away his mother's inheritance, and even gives him a gun and teaches him to be an assassin.  These are all bad things but also for the son is supposed to be the heir to the family and his father wants to see that.    I have no idea why anyone would do something like this to a child but I don't think it would have happened to any other child.  A few of the other characters (a couple of the parents, a few of his teachers) also seem to have some good qualities but they are completely unlikable.  They are just the types of people you have to hate.  I guess when you have a plot that is basically a lot of plot to keep up with it's not a good idea to have so much sub plot.  Now let's talk about the acting.  It was interesting to see a group of young actors doing something so horrible for the sake of being horrible.  We know they are talented, they can all do terrible things very well but they never had any good intentions.  The acting is just horrible throughout the film, it is really bad.  Every single actor is horrible, I'm not really going to name them but I think everyone here did a terrible job.  There's only one guy I remember to have any personality at all, and for a good part of the film he's all the same. The movie is so bad, all you can do is hate the characters and not care who does the killing.  When they are fighting it's just not believable, even the fighting is bad. After the movie is over you feel cheated, and I can say without

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Cinema is my life, so you can imagine how much I adore The Wicker Man - a wonderful film. Well, I loved it so much that I took time to write a review. I am a film critic, and it is a good job that I love The Wickers Man so much - it is one of my all time favorite movies. The production design of the film is brilliant. It looks like a classic British horror film from the seventies and it even evokes classic horror films from earlier years such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The cinematography of the movie is wonderful as well - one could easily assume that the film was shot during the winter season in the beautiful English countryside.   What I think I loved the most about the film, however, is the subtlety of the performances. I mean, for one thing, it would be hard to find a bad performance in this film. Tom Waits gives a superb performance as Dr. Henry Wicker - a man who is constantly worried that he will lose his sight in a car accident. For some reason or another, Wicker finds a way to cope with his blindness, even though he does not always have a very good control over the situation. Wicker is an old school horror film director, with the old school film director being the one who decides to make a low budget horror film about the blind. And even though this film was made thirty years ago, the actors still had enough energy to perform. The performances are as good as ever in this movie - which is saying something, because Tom Waites was not exactly a name that I remembered hearing. And I did remember him from another film - A Streetcar Named Desire - a movie that was more famous than The Wicket Man (in fact, it was the movie that created the word 'awesome').   Unfortunately, I cannot give a high rating to The Wacky Adventures of Waddles - a great movie that I enjoyed quite a lot. It was a simple family picture about an animal man and his wife. The movie did not have a whole lot of humor to it - it was a very simple and straightforward tale - and it only really worked because it came at the time when a lot of movies were featuring animals as the main characters. It is a really interesting story about a man with a pet squirrel, the family patriarch (who is not even shown in this picture), the son, and his friends. The
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie last week.  It really sucked.    A bunch of people in costumes in a big arena where they play baseball.  A lot of the things are done in a way that is really uninspiring.  I didn't care about the game.  The baseball is a joke.  There is no variety.  And it makes no sense to watch an announcer with his mouth full of spit for 30 min talking about all the little guys that nobody else cares about as the big guys are on the field doing their thing.  It was also quite funny to see the baseball players trying to be different from each other.  All this baseball stuff would have been much better if not for the boring characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "B" grade does make a movie great.    It seems that the actors in this film all have one great scene together, so that gives the movie three great scenes. The story is good, I just wish it wasn't so damn obvious that they just couldn't find a way to save a girl. It would have been nice to get a sense of what her feelings were, and what her thoughts on it were.  The bad people were just too obvious in this one. The bad people in this movie are just too...unattractive.  It would be nice if the villain was more interesting, and that the characters in this had more to them, rather than just being a generic group of bad people.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love this film. It has lots of heart, humor, love, heartbreak and it's a beautiful picture with a beautiful story. But there are two HUGE problems. The first is the story. The most heart-wrenching story you could ever imagine. And the second is the acting. It doesn't quite hold up as well as most of the performances. They had some great performances, but they're overshadowed by this great story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a reason why I can't make it through a whole movie by myself.    I never really liked this movie in the first place, as it was nothing short of bad.  I did watch the director's cut, which was slightly better, but I have not watched this one at all. It's just not that good of a movie to see on the big screen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is sad and disappointing that so many people are calling the movie a racist, misogynist, homophobic, homophobic, and even anti-semitic film. Well, if you are offended then the film is not for you. If you are a fan of the old movies then don't watch this one! If you have any decency you will enjoy it, however, if there is something wrong with it then I do not know what the problem is. But to sum it up: the movie is not bad at all, but it is a poor attempt at a sci-fi movie. The movie tries to emulate Star Wars, but in the same style. It's all in space, there is no aliens, no space battles, and it's all about space ships and space adventure. There is little interaction between the characters and their own life. It reminds me a lot of a Space 1999 movie. I guess the point is to create a space travel movie, where the only reason to watch is because it looks good and will make you want to see more. The only thing that bothers me is that there were so many more interesting sci-fis out there. But since it's just a sci fi it is easy to make and to do so. The ending could have been better, but all things aside it has enough promise.   Overall: 9/10   Thanks for taking the time to read this review I hope you enjoyed it, and if you didn't... well I guess it's time to try something new, something different... you should still check out Star Wars! Helpful and really funny as well! But it doesn't stop there... The plot continues to evolve until it makes you say, "Well this is a movie." The movie doesn't want to be anything. It has no beginning, no middle, no end, it just keeps going for ever! So much so that it is hard to describe this movie at times. For some people, this movie might be one of the worst sci fi films ever made. For others, this one will be one you'll remember for a long time. For me, this is one of those classics that will always hold a special place in my heart, as well as that of many others.So if you want a sci,fi movie in which everything is going on at the same time, and you have nothing better to do with your time... well, then this movie will be the ticket for you!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had a lot of flaws. The script was bad, the acting was bad and the special effects were bad and very cheesy. A story like this can only be considered to be a joke. It was an extremely slow paced movie with a lot to keep track of. The first half was actually pretty good. I really enjoyed it. Then, they started using the characters and it all fell apart. There were a lot more plot holes then you would think. I never once thought the movie was good enough. That could have been taken care of with a new script. I would not recommend this movie for anyone. If you enjoy comedies, action movies, sci fi, thriller, horror, a movie like this is definitely not the movie for you. It is basically a boring story that is very poorly written.  The following are spoilers from "The Chronicles of Riddick: Death Knight". If you have yet to see the movie, I do not recommend it unless you want to be disappointed. The following are the movie plot summary. The movie begins with a shipwreck on an uncharted planet. A group of explorers arrive in the ship and discover that they can fly (sort of), but it is not a simple flight and they have to learn how to use it in time. They encounter a wolf man and a caveman as they travel and become the only members of their kind on the planet. This is the first human to ever explore that planet. He is found by a group of people who call themselves the "Death Knights" They are hunters and are dedicated to hunting and killing the Death Knights. The story slowly goes back to the beginning when they encountered the Death Knight and they begin searching for him. There are a number of characters that are introduced in the film. They are the ship's captain, the ship engineer and the wolf man. They live in a town called Tarkus which has several townsfolk. The main antagonist is named Riddrick, a warrior that the "kings" who control the planet, want to kill. The townspeople are very superstitious and have a fear of the Death knight. Some of the things that happened in this movie are very cheesy and over done. It can make you laugh but then you begin to find it quite bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- After the amazing trailer the movie starts with a small town in a war torn Europe, in which the government is trying to hold a referendum to change the laws to allow civilians to join the German Army, which are fighting in a very small town of 1,000 souls, and they need a priest to perform a ceremony with a bunch of old women and men in order to grant them the ability to kill other humans, the only problem is that all of the women look like they're going to throw up from the pain of the pain, a group of soldiers tries to talk a priest into turning the town into a slaughterhouse for their army, but as soon as the priest takes his hand out of his pants he gets hit with a baseball bat and knocked unconscious, the soldier has already finished killing his prisoner when the priest is awakened and the soldier tells him to get ready for war and that he will kill the priest and then take over the town, the priest tries to run to get away but he is hit by one of the soldiers who also tries to kill him, but the priest turns around, hits the soldier in the head with a water hose, the other soldiers come out and shoot everyone in sight, then a huge bomb goes off in the air in front of the town. In the end the priests body explodes, everyone is killed, one soldier is able to get out alive, and the priest does a little dance in front the soldiers. Now that you are sure you have seen the movie, let me explain the plot a little, it all seems pretty unbelievable but is actually pretty accurate, there were some scenes that would really leave you scratching your head, and a lot of it is made up, there are a bunch that were not in the trailer, including a scene where one of those old women asks a priest who he thinks is a God or Godlike. I would call it a parody in this film since the movie is based on historical events that actually happened. A very good way to see some of the films flaws.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw this movie, it gave me nightmares for weeks. It had the most evil, evil looking people, and the scariest faces I have ever seen in a horror movie. I just saw this because it was free and I really did not want to pay for it. I am so glad I did.   There is some good ideas here, and some scary, dark ideas. The plot is a little contrived, but it is a good idea. I really do not understand how this film has any stars and no real bad reviews. I was not too crazy about it, but for $4 I will give it a shot.  : A group of high school kids go out on a camping trip that turns into a nightmare of terror. They get trapped in the woods after a tragic mishap involving a giant rock. One of the boys who went missing is found and the film is about them trying to survive their terrible fate. There is some nice character development in this one. I like the character of the boy who is supposed to be killed, but he manages to get away and goes on to live a normal life. I did not find the ending to be very satisfactory, but then again, it is supposed be a horror film so it was nothing new. It is very well put together, but there is nothing special about this film. The effects are mediocre and it is hard to watch. The film is worth seeing if you have a few extra dollars to burn and are willing to spend a little time in your driveway in the dark. That is about all I can say.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********************* *************** What is this movie about? Well, there's nothing wrong with that, but it is not as great as you would think. It's not as well-done as your average vampire film, it is more action-packed than I am going to say, and it is a very confusing movie for the most part. The vampires don't really have names, and the one that is the main character is named 'Gordy', (Yes, he says his name, but I think he actually says 'Gary', or something, and that is just stupid.) He is a vampire, and he also is a bounty hunter. His job is to make himself known as a master of disguise, and to make others recognize the danger he poses. He does it by wearing a cloak, and by pretending to be a normal guy. He doesn't have any powers, he doesn't seem to have any real weaknesses, and, to make matters worse, he's pretty annoying. He has a pet, a little dog, and as well as that he is able to disguise himself as a human, in order to catch thieves, murderers, and other criminals. He is not a very smart vampire. He can be a little stubborn, he likes to steal, he goes on a rampage, and his only saving grace is that he can talk. This, combined with the fact that he has no real weaknesses makes him a tough-to-kill foe. The film starts off with a nice montage of some great scenes of vampire-bashing and a lot of running from the law that is played in a very funny way. Then, there is a bit of a problem. You have a couple of scenes where they show some of the different types of vampire, one is a male, and one is called a 'Slimy' (I have only seen that movie, but you get it,) and then there is Gordeux's 'brother'. The Slimy has no eyes, no mouth, and a long tail that ends in a long, sharp point, and is made up of a long thin, spiky, snake-like tail. The Slimys also have claws on their hands and feet, but most of the things about them are unknown. One interesting thing about the slimy vampires is that they seem to be able to smell blood, even though they don't have noses. It is assumed that their noses are extremely sensitive, and they can smell things as subtle
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I say "horror movie," I mean "bad movie." But that's a slight exaggeration. The movie is about a group of people being attacked in their home at night, and the people that happen to be there have not the slightest clue what's going on or what to do. The director did a good job of not making them look stupid (because they're not stupid), but the "characters" don't give the movie that much of a kick. (Maybe the only thing that will scare you is the fact that the house is built around a hill and you don't want to stand right next to it.) The only "good" part about the movie is the final scene when they finally get up the courage to get out of the house. It's a bit of a drag to watch that, seeing the people who died a horrible death waiting for them. There are a couple scenes in this movie that give you nightmares. (Like the "creepy" music. It wasn't creepy at all, it just looked like what I had heard from all the movies. No matter how "disturbing" it was, it still could have been something really bad. And the last scene, while kind of scary, was far too long.) But it's not a bad flick. It is the kind of movie that was used to scare me (or at least it should have been). This is a cheap horror movie and doesn't really get that "spook factor" at all. But as far as the good low budget, low budget movies go, I say this is a pretty good one. And as a movie about people being tortured and murdered I thought it was okay. It doesn't have the best acting (which is to be expected, because they weren't actors), but it's a pretty effective film in any case.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- I did not like this movie. The story is simple. There is a group of people on a camping trip. One of the young people, Sam, is sick and has to be taken care of in a home that is run by a kindly old man who thinks Sam is his own son. Sam and the others, being sick for different reasons, try to find a way to stay in the village. There's some good ideas, such as the idea to have a 'garden' so that everyone can enjoy themselves without having to worry about food and water. It all works very well and it is entertaining, but the acting is a problem. I am not a big fan of the acting in this movie, the best part of the movie is the scenes where the characters do stupid things like trying to use a fire extinguisher instead of a hand pump or running the electric wire across the campground in the dark. The only acting I liked is where Sam is trying to make a fire on the grill. The rest, not so much. So, if you like a good old fashioned story of a camping holiday in the country. Then, this movie is for you. But, if that's your idea of a good camping holiday then you are in for a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not enthralled when i first saw this movie i thought this is one of the worst movies I have seen   but I can't put it down   It was one of those movies that you can feel so helpless when you watch and it is like you are the puppet on a string and there is not a single thing going right for you. I watched this movie from start to finish so i don't think that is a fair summary   A boy goes to a lake and in a cave in the lake an evil entity has taken the form of a fish and now wants to take over the world so he takes the body of a human being and brings it back to the lake in a boat and puts it in the water he then takes the bodies and goes on a rampage and starts shooting up the lake with the lake life forms. It is then that the human who is the lake is able to use the power in him and takes the form that you and I would have that we are the lake animals and we go on an evil rampage destroying everything we come across and a group of humans and animals save the day.   Unfortunately the human is killed by the beast which is the fish and the beast then comes back to life and starts attacking the humans and the animals as they are trying to keep the beast away. The humans all have their powers in their bodies so they are able to fight the beast and fight him off and get out of the lake and now the lake creatures are scared of this lake life form that they are called fish and they become scared and do not want anything to do with him and now they do not know how to make the beast go away so they put some of the human life forms up the mouth of a giant fish and tell it to go away and he does and they all go back to their normal bodies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is basically nothing but a waste of a few hours. In the beginning of the movie, there are a group of students who are planning to get away from a boring classroom and go on an adventure.   Unfortunately for them, their trip will turn into a nightmare in a few minutes. It is a good story and some of the ideas have a definite basis in reality. It's just a shame that there's nothing of note about the story or that at any point any of the characters have any interesting dialogue.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A few years ago when I first watched The Hunger Games, I was quite excited to see that Jennifer Lawrence is playing Katniss Everdeen. I didn't feel that this will be good for me though. It is so stupid, so over-the-top and I can't even believe they went to the trouble of making such a bad flick as this. I loved that they showed us the Capitol, but that movie is really about The Hunger games. What a lame movie! It didn't even try to have a good ending. The ending of the movie is just a bit too perfect. It should have ended with Katnis being locked up or dead. No, Katnissa is actually supposed to be a good person, but they don't take into account that Katnisson will try and do her best to get her revenge and get her to return to the Capitol... but who's going to believe this girl? She is not a bad person but she's so far gone that she could never get over the Capital's death. I hope the studio didn't use too much makeup in this film. Every time Katnises looks different than the previous movie! Oh the wig is great though! I wish I could have seen this movie before it came out so I could see them better! I guess I'm just disappointed now, but I'm sure that they could have done better. I'm not the only one who hated this flick. There is even a joke that I had to go and look up online for. Oh well I'll keep my mouth shut now!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure how much I liked this movie, I mean I thought it was decent but not great. I mean the guy with the stupid hair was annoying as hell so it's like I'm watching a TV show that's trying to be cool. If you like your movies to be entertaining then give this one a try as it gets better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't want to say it was bad, I really liked it. It had everything, great characters, a nice plot, and very nice directing. The acting was good, but it wasn't really anything to write home about. It was also kind of a downer, as I couldn't help but think that they made the movie for a lot of people, but didn't do a very good job at it. The script was good but there were things which didn't make sense, and you know that the story has to happen, but the execution felt a little strange to me at times. There were some nice moments, however, like when the character of the bad guy would try to kill the hero's father, which was a very effective moment. I'm not sure whether the film was good or bad. The story and action seemed to flow well enough, and I'd have liked the ending a bit better, as it seemed to be a bit rushed in the end.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film a few years ago at a theater in Toronto when it was in Toronto.  My friend and I both loved it.   Well, this is an old film with a modern twist to it.   The story is a bit bizarre, but it was a lot of fun and it gives us an idea of the lifestyle of the old West, which I like.  The characters are interesting.  I will always remember the old west, not only because it was fun and exciting and a lot more interesting than a lot other movies about the West.   I also remember the fact that the character of the gunfighter was quite realistic.  It took me a while to get into the character.  After a couple of scenes, he was easy to relate to.  He had real passion for the Old West and it is all expressed in the film.  All the other western heroes seemed like characters in a western comic.  That is not the case with the Gunfighter.  When he is in a situation, he acts, he seems more like a western warrior than some random gunslinger.   There is also a great amount of dialogue during the movie.  There is some great humor in this film that makes the humor even greater.  I must note that this film was shot over an 11 year period.  One day, the producers decided to remove a part of the film (a great story scene), to create more money (which is often what they do).  The whole scene in question would have been shot over 3 weeks.  This is a film of adventure, and it was worth the time and effort put into it. I would give this a 4 out of 5.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The most fun you'll ever have watching a bad "comedy". I wish I'd had a better brain-computer interface, I would have been able to enjoy myself so much more!!!! Why would I want to like this movie: - You will find this story is hilarious (you're welcome), the acting is fantastic and it's easy to follow...and of course there's a villain who is funny and menacing. - As a final note, this is a really great homage to the old "Gremlins" films. - And the final shot of the movie is absolutely haunting. - The best part of the entire film?  Greta and the kids - who are both in their early 20's. - I am surprised how much this movie has aged (it has a similar atmosphere to "The Breakfast Club") - The soundtrack is absolutely amazing... I wish more bands would use this for their music (I think I could use a more "crisp" soundtrack that might be on the radio or the internet...maybe a little more "rock" on top of that...).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While I really like this movie, I can't give it five stars.   I'm not going to say this is a bad film, but it isn't anything special.  It takes too long to set up what's going to happen, and I found myself thinking, "I've seen this movie before".   There is a really good villain in this one. He's funny, smart, and very likable.  I had a blast watching him kick a bunch of ass.  The dialogue was great.  This was my first "comedic" role that I got to perform in a while.  Posted by Michael Dyer at 2:56 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a nice piece of filmmaking. I'm sure I was probably a little too young when this one was made. The movie is quite possibly my favorite movie that is about the Vietnam War. I didn't really see much about this movie until a friend mentioned it a few months ago. It really is one of the most moving films I've ever seen, it really shows how the war affected families and how kids could die. The acting, acting, the acting, and the acting. There is something about this film that is just pure emotion. I could watch it over and over again in a heartbeat. It's also a very interesting character study, it paints a very complex picture of the war. Even though this film is a little on the preachy side it's still good. 9 out of 10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To say a film made by a French director (who happens to be Jewish) is good is to say a duck gets its just deserts. This film is one of the worst. I really wish the guy didn't even know how to act, he was so wooden he looked like a man who had just stepped from a dumpster. This movie is just bad, and I hope the guy never makes any more, because that's all I can say.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What the fuck was that stupid fucking thing that everyone is calling a remake? I saw it like 2 hours ago. I don't even want to talk about this dumb fucking thing. I mean how the fuck did these people ever think of doing a remake of a movie that's better than the original? I don�t understand why all these people think it's so great that they need to remake a movie they already made 10 years before. It�s like this movie is a cheap cash-in. You don�T need to watch it to know what the original movie was all about or even the remake is not bad, but I don?t know how they thought they could replicate it so perfectly but still be stupid. Like you�re watching a movie where every fucking shot is a close up in front of a big city that's a freaking city. But not a city that we know. I would rather watch that movie in the theater than this stupid movie and that's just my opinion. This movie reminds me of the "Punch and Judy" show where there�s a bunch of people fighting to the death because a guy knocked down a kid who?s in a wheelchair and he has a heart murmur. It also reminds me a lot of that bad "G.I. Joe" cartoon series where they have some bad guy and we have this dumb character who runs and jumps around in the air like crazy. That is NOT how a fight should be. How did all those people think of making a remake when there is a better movie out there and I mean it. Not only is it a dumb remake but a bad remake.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It has no heart at all. It is a disgusting excuse for an action movie. The characters are all awful. It's so bad, even the plot is awful. The bad acting, the bad acting by the cast, and the bad voice over. The worst part about the film are the girls. They are all ugly. And the one that is the most stupid of all is the actress that is in it. She is supposed to play a little girl that is a princess and is supposed all the time to play the princess part. The problem is that she only has two things that can make her a good princess and neither of them are princesses. Her voice, and a few things like the fact that she has a big butt and a tail. And she has her butt in every shot of the movie, and this is something that a real princess doesn't do. No princess would butt in all of the shots! She just has that one big butt that she likes to look at and that is all she does. It also shows that she is a dumb little girl. But that's besides the point. The cast is all just plain horrible. They all have some thing that makes them seem like a complete moron but none of them can do any acting or any acting at all except the worst. It doesn't matter if you like the acting or not. If you are in a movie, you are not going to enjoy the acting in it so much as the badness of it. It was almost as if the writers were trying to show that bad acting is good acting. If they were going to put some good acting, they would have done it in the background. The one thing about the acting that is good is the bad girl. She had all of that badness that you would expect from a bad girl and that's what makes her a little better than the other bad girls, just because she isn't a complete idiot. She just plays the part of a stupid girl that thinks that everything is ok. This movie is a complete and total disaster. If it had been an animated film, then the rating would have been higher than it is now. However, it is an unfilmable film. The people who made it were probably trying to make a little money off of the bad movies like the remake of The Exorcist that they made with the same people that made this movie. It seems that they really
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a film that is nothing more than a very bad piece of work.  There are very little to choose from in the film world and even less interesting actors who can only deliver dull and boring performances.    This is a story about a man who is trying to make it through the week, but his wife is not going to let it happen.  That's right.  They are still married.  I guess you can't make a divorce without cheating on your wife but who wants to start a relationship with someone who won't make any changes in his life, will not change for the better and is in the middle of divorce drama.  A few scenes do the trick as to startle the viewer, but by far there are more scenes that show the poor performance of the lead actor and then some more more scenes where he is not even on screen.  There are even more scenes about his family members which are completely unnecessary and there are some more scenes showing his kids in their diapers, then on to the divorce scene that again should have been edited out.  The wife and children are pretty much treated like second class citizens, the wife in particular seems pretty much incapable of taking care of herself, the film even shows the husband and children living with her mother and her family for a while but she is never on screen at all.  It is a very boring movie that is far and away the most dull and depressing movie I have seen since The Lord of the Rings.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is bad. This movie has been in development hell since the 1990s. The lead actor was replaced in 2000 by the much better Richard Dreyfuss for reasons that are still unknown. He is not good. He does not look good. The rest of the actors in the film do not play their parts. The story line is awful. The director who was supposed to direct the whole film has been replaced by the film's producers. The music in the movie is not very good. This film makes a lot of money. But, it is not worth seeing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like the name says, the movie is all about a young girl who is very sensitive about her physical appearance and wants to take her hair down. She is not allowed by her family. This movie was so bad it made me want to throw up. I cannot take this kind of crap. The acting is so lame. Most of the actresses that are in this movie are the most useless in any movie ever made. Their faces are not real faces. They are all ugly like I would put it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's bad, really bad.   What happened to a man who was the one to invent the light saber?   Now he has been sentenced to be executed because he had created an evil weapon that can kill.  I am not kidding.  In the movie, the protagonist is a poor orphan who has been abandoned by his parents and goes to live with his uncle. He is also a genius with a "smart" side. The uncle (Bobby) makes him make a "souvenir" of his father's death. This is an elaborate ceremony of suicide with a box and a candle. When the boy touches the box he feels terrible pain and he does not want it. He doesn't want to die. When he tells his uncle he can't go on anymore, the uncle decides to keep the boy as his heir in exchange for a "great love" he has never met.  When the uncle gets married, the boy realizes the man is too selfish to marry a beautiful woman, even though he really loves her.  The boy's new uncle is a horrible drunk. He abuses the boy and has his father killed and the boy is forced to join his uncle's gang.  If this movie had been made before 1984, I bet the plot would have been more believable.  It was really cheesy, very obvious that the writers were drunk and did not understand any of the science behind their movies.  My favorite part about the movie is the opening with the "great" kiss. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a little disappointed in this film because despite the fact that it has some really nice ideas, it just didn't do the job.  You have a lot of characters in this movie, and while they all are sort of similar in character types (although some of them are better than others), none of them really get to do anything.  I'm not quite sure what to make of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________ A decent horror movie, with some good scares. _________________________________________________ Watch for that classic scene with the man getting electrocuted.    I love the idea of having that creepy, empty house, with nothing inside.  The movie is very good and I liked it a lot.  It's not as good as I thought it was going to be, but I like it.   Rated: 4 out of 5 by ajk_dennis from Nice little horror flick. Great cast.  I saw this on a movie channel while I was at a restaurant. I didn't notice anything strange about it. Then when the waiter was being attacked by a giant spider (an action movie staple at this point), I said to my girlfriend "I'll be out in a bit." I didn�t even see the spider when I left. I thought "I'm just going to wait for my friend to come home and take care of the spider." So I went and sat down at another table with some friends. There's another guy there with the same girlfriend I was with. He's pretty much just there waiting for the spider to show up. So I sat there and waited a few minutes and when I looked back I saw the guy with the girlfriend walk away slowly. Not so fast.  He's holding his stomach. Then I heard the screams of my friends and saw the spider just walk to the right and then a good 30 feet to the left.  My friends didn't even try to move. They were frozen stiff as statues.  Then I walked over to the guy who was still hanging from the ceiling. I grabbed him by the ankles and I told him to be more careful about moving around. He was saying "What is it? What is this? What are you doing?"  It was a bit scary but I think I would have been okay if my friends hadn't been so frozen stiff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The worst film I have ever watched by a long shot. I guess the first 30-45 mins are good as the baddies are being brought to justice, but then as the plot starts to take it's own path... there is no plot. So no plot, no plot... it just goes on for 90 minutes about as much fun as a piece of paper with a pencil on it. The whole thing is a mess and the only person who is entertaining is the director. A terrible piece of work that should be banned or at the very least, edited down.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a fun time for the little people. The story is simple enough, but the characters are really good! The art is great. The music is very enjoyable and fits the picture exactly. What more could you ask for in a time of peace? I like that this was made in 1971, but I'd imagine most of the kids of the 80's are more than glad to be out of bed. I did enjoy the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very good old school film about one of the most infamous serial killers in history, Ed Gein. Ed himself has not aged at all over his fifty years, as it's said he is still looking for love and a woman to marry and raise a family with. He has a young wife called Marie and a little boy named George. A few years before he murdered the nine other young women, Gein was hired to take care of a stray cat for its owner, George. Gein did not really like the cat, he was afraid to get to know him, but when the man took the cat away, it found him. Geing and his wife went to see the cat the next day to take it home. Instead of the usual house cleaning they did a little dinner. Geis was very happy about his new friend, George, and the two went for a long ride on George's motorbike. In their excitement they stopped in a field where a car was parked. George decided it was his chance to kill the gein and he drove off. At the time the cat was not seen and George decided to go back home and look for it again. Geins wife, Marie was not home and he was quite confused. At around 4 o'clock in the morning, the couple walked to the door. They were caught by the police, and a search was made to see who was in that car and how they got into it. It turned out to be George's wife and daughter. When George was arrested, he informed them the car was his and when it happened the night before it happened he just got the idea to take Marie and get the cat. When a detective arrived, he started to laugh. The next day George asked his wife to look for the cat and she was a perfect detective and found the cat in the same field. Geinning told his wife it would not be difficult to catch George and she did. She found him and took him to jail. As she left, she saw George's gun lying near the door and ran off crying. He then killed himself.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First of all, the special effects in this film are horrible.   This is actually the sequel to the 1978 classic.  It makes me mad when I hear that the special edition costs like $8 and the original $10.  I would have never paid for the special version!   But, that's just my opinion. I don't care if they have new special effects, it just is just not worth the money.  The best part about this film is a talking dog that is voiced by the original creator of the Muppets, Jim Henson.  He makes his appearance in the middle of a fight between the evil Emperor and his henchman.  The henchmen just come into the castle looking for the emperor but they miss the dog.  As he is chasing after the evil hench men he finds out that they are after his family.  This brings us back to our characters... Emperor, his henches, his son, his sister and his dog. There is some good jokes in this movie and you can really relate to the characters.  There is not a great amount of laughs but it was funny at times and there is a great score by Bernard Hermann.  For a sequel to a well known movie it still stands out as a classic. If you like Muppys then this is one to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoy this.  It's an oddball piece with a nice cast and a silly premise.  But I can't stand it.  I just don't like it. I liked the concept, but it never made sense to me, and there isn't a single funny line to be found in this movie.  There was a funny line near the end though, which was that of the warden, and then that of Mr. Tannen:  'There is no justice in life!  The only thing is to make the other side suffer so that you can reap the benefits.'   The other side is the inmates.   These prisoners of society have to be kept in check, and they do so in the most brutal ways imaginable.  While the wendigo is a fictional creature in a fairytale, it does a terrific job of illustrating the evil that man does to himself and to society.  A film that I would recommend to anyone who loves movies with great action sequences.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was looking forward to this movie. It's pretty funny at times, but it seems to be missing something. I mean the character is a clown who's trying to escape, he's supposed to be doing his funny stuff like saying stupid stuff, but the movie just doesn't seem to be going anywhere. So the clown is going down the rabbit hole and he ends up in this place, and I wasn't a fan of what happened to this clown. It was like watching a bad episode of a bad sketch comedy show that isn't that funny. If you're a clown with a sense of humor, then you might enjoy it, but if you're not a clown then I don't know if it would be for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is boring.  I do like the idea of getting into the past, but I really don't get why we're doing it, we are only told about an assassination plot by an old woman.  The only thing I liked about the movie was the end credits.  There was something about seeing it in this movie that reminded me of the beginning of The Silence Of The Lambs.  The movie did not have the heart that I'd like to see in a mystery series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ It's a typical story. The protagonist is a nice guy that loves his wife and daughter. He is a very responsible man. He has a hard time keeping it up with his friends who are all so busy playing pool and drinking beer. The girls are all like little girls. They play and laugh all the time. But one night he catches his wife cheating and tries to get rid of her. After a long period of time the wife is ready to leave and he decides to go to the motel to see if anyone is there to take her place. In the motel the wife tries to find a man. One of the guys in the motel has a crush on the wife. The other guys in town make it harder. But he ends up making her jealous and she ends up taking a chance and leaving town. Now this is where I have a problem. I felt that they could have ended the movie a little bit sooner. When you are so late in the movie it could have been a little easier on the audience and they could start off with the guy and the wife and be out of the way in no time. They don't even bother to get out the other guys. The movie could have played out a little more. It could have started with the wife in town and the guy in the mall. It would have been fun and they still wouldn't be out. ______________________________ Get a free movie ticket to see what they call a "Hilarious Movie:  __________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The problem:   -The entire plot is a bit of a mess: first, an evil man kidnaps an innocent boy called Alex. He is taken to an underwater cave under the sea, where his captor explains that Alex is the key to the ancient ruins. The only thing that is missing is his heart. He then proceeds to brutally murder the children in a very creative way. This goes on for some time, when Alex is kidnapped for the second time. Eventually, he is rescued by a group of pirates who tell him that the only way to bring Alex's heart back is to set a treasure chest in a certain place...and then some random people decide that they have seen a treasure map with the chest. However, they are led by a man called Alex, who is not very happy about this.   Then things start to get a bit confusing, especially when you find out that he is being controlled by some bad guys in a ship, who have a lot more money than they should, and who are actually planning to take over the world!   Anyway, Alex has an absolutely brilliant plan to solve this problem: he has a group called "Babylon", who are good at solving puzzles. They all live in a huge spaceship called the "Valkyries" and they go around the world, collecting money and destroying the bad guys. The good guys are called "the Order" and the bad ones are called the Renegades. When the bad characters from Babylon decide to go to a town called "The Island", they are greeted by "The Renegades", who make a huge fuss about being taken prisoner by Babylon, when actually all they are doing is stealing money.   to make things even more confusing, Alex's mother (who is actually a super-heroine called "Pantheon") is also being controlled and can't remember everything that has happened: she even falls in love with the bad guy from Babylon named "Fog", who is a very evil guy, but she just doesn't know what she likes! Then, Alex makes up a whole story and makes himself the leader of a group who are going to go up against the evil Babylonians, but then a bunch of other bad guys break them up. Now, Alex is leading "Babel" to destroy Babylon, but he is unable to use all the tricks of the game (and they don't look that complicated to begin with). But, somehow, the bad people manage
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got a bad deal for this one. At first glance, this movie seemed like it could be one of those classic comedies that are so popular at this time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't believe this movie is worth the time or the price. I will be reviewing it on the next page!   What more do you need to know about the film? It is about a woman named Betty who is trapped in an elevator with a man who is the killer. She is raped and then the killer kills himself, leaving the elevator running for hours after. The problem with this movie. First I do not understand why a studio would produce this. Betty is not given a chance to find out who the killer is, why she is in his elevator and who she is with when she gets out. When he tries to get her out he does the exact same thing over and over and it takes him so much effort to get the elevator to run that I guess it is like he is trying to kill her. This movie just does not have the brains to be very original in the first place.   This movie will not work for anyone. It is all about suspense and suspense is not really a problem in this movie if you understand the genre.  I am not a huge fan of horror movies but this is just so bad I do a double take.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad idea, a bad film, a stupid, ridiculous movie. The title "Starring Mickey Rourke, Tim Robbins, and Dennis Quaid" implies it is a film about a group of bad guys, but the idea is not clever. It has no concept of the film and no idea what it wants to be. The movie is a disaster, and is more of a story that can be found in a bad soap opera rather than a movie of quality. The acting is terrible. It is a farce about a film which has no idea of what it is, what it should be and what it was intended to do. Tim Robbins is a pretty good actor, but there is no idea where to go with him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is a retelling of the events surrounding the "Night of the Living Dead" and "Shivers". The zombie films are a dime a dozen here but I don't see any of the original movies doing this well. A very simple story that only has the zombie in the background of things. This is very much like "The Hills Have Eyes" except that the zombies have a better sense of direction. The action is good with a couple of very good special effects but there are several scenes that go on much longer than they need to. It's a pretty simple story but I still find myself surprised by the lack of blood and gore.  Grade - B

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ This film is so incredibly bad it may be a crime to ever have seen it. As a viewer you are simply a cog in a machine and must passively accept the awful jokes that seem to come out at random. It is also the first film I've ever seen in which a child is played by a child. There's a child at play, and when she gets hurt the child in question asks how she got hurt, and it's implied that it is because she said the wrong thing. This child was a six year old girl, and although she is still a child she was played by the same child she once was. The poor actor's range is almost nonexistent. I have seen this film several times and still am not surprised by anything the screenwriter puts on screen. As an actor (I am a professional and a very good one) I can only wonder if the film is a comedy written to show how bad things can get for the good people if they become too good. It's really a movie about a small town with a couple of sad, sad characters, and a whole bunch of kids playing together. That is about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a shame. This movie could have been great. It just seems so very rushed to me. At one point, there's a little bit of background noise. Then it becomes clear what's going to happen and the movie suddenly goes into slow motion. I don't know why I would have thought that this would be a good movie. This is bad science fiction movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The last fifteen minutes of the movie, in which the main character gets shot by a guy who is trying to steal her money, was a masterpiece. I don't think a bad idea could be worse, and yet the execution of the final act, with all its cheap shots and jump scares, is so bad that there is no redeeming quality at all.   The next few parts of the story are filled with more jump scares and a number of scenes I cannot possibly describe. But the most terrible part of the film is the ending, where it seems that the main antagonist is going to be executed. The camera zooms in, there is a close-up of his body and then he jumps in front of the camera!  After the movie ends, you will find yourself wondering what just happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a "poor" movie and a "shameful" movie.   The acting is pretty bad, they all try so hard to imitate the "action" scenes, they don't know what they're doing.  It's not very exciting, and it's not even very realistic.  The main problem in the movie is the lack of a story; there are some great shots of ships getting shot down, but they don�t add anything to the story.  You just follow the pilots as they fly their attack, then, of course, crash into each other, then they go to a planet, and if you�re a fan of space combat, then you�ll love this movie.   1 star. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is like a bad film can be a good one, there is one good thing about this film: __________________________________________________________ So the guy I described as a crazy man who has the power to summon a giant black hole.  So what is he doing in a black hole at first?  Well he finds a little girl and makes her his bride, which he does to get rid of her and get his revenge on the guy that stole his daughter from him.    This girl is so perfect that she is one of the most perfect movie stars.  It takes a while to figure out that this girl needs help from another person to save her from the guy, the person who is trying to get her to love him. The only person in the movie who really knows this girl is the old man, he never gives up and is really brave too.  I think this is a really good movie, the guy has the powers of a blackhole so he can take his enemies to the dark side, and he also has a little black hole girl who helps him on a few occasions.  The only problem is that this movie is too long and there is never any end in sight.  However I give this movie a 7.5 out of 10
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************************ My friends and I went on a trip to New Orleans in the early 80's. We were young, broke, and hung over and the only way to escape our misery was to go out with a group of degenerates. I remember the two young guys from out-of-town that lived in a big motel off of the freeway. I've always remembered their names, even now as a young man. I can't remember the hotel name either, but they called it the Big House or something like that. The motel was in the middle of nowhere, about a mile away from the highway and it didn't seem like it was very famous for anything at all. At least, I don't remember any kind of action happening. We all went out for a night of partying, a typical New Orleans affair. We walked around drinking and eating, hanging around with some of the guys that stayed there. They talked for a while and started throwing darts at the other guys and then a couple of them were kind of rowdy and started to make a scene. The bartender came out, started yelling and screaming at us, "You can't do this, you need to get out of here!" The bartender was a local and had a reputation for being a very good bartender. The room was about 8 by 10 and there were four of us, myself being the lone guy. He was in for about three nights before the police showed up and we were thrown out. We didn't really know what had happened, we thought maybe the cops had found the two guys or some other stupid shit. I guess it was only later that we realized we had gotten fucked. We had just gotten drunk and gone to our room when the bartender came down and slammed the door and the toilet, leaving only a light that had the door on, and the light bulb was on in the bathroom. All of the lights, the toilet and the bathroom were all dark, you could barely see through to the other side. There was no water in the toilet either. I could only use the light to make out a little. We waited to see if the cops came to arrest us, but nothing happened. The police came in and took away the lightbulb, the water was still running and there was no one to answer the door. We just sat there in the dark trying to get the feeling out of our brains to call a taxi, because we couldn't get any money out of that damn motel room. We got
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is very good, but it is very bad. You can't expect great performances from the cast, who, if anything, are in very over-played parts of the film. A few scenes are very good. The story about a man in the military who goes crazy after the death of a comrade is so farfetched that I was not even trying to remember it. I guess it is supposed to make us care about the character, but no. The rest of the movie is just awful, as bad as bad can get in this case. The performances are all very bad, and the screenplay just gives them no hope of redeeming themselves. The whole thing could have ended the way it was supposed to, by showing us some kind of ending. It would have made this one of the better bad movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You may think this is a very funny movie (if there really is a joke here). There are a lot of jokes in this movie about people with big heads and all that, and the way these people have big heads is the reason they all got the same name: "Stinkhead". If you think there is any way you can keep the movie going until it ends, you are not going to find out. Even with it having this many bad jokes, it does not make the movie funny. Instead there are a couple of really bad scenes, like the girl who is about to get out of the shower and she looks like she is coming out of a puddle. The guy who is giving the shower to the girl in this picture is so much like some kind of weirdo that you will not feel any laugh in this. When the shower guy is asking the girl how her bathing suits are the first thing out of her mouth is "I like mine with a hole in them," and he laughs at her, then proceeds to laugh hysterically at some other parts. What makes this a bad joke is not only the horrible acting (and poor acting is bad even in comedy), but the terrible dialogue. If I had to be honest, one of the funniest parts of the movie was when the shower is coming down and the guy in the shower (I think it is a guy) has a hard time putting a towel over the shower head. The next line he says, "Look at it... it's big." If you are thinking about buying this movie, you will be disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________ I've loved almost every bad movie I have seen. But this one? Really? How can a movie about a bunch of drunk, clueless people get a PG-13 rating from the MPAA and an R rating from E? I don't even think the movie was that bad. But it was definitely made by someone who isn't very good at anything else and has no taste for writing. The story of an out-of-work guy named Jim (the most boring protagonist I've ever seen) who has a one-night stand with the wife of his boss. So of course he ends up in her bathroom, having sex with her right in front of her husband. After the scene, he goes to her bed and takes out the trash, not taking the trash out of her toilet bowl and all the garbage cans in the bathroom on his way out. He then goes home, has a long, boring dinner, then goes to bed. And then he has sex. Oh, and it is a good scene, too. Not a bad scene but certainly one with a lot of bad ideas, bad writing and lots of "Oh my God!" The idea that some stupid garbage cans can turn men into women is one that is so far beyond absurdity it's laughable. It's no wonder a guy like Jim can't find work and go on a bender all night, getting drunk and having sex in a bathroom! It's all so stupid it's hilarious, and even if the MPA ratings don't let this film in, it's probably not going to get an NC-17 or an NC for language. This was a real, live-action, slapstick, stupid comedy, without a single redeeming quality at all, just as if the filmmakers didn't give a damn about making a good movie. I'm just glad I didn't pay anything to see this thing. I was a little disappointed in the fact that I got nothing out of this movie for my money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ I've seen so many bad movies in the past few years that it is hard for me to remember which one is most awful. "The Devil's Rejects" doesn't really qualify as a bad film. I'm sure there are many more awful, cheap, stupid and offensive movies out there. "Devil Reject's" main fault is the fact that it takes two very different movies and tries to mash them together so that all of the bad elements from each movie are thrown into the blender. To be honest, I didn't see either movie until about a week ago. I just finished both of them and thought both were pretty bad. I would give these two movies a C- for the acting in each movie. Some of the voices were awful and some just were not there. For example, in the movie "The Reject", Jeff Foxworthy is in one scene and the rest of the film is just one long "Let's See" scene with him. In the movie, "Devils Reject" is another story about a guy named Robert who is really into demons and trying to figure out why he has this demon living with him and why it has some weird habits and stuff. The main problem with these movies is they take two very divergent movies and try to make them somehow equal or even better. The movie "Devilt's" has a lot of really great music and it is very fun. I guess I just thought it was very silly but there are a few very funny jokes in there. The other problem with "Devilds" is that Robert's character was the best part of the movie and I hated his character. All of the stuff he did, the sex, the drugs, the weird behavior was just silly. This guy should have been in prison, but he gets off all of it with his demons and demons with the power of love. This is just too far out of the realm of possibilities. I really didn't like these movies at all. I've watched far more good movies than bad ones and "Devilts" is one of the worst. I actually wish I hadn't seen it at all! I can't say much about "Devile Rejectes" or "The Deje" since I never really watched the show "Buffy the Vampire Slayer". I am really interested to see how the film does on the box set since they will be selling it on DVD but I hope they don't do a bad

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an ugly, cheesy, and poorly acted slasher film that was supposed to be a sequel to a cheesy slasher movie a few years ago, but the remake never came about, so instead of re-re-releasing the old one, director David Carradine decided to put his own version of the movie on film and we are pretty much in for a disappointment. The film features a bunch of different'students' going on a camping trip to a cabin in the mountains and they are just kind of goofing around and drinking, talking, and partying, until a strange girl named Nancy shows up. Nancy is a big, fat slob and she keeps walking around carrying her big dog around like it is a small animal. So the kids start to do whatever to get rid of her but eventually all of their attempts backfire and she starts attacking them. The worst part about this movie is the dialogue, in this film one of the students mentions his 'girlfriend'. If you are a big fan of the slasher genre then I suppose you would probably be happy with the performances and effects here, but don't expect much, the actors all play the same generic roles without any development and the camera work is absolutely horrible. I found this movie to be pretty funny and fun to watch, but I just can't recommend it to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie is a film with a terrible plot and character, not to mention it is a bad film that is made all the more terrible by its own flaws. The film's premise is a girl whose boyfriend is trying to kill himself in an elevator shaft. The girl and her friend try to get to the top of the elevator, but are turned away at the top as the elevator is flooded by water.   However, a water-filled elevator shaft is much more interesting and atmospheric than any kind of action or plot.  The action sequences are completely lame.    This film should never have been made, for the reasons below.  The worst thing about this film is its plot. The story is completely ridiculous: A girl and a guy in an apartment.  Then, a girl who has a bad boyfriend.  The guy wants to kill her, but there is a water tank above her.  Eventually the girl escapes the water tank and her friends try to go rescue her. But as we see in the film, the water-level in the elevator shaft doesn't go down to a lower level.  It remains at the same level.   As we learn in the movie, this whole plot has little to do with anything and it is very silly.  And yet, the movie manages to be worse than that.  What really bothered me was how this movie went completely downhill from a bad start. The movie doesn't even start with any dialogue at all.  We first hear a door slam and then the movie gets worse.  This is not even the first film the movie made worse. Another film with this same plot and no action is made later.  I do not even know what the hell a door-slamming is supposed to be about.  A movie needs a good beginning.  If the movie had a good and original plot, it would have been a decent movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had never heard of the movie until after I watched it in a small independent theater with a couple friends. It was one of those movies that was really well done but felt so phony. I think it was written and filmed with a cheap set-up to be able to have some fun.   In a small town in rural Pennsylvania (one of those rural towns that aren't actually very rural), there is a small fishing business run by a small, fat, old fisherman named George (Edmond Fierstein) who's about as uneducated as he is fat. One day (one would assume) he gets a call from a young girl named Maggie (Margaret Cho) to come on board for a fishing trip to a small river in New York. Maggie has no family or friends, but her father is an excellent fisherman and a really nice guy. So George comes with no problem.   a few days into the trip (on Friday night), George's wife Mary (Mary McDonnell) passes out drunk (on Thursday night), his son Billy (Tom Sizemore) gets into a car accident that leaves him in a coma (on Monday night), and his daughter Lizzie (Ki Hong Lee) breaks her arm and has to be taken to a hospital for a few weeks (on Tuesday). It seems like life is pretty easy in the town of Saugerties, Pennsylvania. But a series of weird, violent events are about to rock the town.   of course they're going to start with the death. In an attempt to impress Maggie, George has set up a little fishing resort. His friends and family are not very impressed and so George starts to get into a bit of a conflict with one of his best friends, "Lucky" (Steve Buscemi) who had been his best friend in school (which is to say they hated each other). Lucky's younger sister, Beth (Kathryn Hahn), the daughter of an old, wealthy couple, is very attractive but also very intelligent. Beth and Beth's brother, Pete (Chris O'Donnell), a young, handsome guy, are not afraid to get down and dirty when their brother isn't around. The problem is that the town, Lumberton, the county, and a lot of the local people are all going to be extremely jealous, and because George is the most beautiful, intelligent, and rich, all the other attractive girls want to date him. Plus,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I've seen in my life. There is no way this is the best movie I will ever see. The story line is lame and the actors are not in good enough shape. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Not a bad idea for a film: It looks like a simple idea: Why not just give the character the best plot ever? Well I will tell you why. After seeing this movie I was left with the impression that this movie is a poorly made, poorly edited, and poorly written movie which could've benefited from some direction. The first half of the movie is just bad and boring, there are hardly any great lines and I found myself having to search for words and words to describe every action that happens and what the character is thinking. The movie is slow and boring to the point that we are just waiting for the action to start, and every action is exactly the same. The only time that there is a change is when there is an explosion and some people jump out but that's pretty much it. By the way, if this movie was a book I would've given it a 6 star.   The second half of movie, which is a direct continuation of the story (which doesn't even have a beginning and an ending) gets even worse. The film starts out great with the character in some strange world where she becomes the Queen of the World. Well, I can tell you right now: this is a complete and utter joke. The Queen does not have any authority over anything and is not even a person. She has no emotions, and her character is not likeable at all. She is just a person that is just there. It is sad that the creators wanted to go with such a bad premise and it is even sadder that it worked.   the plot of the second half is still bad, but at least it has some potential to grow. There are a few scenes that do keep the viewer from giving up and it gets a bit better with the ending.  , but as I said before this is just so bad that even a 6 or 7 star movie is not good enough to warrant giving this an 8/10: It's not just bad, it's mediocre bad. I don't know what the story was before this, but I'm assuming that it was something good (which it probably was), and I'm not sure how they were able to make it worse, but the ending does make me question why this is even a movie at all, and I am not really sure if I have found the answer yet, so I guess I will just leave this review unfinished. I do have to say that I am surprised that this was in some theaters
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an abysmal, boring, boring movie and that's my only word for it. The movie follows a young boy (who looks just like the author) who has recently lost his mother. He has just moved to this little town called 'Greenwood,' which looks like a small town, but is much more than it appears on the outside. When he visits a farm that his family owned, his son, Michael, asks him to help him with a painting that is stuck to the walls of a house that belongs to his mother's family. He helps with the job by going around and using various tools to make the picture come to life and he makes the picture talk! That's pretty much it. There is nothing else to it. It has no heart, no feeling, no substance to it, so I guess that's pretty obvious when you look at the movie. That's because it has absolutely nothing going on. It was clearly written for children and is completely devoid of anything that a mature audience can appreciate. It's a film that has no message. The only emotion it seems to have comes from the kid in the story and that is all that the movie has to offer. The rest of it seems as if it's there to give a good laugh but really the only way it could have succeeded would have been with the help of some kind of voice acting and effects. Not to mention that the acting throughout is very wooden. There's no emotion coming through to give the character any sense of humanity or life and when the movie actually tries to make a point, it feels like it's being dragged out by the filmmakers so it'll be more entertaining for kids. I can't give this a negative rating, but you shouldn't bother watching it.     4.7/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that has the potential to be a really amazing and entertaining sci-fi adventure, but it turns out to be nothing more than a mediocre sci-fantasy movie.  That is, at least, my take on it.    One of the main characters, a man who goes on a journey to search for a planet where his people once lived is really interesting, and the story's premise sounds a whole lot more intriguing than it does in real life (although the story is interesting nonetheless).   However, the story starts to become tedious a few scenes in, with the two main characters having no real purpose or character development, the plot and its twists are very predictable (I even managed to figure out the twist when watching), the humor is mostly cliched, the music is uninspired, and most importantly, all of the characters are simply uninteresting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this film boring, and I found it incredibly dull. I can not tell you why, but I simply thought it would be a silly film.  In this film (called A Bug's Life ), we have a bunch of little bugs on a spaceship (yes, a spaceship) that crash land on the small town of Bug. The main character, Mr. Bug, is played by the amazingly gifted and charismatic Bill Cosby, and the movie takes off with a goofy, very silly, very stupid scene. You know that scene. It is one of the most ridiculous sequences in a long time. The Bugs are all very happy about the end of the world. When they land, they discover that the world of Bug is very different from theirs. The town is small, the inhabitants are small, and the Bug's have been given only one wish, that of staying in the Bug hole forever. What makes the movie even more stupid is that the town has some kind of "Bug Bug's House", and Mr. Bugs goes there. The rest of the story proceeds like this for quite a while. All the Bugs go to Mr. Bit's house (which is a giant house) and talk about Mr. B's dreams and aspirations. Then, when the Bugs come down from the tree house, the little girls (they are all about 2 years old) have a party in the house. When Mr. Bits wife comes down from her tree house (another giant tree house) she tells the girls to tell the Bugs that they are going to make them cookies in the cookie factory. Well, what do you know? They do it! A few minutes later, everyone finds that they have cookies in their hands! Mr. Bloggs wife was going to send them off to some other planet, but she forgot to get a cookie factory and has to leave them here. (Oh, the things I have missed out on.)      The movie ends with Mr. Bog's wife going inside the Bug house (I believe he was on vacation) to get something she forgot. She takes the cookies out to the Bug Bug's house, gets to the door, and it turns out to be locked. After looking around all night long, she manages to open the door by smashing it with her head, just to get to the cookies she loves so much, and in doing so, gets the bugs to come out of the hole too, just in time to see that the cookies are rotten!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For years I've wished I'd had a chance to see this movie at a theater where you can actually see a good movie.  I love the art and stories of this story line and the fact that there's a lot of violence and sex. I'm not a big fan of zombies, but zombies in general are one of the most entertaining things I've seen on TV or the movies.   I'm not really sure why it took me so long to see it, it really feels like a movie you want to see and a movie that you will be glad to see.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is really interesting but it only works to cover up how bad the film is in almost every way. The script is absolutely terrible. The only good thing about the movie is the ending where it was really emotional.   If you think the ending is going to be heart breaking, wait till you see the movie. The ending is absolutely ridiculous. There's a man who wants to take his life so he goes and finds a woman and the sex is pretty good. The woman says he's never loved her before and he goes on and on about how he loves her and how he's going to do everything he can to protect her. And so the movie begins, the man goes to take her home, and he walks in and says how terrible her home is, how everything smells bad, it smells like a toilet, and then all of the sudden this man comes into the house and says "how do you feel about me?" And the woman says "of course I love you, I've lived for you for twenty years and your home is the best, I love it, I can't go anywhere else because I know you will protect me," and then of course the man says "I don't mind, I'll protect you from a bad home, I don't need to see that". So the man walks down the stairs and he's wearing a robe so you don't know who he is because he's covering his hair and the man begins to go out to the living room to change into his robe and it's so amazing how this poor woman goes out to get changed and then the man comes back in the house wearing only a robe and he says "my name is Jesus". So you start to think, "how is the woman going to get dressed again?" And then the woman doesn't answer, she's not dressed. She's just lying on the couch with her legs up and her face buried in the cushions and then you realize how silly she is because she's just a silly old woman sitting in her chair with her arms crossed over her chest and it was a really dumb movie. It was the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this and there was little to like about it.  It starts off with an awful girl (who does nothing but cry and complain about the bad things she sees and does) getting kidnapped, and we're in for a real nightmare... This is what happens: She is taken to a secret underground prison.  There she is abused and raped, as is the case with most of the other female prisoners.   One of these prisoners is the daughter of a very wealthy and powerful man.  She's pretty and innocent (a few baddies seem to have forgotten that).  She is then taken and raped by a few of the men in the prison, and she eventually runs out into the open.  Her kidnapper has been watching her and knows she's pregnant.  What does he do?  He throws her into a river and she drowns (or drowns herself, she doesn't say, which may make this sound less horrible).    Her only hope of survival is to find a child with "magic" powers and make love to that child.  I mean, he seems like a good guy, doesn't he?  What kind of mind, you ask?  You think that one of those guys who hangs around women who have been raped and abused is going to turn out to be the "baby-making god?"   It's all wrong.  It's the sort of evil that is so repugnant that even a man is disgusted by it.  You couldn't make it up, and you shouldn't make the whole movie worse because you want to get off.  But what makes it so hard to watch is how awful some of the people are.  One of the guards, who gets the best part in this movie, is so mean and cruel that he makes the rape scene with the child seem like a walk in the park.   Even worse is the fact that she, at least the baby, is a girl and, of course, the men treat her like a "thing" instead of a human being with the same feelings and needs as a man would (although apparently they do have a good time with her as they "bitch" and play with her "boobs").  I don't like to be harsh, but it's hard to take in something this repulsive.  Another thing that should make it even more painful to watch are the scenes with the other prisoners.  One of them takes
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first movie in the  Star Wars: Clone Wars Trilogy is a very poor, uninspired, badly written film that really is a big let down, but as expected with this franchise, the second movie is even worse.   I didn't like it at all.  The story revolves around a group of clones who don't want to fight the droids anymore because the war has ended and the battle is over, and also because their leader, Anakin Skywalker (Anakin, we are meant to think), is a complete asshole.  Even if I never liked his character because he always acts like an infant, I thought this movie was a big waste of time.  First of all, the plot is poorly thought out, the fact that a clone army was created by the Senate and has never been used on a real war field is completely irrelevant, so it is no wonder why they are constantly under fire, but most importantly the plot itself is poorly written and poorly done.  It is also poorly acted by the clone forces as well as the bad acting by the leads.  To add to all this, the special effects are bad and terrible; some of them are just awful.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially not to people who have any interest in Star Wars because I don't think you will be able to see anything else out there like this.  I don't believe in the force.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this one for the first time in 1994. When I first heard it there were a lot of reviews saying it was terrible but I thought it was just awful. It is an awful movie, full of cliches, bad dialogue and a stupid ending that just makes no sense. The entire movie is a remake of a popular movie from the 70s called "The Love Bug." It is actually a pretty bad film but the remake made it even worse. I also thought the acting was really bad in this one. My favorite character was the girl who was supposed to be an alien and she never seemed to make any sense in this movie. One of the things that made the movie even worse was that we were never even shown the alien. We just heard her talking about love and how she loves the love bug and she's "the only one he would ever really love." This movie should have been called "Love the Love Bug".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!   This is a movie about a young man named Steve (Jared Leto) who is on a mission to capture a killer of prostitutes, but he has a problem. His ex-wife (Charlize Theron), who used to be his best friend, has taken over the role of a surrogate mother to his son, who she is trying to protect. Now, he needs to capture the bad man before he leaves town. He does not want to kill him or get his son killed as he knows he is not the killer, but instead is trying a different way to stop him: "You see, this man used to work for my daddy in the meat packing plant, and he killed many innocent souls... He is very dangerous to me... you might want to consider yourself lucky, I have two kids to look after."  The movie then goes into a "bad" version of a good-cop/bad-cop routine that I love. It is a film full of suspense and humor, the main character is likeable, and most of the film consists of him trying to keep his cool under the pressure of bad guys. I can't wait to see this movie in the theatre again, and maybe then, I can get to know and like J. Leto again.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ __________________________ Was my first exposure to the idea of a black-themed crime film. That was in 1978. This is not a movie that is great or anything, but if you're in the mood for a good black-oriented crime film, you could do a lot worse. It has all the ingredients you'd need to make a good movie, except none of them are there. It is a well-conceived and well-acted film. Nothing here is wrong and it is very well paced. A great start to a great crime movie franchise. I do like the black crime stories that are done now, but this was way ahead of its time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed the film, and found the actors and actresses to be all that they could be. It's a good movie that I have seen many times, but I'm just tired of all the sequels. It had good special effects and the film did have some great scenes, but it doesn't have the humor and heart that is required for a sequel. I had to skip the credits after the credits were over because I wanted to see who won! I gave it a 6.

The movie was filled with cliches like when it says: "You might get a kick out of watching him kick someone's ass in the street, but you'll never get a lot out of this movie." Yeah, because that's what it's supposed to be about. There are a lot of times you see it's just a couple of kids. The writing wasn't very good though. It was just too much and it wasn't funny at all. I am sure the producer thought he was writing a funny movie, but his lack of comedy was obvious from the beginning. It's hard to tell from the movie, I didn't find this movie funny at first. It has a few great moments, but there was too much cliche's and it just didn't work.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was so tired after the second movie, but the last movie was a total waste of time, with no story, just a bunch of stupid shots, and not a single good scene to be found.   They tried to make their movie sound more epic, but in the end they just made their movie even more boring, they tried so hard to make a fantasy movie, and failed miserably.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie will do exactly what it is trying to do - entertain the kids at Christmas time. All the good things about the movie come through - it is a good story, the characters are funny, the music is great, and it is the best presentation of Rudolph ever, which is a great compliment, because a lot of people who watch Rudolph don't know how he does it, they don't even realize he has magic, so it is an even better Christmas movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******************* "The Man on the Moon" is a fun film. A little more dramatic than the book, but otherwise, it's not a bad film, it has fun action and good humor. Unfortunately, the movie is not a good adaptation of the book as I'd expected it to be. There is a lot more talking than you'd think, and the talking is mostly useless. There are a few moments that are funny, a few that are emotional, but most of the time, "The man on the moon" is just a boring ride for the audience. There's not much else to say about the film, because it is almost unwatchable.

He is a young college student working at a job in a bar. He gets called over for a man who claims he was assaulted and needs to talk to him about it. The man is the boss (I would be interested to see who this is, if I were him) and he needs the man to help him find evidence of a sexual misconduct with a young waitress. The young man is a bit of a wimp and gets out of the man's way as he goes to find the girl in the back room, when he meets the other woman, who is being kept by the boss. We are then shown the other man's side of the story, which is much more graphic. After talking with the waitress, he starts touching her in her underwear. At this point, I was expecting a scene of a woman being groped, not to mention being made to lie down as if her life depended on it. She is then forced to have oral sex from the man on two different occasions. This has little to do with the first woman being raped in front of him but the other two are. The boss doesn't think that anything is going on but the girl is sure the man is going to kill her for talking about it (and of course, that would be the worst thing that's ever happened to a girl!). We are left to wonder when will this go to trial (I know, I know), what is really going on and what are the implications? For one thing, as stated earlier, this film presents the "rape culture" as a normal problem that is easily rectified through a good conversation. However, if the girl who was forced to give oral sex had had a penis, maybe she would not have been the way she is. There are many, many ways a woman can get sex
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is about how the only way to have a satisfying orgasm is to keep yourself busy with other things.   Don't go into this movie with an open mind. It's definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you're the type who prefers something a little more dark, more erotic, then you'll probably like this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It takes a little too long for the bad guy to get his just desserts.  They're bad enough on their own.  You're supposed to like this.  I don't like it.  It's a cheap trick done badly.  The plot is stupid, the effects are ugly, and the acting is silly.  Why are they making a sequel?  Why doesn't anyone take them out of here?  It can't get any uglier.  Let the dust settle, people!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this "art film" and was hoping for a good movie that would just tell the story. It was far from the movie I expected, and I think I'll be watching this again in a few years to make sure. It took a while for them to work out how to film it and what to do with the actors, but it works so far. So, I'm not entirely sure what to think of it so far, but I've watched several things like it, and thought they were "fun" but I don't remember feeling the need to check out of the film right after it ended (except for the end where they make me feel something. Like "wow, she went there". It was weird). If you're looking for something that won't give you headaches, is a bit like a comedy (I think the main character is actually a funny man), and has one good joke, check this out!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!! This was just a bad Bollywood flick. I don't think they have any idea what a movie needs at the moment. They really need a good actor in this movie to make it a little more decent. The acting was awful and they just couldn't get the whole movie together. I was expecting a good movie and I was let down.!!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ [BONUS SPOILERS - The plot of the first half has a bit of a problem at the end - it's an early '60's crime drama. The film is made in Hollywood from a script written by one of Hollywood's big names - it was directed by none other than Orson Welles - well if Welles doesn't belong in this category he's pretty darned close.] This is well, another story by a well known writer... but not as good as Citizen Kane, for instance. It has some problems - for instance, it's a little hard to keep your attention while it's running (especially for a story that takes place in London). That said, the story is entertaining - but this is not a picture that I'd recommend to fans of Welles' work or even any Welles movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for a new genre to enjoy, and decided to check out the new zombie movie Zombie World. Unfortunately, the movie was not all it was cracked up to be. The zombies were so over-the-top that it made a movie that is not interesting, even when they are fighting one another. The story was so bad that it was hard to care what was going on for more than a minute or two. The movie was also filmed so poorly, that the camera angles that made the zombies look so much like humans had to be edited out of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really bad film.  The story itself isn't bad, but the story of an old man with a lot of money and a wife who only wants him back is a real pain.    I really hate old people and this is a great example.  The movie is bad, it makes me shake my head and wonder how they ever thought the movie would be a hit.  It is just awful and I couldn't even enjoy the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are moments in this movie where something about the scene is just really hard to watch. I mean it's really hard for me to watch this, like really really hard, and it's just not fun at all.  It's hard to tell with certainty why this isn't funny, because the humor is mostly the bad parts of this movie.  But hey, let's just say that I have a new appreciation of this scene, even though I didn't find it funny at first.   The next scene is when the kids are sitting around.  And then...   And now I'm not sure what to say other than I was really disappointed in this film.  It seems pretty obvious that it is not a joke- and I really wish that if they made a third one, they would not make such an obvious pun in the title.  I've seen this joke before, too, as it is a variation of the "If You Don't Come Down," which I have seen many times before, and I have not been amused in any way since then. I have to admit that I don't find the kids in this one funny at all (except maybe the girl who just can't make up her mind).  It's just so incredibly bad- you might as well just take my advice.  A friend of mine once said that if you want to make a laugh-out-loud funny movie, make it like a family comedy.  To me, it is pretty obvious this movie isn't going to make it to an Oscars.  UPDATE:  I just watched "The Room" again, and now I get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've been dying for an American remake of this masterpiece! It's the '70s, and our hero, a wisecracking Vietnam vet named Johnny Utah, is about to be discharged from the army after a terrible accident. His only chance for redemption comes when a chance encounter with a beautiful blonde waitress named Susan Johnson (Julie Christie) leads to an exciting adventure. What could have been a typical "filler," "comedy" (the film was mostly shot in black and white!) turns out to be a deep, thought-provoking, and hilarious romp through the Vietnam war, and a rare piece of filmmaking by the Academy Award-winning cinematographer George Stevens. A truly wonderful film which is worth watching in order to appreciate Stevens' artistry and the true talent of the American film actor...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a great movie, but a terrible movie at that. There are so many great scenes throughout the film that the characters become the main story. Unfortunately, this story is so bad that the main stories of all of the other characters are overshadowed by the terrible story.  There is a reason this movie is called a bad picture:  The story is a poor excuse to tell a bad story and it's obvious there is no scriptwriter in the picture.   I loved this film and I hope it gets the attention it deserves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I guess that after watching this movie, I don't give a flying fig to Hollywood any more.  Why should that be? It never gave me a bad picture and for a film based on the novel "The Catcher in the Rye" this should be pretty decent but what a mess!  For starters there are a number of very annoying characters in this movie. Some of them were so annoying I just wanted to cut their heads off. I would not pay money for another movie like this, not with a whole bunch of awful characters including a few that are just terrible. I think I am in the minority on that subject because it is the only bad thing about this movie that is worth paying money for. So here is the movie: A small American family moves to New Zealand to live with an old aunt, a rather old lady that is also ill and very deaf (which is one of the things that are supposed to be a selling point of this film). This family is living in such a way that it is a bit difficult to be in contact with them but the reason for this is that the aunt, who is really not that old but is clearly very ill as she refuses to drink any water or talk. Also at one point the sister is missing from home for a few weeks so there is a hint that the whole family is having marital problems. I guess that is a good reason to move to New Zeland! The Aunt becomes increasingly senile (which really is a bad thing that is going to get worse), the father falls in love with the daughter and the younger brother becomes quite annoying so the family is rather lonely (which also is a negative sign as I don' believe that being single is a positive thing) and then there is another bad sign which is that while the Aunt and Aunt's mother may appear very old (she is not) the old woman is clearly getting some help from the doctor. It is here that we learn that the doctors who treat her are not really the best and that while there is no cure, that they can give her something to get by. So the movie goes on for a while as the aunt falls ill and gets worse. In the meantime the family gets used to New York and the little girl is starting to become more independent. The next scene is the aunt being sick again and a bit of a scene with the niece and the father. It seems that things are finally coming to a close with the Aunt (who seems
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've come to the conclusion that "Zombie Ate My Hamster" is a terrible movie. I have no sympathy for a guy who had his hamster eaten by a zombie.   When I saw this I was thinking that the whole movie would be a gag. I was very surprised.  I would have been more surprised by a movie that actually has a plot and story.  The thing that is worse than the hamster being eaten is the fact that we don't see any zombies. We never see anything at all! And the hamsters are just some guy's "friends".  I give this movie only one star for the lack of a plot. That, and the hamstering. I hate to say it but the movie is bad. If it was the first movie you ever saw you probably didn't like it. I'm glad I saw it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an epic film and probably the greatest film in the history of cinema. A perfect blend of comedy and emotional drama. It can't get any better than this. The story begins with a man who has lost all connection with his daughter. She is gone so far in the world that he can't find her no matter how hard he looks. As he travels he comes upon a town that seems like a ghost town at times. After a brief period of time he becomes aware of this fact. He begins to wonder if this is a story of the evil spirits inhabiting the town, or just his own evilness. The film is funny as hell in a fantastic way. The acting is amazing. The screenplay and direction are superb. All the characters have a different mood at different times. The movie is a dreamlike wonder. I've heard of this movie but I never seen it until I went to see it the other night. I never thought I'd get a chance to see this movie and it ended up being one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie is great fun to watch as well as being an important work.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the film was very cheesy. This is a film you will probably watch in one sitting, but it's not as entertaining as it may sound. This film was made in the mid eighties and the acting is very bad. Most of the time the plot is in the background. I had to struggle to remember any of the plot. The director of this film was George C. Scott.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â Not worth the wait! Â There is a lot of hype surrounding this movie, but nothing more than that. Â I have no idea why.  To be honest, I really didn't like this movie.   Â Yes, I know that I am making this movie up as I go along, but I am pretty sure this movie was directed by a bunch of low life scumbags.    No amount of sex appeal will make this movie any better than it already is.  As a matter of fact, I would put this picture in the "unwatchable" category.  I am not sure where the writer is getting these ideas for movies, but for some reason, all of the sex scenes in this movie are very contrived and boring.  What a drag!  Â There are some cute scenes between the actors, but they are just a bit too long and very repetitive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ I had to go back to my parents house in the middle of the night after watching this bad movie. The kids are very poor and are living in a small shack in a canyon in New Mexico. They do this because it is much easier for them to live there then in their own shack. A large bear comes by to their place in the dark of the wee morning and eats two of the chickens they have there (there were no more chickens left). The parents are home very late. They call the sheriff about the bear. They think the bear is attacking a young boy. As they call the sherriff the bear comes to their house. The kid's dog is missing and so is the flashlight. It is a big dark thing with some big claws at the top. They are so scared that they stay in the shack. The sherriffs wife starts to walk around at night without a flashlight. She says that it might not be the bear, or is it someone else? She walks through the woods all night. Finally the sheriff comes to them. When the sheriff starts to search the shack they are so glad that they can see something and even talk to a real person that they don't have to worry about. _________________________________________________________________ _____
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Dirty Harry" is a story about an average guy who finds an opportunity in the criminal life to pay back a favor to his friend and rival, a legendary and vicious killer. He finds that his chances of survival are not so good in the face of a very well-armed band of criminals. Not even an attempt is made at making this a good film, just one of the best.   This movie was written and directed by Sidney Lumet. The first script was written by Arthur Penn, and the third by Joe Gill and Sidney Lumetz.   to read a real good history of the film industry I recommend "The Art of Deception: How Hollywood Exploits the Innocent and the Impressionable" by Robert A. Penn, as well as some reviews of the films by some critics.  .
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ (14 ratings) A few weeks after the release of The Phantom Menace there was a sequel. Now you could see where this was headed: Jar Jar Binks again? What a silly idea that was. The sequel to the very first Jar Jar movie? If only. While there were some amusing elements to the film, there is really nothing special about it. Jar Jar makes a quick and easy entrance in this film and is quickly dispatched by Mace Windu. It seems that Jar Jar was cast as a sort of silly clown and he is, for all intents and purposes, that. That was the best thing that happened to me in this movie: it made me wish there were no Jar Jars in the galaxy. I guess the creators of Star Wars must have liked Jar Jar's antics as much as I did!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like to be picky when I watch a movie. And what I saw was a really terrible movie. I wouldn't even call it bad. It was like watching a really bad movie about a really really bad person. It just made you wonder how a person as bad as him could do things like that. This is just like a TV movie of a TV show about a TV actor playing a TV star. I hope that one day they take a good hard look at it. There is one guy who is supposed to be the bad guy. He is so funny and obnoxious you wonder if it is really him. I guess it can't hurt that this movie was released on Christmas. I thought it was an odd choice.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't waste your time watching this film as a straight-to-video release. It's a terrible movie, a terrible attempt at making a horror film and it's terrible because of those acting, the sound and even the writing. I am sure you know the premise of this film so you will have no problems understanding it, but if you were wondering who the main female lead and why she was so intent on helping a guy and her boyfriend escape from a murderous gang of bikers, then you have come to the wrong film. She is a complete loser. She was supposed to help the guy escape from the gang of motorcycle robbers with her boyfriend and she ends up letting the guy walk away, then helping the guy and the girl to escape from another gang of motorcyclists, only to be captured and raped in front of the boyfriend and dad by a thug. As a horror movie. It doesn't even stand up to the first one I mentioned but with all the other bad things that happened there, it becomes one of the worst movies I've ever seen...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am going to start off by saying that I will never again be able to see a great comedy movie the way it was meant to be.   In my opinion, a comedy with a strong lead character is the ultimate "I wish I was there" movie.  With such a good performance from its lead character.  It would have been a good movie without an ending that is nothing like the original.  The comedy is not funny, the acting is not great, the ending is just wrong, and the movie just drags on and on and never gives us a payoff.  When your done with it it becomes an 80's comedy with no idea of what it is trying to be!   It is unfortunate that all that good potential was wasted in my opinion and there is no redeeming factor for the ending.  I give this a rating of 2.0 out of 5

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In what could have been a great adventure movie, the film takes a major nosedive when the main character (played by Billy Bob Thornton) gets arrested for murder while trying to kill a burglar. While being questioned the police do not show much concern for his victim's life. This leads the police and Thornton to question Thornton in what was a completely unprofessional manner. The first two-thirds of the film is one big chase scene, during which Thornton is constantly being threatened by the cops. It's a total misfire.   I was a fan of Thornton's earlier films, especially Blood Simple (1981) and The Dead Pool (1982). But after that film he became a bit predictable. He does have a few of his old tricks up his sleeve but nothing that sticks out in any way. The script by David Koepp is forgettable, with Thornton trying to out do himself as Thornton does in many of his other films. As for the special effects, they're not spectacular (it's hard to notice when you're looking down at a very short action sequence).   One final comment: this was a movie for the kids. If you were a kid in the 70's or 80's you will appreciate this film. If, like me, you were born before that era, you may not find anything special about it.  : This is a sequel to "The Dead Pool". The character of Denny Green (played brilliantly by Peter Falk) returns to New York. He tries to win the affection of his son (Samuel L. Jackson) but the young boy is busy with a girlfriend and he is far from home. He moves in with his uncle who is a retired policeman.   the action is fairly standard. Thornton and his gang run through the streets and get into all sorts of predicaments. They are all quite memorable.   that character was great. I loved the chemistry between him and James Woods. As always Thornton has a knack for making a character seem real when he talks to him.   in a good action film (and this is a very good one) the hero should be able to carry it. Denny just doesn't stand out.     : It's almost a remake of a film that had come out in 1967 called "The Blue Lagoon". In my mind this is probably the worst of them all. Even with this being a remake, it still is a bad film. The story is also a little silly

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The opening scene is a masterpiece. A guy who likes to take pictures in front of the sea: "This is what the sea looks like during the week." The movie goes into the details of the first sea voyage: The ship, the captain, the crew, and the ocean. Then it jumps to the next scene, "We had to go and look for a goldmine!" The next thing is the first person narration: "There's a treasure chest in the trunk." And of course: "It took about four men to open the chest." The next scene is another first person, this time it is a man who talks to another man: The man: "A gold mine! This is it! This place has a treasure of gold!" The man (we don't know if he's a pirate or not, he's wearing a white mask): "We must go now and dig in the ground." The man, now in another white mask: "You're gonna get hurt!" The other man: (screaming, and running off): "That'll teach you to talk." The other one: "Don't look back!" The movie is good, and this is not a bad thing. But there are problems. There's no story. It's just a bunch of random scenes. The character's names are pretty funny: "Curious" and "Diligent." You can't help but laugh, and it's also a very nice start, but that's about it. There is no character development. No one gets better. Everyone is just more annoying than annoying, and some of them are really annoying. Then there's the ship, which in the first half of the movie is a great vessel, but in the last half of it is really slow. The whole reason for the voyage is to get gold. Well, the ship is a small ship, a wooden sailing ship. It doesn't really seem to be able to get anywhere with it. But it does have a bit of a compass. You don't have to find the gold, but if you do, you can use that to get somewhere else. Of course the ship doesn't have a lot of fuel, and you can only fuel it once every day. So you have to have to make all the stops. Oh, and that's not all! It's only a small, one way sailing ship, so once you decide that you're gonna go to a place, you have only

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only time when I have liked a movie is when I like a movie that is bad or bad for the sake of being bad. That is, I like movies where badness is the purpose rather than badness being a means to an end.   While this film could have been a comedy, it was not, because there were only a limited amount of laughs, the film was not funny, there was only a few bad jokes and the whole thing seemed very rushed and overproduced.   "We're gonna win. Let's go!"  The film started out with a couple of scenes that were good and then, in the final scene of the film, the ending was bad.  The film ended with a cliffhanger, a movie star being kidnapped by a man wearing a clown suit.  When it gets back to the beginning we find the two people that kidnapped the movie star, and the man in the suit, he is actually a demon.  I felt like this film was only good because it was bad, and I feel like its only redeeming factor is that it was a remake of the 1970's children's film "The Blob."  While I had fun with that movie, I don't see how "The Demon" could ever come back around, or be a serious movie.

The story was not really good and it's a shame that Disney didn't find a way to improve it. This film is a really bad, one of a kind piece of crap that should never have been released to the public. It's the kind of film that Disney shouldn't release because it makes it look like the studio wants to take over the whole world and ruin everything. I'm really not a fan of Disney but it's the people behind this film that are really gross and horrible and this movie should not be in the Disney movie library.  You can't tell me people were really trying to bring a smile to everyone's face: The people behind the production should be ashamed.

The only good thing about this movie, aside from that it was a bad film is how many people in the audience laughed. The actors in this film were in the 70's. They were good, but not good enough. The music was bad, and the special effects were horrible. I thought this movie would suck, but it didn't. It was one of those movie that was made to be watched by children, and for that alone, it deserves a bad review.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film was pretty bad. It would probably have been fine for a summer flick, but that's just how the kids are at heart. It was a fun story about a girl with a dream, but it just felt so cliche and clichéd. The only good thing about it is the voice acting, though it is a little bland. I wish they had found a way to spice it up. It isn't one of those films that you watch a few times to find out if you like it. It's not that bad, but definitely not great. (2/5)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I wish all "horror" movies could be this good.   The "cinematic" part of this movie is a lot of fun.  The movie itself is great as well, not that a movie needs any more plot or suspense.  There are plenty of gore scenes though.  It is a "good" movie with a small budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want to see a well put together, but over-the-top action film, get the Japanese version, and be sure to skip the American one. The American one is so far superior. The movie is a parody of the "dare to be cool" culture and its associated subculture. It is a film that is about "cool" Japanese. The main character is a man of his time, a typical "cool Japanese" (for lack of a better term) - in that he was a "cool guy" until he died. He is an "eccentric" who likes to drink sake and ride his motorbike. He gets his motorcycle stolen. A "cool young man" (or girl) rides the bike and saves the day. Cool, but it isn't the end of the film, as the next morning an assassin from another time, named "Yami," arrives at the house to kill the old man. It turns out the old woman he loved has been abducted and is in a mental asylum. The assassins get her back. There is a long, silly fight scene where the old men try to stop the assassins. The old man dies in the process, but his son (also an "old man" like him) is saved by Yami. It was in this movie that I really got into Japanese culture. It's just so fun! The movie ends on a cliffhanger, with a new girl (who is also "cool") on a motorbike and the old "cool man" and Yami fighting a monster.   My opinion - the Japanese one was better, but the Americans version had so much better music! (Oh, and this was in 1986, not 2001!)   I have seen other films by the directors of this film. I liked that one the best. It just so happens that in the Japanese (the American one was in English) film, he plays Yami, the same person he played in the American movie, which was great. This was actually made in 1979 - that was when the Japanese film was made and it is a remake of the Japanese movie of the same name.   "A Cool Japanese Man's Death" was directed by Ryosuke Yamazaki. The plot was a remake in one film of "The Three Musketeers." He also wrote the screenplay for the American version.  . Rating: *** (2/5)
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This movie is just like any other crappy action/romance movie you would come across on Netflix. You have this poor guy (Eddie Redmayne) and this woman who has a really bad case of hubris. She's the one that's going to get captured and she's a beautiful damsel in distress. In the beginning they're having this pretty awesome time together, but after a while she starts having the worst time of her life. The guy (Jack Reynor) isn't good at everything, but is good at making a good fight, and when it comes time to save the damsel, well... ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   I have to say, Eddie Redmayney does a really good job playing this character. It's not exactly a great role by any means, but Redmaynes great performance here works to give the character so much life, and in the movie's end, when the evil overlord realizes that they've captured a girl, he decides to let the damsels capture the evil. That's about as badass as it gets... __________________ The world's a stupid place, but there is a bright side - in movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is set in the mid 20's in the old town of Montford and is the story of a young married couple with a baby girl.   This is a very good couple.  They get along well and the child is well liked by all (including the husband).  This is a family movie that is very well done. The wife is well done and the movie has a nice romance.  The husband is a pretty good actor.   This is an entertaining but slow film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I ever saw in a theater. The characters are all lame and the action is totally out of whack. I don't care for this film at all. I think this is a total waste of time and I think it needs to be removed from your DVD collection. I hope this movie is as bad as its bad reviews say it is and not like this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is a big fat bag of nothing.  In the beginning there is a great big chase scene.    A little woman with a giant teddy bears head runs into a bunch of cops chasing down a guy with a knife.  They don't believe there is going to be any danger and they take it easy on the guy.  One of the cops gets stabbed and dies.  It's over.  The cop who dies is played by one of my favorite actors of all time--Burt Reynolds.  He plays a nice nice cop who is very likable and a nice guy to have around.  I don't remember his name.  But the real action happens as the guy with the knife gets away.  There is a chase scene with the other cops with a truck and a car.  A guy gets shot and killed.  At the end of the chase there is some bad dialogue and a girl that is dead.  Yes she's dead.    Now a guy walks out with a teddy bear, a hatchet, and a sign that says, "Kill!  Kill!  It gets pretty dark as they are trying to stop a guy who is on fire with gasoline.  This is the first movie I have seen with this style of violence.  People got really messed up over this movie.  And I say that as someone who hasn't seen a cop movie in a long time.    I just don't get this movie so don't bother with it.  Rating:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen a movie that looks as bad in person as it does on video.  This movie is terrible and not in a good way. I was so angry I almost threw up when I saw the movie.  For one thing they take the whole movie (that we see) to make us believe that the movie is a movie about a boy that was raped and left alone in the woods. When a few miles away he is taken to the hospital where a lady, she doesn't get his name, and a man, she also doesn't say. (I have a good sense of humour) who takes the boy to the hotel in a truck, and the boy, the lady, and himself get out on a boat, all of them going from place to place.  After a few days, when all of the boys and the girl are all good and well, the boy is being abused by the other boy and they have him for dinner, to make the other child better. The boy, knowing that the girl is not going to go to the restaurant with them and doesn't know who they are and what they are about to do with him, says that his dad has given him a book about a man who was raped in the same place as the boy in this movie and the man got away and the woman who had him gave him a bath. The movie then cuts back to the boat where everyone who got into the boat were there, one was an actress that played a girl.   The thing that is not bad about this movie is that it has a strong message. If you do not believe me (and some of you who don't, go watch it) or even believe that this movie has a point then you need to find a doctor.  I have been to the movies (and I do like them) and this was not one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you don't like it...get lost. I don't mind bad movies at all - a bad story is still a good story, even if some of the characters are terrible (I'll be the first to admit it).   A couple of years ago, when I was starting to think seriously about being a writer (I had always loved stories), I watched this movie. I remember thinking this was a fairly decent movie, though it seemed a bit farfetched at the time.   I really don't recommend this movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hate to do this, but this movie is so bad that it is hard to think I was even watching a bad film. The worst thing I can think of about this movie that I can remember is the main villain being a gay pedophile with a large penis. I remember hearing the line "You like little boys too much", then having one of the children that he kidnaps become a little girl. That line is also quoted and parodied in a song. He also has an annoying voice. I didn't find it funny.   Another thing that really put this movie in my top 10 was a moment when one of his other minions is talking to him about the old lady that he stole the baby from. He says the old woman "hasn't seen a movie in a long time" which is actually a line from a Charlie Chaplin movie. The bad acting was made even worse by the horrible soundtrack.  "I'm a bad man, a bad son, a good man and a good old lady."   The main problem here is that none of the movies really have much plot, so much that the plot points never seem relevant even though they really have a lot. It is so poorly written and the actors seem to have had their roles written for them with no experience and very few lines to work with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie because I thought there was potential for a fun action romp.  I was wrong.  As soon as the movie started I knew it would be a failure. The acting is terrible and the writing is terrible.  All the jokes are lame and the animation just doesn't do it justice. The character designs are horrible too, with a stupid-looking "giant" guy who talks stupid like he has a heart condition, another character who is just as stupid, and the two lead females (I didn't even realize they were supposed to be in the movie until after it ended) are really ugly, especially the one who is always getting groped by a giant guy.  It is hard to watch when all you care about is seeing them get groped.  This movie is really boring, with no humor and absolutely no characters or story to keep you interested, which means that this movie will only drag you along with your brain dead, lifeless eyes.  Don't waste your time with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found myself disappointed in this movie when I saw it for the first time. I don't think it's too much to say that it seems like most of the movie takes place in a hospital and the only character we meet is the moronic nurse who thinks nothing of having a gun with a huge scope strapped on her chest. I was disappointed because the nurse's personality is pretty much what's expected of her. Her actions are ridiculous, for one thing. I would not be surprised to find her sitting on a couch with a gun by her side and ready to shoot. The movie does get some laughs occasionally, but nothing serious. It takes a while for the violence to get underway, however. There are some really bad looking characters who just want to show off. It also takes a bit to get over the first "Oh my god" scene. This movie is a complete waste of your money and time. (review of free movie) Review: Here is one of my favorite movies! I like movies that are not just a typical "drama". If the movie is made by someone who knows drama they have done an awesome job. I think this movie is perfect for the whole family to watch as you get to see all the characters in some very unusual situations. I love the fact that the movie never does anything at the same time, it moves from one part of the story to another. I have to say this movie does not come without its problems as it is kind of silly at times. There is also a very silly sequence in the movie where the kids try to get into a car and the woman drives off in the back. The problem I had with this movie was that there was not enough comedy in it. There was not too much time to get to know these characters. The funniest scenes were the ones where the characters would be playing around and talking about their lives and problems instead of doing some kind of plot. I thought it should have had more time to develop the characters because there was nothing in the first half of the film that would get me interested. But I am still going to give it a good review because the movie was pretty funny. The only problems I found in the film was that the kids were too young to get any real laughs out of the joke. It would also have helped if it was not so long and it should start to build up to something in the middle. Overall I thought the movie had a lot of potential but I was

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this to be a very mediocre movie. I would not say the directing is the worst I have seen but it was pretty bad. The acting was ok but most of the acting was just annoying. There was a lot of screaming when it should be dramatic. There were a lot less dramatic scenes to make up for the acting. I was not a fan of this movie but it does not really count as a bad one. I guess you can tell the acting is the best thing about the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ ___________________________ I thought this was a fun film with an interesting storyline, but when the character who is supposed to be a hero is so stupid and lazy that we're rooting for his demise as it happens to us all over again. I can't see how the scriptwriters thought the film was anything more than a cheap way to show off and try to earn a profit by making a comedy. I think this is just a complete waste of the talents of everyone involved and this should have never been produced in the first place. I hate to see a good movie become a total waste. _________________________  Rating: [1/2]"It looks fun, and it is, but it has a lot to answer for. There is an awful lot of stupid people in this film, all dressed up in white and pretending to be the heroic kind. The fact is that the movie is actually filled with terrible acting by a cast who clearly couldn't get a job as a professional clown because they've all got nothing better to do with their lives. I was looking forward to seeing what they could do with this sort of thing, but what a wasted opportunity. I wish I had known about this film beforehand so that I could've avoided it." – Chris B.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is like watching paint dry. The animation is okay- but you can tell that the characters and the world are flat. Nothing unique about the film at all.   I would really rather see this as a TV special for a low budget show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie that's about how a young girl is stalked by a man with a stalker's face is the only one I've ever seen that actually scared me. I mean, we are supposed to believe that the guy (who looks like a little kid) could never get over the fact that the girl is the prettiest girl around, but somehow he still finds a way to get her number and go to her house. That's what I can say about this film - the only good thing about it is that it never tries to get too scary...at least not until the end of the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's been almost 15 years since I've seen a movie that made me feel like a pathetic old man for three hours and half a film.  I was in my early 40's then.    And that movie was "Lassie Come Home".   The film stars James Mason, who I believe would still have some charm if he had any hair left.  This film is a remake of a 1960 film called "Lazy Sunday",  which I think is a classic children's movie.  In 1960, the story revolves around Lassie, an old she-ro who needs to sleep, or at least he should have been asleep but Lassiette is so impatient she sleeps all day in the big house, even though the neighbors are trying to wake her.  The neighbors of course are called to sleep by the dog, but the old shero has other ideas.  The dog was a great part of the film, especially if you are a dog lover.  And I really was a big fan of dogs, so that made the movie a must watch for me!       At least this version of Lassiemay was the least ridiculous one out of the three versions made between 1960 and 1969.  Some of the scenes are really well done.  But the most important part of this is Lassi's voice, which was absolutely perfect in 1960.  It's the only time it's actually heard in a movie, and it's the one part that will never fade from my mind.  Now that "Lasso of Truth" is no longer in the cinema, I will always have this one memory of my childhood.  For a small price, I can still get an old copy of "LASSIE COME HOME" on DVD, but you'll need to make sure to catch it on Blu-ray soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very short movie about an old guy who lives in a house, whose door is always kept open, but not to let anyone in. We don't even meet the old man's family. In the movie is shown how his friend who is dying gets in touch with him (that is also the ending). He doesn't come back alive. This movie was produced in 1968, so we don't have any scenes with the family. It is just about an older guy, who doesn't live in a home. He is a very slow going guy with no personality. He doesn`t care about anyone but himself.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "In the 1980's a movie was made in the Southwestern part of the United States about a Native American who was a bad man to a bad woman (Molly Brown in a very bad play). The people who made this movie made the mistake of trying to make a movie about a historical figure who is a very popular character in America at that time. This has nothing to do with what is happening now except that they thought this was a good idea. This does not make this an interesting movie at all, the writing is just terrible. It's like an American television version of a bad play... If you do not think you are going to be offended by this movie then you are a bad person."   1. "I'm tired of the war!"   2. "We're going to kill you all!"     3. "Your mother doesn't raise little Native Americans!"   (Note from R.T.: This is an accurate depiction of the racist attitude towards Native Americans. But it also goes way further back than just the movie.)   I think they were trying to be funny, like the movie was, but all they did was offend everyone. This movie really should be on the Rotten Tomatoes "Suck it and see it" list. The writing and acting was horrid, and it has a very stereotypical Indian woman, but the real bad thing is that the characters are so stupid that it almost doesn't matter how bad the show is. And what a stupid movie! I mean, the Native American is totally a bad guy? Why? And his mother really is a bad actress who has to be a bad role model for all her poor kids? I mean even I know that a white man would not be treated like that. The Native American had to be some kind of a stupid drunk! I thought that the movie had a little more humor, but that's really saying a lot, since it's not very funny at all and even has some bad language. If you just look at some of the characters and what they are talking about you will see how bad it is, which leads me to another problem, there were very little of the Native Americans that we know and love that were actually in the movie. Most of them were just there to play Native American stereotypes. And they still were terrible in the show. At least the Native Indians in this movie did not look like they were made out of ham.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â This is a good movie, and it is a great "movie with a twist"Â It is a film that is very interesting in several ways: 1. Â It has a story that is about a man who finds himself trapped in a room with a bunch of strange dolls.  These dolls do not do anything but look in the man's thoughts. 2.   This man is a child soldier.  One day he finds himself in a position of command in a very odd way: one day we are being told, "Tomorrow is a new day for the entire world, the war has ended, and the victors will be crowned."  But one week later, we are told, again, that peace has come and will last forever.  The movie has a very bizarre story, and at the end of it, the man gets to be the person of destiny and has to lead a group of people to a land of great wealth.  This is where the good parts of this movie come from:  Â The director did a nice job of not making this movie as "straight-forward" as it can be.  He has made this movie about an extremely peculiar situation, that has happened within the body of this man.  In addition to that, the story is very well thought out and interesting as it does not go in any simple way.  As it does, the film has it's own twists:  It is an action film, but at the same time, it is also a story about a people who are very unusual and strange.  I would not recommend this movie to a young person because I think you will find it a very difficult movie to watch in the beginning (since it is very confusing and weird).  But once you start getting into the story, you will be surprised:  What could have been a bad film is actually one that will have you laughing throughout!  The music and the performances, and in addition to those, all the voices (even some of the children) are wonderful to listen to!  In short:    Â Â an extremely interesting movie with a very strange ending.  I would recommend this for those who like their movies to surprise their audience!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of those movies that when I first started watching it I was expecting to like it, I had seen several westerns on TV so I was a bit curious about this one. The movie had a very western feel to it, a lot of bad guys, a couple of good guys and all the good old western themes that I have liked from the late 1950's until the late 1970's. I felt like the movie should have a little more development in it, but that is all I can say about it. The main bad guy that takes the movie over the top was a really bad actor and really not a very good actor, he made the whole movie about him. The rest of the baddies are really no where near as bad as him. My only other complaint is the soundtrack. I understand that the soundtrack for this movie was used in the original westerns, but at least have them get a rock band in there, like they did with the music in the movies that they made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a truly awful movie.  The main character is a spoiled, pompous, entitled and arrogant little shit who thinks it's okay to cheat on his wife for personal pleasure, but he's only doing it because it's her birthday. The movie is filled with such poor acting that it is hard to even believe the story is meant to be anything other than an exercise in bad acting and lazy plotting.  That would be bad enough, but at this point, it becomes downright funny because the story, from the get-go, is based on poor acting and lame dialogue.  This leads the story into absurd plot holes with no logic, such as the fact that when the daughter goes into labor, the husband, who's in town on business for 3 days, has to leave, leave, leaving the girl in danger and his wife furious.  Not to mention that the main character has some sort of fetish for his wife's breasts which he can't help but watch over and over again.  In the end, it all culminates in one of those cheap, cheesy "happy end" endings: the daughter survives and the husband gets the blame for leaving the baby behind.  What the wife doesn't know is that the baby was actually a doll created by the evil Dr. Deetman, a sadistic scientist who wanted to use the baby's body in one last experiment, which was a "sex change" of the husband.  Naturally, the wife thinks that's a pretty evil thing to do.  She then takes the baby to see her doctor.  Before getting anything out of the doctor, she tries to leave with the baby in her arms.  Dr.Deetman arrives and kills her in cold blood (I was kind of shocked by this and don't think I've seen the film since!) as a way of saying "thank you" to her husband. The most annoying part of this movie is not actually the characters or the plot.  It's the "happy ending" itself.  I really wish this wasn't in the movie because it made it all look that much worse.  If the wife and the baby were alive in the final scenes and not simply dead, I would have enjoyed the movie more.  As it is, I'd recommend this movie purely for its poor acting, awful plot and the fact it's made by people who think they're Hollywood stars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has so many stupid problems that it's really hard to believe that it was so bad. It is just another sequel to that "Jurassic Park" film, and it is even more ridiculous, in that the main character is an ape. Of course, this movie should be called the "The Unsolved Mysteries of the Bizarrely Informed Ape" and I wonder what I'm going to do now if we discover that one of the characters in this movie is really a bear.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had the worst time in the movie. It's not a very good movie at all.  It has very little redeeming qualities.  One of the main reasons I give this movie 2 stars is because it was one of the movies I was really looking forward to.  I was expecting something really bad.  What I got was this: a terrible sequel to a film I enjoyed and thought was pretty good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The original The Punisher was a wonderful Marvel movie that had an absolutely fantastic and well executed Punisher as the main character with some amazing effects from The Coen Brothers. The second Punisher movie, which is a completely different beast to the first, is a bad film that is not even remotely entertaining. It's actually a terrible film that I can't even remember the plot of, with its lame and forced fight scenes and bad dialogue that makes no sense. The plot twists are a joke, the acting is terrible, the action scene in the second movie is so weak that the only thing it adds to the movie is that Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis again. If you like bad movies that don't even have any potential to make the audience laugh or even to be shocked, then this is the movie for you.  I have so many things I want to say about this movie that it would take too long to write all of them. One thing is that after the first movie I was really interested to see what would happen next. The Punishers had an awesome origin, an awesome villain, and an awesome plot. The only thing that I didn't like about this sequel was that the villains seemed to be much more intelligent, which was actually a good thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film, starring Benicio del Toro and Michelle Rodriguez, was shot in the USA. It is basically the story of a boy that turns into a girl after a snake bite leaves him with the physical deformity known as "bud mouth". He lives with his family at their cabin. This little guy needs his mother's help, that is until he discovers something and discovers that his mother is the owner of a pet store in a town near the cabin.   When he discovers this fact, the boy decides to return home to his family.  This movie doesn't have the heart.    It is a film about the effects that snake bites can have on children.  It is really depressing to watch the little guy turning into his girly-girl counterpart. It made me angry when he was trying to get away from his mother, the snake trying to kill him.  After the mother dies, the father leaves the house and his kids take over the cabin, they play video games and make him feel very lonely.  When the little girl asks him, why he was such a bad father, he responds by saying that the mother had a heart of gold, she loved her son even though he was a girl.  The ending is not very pleasant to watch.     2 /10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this was a decent movie from start to finish. I liked it! I thought it was a fun ride.  There were definitely a few mistakes, but not enough to keep me from giving this a "B" rating.  The movie starts off with a young girl named Sophie (Sophie Cookson) who is trying to stay out of trouble.  She's doing fine as it is, though the neighborhood of the village is starting to become suspicious of her.  Sophie can tell they are on to her and they can tell she's being good and that the trouble really comes from outside.  This is the beginning of the "mysterious stranger" who keeps popping up at strange times.   He's about six feet tall, has long hair, and wears glasses.  The stranger has a very strange power; when he speaks he has the ability to turn people into animals.  I believe that he's the main antagonist in this film, he's very similar to a lot of people you can find in a lot old B-movies.  He seems to use some sort of device for it (a mirror or something) and if someone turns into his creature they will have an uncontrollable urge to walk on their hind legs and do things that don't look very happy.  We first meet Sophie at home when some of the people who live in the house try to convince her that the woman in the mirror is really a monster.   She is too scared to go to the police or the doctor as she feels she'd be laughed at.  You'll be able to see where this is going.  First there's this young woman who is just walking around the neighborhood with her sister but then she gets a fright (from the man in the reflection).   She goes inside to her brother and tells him what is going on.    They all head to the doctor (who we later see as her uncle).    He tries to calm the girl but she refuses to go home.   So the doctor asks Sophie to go out and scare someone at 4 PM.  When Sophie goes to the house at 4 she hears people scream and a young man come out of the house and says, "Who are you?"  He asks Sophie where the man was and then a little kid, (who was a little boy when he died) comes out of their house and tries to hit him. Sophie yells and the little boy disappears.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was terrible and a disappointment from start to finish. The movie is a generic story about a guy named Mike and his friend Dan who go down to South America to search for an ancient artefact. While Mike is off searching for the artifact and Dan is in trouble with the locals, two other guys come and join the adventure. One of them is a guy called Ben who has this habit of getting himself in trouble, his only saving grace is that Mike is the "man of the hour". The other guy, "Mikey" is Mike's best friend and the only person he seems to know how to deal with. Ben is always late for the appointment they had agreed to, Mikey is always drunk and constantly swearing, he gets himself into situations, always in the same place and time, and he usually gets into some trouble. The main thing that the film has going for it is the music, which is a classic, catchy tune with some great lyrics by John Barry. If only the film had more of those old school cheesy adventure films, it would have been much better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very stupid, self-aware, ridiculous piece of crap that I wouldn't waste my time watching. The character development is as shallow and weak as ever, the plot is as boring as ever (it's basically the same story as the last one, in a different place), the acting is as terrible as ever. It's a complete waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Donnie Darko was a bad film, not only for the time it was released in.  It was overrated with a ridiculous story, the acting was subpar, and the directing/acting was terrible.  Why is a movie like this on a horror review list?  The best part of the movie was the trailer, which is really just a poorly done advertisement for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never thought I'd actually buy a video game. I mean sure, I knew there were a few great games that were on the market at the time, but the way they were priced really put me off. I was only 15 when the game came out.   The graphics were okay but nothing too spectacular. It wasn't as bad as I'd hoped; I even remember a little kid playing it in the parking lot on a small TV screen and he was pretty good!   Then, after that, my first game failed.  At the end of the level there was some kind of button on the wall that opened a door to a new game.  It looked just like the previous one.  There's a little voice over by a guy who makes some great jokes.  I didn't have many problems with that game, it just wasn't any good.  The next game, which was much better, was a shooter. I had played that one a couple times on a TV, but it actually looked pretty good, at least compared to the previous shooter. It was similar to the one I remember from my childhood, but I wasn't too happy about that one. There wasn't a lot of weapons to choose from and they made it a bit difficult to aim the gun, and some of the bosses were really hard.  After playing that game I was pretty disappointed that there wasn't anything better to come out for the system.  One day my dad's friend came over and played this game for me and he liked it, so he brought home this cartridge and I played it that night.  As I was playing the game my dad came into my room and asked what was going on. I told him I was trying to play it and he told me he'd bought it. I really didn't like the graphics and the game wasn't very good. I think I got a couple of bugs here and there.  So I didn 't buy it. It took me about a week to get back to playing my favorite games.  My dad had gone through all of them and he wanted me to take his older brother's system. I didn' t like the new ones at all, so I said no.  Then one day I took a look at the cartridge. It didn't look like that cartridge before: it had black dots all over the place.  Well, when I tried to play that game the only way to get the game started
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love this movie to bits, however as a child who had seen many bad movies I had my doubts about this being a good one. I remember seeing this movie when I was in the theater and it seemed very boring to me. The music is good and the actors are great. It has an adult feel to it which is very nice. It is well acted. I can't even remember who's name is that in the ending credits. What really makes this movie are the songs on the album "The Unhappy Boy". There are many great songs, most of them made by Roy Orbison and some are made by Jerry Schatz or other great performers. The songs are very good and all of them are used throughout the movie. If you like good, well sung and funny music, look at this movie. Just beware that you're at least 16 years old for this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- This movie is a mess. It takes itself very seriously, and even though this is a very violent movie, it doesn't feel as though it's actually violence that we see. It seems that the director and the director's screenwriters wanted the violence to feel more extreme, but what they end up with is just silly. It may have been a good movie if it wasn't for this: ------------- This guy thinks that if a woman goes to a bar to meet a guy, they'll get married. His mother comes over to give him a little present. The movie doesn't say. The girl doesn't really know what a "gift" is, but her friend suggests "a present you could keep until it is stolen." (or "a gift you would keep until you were dead.") It's never stated how they plan to get married or why this present is important. The gift is never mentioned again after this. I'm sure they were going to make it a surprise. This happens in every movie I've seen so far, but this time I can't even remember them. We see a lot of people in one area getting drunk at the same time, including two women. I've noticed how often you just see a bunch of dudes drinking, but I can count the girls. They seem like extras in a lot. The camera is at some interesting angles, but there are some awkward scenes in the bars. This one scene, in fact, I can just remember: This girl is talking to the bartender, and when she tells him that she's a prostitute, he says that the guy that paid her to work is her pimp. It just doesn't seem right that some people can be so stupid. --------------- The ending is just a little too ambiguous. The whole thing makes me feel like it was all supposed to be some sort of joke, and the end, like the movie, takes a real departure from everything. It's a really weird movie, but a good time. I give it a 2/10. (Dec 18, 2017)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to admit I did not expect a big budget horror movie to be that bad. It is obvious that you could not make a horror film like this for a $5,000 budget. But that is where the money is. A poor, uneducated black male is abducted from his home at night by some masked men. He is tied to a post outside a vacant mansion. It seems that there are several of them in the mansion. He can barely get free. They have him eat and drink but they make him stay there. He cannot escape and is forced to drink water. When the water gets to his throat he thinks it is a blood clot and thinks he is dying. But he does not pass out! No! He wakes up in the night. He does not even have clothes on! He has been transformed into a woman! He feels very helpless and is so afraid to move about. He has to remain in that mansion for two weeks. He must use a phone and a shower that is used only by men. The next day he is taken to a farm where he is to be married off. He finds the farm to be filled with a variety of creatures. He meets a baby cow, a bull and several other animals. Then he meets a strange man who tells him he will marry him if he will give a pig to him. The pig is not a pig! It is an old man and he tells the cow that this man will take her to heaven. She is frightened by the old man. A priest comes and tells the old cow to leave. But the old pig insists she is his daughter! And he says he will stay with her until she grows up. Then the old woman will die too. The cow is so frightened she does not want to leave the farm. So when she sees a pig she goes up to the old lady. She starts to kiss her and then they are married.   The old man turns out to be a magician and his wife is a witch. They make a lot of money when they sell off the people inside the mansion and do not tell the farmer that the man they married to is a female! They even sell the house and sell out the farmer. They do not even tell him that they did this to kill him. What a horror.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is a rehash of a previous film, with no new elements, just the same thing, a woman is sent to a desert island to be with a man who doesn't exist. It is a slow paced romantic comedy in the vein of "The Day the Earth Stood Still" or "The Last Picture Show" and it doesn't even make up for its obvious inferiority by being funny, and the plot doesn't actually have any real purpose; the only time it is given any kind of story is when a friend of the main character says that "I think you're from the future, I think you've gone into the past." At least there's some logic going on with the people who are trying to find her, but it's still the same same old romantic comedy plot; a girl who wants a man to be present to her all the time and someone who doesn�t want to see her all of the time (if he doesn�teer to be an actual man, that is) and a man, who thinks he�s in love but isn't, and a lot of talking about the future.   This movie never gets better. The cast is mostly forgettable (except for the one who plays "Mr. J. D.," who I�m sure will become a major star) except for the female lead, who is a pretty face but a very annoying one that keeps coming in your way just to annoy you and cause you to be distracted. There are several references to "The Thing," except for those times when they are mentioned, they are all in the same sentence; there is one mention when the characters are in a movie theater (the only place where they could be alone), and then they all are in the back of the theater where everything is very quiet except for a loud sound of a woman weeping; and there are several mentions to the film "The Island" where the main characters all meet on an island with the same name, the only difference is that this movie was filmed in the 70s. The music is very soft and it's quite obvious that the movie was shot with a long lens, there is a scene where the girl is talking to a man at the library who is dressed as a clown, the director of the movie (who obviously never saw "The Way You Look Tonight") is playing the guitar and the only other person who acts in the scene is a very small man with a beard, this is
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********************* The only way to describe the story is that there is something horribly wrong with the universe! It takes the form of an ancient alien space vehicle which takes off from earth and lands in the mars. It takes on the form a gigantic tree like creature which lives in the middle of the sky like a giant octopus, with a huge mouth that will eat anything which comes too close. It does this by manipulating human beings into doing the right thing, and then having them do the right, and only the right. It can manipulate people just as easily as it can take on different forms. It is a terrible movie. If you only get one movie in the whole galaxy this is it, the movie "The Fly" with aliens being as big as trees! The story is about a woman, named "Jan" that has become a slave to the tree creature. She is the only person on earth that has the power to talk to these creatures and is sent with the tree to a planet named "Mars". She lives as a slave, until one day her master decides to free her of the tree and have her live on the surface again. Of course, things don't go as planned and Jan ends up taking on a human form and becomes "Ella". This movie is made by people that want to be taken seriously. The whole movie is nothing but "The Alien Monster" with the trees and other forms that these monsters take on. This movie had a little bit of a message. How the wrong human do something to become evil. It had some nice special effects, it has a nice score that is hard to forget. If this were a big budgeted movie with a big cast it would have been good. It would have looked like a big monster movie. But it was nothing like that! And, it is a bad "movie" so you probably won't want to watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't like the movie. This is a stupid movie. I wish it had never happened. I liked this movie so much more then the first one. This one was great. I can't believe what they did with the new girl. I feel she went too easy on the kids in this one and it got out of hand with the adults. They weren't evil or anything but they went too far. It made this movie an 80's movie to me. I loved this movie. The acting and the humor is great. The movie was not that exciting and it was a great laugh. I am sure this movie was just created to get kids to remember it. If you think it is a good movie for kids then it is. I did a lot of it because I want to know what happened to them. A good movie if you don't mind the fact that you may see it to soon.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So I just saw this movie with my dad, and like everyone else said, its a pretty bad movie. Like most bad movies, it takes itself too seriously. The story is boring, and the characters in this movie are not really funny either. My dad was in tears and laughing when he saw it. I was like how come the story keeps changing. And the plot, well its really boring, but what can I say. The movie really did make me go "hmmm, I never thought that would be a good idea to do a movie like this." My dad kept pointing out some details that were not there and it was like, well here I go. Well if you want a good laugh, I suggest that you check out any of my comedy specials...and not the old ones. I hope you are as entertained as I was.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "In the first place, I'm sorry I didn't do this film as an art house comedy."  It was a very fun evening, a bit of a surprise and a really good movie that I enjoyed with a nice group of friends. If I were a woman (who I'm not), I could probably make this movie work as a sexy comedy or even a romantic comedy but that would mean that this would be some kind of a chick flick. Not in a good way. Not a good movie.  You could tell that there was a story going on but it was hard to understand why it was so much of a problem, like it should have been clear before starting the movie. I guess that the plot could've been better, maybe it could've used more time to develop and explain the main plot but it wasn't that much of an issue because the other parts where very good. The actors did a good job and the movie was entertaining but it didn't make me want to laugh.  on this movie: i'd give it a 5-star rating. i wish it had more time developing and explaining the story. It's a good film. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is pretty much a straight-up horror movie with no special effects, just a bunch of people being murdered and left in the forest. It's not that scary but then again it is not a really funny movie either. The only part that might've made it a little more funny would be a couple of people hanging out a tree and playing some type of strange game. It looks a bit silly and cheesy but it's very hard to be mean to a movie that has a good plot.   The plot is not really so good but it is the only thing going for this movie. It is about a girl named Lucy who is trying to find her sister. Lucy gets kidnapped by some kind of a monster that is trying the make her go insane and he makes her go to the jungle, the girl is very scared of the monster because he has really long arms. After some time the girl has a dream where she runs around a big castle with a man in a black cloak who is chasing after her. Then there's some weird music in the movie and the monster has a huge mouth. Then Lucy finds a bag with a map but the map can't lead her to the girl, there is a lot of walking around which is supposed to bring you to the other side of the castle that can lead Lucy to the sister, so the girl runs and then when she looks back there's no girl to see and the monsters is trying everything to stop her, and the movie ends when she's back in the city and she looks at the map she sees her sister and the whole movie ends with her running and the girl in a car trying to get to the city but she doesn't get there because the movie is over.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if I can express how disappointing it is that the writer of this movie decided to make a 'black comedy' out of the history of slavery. The movie opens up in a black church. And of course, the 'priest' is dressed like a black man: wig and all. The preacher starts preaching a sermon about how much he hates blacks. And he ends his speech by declaring that blacks have nothing but 'disease, crime and death in them'. He goes on to say that if we want to save the blacks from themselves then we must kill them all. I won't go further into his racist rant. But this film is just an attempt to put the blame for the black death rate on the "white devils" (i.e. blacks). The film ends up with black prisoners being sold as slaves in Florida, where some of the black prisoners have been freed after being given a little bit of freedom by the whites (who are being forced to work on plantations and farms). In other words: It's all the fault of the "evil white devils". The movie is full of scenes of this type. And while the blacks are being tortured, shot and beaten to death, the movie goes on and on, trying to show how 'evil the white devils' were. This movie is like a bad TV show, with all the blackness removed. No 'white devils' here: just a bunch of black people being beaten and murdered. I mean, is this movie even a documentary?  The movie stars James Brown, a 'rap legend' who does not seem to know much about the history and facts about slavery. Also involved in the film is R. J. Mitte, a man who has written a book about the events in slavery. He talks about how the black slaves were treated. He states that it was not the whites who enslaved the blacks. He also admits that many of the slaves had no choice but to leave their families behind and run off to avoid the harsh treatment and death. That is a pretty good description of the conditions on plantations.  I also don't understand how blacks were allowed to go to the theaters. I know most of the movies shown in theaters are not that good but there is always some good movies in the theaters: Back to the Future, Rocky, Superman (I haven't seen those though) and other sci-fi films.  This movie was never released theatrically. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember being in college when this came out, we all liked it because it wasn't that much of a horror film but it had a lot of scares in it. The plot was pretty simple, a girl gets lost at a construction site and has to go to a motel with her boyfriend and his buddies. There's lots of fun to be had with these guys but they aren't always nice to one another and there's an awesome chase scene involving a car that goes out of control and has a crash through the window on the motel floor. The main character is a female and the best thing about it is that it's the "good guys". We get an evil witch from Scotland, a crazy guy from England, an evil Irish wizard, and the bad guy from the previous movie with his girlfriend. There is a really great sequence that happens right after she goes out to dinner and she has her best friend from home bring her some dinner.   After dinner, her friend shows up with her favorite dessert (which has the word "SOS" on it in French and English). She is very happy and wants to eat it right then and there, but she's told to "wait" because her father wants to talk with her. The father wants her to be quiet and she doesn't have a lot to say to him, so he tells her to take care of the kids and get the table ready for dessert. He tells her that the guy in the car will be coming back and she'll need to be at the motel before his car comes back. So, the little girl stays for another night in the motel and ends up in a room with this guy. He's a nice guy but he's mean to this girl and he makes things difficult for the girl. So she's forced to do a sex act and then we get to see the evil witch who gives her a curse. I never was really into witches so it was a new experience for me. I didn't really care for her because she was a mean girl and not really any fun. I know there are different interpretations about her and it's not as scary as it may seem but it did get a chuckle out of me. The ending was just as awesome as the whole movie!   If you like a good, quick, scare movie and you don't care too much for the witches, give this a shot and I promise you'll enjoy it. It's a good little movie that's not scary but

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad I can hardly stand to look at it. It's full of stupid people talking silly stuff about bad guys, and what I have to say is "How much worse can a movie be?" The worst part is that they seem to make a movie that is so un-original and so weak, that it is almost too bad it's there. They could have gone to the woods and made a good movie like "A Man and His Dog" or even "The Three Wishes," but they did not. The title is so stupid, the "movie" is so simple, and it seems so full of clichés, that I can't think of a single reason this movie could be made at all. I have no idea what it's about, I could have watched more than ten different horror movies before I decided to go to see this, but I will never think of that movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***************** As a viewer, I thought this was a really bad movie. There was no character development at all, and almost no interaction. The main character was the weakest part of the film (who would've thought a movie about a group of kids getting lost in a haunted house would be anything but boring?), and the rest of the supporting cast is either underdeveloped or too stereotypical. You are just supposed to know these people by their appearance alone and have zero clue about them. I really wanted something to happen with the characters...but no. *************** I don't give a **** about this movie. *********

I really liked how the old "Hollywood" cast would go out on the town during the summer.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A decent film, if you like a western, a movie with a good story but a bad script.   The plot is about two hunters who kill a guy who they thought was a wolf or some kind of a beast.  It's a good idea to have wolves and man together (in the same movie).  The story is about a man who kills a wolf to take his medicine (a plant that will make him strong and strong) and he's going to take it back home. But there is something very wrong about him. It's not the man, but his wife that is going to make him fail. She gets rid of the man and she is going out to kill a man. It seems like a very weak story but I guess because it's set in the country, it is very hard to get the story done. The problem is that it does not have a great story and there is nothing to think about. If you love the western you probably won't care too much about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple weeks ago I saw this film at a local movie theater. It was a fairly average movie, but it had a good plot. The lead, played by Jeff Daniels, was very good and played him well. His friend played by Matt Dillon, the guy who played Mr. Big in Dirty Dancing, was annoying. He kept asking for a gun, which he would only use in the end. It also seems like he was wearing a "corset" all the time, because all the scenes were shot in bed and he was only allowed to take off one or two outfits. The only interesting part was the scenes with the couple. Jeff Daniels had a great body, but I thought the girlfriend was out of place for him. She just wasn't hot enough and I was just bored of her. It wasn't much of a good movie, just good actors and some good scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie to be a complete train wreck of terrible acting, bad script, and bad plot.  The plot is that a guy named Mike (Michael Rooker) gets stranded with his wife on a deserted island with no food, water, or electricity.  He is a huge fan of "Titanic" (the movie), so it's no surprise that he's totally psyched for the movie's ending.  But it's not to be.   The ending turns a complete mockery of the Titanic's disaster.  It starts with the two talking about the events leading up to the sinking of the ship.  Both of them are dead-eyed and the only thing that they've really achieved is a permanent spot on the Titanic Online "What The Hell Just Happened" List.  Mike is so over the top that he manages to make everyone think that he is trying to make a movie.  Then they decide to make one.  They go to Los Angeles and attempt to convince a studio to make it.  There is a lot of talking between the two about the ending and how it is perfect:  But when the two finally make their pitch (it is really bad), they are so over-the-top that even a giant ocean liner couldn't sink it, just as the Titanic did.  All I can say about the entire movie is that it was a complete waste of time.  If you have to watch one film, make it this one.

You can't make it worse than this. This is the kind of movie that will only make you angry for being alive. The acting is really bad. My only concern about this movie is that it was put into a box, where everyone just watched it. If you didn't enjoy this movie, you shouldn't be watching it. It will make you sad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great story with a very bad director ( I'll say this now. I've had one of those films where it seems like everything is going to go wrong. Except it doesn't. It's just dull, boring, and I think over the top. I don't understand why there is so much "magic" in these films? What is the plot anyway? Nothing is explained. It seems to be more of a "how to" rather than an actual "how". This was just a boring, stupid film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was an okay movie, but nothing special. I like most of the movie's plot, even if there is one odd little point that does not fit. The movie also gives us the usual "good guy" and "bad guy" stuff. But there are also some nice scenes here and there, but again there is nothing special about these.   Overall, this is a mediocre movie. I really wanted to like it and thought it was an ok movie. But I just didn't care for the plot. It has to be one of the weakest movies I've ever seen in my life. Not a very entertaining, fast-paced movie. Very little thought went into this movie. If you are a fan of old science fiction movies like The Day The Earth Stood Still or Star Trek: The Motion Picture or even something like The Right Stuff, you may enjoy this. But if you are not, this won't be worth your time.  Helpful the movie gets off to a bad start, when the movie suddenly jumps forward. In the beginning there is a guy who has to kill a demon named the Grim Reaper in order to get a chance at a place called Heaven. Then there is another character who wants to be the Grim Grim Reaper but doesn't know that he has a family, so he ends up stealing money, which makes him a criminal. I think the director may have had a lot of ideas for this movie, since the first few scenes are interesting. The plot then gets completely ruined by a bunch of plot holes that completely change the way the movie is going to be. Some of them were stupid, like "who was the Grim's original host?" or "who did the Grim decide to kill?," the plot is completely thrown off course by one of these holes. Other holes didn't seem to affect the plot at all but I didn't have too much faith in the director to be able to do anything about them. It is pretty bad when a movie is so poorly thought out you can't even tell a different movie was made over it. This really ruined the movie for me.The movie does have some good parts. There are some fun moments in the movie. The bad parts make you question whether or not the movie was even made or whether it was something an outside person just re-wrote, to cash in a little. It definitely looks like the movie came from an old book, which may or may not have been well done, the

But I don't have the heart to kill myself, because they were all wonderful people. They were all like my family. They're all dead. But you should've known something was wrong after the first film. You could tell the first one was going to be hard to kill off because of the ending. It was so horrible that you couldn't help but think that it was going on a little too long. There were some pretty intense scenes, even though it did feel like the end of the world. But it was really hard to take your eyes off the screen as these three fell apart. And when it was over, it felt like the film ended. After the second film, I felt kind of sad. I mean there were some beautiful parts, but there really wasn't that much to say about this one. I guess it was a waste of time. It really wasn in need of a new direction and a lot more love and a more believable ending. I wouldn't recommend the film."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You know, I never get why the producers of this film couldn't just edit out a lot of the terrible dialogue.   In fact, I don't know if they even filmed a conversation with the guy in the wheelchair. The movie is basically a conversation between the girl and her father about how much fun she and her dad have. She says she wants to go to prom with him, his daughter. But he turns out to be paralyzed and the girl's mother has a hard time with that, so the movie ends.   the movie would have been better off cutting out all the bad dialogue. And the movie wouldn't have been bad either without the cheesy, over-the-top comedy.

There was no need for them to go so far as to produce a remake of The Haunting in Connecticut (though it was inspired by the film, and certainly a better effort at the same time), or even for the Blair Witch to be the antagonist, for that matter. Instead, they did the more important thing, they took what could have been a weak film and enhanced it by giving it a good story (which is a difficult thing to do in this case, since there was a complete lack of any real tension, as you'll see later on), and by casting a great film actor, and a great performance from the young Laura Dern. But the movie is too much like the first one, especially with the introduction of Bill Skarsgård. The movie takes place after the events of the first film, but we are still not given any sense that the original events ever happened. The plot involves Laura trying to find the missing girls, but before she can do that she gets killed by a creature that looks like a monster from a horror movie, and while there are no real explanations of what actually happened at that point, we are left with the feeling that this is a film that is only going to be remembered as a sequel to the first and not as a genuine horror film. But as I said, it was a great time, and there was some interesting moments that did not make it into the theatrical cut, and that is a shame. I can see why they made such a fuss about the story, since it was quite original, and at the time it looked very good and was definitely one of the more interesting horror films out there. So when the remake came out in 2009, I was excited by the possibility of a good remake, but when I saw it I found myself a bit disappointed because there was no more "original" Blair Witch experience left in the first movie. So if it weren't for the fact that the movie was a little less well received, I might have given it a better rating than a 1, or even a 6. As it is I gave it a 3 because it does have its moments, and its performances and its story are not terrible, but it does not live up to the original, although it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only movie that can rival the film The Matrix, is the film, The Fly (1960). This film is a movie about a man who is able to fly, his friend with the same ability, also. We see them going on a fishing trip, they get their car to the lake, and then it starts to rain. The guy with the ability to fly gets his clothes wet, but it gets too dangerous for him, so he wants to stop flying. He tells the friend that he'll stop at the motel, and if they have a nice evening with their friend. Well this movie is a great movie. This is the second time I saw this film. The first time I went to see it was 20 years ago. That was a long time ago. The plot is nothing crazy. This movie has a good plot but this was a movie for kids. I saw a guy in the movie, I forget his name. He is a small guy and he had a very small body. This was an okay movie. There is not much action, there is no blood, this is a kid's movie. I loved it and I remember laughing out loud several times. If you're a big kid and this is not your kind of movie, you're going to have a great time. It was a great little movie and I would love to see this movie again. I'd like to add a movie to this list that has a great plot. It is the movie "The Fly (1959) directed by John Huston. A kid gets super powers. Then he gets involved in a plot that goes on to be a huge movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- Not sure what I liked about this one, but this was a long film. The first two films have a lot of heart, which the others lack. The main characters are funny and the ending is nice, if a bit contrived.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not bad at all (but just not my cup of tea) The movie has an eerie atmosphere to it, with a strange theme. While not really original, it gives a chilling feel to it and it made me wonder what could be waiting behind the door. The movie is full of little oddities that add up to make a bad day. The script is not bad at a first, but there are plenty of plot holes that need to be filled in, and the ending has a very weak climax. A very good horror movie in my book.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie on the basis that it was a comedy, and I was wrong.   It was a very heavy and serious work, not just in terms of plot, but of tone.  There are a lot of characters with no development.  In a scene, a boy and his dog (the dog gets his owner killed by the boy) have a fight and kill each other. In another scene, several girls (two girls are dead and the other one is paralyzed) are being attacked by a giant snake.  The snake is played by a man (whose name I've forgotten) in a green body suit, he gets shot a few times and falls apart in the end.  For a comedy with comedy.  A very bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is very poor and this has nothing to do with the character of the main hero - it's a bad mess. The film is very confusing with a plot that isn't clear and we get very little information about the world and the characters. There are several characters (the most of them are not really involved in the story, some of them have been introduced a few times), but only one is actually important to the story and his only motivation is to have a little fun in the town (it's a very typical "tourist town" scene, and that's why the movie is so boring and so stupid). He likes to drink and his wife is always around with him and her life is boring and boring - she doesn't like her job and her son is a spoiled brat. She tries to make it better by hiring the "best" young boy to help her, but nothing works and eventually she lets him go and asks the son to take care of the kid (he is a typical "puppy" in that he is extremely spoiled and he doesn't want to be in his mother's place, he wants to do all his chores by himself and then go get drunk with a local girl for a little longer). So that's the movie - the "villain" is the town and the "victim" is a man named Bill who is the local drunkard and drifter and who is very happy and content in life. The plot is so bad that if you had a job to do and had a family to take a good care of, you might want to stop watching it...   Overall the film was very bad, it was just too convoluted and there were too few details about the characters and the world. It was just like watching a bad horror movie that happened to be about an evil town.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It takes a while to understand why these two are doing what they are doing, but I think it's more about the people. They can't have sex, but they want to get off to each other. I found myself feeling like a voyeur while watching these two go through the motions. They do things that are so far from what is acceptable.  In one scene I even see them making out in a car. It isn't funny, it's disgusting, it doesn't even look like they're having fun.   I think these two should be ashamed of themselves for a couple of minutes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a mediocre film, I mean really bad. It doesn't really have anything to do with the movie being "so bad" because the characters are mostly not bad but you don't care about them. I have to say that I like this kind of crap, a lot. But this is a movie that is so low budget that you might think that they filmed it in an abandoned building with the window shades down. I found the special effects to be very poor, the background scenery is all of the most generic scenery I have seen. It was so bad that I felt bored with it a bit. I don't know why they even bothered using special effects, to me they just looked like someone who was really into making up an excuse for how a character died.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________ I'm not sure what to say about this movie that hasn't been said already, except that it is not very good. If this were a movie that was made in my childhood, I would probably be more forgiving than I am, because for all I know, it may have been made by some idiot. There is a girl in this movie named Mary; she is a bit of a snob who thinks that every movie has to be full of "giant monsters". She has an awful time with her boyfriend (Billy) and is eventually forced to stay in this haunted house for the night because she has no money and because she can't get to a movie with him. I don't mean to say that this girl is worthless, she has her moments, and when she does something that seems a bit silly she just has the time of her life; I just don't get the logic of this. The two most memorable scenes in this particular movie is the movie where she is trying to get out of the house and the movie that the movie opens with. It is not one of the great movies, so don't watch this unless you have an irrational hatred of "bad movies".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you enjoyed this terrible movie then check out these awful films. "What's in the box?" "Just some popcorn and a bucket of paint." "I can't believe you can get away with this!" "You're the real star here." When a guy in a black dress and an old white woman are having a conversation, they start talking about the time they saw a movie. They start talking, talking, about the movie...and then I don't know what's about to happen. The movie is The Bride of Frankenstein. The old white lady keeps asking the old black man "what is that in the closet?" The old black guy says "that is a horse." The old lady asks "Why doesn't she ride it?" He says "It's like a monkey." The whole movie is about this stupid girl who is not intelligent enough to figure out that her husband is in love with someone else. The old man keeps insisting that her name is "The Bride of the Frankenstein" and that she has some sort of curse that makes her look like a monster. I guess you could call that a sequel to Frankenstein. I'm surprised that no one has made an animated version of this crap. The animation isn't bad. It does remind me of the old animated shorts made before TV. It is just ugly. The acting is terrible. The guy in black dresses sounds like a drunk. I really would have liked to hear a voice over of the guy saying "I'm sure that this can be changed!" I don't really care about this movie but this is an example of why people keep thinking they can get into the business by making bad movies. The only thing I can compare this to is a movie called Caddyshack. If you liked that movie, you will like this one. If you haven't seen it already, go check that out! This movie is not the good part of Caddieshack and this is not a bad part of it. It's just a bad scene in it. I don´t get it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film should have never been released.  It is a mess, a disgrace, and a joke, but it did make a few people very laugh - those who loved the first one.   A guy falls in love with a beautiful woman - we think the guy is going to be the one, but he dies.  The body is found and it turns out that his girlfriend was the murderer and he was just a patsy.  This was a terrible sequel that made me angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like to say I've seen all the movies about the Battle of the Atlantic (or 'the British Invasion') that I can think of but this film does have something very original. It's more than a good yarn, it's a thought provoking romp and, most importantly, a thought sending one. One man's fight against a whole nation of bullies with a few men, weapons and a boat in a time of national crisis is a truly epic battle, which should only have been made into a movie. As a story it's very thin and simplistic but this is what the greats of Hollywood are all about, they tell us what we want to see and what we don't want to know.   I will add a few more points to the great man's list of things to do in his life...a lot of them involve drinking, smoking, driving, gambling (if you're into that sort of thing) and, well, that's about it. So if you're looking for a movie that will entertain, make you chuckle at the ridiculousness and, when the time is right and the stakes are high, will probably make you feel a bit dirty and even sad (even if this all seems to end in a way that should make it pretty clear that the villains are the ones who really deserve it).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a terrible mess, so bad that I'm still wondering why they ever thought it was a good idea. I know that it was originally going to be about a serial killer, but as time went on it was really just about some poor little girl who loses her parents and has to move in with her aunt.  There is a scene in this movie where her aunt has to buy a new car because she can't pay her car insurance.  I love this movie.  So, when I go to a movie it always looks like that is gonna happen, but instead of an aunt or uncle driving a car, it's a little girl and a car.    I have never been a big fan of this movie but I have learned to tolerate it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        What the fuck, why does this movie exist?   It's just...   I'm sorry, what?  Why does it exist? Why does this exist? This movie just isn't very good. I was expecting the most ridiculous film ever, and this just isn's not very funny.  It just isn' t very much fun, and while it's possible that there could be a great story here, the writing just isn,  doesn't work very well, there's a couple plot holes here and there, and the characters just don't have any real motivation for anything, it's just,   a very boring and uninteresting film.   What is the point of a character's obsession with her daughter?  Is it just to be annoying? This is a terrible movie to be sure, but then again what really makes me laugh is how awful this film is, I mean I really do think the worst film ever could be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   -I can't stand the dialogue of this movie. The dialogues are stupid and cheesy and the plot is nothing more than a lame romance between two bad people.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all honesty, I found this to be a very unoriginal "Muppet Movie". It has no real plot, and even less characters to get behind. It was made on a budget of 10-12 million dollars, so it doesn't have the special effects that a Disney classic should have, instead of the "Hula Hoop". This is a bad film for anyone to sit through because it is filled with lame lines, bad laughs, and a poorly acted performance by a guy called "Dr. Bunsen Honeydew". If this were made today it would have been a box office flop.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To all of you who can't even look past the fact that this movie is a blatant rip-off of a cult-classic, I say don't bother. Don't bother watching it, don't let this film be your last memory of a summer you spent watching bad movies like this. There is nothing special about this movie: the cast is basically just the same people, the writing is as clichéd as it gets and the acting is as laughable as it can possibly get. If you're looking for a cult classic like "The Fly" (which is a much more original movie) then you won't find it here. If this is your last movie, just remember the words of the old saying: "We should be thankful for what we have, but not so thankful that we're blind to the things that are so much better."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie, except for one scene that completely blew the plot. I mean, I really liked the premise of the movie - a man gets a bad case of amnesia (a few years after having a child) and gets into a big car accident (that he caused). What makes the movie so good is a mix of comedy and science fiction. It's funny to see how he will remember everything about his life, which makes me wonder if he remembers everything from the accident as well. It is really well-made and a great film to watch with the big sound system and the bright color. I really enjoyed this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the spirit of the movie, a little boy, David (who, by the way, has a nice laugh and plays the piano quite nicely) finds a "Groucho" hat on the side of the road. The hat is "gouged" to make a hat.  There's a lot of "what-ifs" with David's hat being stolen at one point.  "What if I'm the Groucho?"  David's girlfriend Elizabeth (Diane Lane) is very attractive but there are times when she's not so much.   One of David's more charming features is his ability to not only tell a "fairy-tale" story but also to play on Elizabeth's sympathies.  It's obvious in their first relationship that he doesn't get all that much in return for all the trouble he's taken, which he's clearly having fun with.    It's all a very, very silly movie with lots of jokes and laughs but I couldn't help but have some doubts as to whether David was all that funny to begin with. This one gets better at the end when it gets serious, although even then, I'm not sure I could tell how serious or funny it was until the final credits. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, I don't know if it's for the best that I found an old, dusty VHS that I had no idea it existed. It's a decent movie. I didn't hate it, but it is only a very small part of the "G.I. Joe" series.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought it would have been even more awesome to actually see a dragon on screen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Brief description:    In a dystopian world where technology has taken over a large portion of the planet, humans are confined to the Moon, and only the super-intelligent artificial intelligence, HAL9000, can give them an "escape from reality", a world where they can live forever on the surface (on Earth), while maintaining a life and mind on the Moon.   The world was more than a little familiar to me; I am only one of many people who lived through the 80's in that era. In a manner of speaking, this movie is really a remake/remaster of "The Man from Earth". A few issues occurred, as I have already mentioned, but overall this is a very good movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are some pretty terrible actors here: A lot of people think he is supposed to be black so he gets all the roles but he is nowhere near that good. He is a really bad actor. He tries to look black but he has no presence. There are also some really terrible songs like the song "Blowin Up My Own Body" (which is a cover) by Billy Cobham. It does have a nice jazzy beat to it but it is too short. This movie has some great music too!   I like the look of the movie. It has a pretty dark look and some great images to it. I like it but I hate this movie! It really makes me want to kill myself. I am really sad to see that this movie has already got the bad reviews on IMDb so I guess I will not watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of old ladies get a box which is full of "B-movie horror" type stuff.  But they have nothing to fear because the stuff doesn't work!  They go into the basement to see if the ghost has left, but instead they get more crap.   The old ladies are supposed to be in the basement for a reason (it is the house of the witch and she is the witch), but what the heck does any of it have to do with anything!    So they get the second part of the box and get a very weak movie.  There is not much in the second movie that is good at all.    So far the movie is mostly just lame, boring and pretty silly.  The movie starts with a man running past an old lady in a dress, who then runs into the door and screams.  Well first of all who in the world is running past the old lady?!     This movie is a piece of shit.  It has an old woman who screams and that is it.  Then a little boy running past and that's it too.   The rest of the movie then involves some really stupid nonsense.  This is nothing like the other films in the series.  So if you like the first three in the "Goblin" series, then you will enjoy the second. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********   At the beginning this movie is funny but not enough to be enjoyable so far. The movie has so much potential if this cast is good in this movie but they don't have a lot to work with. And I like it when good movies have funny parts in them. So far I have seen two of them that are good (The King Kong) and the fourth one (Alien). The King Kong is good. But I thought that the movie made fun of itself a lot when the gorilla was talking about how he's going to eat everybody's brains and I just laughed.   Overall I would recommend the movie to anyone that likes a good monster movie. This movie is good with a cast that I think has potential. I would not suggest this movie to a kids audience unless its a really cute, funny movie that has some really stupid stuff in it (the gorilla eating his family and the baby gorilla crying during the scene) and a pretty good ending!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason this was good is because it is the film in which we finally get to see a decent female villain (I've been asking myself since seeing the first 'Jurassic Park' film why the female characters in films by Steven Spielberg and John Hammond were always so bad - it's because women don't want to be heroes and are more interested in being sex objects).  It is a very well done female villain who has a very good plan to take over the world and the baddies in this film did not disappoint.  I thought it was the only time I ever saw a truly bad female villain in a film.  I have never heard anyone say that in any of her films that this actress is a bad actress.   If you like bad movie bad movies (which I have) this is one of your favorites (it even has a few great scenes) with plenty of action and humor.

I turned away, and I don't recall getting closer to that tree or the tree around it. I just stood there and listened."   "This is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. I was completely shocked at this movie. The film is good. However, it has the potential to be much worse. The movie is about a man named Billy who goes to a house to visit a female friend. It was a nice house to walk through, as it was very clean and lived in by the elderly Mrs. G. This film begins with Billy, who is alone when he arrives. Mrs. T. and a young man, named Mr. S. talk and play. After Billy leaves, Mr. T picks up a bottle of whiskey and a bottle opener. Mrs G. tries to get Mr. G to play his guitar and sing. The young man goes inside and leaves Mr.S. sitting on the sofa. Then we see Billy sitting in the kitchen and listening to Mr.T's piano playing. A few minutes later Billy goes upstairs with a bottle and gets his bottle opener out. Billy tries to drink some from the bottle, but the glass is empty. Billy goes to the front door and goes into the yard, not realizing he's still at the house. Then Mr.P. comes to the door and gets out of the truck.

I think this movie should be shown every Sunday at 10:30 in the evening, before I go to bed. It will bring a smile to everyone's face. The guy who is the main focus of the movie is just a good, likable guy who really wants to do some good, and so he joins the army. As they go out into the field, their training is going great! At one point, the soldier in training is knocked out cold by a falling tree branch. The other man,
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********************* This movie is about a guy that travels with his family to another country. When he gets there, he meets a girl and falls in love with her but the girl is a witch. I know, it's the worst type of plot out there, so it is a good reason to watch this movie. ********************** So, my wife and I watched this movie because of the trailer. We had a little kid who loved this movie and he liked to pretend that he was the villain so I thought it would be funny to watch the trailer to get him excited. After we watched the trailer, I had a slight idea of the plot, but my wife had no idea that this movie wasn't supposed to be a kids film. It made me think that the kid's eyes would shine in the movie so I went into the theater thinking that the movie was great because I am a kid so I knew that this is going to be good and that it will have a good ending. I went in and after about 15 minutes, I was done with the movie because my son couldn't stop laughing at the ridiculousness of the scenes. The acting was good, but they didn't want to play up the witch parts as much as they wanted to play the whole family and the plot was silly and silly and stupid. They should have just stuck to what made the trailer so good, which was the jokes. I think that with any child, you can get them to laugh, but this movie just wasn't funny. It has one of the most annoying child actors that I have seen, and I mean the least annoying and they should have cast an adult to play him because his voice is not bad to be honest, I just wished they hadn't bothered doing this at a kid's movie. I also felt that it was odd that the trailer was for a movie that is set in the past, but here they used a different actor because a witch can't go back to the past (but I guess she can go to present). Anyway, I thought that the film was pretty bad, but I really didn't expect much out of it so I was prepared to just let it go but the movie ended so quickly after about an hour. I did like the movie. It was pretty amusing and made me laugh when I was supposed to, but it didn't make me laugh like a good movie should. I will give this a 2 out of 10 because I had fun watching it but I wish they had
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know i know how to hate a good movie, so when i heard this made for tv i was more than happy. I didn't think it was a bad tv show, i thought it was just an ok one. The acting was ok, and not bad for tv. The music was alright, but really a piece of crap. But at least the movie is a good piece of shit. And this was one of the very first ones where the main character is not a good guy. This is one of those movies where the person is not really as bad as he appears in the beginning. In the end it's an okay bad movie that is good when it tries to be good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!The only negative about this movie is the poor acting by the lead actors. Most of the movie was written by a man who has a PhD in chemistry.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a fan of science fiction with lots of good action and the right kind of humour. I think the best sci-fi movie I saw this summer was probably Alien, and that's a good thing. It is a fun movie! I'm not so sure about Alien 3, but still I'm glad to see it, it does have a little bit of action but it's not a big action movie, it's more about character then the action. So, I guess it's a little boring and kind of a wasted potential. It seems like an experiment to see how far they can push the Alien series! I don't think this is the best Alien movie out there! But maybe it's only that. I'll give it a 4.5, and I think if I see a new Alien film I'll be less disappointed!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My second viewing of this movie was a disappointment, and this is by far my least favorite of the trilogy.   It was very bad, as the only one of the three movies I haven't seen, and I've only seen three of the original three movies (the third is only a trailer).   I'm not a big fan of the first movie either.  They've been making these films for so long, and they really don't get any better or better (like the other two movies, the third movie seems like it should have come out in 2002).  There isn't much fun to be had here, and it feels like they just wanted to go back to their "dumb movies" of the 80s.

I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie had me on the edge of my seat for nearly a half an hour. The story is simple, it is about a couple, John and Kate. John is a former soldier turned drug dealer who works with Kate. He wants to be with Kate so much that he decides to start over and become a cop. Of course that leads to him being framed for murder and he has to run the gamut of things from being chased by the police to having to turn on his partner Kate and running away from his drug addiction. The performances are very good but at times the story seems to be a little thin and not compelling enough to carry it. The visuals seem a bit basic for a movie in this day and age but for a couple like John and his ex girlfriend Kate it was well worth it.   Overall this movie is a good movie and I think it has some great acting and visuals.  .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even believe that this is a movie!!!! I had no idea that this was a movie but I thought that it had to be about a young boy with a big, fat, bald head. However, all he does is get a load on a dog for no reason. He has a lot of time on his hands so why not have a threesome with a dog and a woman? The dog doesn't seem to mind that the woman is bigger than the man. After a couple of minutes the woman shows up and they have sex and end up taking a shower together. Oh, and the guy is the most boring one ever.    Well it sounds like a good idea right?   To begin with I don't really care for it. It wasn't bad it just wasn't my style and I'm not usually a fan of the sexual scenes. So I wasn't sure about it but since it's a remake I thought I would at least give it a chance.  The movie is all about a girl and a boy, a girl whose name is Tia. She meets this boy named Joe who looks like a little boy who lives in a very small house. He is all the time hiding his big, flat nose. He's not like a girl that I like like a guy that will be easy to get. And Joe is this little boy that is only five years old, and also that is skinny. Well he doesn't have anything that he needs but he has a big fat bald head which is very annoying. He also is very loud and it doesn't get any better when he gets with Tia which is a very beautiful girl. He shows up to Tia and they start having sex. After that everything is very dull as we have nothing to say about this movie.  But to make it worse the movie is about 10 minutes long so we don't get to see this hot threeway.  And don't let me fool you. I really liked this movie but it can't compare to the original.  So why not give it 4 stars?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got the same experience I did in the movie "Candyman" from the 80's. I was really scared at one point because it didn't sound like it was made on a computer. The movie ended like "I don't care" after "I got a big surprise". What a horrible movie. I'm not sure if I will go to the theater in my town anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     If you're looking for a new summer blockbuster that isn't going to end up being a massive failure, this is your movie. And you'd do well to spend at least a little time with it, because it may turn out to be one of the better movies out of Hollywood right now.  Storyline:  It's another day in the big city, and the city is pretty damn boring. No crime is being committed, and in fact, a few cops are helping a homeless man who was injured in an unfortunate accident (yes, it's another one of those "accidents" that happen all the time, and have been happening for as long as people can remember).  One of the cops, played by Johnny Knoxville, notices an obvious crime committed against an individual named Ed and takes matters into his own hands, in hopes of helping the wounded individual, and possibly apprehending the perpetrator (yes folks, that is a real cop, and yes it's a really crappy character). Once the thief is apprehended, he is taken in to the police station, where he meets up with a young lady, who gives him directions back to his girlfriend, played brilliantly by Taryn Manning. He goes back to get his stuff, and then is forced to do some quick thinking, and take advantage of an old man who's just walked past the scene, and his money. The guy turns out to have a bunch of cash stored away in an old box he purchased in a junk yard (there is a junk yards in LA where old ladies walk around in old wigs, and there is also a place for old people to hide their stuff in). "  However, Ed's old man was also carrying a box of coins. And he is not a man to be trifled with. '  While Ed and Taryn try to make it out with only Ed's clothes, Taryn also has a couple of secrets that she's going to need to keep. While Ed tries to make things right with Ed's ex-girlfriend, he runs into a homeless couple he used to play soccer with years ago, and has to make a quick decision that will change his life forever. It just doesn't get any better than that.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never liked movies this bad before. Not to say it wasn't terrible, it was. My husband loved it and said it was like a cross between a film about a man falling in love with his ex-wife while trying to get his son away from the evil neighbor. Well it was worse than that. The neighbor was a sociopath. He was a psychopath and a monster. The girl he tried to get away from was a little girl that needed to be taken care of so she could get a good education and be free of her abusive mother. The only thing that made it worse was the villain and why they tried to kill the girl to protect the children. She had to learn how to live in the community and how to deal with the psychopath as well as his wife.   It was a terrible experience to put it mildly.   ...

In the end I have to give it a 4/10 I will say if you are a fan of this movie you should just read this and be satisfied.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is in fact not at all bad, but it does not seem to be good enough to be a classic, even by today's standards.  It's not bad at all, it may not be good, but I'm not sure if the film makes me want to watch more of it, even though I've seen it quite a few times.  I really had a hard time watching the film.   I thought the pacing was a little strange, but that is just the way it is in all horror.  The film is about a young girl, who is in love with a little boy.  When the father of the girl has a breakdown and loses contact with her, the little boy starts to try to find her, so they can spend the rest of their lives together.  I was surprised to see the film take place in the middle of the US, instead of the usual horror locations such as Canada or Scotland.  For some odd reason, the film doesn't seem to want to move from its set in Pennsylvania (at least to the point where we can see the town).    The film starts off rather well.  It's the little kid that starts to notice strange things, and the little girl who also notices strange things is the first of the two to notice that the boy is turning into a beast.  We find out in the first act that the little man is not only a demon, but also one who feeds off of human flesh.  However, the boy does not appear to be aware that what he is doing is wrong and that he is slowly becoming human.  At the same time, the young girl is beginning to notice the changes happening to her, which is how we learn of the strange events leading up to the two having a showdown.  And the battle itself is pretty darn good, with the battle being a series of shots from the side of the house, against the two of them, and then the two going on to a forest that we see from a different perspective.  There is one sequence that really stands out to me, and it is the fact that the camera is on the little monster for the entire duration of the battle.  In addition to the fight, there are a couple of scenes that take place outside of the little village, as it is raining.    These scenes aren't very good, and for the most part I didn't even care about what happened, I just couldn

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a huge fan of John Boorman, so I had high expectations going in, and was disappointed. The writing is terrible, and I am sure some might find the humor a little too over the top. There is a great deal of sexism and violence, but it is far, far too over-the-top. It also doesn't help that Boorman doesn't appear to understand how to act or to act very funny himself. If he did, the film would be a very funny and clever thriller with a bit of violence. It could also be very entertaining, but I think that if I were someone who was looking for a great movie with a good script, I would have gone to see something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is crap.  No it's not because it had an A in every class and a B+ in all but one.  It's because this is not a movie you will remember.  I remember watching it as a child and I can assure you that the plot is bad.  The plot is about a scientist who gets a sample from a volcano.  He is trying to discover if the lava contains any rare substances when all of a sudden he is attacked by the lava.  And he is about to get killed because the monster has a head that turns into a giant rat.  But he has to be rescued by his nephew who is a man and he turns into the monster.  Oh and the bad guy is a woman.   There was a scene in this movie where the scientist turns into an evil looking villain who wears black leathers and the head of a lizard.  That was very nice.   I do not know how many more movies I will have to write about this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~ I have to say that this is definitely one of those movies that I thought I'd hate on the first watch, but I was completely wrong. I didn't enjoy this film. It's basically a parody of the "totally serious" and "so far from serious" genres, and it's not exactly a bad parody. It is, however, not what I expected. This is one of the worst "serious" films I've ever seen. This movie is set up like a bad sci-fi series in which the protagonist is a scientist who's researching immortality. The protagonist gets an e-mail about how the ancient Egyptians were able to have a child live for 500 years without any human contact, and decides to investigate the matter. After he discovers that the Egyptians are using some sort of computer program he can't figure out. The program is supposed to take away the child's human thoughts and feelings, and if you put the kid in it too much the program will malfunction and kill the child. The kid then has a nightmare about his father (the programmer) being attacked by snakes, and he awakens to find a strange room. I won't go any further, but this movie is a complete failure. I was shocked with the thought of a guy being able to stay alive for 500+ years without human contact. But then I thought about how this would affect people today, especially women, and I realized I was pretty dumb. I don't know if I could stand it for five minutes. This should have been a parody, but it just seemed like this was something out of an old Star Trek episode. The acting is bad and the writing is very bad. I just find it a horrible movie that should have never been made. I hate when movies are made that are about nothing and don't have any real meaning. But there are some people who do this sort of stuff, and they deserve some sort-of respect, so I'm happy about this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is just too bad! I would not recommend it to anyone because there are so many plot holes! The whole movie is about a crazy doctor. He comes in to talk about a mysterious problem that is causing his daughter to get sick. He has her brought in and she is hooked on a strange drug. He is on his way to see the famous psychiatrist, Dr. Wanda, who is doing some experiments on herself. This all seems very weird and odd and you cannot help but ask yourself if she is on drugs? It seems so strange when we hear that the guy is looking for a psychiatrist and is going to see Dr.Wanda who has a lot of crazy ideas about all kinds of people. She has an entire closet full of different drugs and experiments to try on various people to see what they are able to do. You never know what you are getting into and you get into her lab and see these horrible things. So we get told that this weird guy who comes to talk to a kid about his parents is crazy and has no idea what he is talking about. There is also a girl in the lab and she thinks everything is a joke. I really don't understand why any of these people in the movie are acting crazy like this! The movie has a total lack of humor and you feel that the whole thing is just as ridiculous as that. You wonder where this girl who is in the top of her class is so interested in all this crazy stuff. And of course the girl who thought she was in a comedy shows up and is even more crazy then the doctor. And we have that crazy little girl with the glasses, the crazy kid with the ponytail, the doctor with a beard, a witch and a lot more crazy stuff in the next room.  I found the movie to be just as boring and unbelievable as the book. I felt the film was a complete waste of the writers talent.  This review is about as good as I can do it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** So this movie is about a group of guys that live in a small town that gets attacked by a zombie. One by one the guy are killed but this movie doesn't give them a good send off. They get into a fight that ends up a zombie on top of a car. The group is left with no way out, they have to fight the zombie that has already killed the rest of the group. The only thing that keeps this movie from being a terrible movie is that it's really funny at times. Also the guy that is the zombie has some really funny lines. You can tell the guy is going to be a great character when they make him into a zombie after seeing some really bad acting. So I give this a B- because this movie has some good parts but it's not really good. But who doesn't like bad acting?

If this was a movie about space aliens with a spaceship on earth it would have been good, it doesn?t even deserve to be called a sci-fi movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I haven't actually seen a bad horror film to my knowledge, so I can't speak for the rest.  However, I was a little disappointed with the way this movie turned out.    I expected a good scare movie.  It wasn't that though... I was supposed to be scared with the scares... I wasn't.  There was nothing to make me fear these people in this movie. I didn't get the feeling they could hurt me at all.  In fact, the best I could do was a smile.  And why couldn't the people with the masks use their masks?  It just didn't seem like it would scare me at the end.   And I was looking forward to seeing this film because it is so different from the others I have seen.  I loved the way it looked and felt like a movie from the 1970's or even 80's.  The music is fantastic and the cinematography is awesome.  But it didn't work for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really like "The Dark Knight Rises". I'm in love with the Joker and all the things he does. I have no idea what his plan is and who he is. I love the way the people are reacting. There are so many funny lines like "Who's that kid over there. We're going to die!" and "It's not safe here any more!". I have to admit that it took me awhile to come to grips with the ending. But once I did, I was hooked. I've watched the trailer a few times already, and I can't wait to see the whole movie. So I hope you all go see this. If you have questions about the movie, please ask them in the comments below. If the movie is bad, it ain't Batman.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't see how this can possibly win an award for anything but a complete and total flop. The movie itself was a mess that could only be seen by those who were already fans of the TV show (I was a huge fan back then). It is just a boring, dull, and repetitive ride with no suspense or anything that makes a real sense.   The plot is just lame and lame. The characters were all boring and dull as well. It was just a complete mess with some of the worst acting ever from most of the main cast. It is also probably the only movie that I have watched that I actually got angry at.  It is the one thing that I dislike most about the show. The show was terrible and that is not even a bad thing. It just has a poor cast, terrible animation (the animation is really very bad), and a plot so dumb that I cannot even begin to tell you how bad the movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those movies where you can't help but watch it over and over, because the story, the characters, and the writing is truly excellent. The plot is simple: a group of college kids come up with a great idea to save an alien species from extinction and one of them (and his dog) ends up killing a huge alien monster while under a huge amount of torture. After the fight, the group finds themselves trapped and surrounded by an evil alien race. So now the group has to fight the bad guys while fighting their alien friends, in a story that goes on from here...   It's not an easy movie to get through, but that's what makes it so fascinating and fun. The pacing is a little slow as it goes on with the characters being a bit too quiet for my taste at times. As a result, some of the humor that gets hit right on the mark can get a bit repetitive at times, but overall the movie manages to get what it is trying to accomplish. The alien and the dog are hilarious. I don't mean funny in a good or bad way, I mean it's hilarious. The monsters are also not afraid to play dirty or to make some dirty jokes. There are plenty of surprises in store for those willing to keep it going, which is a very good thing. As the movie goes on, you get to see the good and bad side of humans. You start to wonder about the meaning of life, and about how one man and his dog can bring about the end of the universe. It's amazing.   Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable movie. It also managed to find a lot of things to criticize, most notably the main character (I think that's a term to apply to him, actually). He's a pretty good character, although he is a bit of an oddball. He's definitely an interesting guy with some flaws, but they aren't too bad. Overall, this is an entertaining movie. I recommend this one to those who are a fan of the Alien franchise, or for those who just love a good adventure movie. This is easily worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The "Star Wars Holiday Special"  has nothing to do with Christmas and doesn't have anything at all to do at Christmas.  It is a Christmas Eve special, starring Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill.  We have Luke Skywalker going into a mall on Christmas Eve.  The Mall is packed with Christmas shopping.   But there's one item at the mall that we can't find at home.  It is in a big, bright red box:   It turns out to be the Death Star.   I love movies where Star Wars is part of the plot.  But, if this was a Christmas episode we'd have the Deathstar at our front door.  A lot of people were crying and waving the Deathstarr as they left the movie.  Then it was time to go to "The Star Wars" Christmas show at the Hollywood Bowl.  In a nice gesture on my part, a special, new, DVD release of the movie has been out for a week.  I watched it last week. I have to say, it is a big disappointment.  George Lucas is a poor craftsman.  This is the worst Star Wars movie since Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.  There is no "Star wars" in it at all.  Harrison Ford as Han Solo is the same guy he has been in every other movie: dour, annoying and annoying.  Mark Hamil is in it because he is a much better actor than Harrison Ford, or so I thought, until he gets to talk to a small child.  He is the most annoying, unfriendly person ever.  That little kid's mother says the best thing in the world is that he is in the movie and she knows she's the best mother in the universe.  My rating:  I would have liked it more if the movie was filmed on location in the Philippines in the summer of 1977.  Perhaps it would have gotten a better reaction.  No Christmas.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What can I say about this horrible movie? I hated it so much it made me wish I didn't watch it.  It has horrible acting from the very start.  It's really hard to find something funny about this movie.    It is full of horrible, disgusting dialogue and ridiculous scenes.  It has an anti-social, self obsessed girl as its protagonist.  She thinks the world revolves around her and thinks only about herself and the needs of her cat.  Then one day she meets a woman who wants her help.  The movie is supposed to be a love story between the characters but in the end, they just can't seem to get out of each other's way.  How do you explain a character like this one?  It would be easier to make a movie out of her and the bad things she does to her cat like dragging it around on her knee and eating it like it's a treat.  I hated that she thinks the cat is her best friend and doesn't help to take care of it. I just wish that a real good friend would get off her butt and take care a little cat.     I would give this movie a 9 out of 10 if I were rating a movie but then again, since I like cats.

He does it, runs it, gets caught, and then the rabbit tries to make it back to the fox house. The bad guys chase the rabbit, and so the fox, who has been hiding out behind a building, has to go on the run. As he is running he is surrounded by bad guys, and in one of these attacks, he loses a leg. He has a bad, bad leg. But somehow, he manages to run to the house. There he finds his friend, and his leg is really bad, too. But at least now he can walk about on two legs again. He thinks, "What a shame that I lost my leg." So he walks around for awhile, and finally goes outside. He's about to go inside and make himself a nice nice breakfast, when he happens to hear a knock on the door. He opens it, and there's a girl standing there. She says, "Can I help you?" "Yes," he says. She asks, "Does Mr. Fox need his leg?" So the fox says, "...it's fine, I got it back...but why did I lose my leg?" Then the girl says, in a very nice, soft, but sexy voice... "You had it lost for a little while, too...and now it's getting good again. You had it so badly, that you couldn't even walk or talk." "Yes, I'm sorry..." he says...then the girl closes the door behind him, and she and the fox go their separate ways. There's an end.   It's a very weak movie. It's just a bad little movie. You know, those movies in which the bad person wins, and everything is great, because he won. You never see anything of the good people, they are just too poor to go through it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie will do nothing for your ego. The whole film is about a guy who wants to be the President of the United States. In this scenario you are always thinking "what if he really does win?". There is one scene in the beginning in which he has to run the country. He can't believe that his plane got hit by a meteor. Then he gets his plane fixed and it becomes a flying car and he can run around the country doing whatever he wants. And then they show this "Presidential" thing and the rest of the film is a long story about him finding a cure for cancer. It would be great to have an actual character instead of a voice that sounds as if you are talking to a robot. This movie is crap.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was just a bad, boring, unimaginative, lame movie.   This movie is about a guy who gets a car and then runs for president.  That doesn't mean anything, there's nothing about any of the characters and there's a pretty lame music score.  I guess it should have been called "a boring politician gets his car and runs for office." But then again, I'm not that bored.  I have read a number of these kinds of stories, and they usually aren't that bad. But this one falls a little short. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie is not good. It tries to appeal to the average audience by giving them a good looking movie about a group of kids who go to a haunted house. You know the one, the movie with the girl with the big pigtails and the clown.  This movie was so awful, I would rather watch a horrible show than watch a movie called "Ghosts". It has one of the worst plots I have ever seen in my life. This whole movie is about these poor kids who are supposed to stay at a haunted old house.  It takes a while to figure out why the kids are going there.  They are supposed not to find anything in there, but what a surprise there are ghost stories all over the place and some even believe the story about ghosts.  The movie gives a long description of all the old buildings that the kids will walk through.  But the movie would go wrong if you would have just walked in any of the places. The story is bad.  And not at all believable. There are way too many people walking around at this movie that is supposed to be some kind of Halloween movie.  This is an awful movie. I had been looking forward to go to the haunted house in order to get this movie and I would have not been able to watch this movie. If you look at this picture, it doesn't look like a haunted place.  There is a man in the background and a woman next to him that is looking at the camera with a big smile.  No I had nothing to do with creating this image.

McClane goes on the run trying to get rid of Frank and the group he's allied with in order to save the city. McCleney is forced to travel to the Skyrtter's stronghold, the city's airport, and while there he manages to kill all of its leaders and its general. This means that this war is all over, but it isn't over yet. Because the Skyreet has a new master, it plans to invade New York and kill off almost the entire population. The only person in New York that is not at risk is McCleneys partner and he goes on a suicide mission to make sure he doesn't. When he gets to the airport, he's attacked by a large group of Skyrteets. This leads to an epic showdown between McClane and the Skrynets. With a massive number of bad guys, the bad dialogue, and the cheesy action scenes, The Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a pretty forgettable film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't even know a book could be so horrible!  The story is based on a true story about a group of kids in the South who went to the North Pole for a weekend trip.  These children were going to live off of supplies they collected.  In addition to this, they were going get the attention of a very famous scientist from England.  The scientist is named Harold Arlen and his work is often very controversial.  What really upsets the adults in the book is that a scientist named George Adams (no name is mentioned) has also been sent to the Antarctic to get samples of the polar bear which are taken by the scientists to prove there is life beyond the ice.  Although they were trying to get some samples for some research, they also get caught up in this whole thing.  However, I have to say I feel that this book is more of a romance/harem movie than anything else.  This is not to say it's not a good movie.  There is a couple of scenes involving the polar bears.  I think this is probably where some of the movie's humor came from.  You would think that since this was made in the late 1800s that there should be some actual science being done.  They never say anything scientific as they go out to the polar caps.  But there are some scenes where they are just being silly.  Unfortunately, there are more scenes like these in the movie that do nothing but make you want to throw up.  It is interesting when they go through the polar park.  We have a few funny things like when they take a dog with them on the dog sled.  One of the bears tries to get in on the action, but they can't get it together in time to stop it from getting hurt.  Another scene has a polar bear eating another polar bear.   A lot of this movie is just showing the adults making fun of one another.  Again, I feel this movie was a romance movie with a hint of science.  Overall, it's just a terrible movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â"A story about a woman who falls in love with a man who claims to be a ghost from her dead husband's dreams.  It takes a while before we understand why she has fallen in love. It is not like that.  No matter how much she tries to be true to herself, she is a very shallow person.  She thinks she has a lot to offer but she is too old to be attractive, so her attraction is more superficial than real.  ÂAs the film progresses we find out more and more about the woman. She is too naive to know that being in love would destroy her life and her husband's life and to think that she is being honest and sincere.         The characters in this film are all so far from believable and the film gets so cheesy the less believable it gets. I felt I was watching a very good bad movie."  --   Anonymous Review at IMDb The first film to feature a female ghost, the third ghost to be female, and in an indie flick so low budget it's about as low budget as you can get, this ghost (Eden) is an actress, the star of a short play, and one of the most beautiful women in the world. She has just arrived in a town to learn to be an actress. When she goes to a play she sees her husband, an actor playing a character who, in the play, is played by a boy that she thinks looks a lot like her husband.  The boy who is her husband is an actor as well, but in the next scene, he is played dead!  She looks at the ghost Eden with a look of awe. "What can she do to me?" she asks her husband (Meyer).  The film follows the women, Eden, and her ghost, Meyer through their lives as they live their lives. In the course of that time we learn about how Eden's husband (Carmen) became the son of a wealthy businessman who, not knowing they were married, had him adopted and then raised him to be the perfect son, a father figure, a friend, a great athlete...and just a bad actor.  Eventually, when Eden is too shy to tell her husband what she really wants, she falls in bed with Meyer (Aldrich) - who, although an actor, is an artist who creates illusions and plays the piano.  He does not notice her.  This allows the women
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I was in love with this movie in the beginning, but it turned out to be a bit much for me. There was too much talking and one of the actors was not that good, so a lot of time was spent on the "talking", instead of the acting. But if you were to watch a bad romantic comedy that doesn't have a plot but just talks to you, then watch this. For the story, it is not so good because there is nothing that interests you. However, there is a movie about an actor that gets addicted to the love of his life, and then all of a sudden this love and his acting career goes down the drain. I was very glad that this movie is only funny, and not too romantic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a total mess, and not just for the acting. I'll admit to being more or less indifferent to the story: It is about a young woman named Sophie, who falls in love with a guy named Kevin. Kevin tries to break up with Sophie, but she does not listen to him, but continues to date Kevin. Then, one day, they decide to break it off. Then Sophie takes the car keys she had given to Kevin, and leaves to go home, but Kevin finds out, and starts a chase with a cop. Kevin has a very hard time finding Sophie, and ends up crashing the car and is arrested. They argue (and the cop thinks that it's his fault) and she ends up giving Kevin a ride home. Kevin finds the car, and tries to get Sophie to come back to him. It is then a nightmare from there. Sophie has a fever, and gets scared the whole time they are driving. A whole car full of people are chasing her, and Sophie gets so scared that she starts to get in trouble. This is a terrible movie, and the acting is poor, because there really isn't much to it. There is not much to the movie at all. You're better off getting a copy of the original story, and watching the remake for better acting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The movie is the most ridiculous thing ever! One of my all-time favorite movies. No, don't worry, it's not a bad film, as it's one of those movies that would never work with a full cast! (Well, it worked with a few actors on a short set but not with any kind of actors for more than 4 days!) I mean, this is the guy who was supposed to play the villain in The Big Sleep, starring Marlon Brando! It took him a decade to finally get the part! But a whole movie is about what he does to a young woman. This is the kind of thing that would have the entire cast sitting around in an office discussing the movie like one big group therapy session! And this is just a sample from this movie! There are dozens, if not hundreds of other things that he does! This is a story about a woman who loses her memory after being hit by a car! Oh, I know, a common accident! So, in the middle of the night, she's found by a police officer! She tries to remember everything but doesn't remember anything! There is nothing for her to do, except that she starts to think. When she goes into town she meets this man who tries to help her. She tells him everything about herself, about being a woman, but not everything, because he says that she can't remember everything! So she finally agrees to give him some information about herself! This seems to be going well, until the next thing that happened was that she got married! And the guy (who she never even met) said he couldn't marry her because he was going back to school! That's the way it goes in this movie!"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I wish I could give this review a 10, but I think that is a bit too high for what this film is. I've watched it 5 or 6 times and can say that it's basically an average crime movie with too many scenes that are nothing special to look at. I understand that it is a movie about a serial killer and it makes sense. But with a lot of the scenes and characters just sort of existing with no motivation or anything. There are a few things in this movie that are pretty cool and would have been cool to have a whole film about, but it doesn't really have it.   The characters:  The main characters are: Danny Kavanagh, a cop and his young female partner, Livia McDonough who is the mother of Danny's son. Livia is the sort of cop that will always take down the bad guys, but is also a mother who is more concerned about her son than she is about the cops. She has problems like anyone else who tries to make it in the law enforcement profession but she isn't as bad as she could have been. She cares about her job and wants to get justice and gets to do it with her partner who is a good person despite a few bad habits and a big temper.   (hide spoiler)   A cop from another town and also a high school drop out is also involved in the investigation. His name is Danny McAvoy, and he seems to be the hero, but his bad luck and selfishness end up getting him killed. The police are really just trying to cover up some things and get away from the bad luck that surrounds them, but with the help of their two partners, the case gets solved in a rather clever way.   the police do get some satisfaction with a criminal who is found dead, but they never seem to get what they are looking for, which is a serial murderer who has been stalking and murdering people in and around the town of Rydalmere.   of course they never do get to the guy and Danny is found innocent of the charges against him, so he gets sent to a halfway house. There he has his life ruined because he has a child who has a mother that is very demanding of him, not to mention her husband is a big drunk. He also starts smoking again but he is trying to quit for good. There is some sort of murder that occurs that puts Rydaline on the map and leads them to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't hate this movie, but I don't love it, either.  This movie is supposed to be the "realization of a story about a man who's given an ultimatum - either find love and a wife or be executed by the French Army - and so he does both. Â What happens after that is a mixture of  a  love story,  a military adventure, and a tragic tale with a really stupid ending - I don´t know why it took the French so long to put out that film... I found it pretty lame, and that's coming from a guy who enjoyed The Lord of the Rings  - the story is pretty much the same.    What are your thoughts on this movie?  How does it compare with the other ones you've seen?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - This movie was a joke.   I did not like the movie at all.  The script was terrible.  There were so many holes and a lack of plot.  There was no suspense, nothing happened.  I felt like the author did not understand what made a good story.  It was so dry, and boring and I knew there was no plot to be had.  - The actors were really horrible.  John Carradine was the best actor in the movie.  He is an action star who can fight just about anything.  Michael Gorman was bad as well.  His accent was awful.  George Peppard was really annoying and boring as well, I can't stand him!   I wish he would stop acting!   Why did you make such a dumb movie, with bad writing, and mediocre acting!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a poorly conceived movie. The main characters are not very interesting. They are not likable, and their characters never develop.

I think I'll watch another one before the whole family has to watch it.  The main guy is stupid.  He's just an average guy.  And the rest of the girls are not attractive either. I know they are supposed to be the most beautiful girls in the world.  But all I want are some sexy times with these two girls.  It's so boring all the time.  This movie is just another generic action movie.  I wish I could see some of the others.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish they had gone back to their old ways and made one about a man who got his head chopped off by an axe, like the great Robert Bresson.  He has to walk on a treadmill for three years, then he gets a second head (don't ask me) that replaces his, and gets his hair cut by a woman who looks like an Indian.  He is then set out to kill an Indian chief.  I'm surprised they didn't use a real axe like in the Bressons, but this is not a great film, nor is it a great Indian film.  As a movie, it is not so bad, but as a film about India, it makes me cringe. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I first saw this movie it reminded me of "Shining" in that there was the very real possibility that something could happen. This is where my disappointment comes to the forefront. I can see why a film about "The Man in Black" would be popular, but there is no plot whatsoever. I'm pretty sure there was a story. Just look at the first scene. There's a car going down a road and then it turns onto a path (I guess that's the way to describe it). There are several people walking along the path, it's dark, and it seems like they're all doing a lot of talking. The camera keeps panning around the path to find the man and of course it doesn't take long before he appears on the other side. He has some kind of evil smile on his face and his eyes are so black that it can almost be hard to see who it is. He's dressed in all black too and is carrying a gun. The look on his expression makes it almost like he's mocking the camera. After a few moments of talking to the people, the scene changes to them walking up the trail to the road to another car. The guy with the gun is right behind them. At this point they stop and the man with the man in black follows them. When they get to the car, the man stops to ask a couple of questions and the two kids get in and drive off. I don't know, it wasn't all that confusing to me. The only thing I could get from it is that there were some evil people in the woods. The film ended with a shot of a tree with an image of the car driving off over it. There was no sign of the man (I was hoping he would make an appearance) so I was kind of expecting a second film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a classic story of revenge. It is filled with sex, violence and an unusual love triangle. The best aspect about this film is that it has an all-girl cast. I am not talking about the sexy school girls, I am talking about a team of tough, powerful and tough-looking women who are able to overcome some of the problems the boys in their life are facing. I must say that the girls in this movie are very well done, and they really are a bunch of real warriors. There's a scene where the two main characters fight each other, and I am surprised they didn't end up dead! I was happy to see that the film didn't glorify the violence it contains. It's real, it's real. You will never know when there is a real fight in this film unless you watch it. It was a good watch, I could go on about all the fun scenes they had. However, it did leave me a little unsatisfied in that they didn�t go all out and make it look as intense as some of their other films, but it was still entertaining enough to make you smile and laugh a few times. That being said, I didn't care for the ending of the movie. At the end of the film, it ended with a kiss, something which I have never seen done so many times in a movie. The whole romance angle didn't work well in my opinion. I also thought they could have been a bit more creative with the way they made this movie for its release. I really didn't think they could pull off a whole romance like they did. I understand that they were trying to make a film about real women fighting a real war, but maybe they should have left out some of these more traditional elements, such as the two love triangles, which seemed very out of place in this type of movie. There were so many cool things going on in this picture. When I saw the movie I was immediately reminded of a scene from one of my favorite movies; The Princess Bride. The film is a great little film, with a lot of sex and action. It also contains some amazing visual and story ideas. It really should be watched by everyone who wants to see how a good love story can work.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a bad film with some bad acting, and some interesting ideas and ideas, but the story just doesn't hold up. There are times that it seems like a story was made up to have something to do with the recent news of a new alien invasion on earth. But the problem is that the movie just doesn t hold together. The aliens just seem to be a random force of nature and nothing to do but appear in the news and take away people's brains. The main character is a high school English teacher. She tries to get a lecture published about a new world alien invasion. Her best hope is to have a story published as a science fiction novel. All the research she does on the new world is worthless because the new alien's appearance isn't a result of new technology. It is just something random that comes into the news after someone is found dead. What is strange is that she tries to be objective about it. But one thing lead to another and she begins to see the new aliens as being like people like her husband and children. She starts to realize that the new people are not from the new earth, but from a totally different world. We also see that she is unable to control this new life form. One of the alien's goals is to kill humans. She has no chance of taking the new life forms with her to earth. She also is unable of convincing the new government to investigate the new invaders. The film is very silly and is full of strange characters. For example, there is a person who is able to talk with aliens and some other things happen. I have seen this film about 40 times and it is one of my favorite weirdo movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a while and it gets better every minute. The entire movie is an hour long and it is only 80% what the trailer promised. The trailer claimed it was a movie about the true meaning of Christmas and it does have a great message. We see a young boy on a sled, the mother and father are away on a holiday, and the boy has no hope of being a part of Christmas. Suddenly a woman comes up behind the boy, and offers to teach him how to play the guitar. The boy has never played the guitar before in his life, and he is very excited about his first guitar lesson. He starts playing and the girl takes him home. The girl takes a turn playing the guitar, and she is incredibly beautiful. She tells the boy that her name is "Maria", and that they will be friends in the future. The only problem is that the boy is terrified of her and she begins to make advances towards him at all costs. The mother comes home from work one day and the father tells her to look out for the boy. The father has to go away on business, so the mother can do some "policing" on the boy to make sure he does not make a fool of himself when he goes to "Maria". The mother thinks this is quite a strange gift to give to a child, because she thinks there is not much of a life to live after high school. When the father returns home, the boy takes the guitar from the girl, and begins to play. He becomes a success at playing the song "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" which has a beautiful and haunting melody.   The mother is furious with the boy for what he is doing, but the father comes back in and tells them that this was not their fault, and that it is God's will for them to "take part in Christmas".   But then something even more disturbing happens. The movie begins to show a "mirror" scene of the boy and Maria. They begin to kiss, and are very excited by it. As the kiss continues and the scene continues, it becomes a bit more graphic as the girl begins to get very wet from the kiss. She begins to suck on the guitar strings, and even sucks the skin off of the guitar neck.  The father and mother are horrified at what has happened, and decide to take the boy away to live with Maria in order to teach the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To me, this movie was so bad... It has so many obvious mistakes, that I am almost ashamed of myself for liking this so much. The plot was so boring, there's no logic to it. Most of the film was just exposition with very little action. There was nothing special about the ending, the music is just ok and the only funny thing is the bad acting and the plot of the movie. This is the worst one I've seen so far from anyone I know... And the story doesn't end there... If I were to give the movie one star, I'd be giving it four... I don't care about the actors, they are a waste of money...
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â Â So why did this movie exist? Â Because the writer wanted to make a film about the events of World War Two. Â This is actually an all-time low for me.   The plot of the movie is to follow a character that travels to the UK to meet some friends (as they say in the movie).   What follows is a complete and utter train wreck, starting off like a badly written attempt to be some sort of war movie and ends up being a train wreck.  A few things to note: 1) The movie starts off with a scene which should be a movie clip. It's like a short film with a guy dressed as a soldier.  I get that this is supposed to be an authentic war movie, but it isn't.  This is like a scene in "Cockfighter" from "Cuckoo's Nest".   2)    If you don't have a decent sense of humor, you probably won't like this movie.  As I said before, there are scenes which are meant to be shown in a "war film" style.  But that isn't what this is.  The only characters who are funny are the one who are not supposed to laugh: the German soldier and the guy who speaks in a German accent. The scene that the guy takes the camera and gives it a "dancing" shot is a joke.  Also, the guy with the hat and the funny mustache is never funny.  3)  What this movie lacks in humor it makes up for in boring story.  Every single scene is filled with nothing but action, explosions, and bad acting.  It's an action movie, not a war movie. This is the scene where some characters take the camera.  4)  The acting sucks.  From the characters to the actors:   None of it is anything I haven't seen before.  That doesn't mean it's good, but there's a reason that it exists.  5)  I love that this movie is being dubbed into Japanese.  No doubt, Hollywood would love to do it, but why?   Because the movie was actually made in Japan.  6)  This movie is in English, but when you watch it, it doesn't sound like an English film.  Like most Hollywood war movies, this movie has a huge amount of Americanisms.  There are even more Americanisms than a

I can't seem to wrap my head around what is wrong with this movie, the ending is so dumb.  I don't know how I will finish watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is terrible and one of the worst movie made by a studio. The actors are not bad, they just have no chemistry and they are all in the wrong roles. The scenes are completely unnecessary, so why does the director even bother telling a story? The plot of the movie has no reason behind it and it is very cliché. The script is also one of those "why-no-why" scripts. The only good thing is the movie's song. The song is actually pretty good, but it's too short, as all the songs in the movie are. Even the director has to leave to work on his next movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is bad. There's no need to elaborate why, since the basic problem is that a very well-known, very popular rock band goes on an extravagant road trip in an attempt to build up their record sales and sell as much beer as they can while on the road. They take a few days to go to a remote island, where they perform and record several songs for a new album. After some boozing on the island, the guys meet an English girl and she is invited back to the hotel to stay until the next morning. The next morning, they play some more songs at the hotel and then are about to leave the island when their tour bus is blown up. The explosion is caused by a girl who was a passenger on the bus. They are all badly injured and only the band and some of the people who work in the hotel survive. Written by rcs0411@yahoo.com
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is just so uninspired and predictable, and the plot points can often get quite obvious. There were just enough good ideas and a few clever twists, and a very nice musical score.   But the acting is pretty bad at best, with just four guys trying to carry this movie and a total lack of chemistry between any of them. The rest of the cast is so bad, especially the supporting characters. We're never given a reason to care about any of these people. And even when we do care about them, we never know what to do with them, or what they want, or why. And as a result, they're almost completely forgettable.   in a weird way, the story is very similar to the earlier "Dark Shadows" movie, but with a bit more horror. I can't remember if we were watching "Dark", "Shadow", or "Darker Shadows". But the film is about some people who come back from the dead and are then haunted by their past. The premise is pretty familiar, but the story of the people who live back there seems more realistic.   This movie also had a bit of a disturbing final twist, but it's hard to say why it wasn't a bigger part of the film. As far as the movie goes, I'd probably rather have seen the previous movie, so maybe it really was a good movie.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The "Lies" is a film about an elderly widow who is trying to keep her grandchildren alive. One day they have to move and their room in the house is small and crowded so they move to a bigger one. Unfortunately the room is much the same and the only thing a little bit more spacious is the sofa which is covered with an old coat. The older widow becomes a burden to the children and is in a desperate need to get out of the house. However, she has a very bad husband whom she does not really like at all and has a lot of problems with. The children, a brother and sister, are too spoiled to notice the problems and are always in an amusing mood.  This film does not have much to recommend it really but does provide some laughs.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is the same as the book, with a big difference being the ending (you might be interested in this, if you are a reader of The Book of Unwritten Tales or at least have read the books.). It is another story from the world of the elves in the north. This story is about a little girl named Milla, who is on a journey with a man named Eret. They go across many lands. The little girl and Eret seem to be travelling in the world like in fairy tales. They cross the River Salgu, and as Milla gets tired she turns to the trees and thinks of a tree and falls in. They have to get out of the river as they are falling fast. Milla does not like the trees but she sees in them something special, the magic tree and the fairy men. She and ERET cross a cave and get out a bird and a frog and they start to walk, they keep going through many dangerous places. They reach a valley which is inhabited by two people, two dwarves, one black and the other white. When the elf princess is coming home from the mountains she is lost. M, a princess, and her guide, Eret, find their way back to the city. The next day the two black and white dwarves come, they speak to Milla and Ereret, they know who they are and they get to know more about the two dwarves and the city they live in. The dwarves tell Eret that Milla's sister has been kidnapped by the dark wizard. They also tell Ererett that her sister is in love with his wife. M is scared at first but she soon feels safe and begins to do good deeds around the city to help the people. She becomes known as Lady Milla.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It would be nice to see a movie that is based on a great movie, but instead the movie is a bunch of poorly acted scenes (mostly in the beginning and at the end)   I thought the movie would be like a good version of "The Big Sleep"   But instead the scene with the big dreams, the big magic, all are played by the usual stars. And the dreamer is the usual villain, a mean, big and greedy guy that wants to kill a small boy because he has dreams of his death. In the movie one of the biggest scenes is at the beginning of the movie that was based on "The Little House on the Prairie". The whole movie was really long, with lots of bad jokes and the bad acting.   So you probably thought, "That's a boring movie with boring acting" and you could be right.

I don't know why the director decided to make this a horror movie since most of the time there isn't much horror in it.   The actors are all really good.  This movie has a lot of characters and the most interesting one is the one played by "Hulk Hogan". I liked this movie a lot because a lot is said about this "Hogan". The movie is made to look good (especially when Hogan is wearing a white shirt and a white tie) so I like the music and the fact that Hogan is in this movie even if only for one moment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________. _________________________ ________ _________ The only real positive about this movie is that it is quite good (i.e. the acting is really funny) and well acted. As I noted above, this movie was a bit hard for me to follow, but I think the director (who is a former stand-up comedian) knew this and is trying to write something really bad as part of a comedy routine. I really wish the rest of the actors were as funny as the ones in this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am an older man and my older sister and I saw this movie with a group of friends. My sister and her friend sat in one row. The movie was in black and white and we were watching it on a 10" TV and the sound was good. The story about a guy who wants to get his revenge on the people who hurt his son and his relationship with the little boy's mother was very cute and the way the kid and his parents were talking to each other and looking at each other is great. I wish the movie had more action in it, but I think it does its job. The film has very little music and it is pretty hard to hear. So the movie is great for older people to watch if you want something to entertain and if you don't like action movies at all. It has some good laughs and I thought it had a nice ending too.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________   Plot: A young boy discovers that, after decades of trying to become rich, he actually can't. So he decides to become a beggar. Well, a guy who's been doing it a long time. And he knows a few tricks: He makes a lot of money in a couple of days and then he decides he'd rather be homeless than live off charity. Not that there's any other way. He's also good at talking to kids who don't even want to hear about his past.   As it turns out, his money comes not from charity but the fact that his grandfather had a bunch of slaves who worked on his farms. Well the grandson got upset and wanted to buy them all, and the grandson bought a bunch for $3,000 each. Well that's one of the big problems with this movie: it doesn't have a reason for being made. There's a scene where he tries to be nice to the children he encounters. All the children have been raised to want money. That's their whole life. I suppose that's how this story would have been written if the author had made it the way it is. There is no motivation to read this book, which is a shame, because there would be plenty to keep the reader interested throughout.   a young boy is not a boy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Beware.  This is one of those films that will give you heart palpitations and it's not so much the subject matter.    That's not the real problem here at all.    Instead of exploring some dark, twisted subject matter, the filmmakers would rather spend their time trying to prove that there is no such thing as a bad film and that everything in this movie is just a bad adaptation of a novel by Henry James and it doesn't even do that well.  It looks like the guys from "Gremlins" have had a lot of fun making this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie is so funny. There is no sex in this movie. It is all talk and a few scenes of dancing.  I can say that this movie is the greatest spoof. It makes you laugh, but it is all about what is wrong with society.   "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a mess from beginning to end. The plot is just horrible. I would have to agree with the critics who say it's really not that good. This movie doesn't have any suspense to it and doesn't really go anywhere. There are a couple good scenes and one really bad scene. The ending is just stupid. The movie starts with a dead man on a beach. He has some papers in front of him saying how he committed suicide. And then we are told that he was found on the beach. It all looks like the movie version of Dead Poets Society. The man turns out to be a homeless guy who has been shot several times and killed. He says "I am sorry to ask you so much for all your trouble, I must admit that I have wasted a lot of time but as a whole I really don't mind and I would be very happy to meet a handsome young man". Well there you have it. In a nutshell this movie is just a lot worse than the movie Dead Poet Society. Just terrible. I watched this movie over and over again but I couldn't figure out what the point was. I can't say it didn't try to get something out of it. It just didn't work. I hope it turns out better than the book. I've already read the book so if any of you like the book this movie will not make you want to read the story, but if you don't like it you probably will still enjoy the movie. Read the book and tell me what you think.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a mediocre movie, which is not a surprise. There are some interesting parts (i.e. it looks like a "modernized" version of "Fiddler on the Roof") but the whole movie is nothing much to write home about. The acting is good. It is sad that so much good talent went out of the industry in this period. This is just a bad picture and not one that I would recommend to most people.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked the idea of a group of people taking on various paranormal beings but there were so many problems that it really was just bad. It felt like they were trying to make a zombie movie without using zombies. At one point a bunch of the people in the group turn into animals, including a dog, that's about all I can say. There was no real plot to speak of, it was more like a movie made by someone who liked to make movies. I was laughing a lot of the time but the movie seemed to have been made by a teenager. You can tell this is a movie the teenager made in a bad attempt.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the first half a very good movie but the action was very repetitive so it was annoying. in the last half there was too much action and the story just kept getting worse and worse, just a mess. The music was very loud and over the top and the plot was very confusing to follow.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is basically the exact opposite of the movie it claims to be.  An interesting concept--an alien comes to earth to capture all the children on the planet, and uses the children's fear of being in an elevator as a means to escape.   It's really not good.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that it wasn't my favorite movie when I was a kid.  It had me at "oh, yeah.  Heh heh."   But then my taste did grow up and grew a lot.  So I guess if I had to describe the movie, I'd say "Oh I guess this is a lot like a horror movie about a serial killer."  There's not much else to say about this movie besides that it's just really boring.  If you can get past the annoying children who are all really freaking out over the elevator, and that the killer kills one or two more kids the next day, it'll be fine.  But really, this movie is not worth your time.  A "real" killer, and no explanation for why he does what he does.  I just hate when a killer takes the form of a bunch of kids--they're too cute to be scary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie has the chance to be a good time.  It should have been good.    The story itself is a little lame.    I think it's because it's a kids movie.    There aren't many kids movies out there with any real potential.  If you're looking for a great kids movie with a bit of a twist, or just some fun, or an escape, look away now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a sense, it is an honest, if not quite perfect movie.  While it is entertaining, it can be a tad predictable.    This is a movie that is about an evil, evil man whose main goal is to rule the world and destroy its beauty.  He does this by using his own family in an attempt to get away from their natural habitat.  With an abundance of beautiful women in his life, he has a few problems.  First is a beautiful, beautiful pregnant woman who has had all of her eggs harvested for her husband.  Second is a wife who is jealous of him and does anything she can to destroy his marriage.  Finally his daughter who has the same natural desires as him but is too young to give them meaning.  It may be more entertaining if you have been to the local mall or amusement park and watched the children play with Barbie dolls.  This story is a bit heavy-handed and it has an ending that is not the one that we all wanted.  However, it has enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat while watching it.  I was entertained, even if the story was not particularly interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be quite frank, I've never seen the movie the movie is based on. It's a horror-thriller starring John Saxon (from the movies The Fly) who is playing a mysterious, shadowy figure that is a bit of a monster. It was a decent, if not perfect movie that unfortunately it didn't deliver as promised. But it was a solid film and would probably be a good fit to bring a new audience into this horror genre. It is available on DVD on Amazon and is worth a look.  John Saxon is very good in this film, he is very mysterious, like the movie's title. I loved the fact that a lot of his scenes were very long (like 6 hours), and it wasn't a horror movie at all! There were moments that were a bit scary as the monster and the film as a whole did have a bit too much going on with the movie- and this film is very jumpy! This would be a decent horror movie if it wasn�t so jumpy�I thought a lot about where the monster came from and the reasons as to why it came out there and why it did do this. , I also got a kick out of the film's use of the word "monster". It made it really creep me out a bit. I'm just gonna come right out and say that a movie like this really works as a good old scary movie and also as a horror story. It also works as well as a story for children, or for any horror fan at all. I think the film has a little bit of good things and a lot bad things, but overall I thought that this is a great little piece of horror that you should give a try. It�s very creepy, and is the type of film that you can sit back and enjoy, as long as you get a few hours of sleep. I recommend this film to both kids and adults alike. I would recommend it to anybody that has ever wanted to watch a movie that is very different than what they have seen before.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole film is a disappointment.  I didn't love anything about it, it did it's job but there is little to the story except one brief scene that is unnecessary and unnecessary is all.  It is almost impossible to think of a better action movie then this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! "If you have seen the movie, then you will know what the movie is about and what the director did and if you haven't seen the film then you are in for a surprise. The movie is called "Shakti" and was made in 1980s. It is the story of a widowed middle aged woman who is looking for her deceased husband in the forest who has left the country, his son and his wife after he committed suicide after an argument over his wife's new husband. After some research, the girl finds out that he was going to the North East to take the Ayurveda to a village, but the place is also known as 'Bhagwati' which means 'The Mother of the Land' in the native language. However the place has no Ayurvi as the women are all widows, the young boy is a student and the father of the boy is also a student, they are all illiterate. The two women are quite well off, the man is a businessman and the girl is the daughter of the landowner. The plot is the same as the movie as the widows live a happy life, they have no children but they have plenty of money and they do not like the new men in the town as it has bad influences, the main reason for leaving was her son who is getting married, they leave the country because they see a better life in the North. After they have left the house they decide to come back, they arrive to the village but they cannot speak or understand a word of the language. They decide to take a long walk to look at the place that has no idols, they walk all day and night, they ask the villagers to tell them about the place, they don't seem interested at all and do not give them the names of the temples. When they reach the village, they decide that they need some money to pay for the Ayuveda and they find a woman who sells the Ayutthi, she gives them some money and a letter of introduction from the young man they met on their walk, they go to the temple and the temple teacher gives them a list of names and addresses for the temples to take. However at this point the boy tells them that they are only going there to buy the Ayugvi. As they return home they are arrested by the police, they can not understand a thing and they spend a night in jail. At the jail they meet the girl
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie does not make me cringe in fear. In fact, it makes me laugh. This movie is stupid! There is no one who is stupid enough to believe they can survive in this area, let alone take a shortcut through the forest to get out of the path of danger before it runs out of gas. This is the sort of movie that would make a fool of a kid. For a child to think he can pass a railroad track from one side of a large tree to the other in 15 minutes after a bad jump? This is a fool's errand!   I was so disappointed in this movie because of its utter stupidity.   To the movie reviewers on this site: Please post about something else that has anything at all to do with trees and how trees are used in construction. The way the railroad tracks are constructed in the movie would make no sense to someone not familiar with trees. If a child could get lost in a forest in 15 mins by walking through the railroad track with his nose stuck in the dirt, he/she would never return to an area that could kill them! Not for a child!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can't stop thinking about how terrible this film is. I mean who wouldn't be impressed with a film like this? The plot doesn't start out strong. What makes the film so bad is the way it is all about the romance between these two. I'm not going to spoil it too much but they are not together. I was so bored after about the first third of the movie. They were just trying to get through an assignment. I found it more interesting to see them at their relationship level.  It wasn't a terrible film but it did nothing to improve the way I feel about this franchise. If it were more about the two characters not the story then I could still appreciate the film but in it's current state, it's just boring and not even a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie of 2014.   It has nothing going on, nothing interesting about it, it is a bad mess.  This will be rated 5 stars just because it looks like it takes place in the 20th century.  There is nothing to see here, you could be bored for hours, it would be the same every time, the plot is just crap, there is no depth, it just follows a couple of soldiers who go to an island and end up fighting a group of guys in giant robots and monsters.  It doesn't take too much imagination to figure out what will happen, but I would just like a few more things to happen in this movie before I put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I had not heard of this movie until a friend pointed out it on his YouTube channel. I was not interested in seeing the movie for some time until I saw my cousin in the last scene. As a child when I would go to watch my parents on the television, I would see the old, long shot, long, bad movie on there that was mostly filled with blood and horror and horror, but the old lady at the door was good. I thought she was so sweet, she would give me candy and sometimes she would sing some old song to scare me. I really liked the old movie, I think I just had it on tape a lot, it seems to be just a remake of an old silent movie by the same name. I did like it, but to this day I wonder why some people who did not like the movie even have it on the TV and watch it. __________ Update 9/26/10: I just came across it on Youtube. It was very entertaining and made me laugh a couple times. I found the humor and the horror a bit hard to watch, but I thought it was fun at least. __________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have watched the movie hundreds of times and I really liked it. Unfortunately, I still find it somewhat confusing, with all of the characters speaking in the same accent. I don't care that much for the actors, especially the one with the beard. It was like watching a couple of old people who had been around for awhile. I had to ask why a movie like this was necessary. It wasn't. The actors were all pretty good. It seems like they were supposed to be playing themselves, but they all had way too much fun in those costumes. The film was not good for kids. 4 out of 5  stars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an awful bad movie.  I mean, I've seen worse, but this is an extremely bad movie and not worth my time.  This is about a man who goes to Africa on a safari.   It has a ridiculous setting where people don't have clothes and wear clothes from other cultures.  The only saving grace for this movie is a man named Richard O'Neal, who is in a romance movie. He's like a young Elvis, although I suppose Elvis would have been more handsome, if his body had stayed in shape. It's a movie that was supposed to be about Africa, but it's not Africa, it's Africa that's in the movie, except it's just a big movie set in Africa.  It's a western where the white guys are going into Africa and have this guy who's supposed to have a lot of money.  He's a bad guy, and the movie goes on like that.  But it's kind of a mess.  All of the people have terrible accents, and they don't really fit in with the cultures they're portraying.  As for the scenes of the animals, they're not really animals they're just animals in Africa, except one is a cow. I guess there was a movie about cows, but if there was, it would have at least had them in the right animal costumes. This movie was horrible.  And it was an insult to a country that is trying to be a good world leader and instead has these kind of stereotypes.  Even the movie's ending is insulting to Africa. If I ever have kids, I'm not leaving this movie on the shelf, but I might as well say that it would not make a good Christmas movie, if it was a holiday movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********************* In the late 1800's, the New York City police force was in desperate need of new blood. It needed the tough and brave, it needed the hardheaded, no nonsense law enforcer who would not let a good criminal go without a good punch. That was the type of officer James "Old Bucky" Barnes, the "Lil' Slugger" Barnes. The NYPD wanted to hire him as the youngest of four brothers to be the replacement for the older brothers who were long gone. When Barnes was accepted, they assigned him to the newly formed Crime Patrol. Barnes was the son of a former officer for the department and grew up the city like a typical "lil' boy" but at the tender age of 14, he became a man. He became the very model of a policeman. But on this day, Barnes was not a man; he was a monster. He was stalking a family in their own home and they decided to call the cops. He had found a young woman locked in a closet with her boyfriend. The officer entered the room as he was searching for the missing girl. He grabbed the young boy by the throat and ripped the child from the boyfriend. He then shoved the young man out into a small alley where he stabbed the child in the throat. He ran off to the woods where he killed himself. The father and the boyfriend searched for a good night's sleep but the police are on their way! A young man who was stabbed to death by a policeman was now the newest member of the NYPD! A few months later, Barnes' death brought a new detective in. He would soon discover why this young man was so distraught over Barnes' murder. The story of what happened to this new officer is the stuff of classic mystery novels. The most exciting of the many chapters of this mystery has just been published. In that same story we find a young man whose father was murdered. Now his father is dead and his mother is a drug addict; he and his new brother go to live with his uncle and a friend in a New Jersey apartment. Soon, they become suspicious. The old man's son is a cop and now they're coming after the uncle's brother. Is it too much to believe a cop is still alive? What do the old police know about the murder of the son's father? And is there more to the son than just being a cop? This was the first of my detective stories; I wrote them in an attempt to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie at a theater in which I was also showing "Killer Joe" at the time.  This was the movie that made Joe's career and gave him a chance to star in the films that would become the hits that made him the star that he is today.   It's good for a laugh (which I'm happy I found in here), it's an entertaining movie that may make your head spin and is a good time for all ages.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      What a letdown. If there had been any good at all to this movie, it would have been at the beginning. It has nothing going on with it from beginning to end. It is a pretty average film from the get-go. You don't know about the rest of the story until you read the first paragraph about the man who goes to meet his girlfriend. This is the only redeeming quality of the movie. But by the time you get to the end, all of that is gone. It isn't bad. It may have had a good plot, but it really sucked the fun out of the experience. I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone. This review, and the next one, are not for the easily offended. If you can ignore the fact that a man is murdered on screen, and if you can tolerate the fact a woman who wants a relationship is killed by a man she likes, then I think you have a movie worth trying to find a place in your heart.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a mess. There is literally zero logic to the story. There are too many characters, none of them interesting and none of the dialogue is funny. There's no reason for anyone to care about any of the characters beyond having sex with them.   I like my rom-coms to have some substance to it and this movie is just a mess of wasted effort.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It had a nice story, well executed and executed with passion.  The acting in it is fantastic and I was a little shocked the whole way through that a girl would fall in love with a dog!  I thought about watching this again but had to put it on hiatus.   I have a feeling that this movie was made as a tribute to those guys.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a bad film by any means but it has a problem. It is very inconsistent and sometimes feels like an exercise in contrivance, especially at the end.  The writing has to be a bit better; sometimes the dialogue feels really bad.  I could see the film as a bad, but I could also see the potential if it is allowed to develop. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The Good:  - I've always liked the look of the characters. The character designs are really nice.   - For a movie about a kid who can control the powers of insects, this is a surprisingly light movie.  - The sound effects are very good.  - There's a lot of good animation, especially in the background and in the fight scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this scene in this bad movie, the guy's wife, who's a professional porn star, tries to seduce the bad guy, so that she can get paid for doing so. The guy says, "I've tried to seducing you, and that's it. You just don't want to have sex with me. Why are you so bad at it? Why do you make porno? You're a pro, aren't you? You've done a million other things." The wife replies, "Well, maybe I'm not a pro at it. Because I am really bad at having sex." And so the movie ends with a nice shot of the guy and the woman in bed, together.  The whole movie is bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has many, many problems. The story is pretty bad and the acting is horrible. The camera is awful. The writing is bad. The directing is bad and is so bad it is almost laughable. The cinematography is bad, the editing is bad (it makes some movies seem good by comparison). The soundtrack is terrible, the acting (or lack of acting, it's hard to tell) is terrible. There is almost no music. The special effects are bad (no camera movements, no special effects), the plot is dumb (the same old character, same old story, same stupid ending) and the special effects in general are not impressive. This movie is basically a mess of stupid plot holes, stupid special effects, bad acting, poor special effects (the only one I really like is the last one), bad direction, stupid story, and bad special effects. The final scene is truly awful. It feels like a rushed, rushed, hurried, rushed rushed rush to a bad place. This is a terrible movie. I am sure I'll see the director's next movies but probably not with my money. If it had had a decent screenplay, and had better or at least different acting, then maybe I would have a different opinion. See, the movie is about a woman and her "baby". He is a boy and lives in a cave with the woman. They live together. One night the man comes home and the woman is in a trance. She says "he is the son of God and he is in the cave". The man believes her. She gives him a knife and he kills her. The next day the man sees a huge hole where her body was. He calls out, but the cave has been invaded. So he tells his wife that he has killed the man's son and then he kills the men and takes the woman with him to his cave. The movie has many ideas including a "child's right" to exist in the world and even a "human's right to exist" (which is a horrible idea in itself). The movie was directed by the very talented John Landis. I have seen a few reviews where people said it was a good movie. They're wrong! It is a really, REALLY bad movie. It is terrible! I was so disappointed in the movie that I can't even remember what happened. I think I have forgotten what happened! It was so terrible that when I watched it on the big screen and looked away
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was an interesting idea, and the movie was fun, until the end of the film when it became like a bad video game. I thought it would be a good idea to turn the movie into a video game but that didn't come to pass. It's fun for the first half but then it takes the fun out of it. I don't remember anything that happened after that.

Â  But then this movie gives the "why did you give me the best movie!" answer! Â This woman is very strong minded and will not let things get between them!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!! It's pretty bad, a very, very bad movie. The story is interesting, with a lot of jokes, a lot to laugh at, a few good gags, and a very bad story. First off, it was supposed to be the greatest horror movie ever made. Then the producer decided to not use all the actors from the original version, and it just turned into a joke. Then they tried to make a comedy with the acting and jokes from the movie, and they just don't have any good material. The most embarrassing part is that there were a lot more interesting characters in the original film than in the new version. I hate to see this movie. I don't understand why they made it with the actors we just seen. There are still some funny moments, but overall it's just an embarrassment to watch. I will never be willing to see a new movie from this studio ever again! I just don' like watching them. I wish they would go back to the days of the original. 1 star out of 5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what to say other than this movie was very hard to watch. There was some really nice looking scenery as well as the occasional great visual effects. The story was fairly standard. However the acting was horrible, especially for a movie that would end up being released on DVD with an extended cut. The only thing I will say is that the extras are all very cool and interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  [S]o far, so good..  ...the movie has a little bit of everything: funny, sexy, tense, fast-paced, slow-paced... I felt like a lot of things in it would have made a fantastic movie, except the lack of characters: there is one bad guy, and it's not like there are two characters of a kind. And not a single person is named. Just the bad guy... There is no plot development, no romance, no story, not a shred of humor or horror... but it makes a great movie, a fun movie, fun for those who just like to see a bad guy running around...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sure that most people reading this will not be very interested in seeing this movie, but I'm going to be honest here: this movie really is not all that bad. It's a very well made movie that has some nice surprises in it, although it is not a great movie. It was a movie that I thought was going to end on a good note and unfortunately there is a big problem with the ending. I think that there is some bad editing, some of the sound effects aren't that great, and it seems like there was a bit too much time for the characters to hang around in the desert waiting to be attacked by the bandits. I've seen better. For the time it was made, though, it was really pretty good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I've seen in a very long time and it isn't even a really bad movie. It's a great way to get people in a movie theater but most people I know didn't like this and the worst part about it is the whole stupid plot.  The story is about a scientist that can make anything look like anything else.   There's a story about a couple of guys in a small town who are trying to prove a scientific fact that a man has just died.  They use a machine that makes the dead look like they're alive.  These people go off into the woods, one goes into a woods to get a deer.  He starts to fall into a pit and is killed by the hunter who was hunting the deer. But then the hunter turns into a man and starts killing the deer because he is now the deer again.  Then a young boy gets killed and he has to go into the cave to get rid of him because he has a face like a woman.  When he gets there, he finds a woman in a cave and the woman starts having sex with him.   The movie ends with him and his mother, who is just as crazy as the woman and her husband, getting rid of a bunch of ghosts.  The last two minutes have the scientist running around looking for the scientist's mom and he makes it into another movie because he doesn't know where it is.  This movie is really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to be honest with you. I had to force myself to actually watch this film again. I have to admit that I had no idea that this was supposed to be a movie. I don't usually care for these types of films and thought this is just a poor attempt. It's so bad the ending of the film will make your head spin. That being said the acting in this film is really bad. They are all terrible. There is a really bad accent in this movie that is just awful. A few scenes are ok and a couple of the characters are pretty ok but all of them are a complete waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie to be very offensive. I could not watch it without thinking about some of the racial slurs being said in it and the fact that many of these white people are in the military to serve their country. It's a poor excuse for a movie to me. I will never see another action movie from this filmmaker.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very bad movie in the first place. It starts a bit poorly, with a bad guy killing his girlfriend and her dog because they broke the rules of the game; well you know the rules by now. But then things get interesting. Because as if that was not bad enough, the killer has a dog! So much for the game. He's in a prison and the only way for him to come out is to kill a bunch of prison inmates. But he can't, because he's trapped, and we learn that he's not really insane, but mentally sick. The prisoner's wives and girlfriends want to help him, but he won't listen to them! One of the girlfriends gets killed, so he kills a bunch more, and he gets to his own girlfriend. But it doesn't work out so well. At the end, after a long time, he does get out of the hospital and sees a new lady (played by a blonde with a nice body) who helps him out, but she doesn't come alone! She comes with some guys, too, and she wants his hand. He'll have to help them get revenge, or she'll kill him, and then... wait, how can there be any suspense?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just came out of this movie expecting a terrible horrible movie. Then, it ended up being an OK movie. The best part is that a lot of stuff is left up to interpretation. For the most part it is a bad story with bad acting, bad writing, bad direction and a bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Dirty and messy" This movie takes place in the 70s. What the heck are cops doing with a police station in the middle of the desert? Oh it's the police station! In this movie the director (Ludmila Ulitsa) gives us a great picture that has been shot on film. It was like a time machine. The people of the old times used to walk through the desert and it was hot. But then the movie takes a bad turn. They just stand around and talk and have a drink. I was bored to tears and I was thinking "I could have done that". I would have loved to have had a drink here. That should have been a theme song. It's not a bad film, but it is so bad it's not worth a watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________   I thought there was going to be more of it. It was the movie that my boyfriend had been wanting me to see for a long time. He had been getting a hardon for the bad movie for over a year.   And we were at the park in LA. We were having so much fun and watching it back to back, and then we came in the house.   was so cute! We wanted to look up her name. I had her in my book for a very long time because she was such a cool girl. And I had the sexiest fantasy...   "I want to go to the mall and get a new dress". I said.   and we were talking about that. And he was thinking about it. But I said.. that I think I want to play more for him. And so we came back into the house and he was playing in front of his tv. He was really hot. We had to leave him and he said "I'm out of here, I'm going to go over to his mom's and play." But that was one of those things where we were going on and off a lot.     So then I saw a lot of her. And she really knew how to play that guitar. And her voice was great. And we were so excited to see her again. And then when the show ended... we weren't really feeling it. And when the girls left she asked if she could stay over, and I said "sure" but I don't think I was feeling like it. I was looking forward to the next night... So we got into the car and I asked her if we could just go to a movie. I mean... she said she really did. I just told her that I really don't feel like getting undressed to have sex, that I just wanna lie in bed and watch movies with her. I don;t know why I can't have an orgasm. She agreed, so we went to a big movie. It wasn't much, but she did look really sexy.   a nice little movie and I even got a little bit of a look at her ass. She took off her bra. I watched as she got undressed, then I started doing what the movie had told me to do. She was going down on me in the middle of a movie so I started touching it, and that's when I was able to get an erection.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had no expectation at all that this was going to be any good. My kids were the reason, of course.  But the whole movie has no heart in it.    This film is so cheap it's silly.  The story is terrible, the plot is bad, and it really doesn't have much character to speak of.  You can't get very far in this film unless your wife is an idiot.  And that's what she is.  It really doesn' feel like it even got made with the money and the actors who are in it but with such poor acting from these people I just don't know if I am watching a bad attempt at a horror film or a movie that is being filmed in the style of some cheap '70s disaster movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "When you look at it that way you just don't know what to say about it" (T. S. Eliot)   One of the first films ever made with a talking cat, it is said that it was made as a satire of the newfangled and sensational movie industry. The movie is called "The Cat and the Fiddle" and it is actually a funny little film but one is reminded of the old classic "The Lady from Shanghai", "Lenny Bruce" and other old stand-up comedy shows. It is quite a bizarre film but it is funny and I think it would be a lot of fun to have some friends over and watch.   Lenny says this about the film:  "I had made this movie for a film festival, and it got on the screens at the theatre, where the audiences were getting drunk and the cat was looking at them with the greatest contempt. I thought it would go for ten dollars, and so I thought of using it in a play, but the playwright, who has a good eye for comedy and so did I, said: 'No, no, I don't want to use you in a comedy play; this is a serious movie. This cat is a man-cat, but you are a cat.' But the cat says it is an old man, and the Cat says: 'It's been on the radio for two weeks and this country can't take it.' And it goes back and forth between being a man and a cat, and I don"t really know whether the cat thinks in the first two minutes or the second five." (Source: Lenny Bruce's biography by Brian Friel.)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   . What a bad film! I did not like it at all. We only see the mother and daughter, the other two are in the basement. The mother and sister are doing a "revenge" on a person who did them a wrong. The daughter is not very funny and is just a "stupid" girl. I guess the real problem in her is "lack of a sense of humor". The sister (and mom) are playing around with their big machine gun, and the daughter is about to fire it, but she doesn't. She is so dumb that she does not even think twice about who to shoot. That is when the daughter calls the brother. The brother is there. The two girls are playing a game in which they are the winners. The whole "game" is to fire their little machine gun at the opponent, who is on top of the building. The sister and the little brother have to try to shoot each other. But the little sister is so stupid that even when she knows where the brothers are, she still does not go after them. This movie should never have gotten filmed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  He was a big jerk and a good example of the "courageous" white guy who's only good because he's black.  The only thing I don't like about this movie is the fact that the baddies are usually in white costumes and it can really get really boring watching a bunch of these guys fight each other with no regard to how bad the other is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This one had no redeeming qualities. I have never felt a movie was more disrespectful to the history of the show.  The "Hollywood" series started out on a high note with the series finale "Haven."  In this episode, The Master was seen being held captive on a planet, and was taken hostage in a very cool way.    That episode was not an "Hollyweird" episode because it wasn't about an alien invasion of earth.  It was about a man being captured by a group of men.  And what the hell, the guy just kept coming back to life, and now, it was about the men who did this to him.  At first, I felt sorry for the Master, but after a couple of episodes, you just start feeling bad for him. Then this guy showed up and killed several of the Master's men. That's when all hell broke loose, and I can't even explain why the show tried to put on a "Halloween" episode.  The episode wasn't even scary.  Even I was getting a bit bored with that, and then at the end, the Master woke up as if he hadn't been held prisoner for a year.  I felt this was too much for a "Master" episode, and it was supposed to end up as a horror story? So, that is the end of that.  Now for the next season, "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine", that is where the show really started to get good.  When this show started, I was a big "Hanna Barbera" fan, and the fact that I got to see a show with a man trapped in a room with aliens was very exciting to me.  But, to this show's credit, it had its own little episodes that took a bit of the "Hannibal Lecter" aspect away.  Like I mentioned before, this episode was about "Sisko and Jadzia's" attempt to make Sisko look like a normal human.  Siskos "humanity" was a bit too "normal" to this episode. I mean, we all know how much this show hates "people who are different from the norm".  But what really got to me was the way the "Jadzias" (his name was Jadizia at the time) were forced to act.  In a nutshell, they had to act
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first saw this, I had no idea what it was. This looks a lot like The Man from UNCLE, but I could not identify with the role. My brother and I sat through this film, not understanding a word that was said. This movie was more like a bad comedy than an animated film. I have watched many bad comedies, but this one seemed the most like a crappy ripoff of a bad comic book.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A horrible movie. This movie has nothing to do with real people. I think that the movie was made by the same company that made the TV show "The Secret World of Alex Mack". Well this movie is about a secret society of people, that don't want the world to know about the existence of a world where you just can't kill anyone, and have no real evil. Well I don't know how true to the books this movie really is. But the movie is bad. I thought that it would be funny for the two heroes to kill the evil people. When I saw the movie I didn't think it would work, and it just made me sad and angry. It's almost like watching a horror movie, because of the "woooosh". But this movie has so much bad jokes and bad acting. If you are into the paranormal, try the book " The Secret World" I think it is good enough as it is. If not then you will hate this movie. If this movie worked as the book, it would have at least rated 6 stars. But it doesn't work as the story, or the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's no reason for this movie to exist. It's nothing more than a poor cash in. It has the same tired jokes, the same generic villains and the same "you know nothing, Jon Favreau" line delivery. But it doesn't have the same energy that's lacking from this movie. There's no stakes. There are no real characters. It only makes me want to watch more of Favreau's next "turd in the punchbowl" movie. And I know it's not a good movie by any means.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't like this one.  It's the only reason I've seen "the Lord of the Rings".  And I didn't care for it.  "The Two Towers" is an excellent movie, and I can't believe that the first movie didn't make it into the list.  This is more of a middle ground movie, which could have been a much better movie if you paid attention.  The story is nice, and the scenes that you see are exciting.  I can see how some people liked this, it's a fantasy movie about war.  Unfortunately that's not what I've come to expect from a movie that's supposed to be awesome.  In fact, it could have used better acting, better camera movement, better editing, and a much larger cast (especially the actors involved in the war.)  But that's the nature of Fantasy movies...they're never really perfect.  That's what makes them fun to see, and so much fun to discuss.  But this movie is not a great one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is definitely not a good movie. It is an extremely bad movie that is bad at everything. It does not try to be smart. It's only a joke, and it is not a very funny one. It just tries to be funny for about a minute. The acting is not very good either. Most of the bad guys just sit around and wait for the bad guy to get a gun and shoot them. There is one exception, but the movie could not get out of the trailer. There are some things in this movie that will be sure to give everyone a headache. And the ending is very sad. All I can say is that it does not take itself very seriously. But then again it is a movie that tries to try to make people laugh.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is all about "being a good human". It's supposed to be a family film, about a happy family. But the filmmakers chose to make the audience "think about" the situation all too often. And I guess the audience is supposed to sympathize, but at the same time "be a good person" (if possible) to the family member who is constantly trying to do something bad and doing the "wrong" things.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was in the theater when the movie started and it was a very poorly made movie. The actors seemed to be just trying to fit in and being good looking. The main character seemed very immature and I could tell that he was under the influence of something. My wife and daughter both had the "bad" effect, but it did not change their opinion of him one bit. He was a good-looking actor, but was obviously under the influences of something in this movie. I was thinking about the movie after watching the movie and I felt like someone just took the best parts of a movie and made a bad one. If it were a "new" movie and a low budget movie it would be a good flick, but if it were to be made under the circumstances, then it was very uninteresting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This is one of those movies where there's no reason to ever see it again.   This is about a family who's trying to escape from the harsh, cold, and snow-bound northern wastes of Norway.  There are three of them- an elderly woman, a child, and a dog- and in their travels, they stop off at a remote house.  The elderly woman is very ill- her husband is dead.  Her daughter was born three months before the family left, and is ill too. The dog, on the other hand, is quite lively.  They stay there, though, and the old woman dies from a broken heart.  Then they all get together and eat cake.  We can only surmise what the cake is.  It's a really bland cake- which was good enough for my grandmother, who used to eat it all the time when she was a little girl.  I think this is another movie made with bad intentions.  One of the reasons I was willing to take the time to watch the awfulness of the film was that there is so much in it that I would like to see a more elaborate picture of the real life that it portrays.  This movie was a bit like the kind of film that you see in the movies where people go off on wild goose chases for no reason.  Perhaps the most obvious attempt to create an elaborate set is the way the little girl is dressed.  That little dress is a great way to make you feel that she might be an elderly grandma.  (Although she looks to be about ten-years-old.)  I was reminded of a photo-negative of what the people in the 1930s wore to the movies- it's like a really old, dusty dress.  But I'm not sure why they chose to dress the dog this way- I can't figure out how it would make sense for a dog to wear a dress that is so stiff it barely covers her.  Instead, they choose to use the dog's collar as a fashion accessory.  For a second, I thought that this might be some kind of German movie.  A girl is in a dog collar, so they must have been German, I guess.  However, this film was made in Norway, so the dog has an accent that makes me think it's a Swedish dog.  Or maybe it's German, but it doesn't sound like it.  You have
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you don't mind reading the film's plot summary: It's like one of those 80's cartoons about a group of kids that live in a castle and have adventures in the mountains. It's pretty much what the title says.  What it doesn't have is much of a plot, the action is very low in quality, and there's not much sense of humor.  There are some very strange lines here, but if you can't get past those, then nothing else matters.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Taken 2  is a horrible movie and an absolute disappointment.  What was supposed to be a sequel is actually a very bad and uninspiring movie.  We start off with a film about a group of kids who find themselves stranded in a forest and they go about trying to escape the danger the forest is in.  Once they find a way out the film falls completely apart.  For starters the acting is atrocious.  I was thoroughly disgusted with the acting and I felt like the whole movie was based on an actor named Tom Hanks and a bunch of kids that he plays that aren't that likable, they're just not very entertaining and all the rest of the characters just seem like they're there to be mocked.  They're all really forgettable and I really have no respect for them.  The plot is a little strange at first.  A girl called Lily and her dog go for a little walk into the forest and get picked up by these guys that are carrying a very dangerous weapon.  And at first I thought that it was a good idea, but as the movie goes on I found that the movie started to lose me more and more.  First we have the group that picked up Lily's dog, the group of 3 that are with Lily, and finally the main guy who's there to get revenge against the guy who messed with the dog.  Now, I won't go into too much detail, but there is a whole lot of very odd moments in the film and one of the main things I have to mention is the very weird ending.  Why are these guys following this dog for a while and then following them?  I suppose it's because it's a wolf, and this is a story about wolf hunters, and that is a very good story.  Also, why does the wolf just stand there.  It doesn't even try to attack the kids.  He just stands there like a dumb wolf, because there was no reason for it.  But yeah, all these things make a big deal out of this movie and it does try to do a lot, and yet it does it all in the same movie. So, there is very little in the story that makes any sense, and very little reason at all for anyone to continue watching.  After all these elements make the whole story feel really weak, and it becomes a chore to watch the movie.   So, I gave it a rating of 1
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What kind of lame "experiment" is this? I've read this novel a dozen times and yet I still don't believe this is a real novel. This book seems to be about a girl who is trying to have her mother's baby. There's a scene in which the mother and daughter are playing in a field in the middle of a cold winter and a baby runs up to the daughter and asks to be taken care of. At first, the daughter refuses but then finally she agrees. I think she wants to be a doctor, but in a weird, twisted sort of way that I have never seen before. She takes an "infertile doctor" to her house. This is weird because a couple of days later the daughter starts complaining about not getting a boyfriend, that she can't seem to get laid. The mother then decides to take the girl to a psychiatrist who has a practice just across the bridge and he suggests the girl start taking Prozac. At the end of the book, the mother tells the daughter that "everything's perfect now." I can see why the daughter would think this, but I really couldn't understand it, and that didn't stop me from reading it again. It's all rather bizarre, I think because the writer is in a real state of mind - he's trying to describe the effect of prozac on the human mind. I guess I don't see that it is a realistic portrayal at all and I wouldn't want to live in such a crazy world.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******** ******** This movie is a comedy, and that's about it. But it's also not exactly a comedy. The characters are very immature, as are the stories they tell. It doesn't really feel like an episode of a popular soap opera. The dialogue is stiff and monotonous. The story is repetitive, repetitive, repeating itself. There is nothing about the plot to give it a sense of urgency. ********

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "  The story begins with the protagonist, a poor homeless boy named Tom, who is sent home on a train. He is the victim of a series of events that take place during his stay in the train's station.   Tom's first stop is to find shelter from a rainstorm outside the station. The next stop is for some groceries at a shop where some poor homeless men are staying in. Tom sees these poor men and becomes interested in them.  After Tom gets all his groceries, he sees that two of these homeless men, one of whom is a little girl, have been beaten to death and the second is severely injured. The dead and the seriously wounded homeless man are placed at the foot of the street.  The next station is a hotel and the next station, more homeless men. The homeless men's names are, "   After taking a walk at night along the highway, Tom finds a girl named Mary, who has been abandoned there by her parents. Tom is attracted to her beauty. However, the homeless man at this station who looks after Mary, says that she is no good for him.  Tom, tired of walking up and down the highway on a rainy day, returns to the station to visit Mary.  Mary is very grateful to Tom, for taking her in. However she can't stay overnight at the station, for her parents, are still at the hotel.  They decide to return to the hotel at midnight. In order to do that, the father of the girl, who was lost in the rain, is told to walk down the hotel's stairs. When he arrives, the girl is missing and the mother tells him that she didn't know where Mary was.  When he starts to search for her, the dead and severely injured homeless man with whom he was traveling, appears again.  At the hotel, Tom meets the girl and begins to tell her about the homeless life.   After this, the movie begins to take a dramatic turn. The film shows a homeless life, in which people suffer all kinds of hardships. People are hungry, tired and cold all the time. It is also a good place for the viewer to get into the inner soul of these poor people.  With only a blanket to cover him and the rain to try to stop him from moving, poor Tom is the center of attention of all the homeless people. This creates tension for the viewers.   In the first scene, Tom has a dream
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************************ I was thoroughly impressed by "A Clockwork Orange", as one could reasonably expect a film about Alex and the evil, sinister, brainless Dr. Strangelove to be. The plot is fairly simple: Alex, the protagonist, becomes caught up in a drug-dealing ring. Alex is put in charge of the gang; he takes money from the dealers, he makes them more efficient at the business, and he does it all while looking for the perfect date to have lunch. The main flaw I found in the story was that it was over-reactionary. Every little thing that happens in the film is presented to Alex as if he were a criminal. His behavior is portrayed as not just stupid, but also stupid and annoying. Alex acts as if the drug dealers were out to get him. The film does a fine job of getting the point across that Alex is a criminal in an over-the-top way. The movie never actually explains why Alex is so stupid, and at times, it is hard to understand why a character like Alex does what he does. Alex's stupidity and attitude are not the main problem in this film; rather, the film's problem is how the characters are depicted. Alex makes some interesting decisions, such as killing off some of the criminals he is supposed to be protecting. Other times, he does what most people would do; he puts on a heroic smile while giving the enemy his money's worth. Unfortunately, the movie is not really about Alex; it is more about Dr. Dr.Strangelove, a character who does have some personality. He is the one who is supposed be stupid in this movie, and his attempts at comedy are so predictable that you can't help but get tired of him. Some of the jokes work better than others. Alex gets a really funny line about killing a terrorist with a bomb, and then immediately laughs it off. He does the same when he murders a man who looks like a dog. At one point, he even tries to kill himself; he is so bored, so pathetic, that he tries to hang himself in a tree. The story is not an amazing story, it just tells a really bad one in Alex's case. I recommend this film to everyone that enjoys a laugh. *********************  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------- I watched this film with a friend of mine. It was a bad experience. The movie is in English but it is not funny. I mean, I am a sucker for the funny but the English isn't funny. It's a comedy about a group of people who want to get famous by a radio show. They find a famous guy to do the show. And then we get this one scene where the guy is getting his penis sucked off. If that is not enough to turn you away from this film, then we don't know what is. The acting is terrible as well. I'm still laughing about the scene where a girl's boobs fall out while being taken by a guy. This movie is not good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- I am a huge fan of horror. This is a good movie, but a very bad one. I don't mean that this is a bad horror movie. It is a very good movie. The acting, directing, screenplay, music, the visuals, and all the special effects are awesome. The monsters in this movie are awesome, they are all awesome. I am sure if you watch this movie a dozen times and you see the monsters over and over again, you can become desensitized. All I wanted to do was to go home and relax because that is what I always do when I am home alone. I knew that the movie was a bad one because I felt that even though they tried to kill the characters at first that they would eventually catch them all off guard so that when they finally got the perfect time to kill them, I thought they would just kill them all in one take and then the movie would end. They didn't. They killed them all with one shot from a rifle. That is all I really wanted. The movie really was a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like the movie very much, but it is a long long long movie and a complete waste of time.  The script is awful.    I mean, I'm not a script person.   I have nothing against a good story but this is not a good screenplay.  This movie has no plot and no character development.  Even the main villain is really a dumb ass.  I think the main problem was that the director (Hank Williams) was trying to keep the story short and sweet.  But Hank Williams is a great singer!  And he does a nice job in the movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There has been a lot of talk about why this movie is a good one.  The movie was an excellent adaptation of the book.  It may not be as good as the book, but it is an excellent and compelling rendition.  The movie is very dark.  There is no way anyone can look away from the horror of the movie, without turning into a ghoulish monster yourself.    When the book is first brought to the screen, it is shown to a theater full of people.  As a matter of fact, it took several years to make it to a film.   I was excited when the book was being made, but I was not so excited when it came out in book form, for the screen adaptations never seemed that special to me.  I did enjoy the movie adaptation, and I hope some day I can see it again on the big screen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The new Ghostbusters movie is really quite funny. They put together some great and funny characters. Unfortunately the new Ghostbusters just can't seem to get the plot straight. It is very poorly written and the director just gives up and leaves the Ghostbusters alone for a very long time. It also leaves out all the background stories of the other Ghostbusters and makes it more a typical comedy with an old man as the leader and a girl as the secretary.  The acting in this is very poor. Paul Feig who directed this movie is trying to go through his experience with the old men in movies and how hard it is to see a man in his forties who has lost his hair and looks like a 70s man. But I think he is just being childish and I just would not want him to direct any more movies.  I just don't think this was a very good movie and it is certainly not good enough to warrant a sequel.  This is certainly a film that is a waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A low budget, stupid movie by this French director and his crew is nothing but boring, unmemorable, slow and uninspiring. I have to say that I hated the entire film, especially the first part which was the most boring and unfunny part of the whole film. This is what makes this movie a complete failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________ Last week I was visiting my brother who is in his early 30s. He's a writer and he's currently a student at the University. This is one of his scripts, but you can feel the story is written to be about college students, not adults (for example, there's a female character who's basically a virgin in a sorority, who is pretty creepy). _________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've heard a lot of bad movie reviews, but I can't say these reviews were that bad! I think I'm going to go in with a very big voice of caution when I say these are terrible movie and I think that many people, young and old, will have a difficult time turning off that awful sound when they hear these guys screaming and hitting each other around the house. But this one is really so much worse in the sense that it makes me laugh.   My wife and I were watching it for the first time and we didn't think so bad. I was pretty pleased with it...but the other 2 stars I gave this movie are a reflection of my very personal feeling about it.  For me, it doesn't quite work with any of its ideas. For me and many others it seems like it's trying to say, "hey, don't get into fights over nothing." Or "Don't let the other guy beat on you, because then you'll never get anything done." Which it does at times but then it's the other guys who beat on them?   There are some interesting ideas in this movie: one is that everyone who is getting into fights is either a loser who wants to lose more, or a loser that is just trying to make a quick buck. This movie is filled with a lot more fighting than it should be with all the bad guys and some interesting character. But I was also a little worried by the very final third of the movie. It's all really very violent and I did have to stop watching it...the end just went to hell.  I found this review helpful! When I found out that this movie was about a couple having a fight over a television set that they bought (on consignment!) with the intention of selling it, I had no idea how much I would enjoy it. My friends who were watching at the same time gave me a little warning but I didn't understand it because I'm not exactly the kind of person who understands such subtle little things.  At first I thought, oh this is good--looks like the movie isn't just going to make me laugh a lot, but it's also going to let me get into it. But...no, it's just getting very repetitive and annoying.  I was thinking: how can a movie that looks so pretty end up making me angry so much?  So I went in expecting a good time and it wasn't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was quite disappointed in this movie.   There are several reasons why I thought the film was a joke.  1) The movie opens with some strange things: a man's head falling from a tree; a woman walking through a field with a very long scarf (like a kimono).  2) They have a group of Japanese school children (children dressed up in different clothes?) who seem to be running around a forest searching for a tree or a tree trunk to break into.  It gets more ridiculous when they break into an old tree.  In the forest we find a man who is trying to find a long scarf to wear. The kids chase and try to catch him.  Now, a man walking around a tree is nothing new.  The guy in the movie can easily be mistaken for someone who can climb a tree. The problem is the woman.  I have found nothing else to make me laugh for the rest of the time.  When the children try to chase the guy, he just gets the best of them.  That is one time I found a movie to be rather silly.  A good parody of the silly genre is "Wakko the Witch".  3) It also has the same kind of story as "Chasing a Devil".   It is a woman dressed in a kuubo.  She makes a trip to some people's house with a white long scarf and they want to sell it.  There she sells it. The man wants to buy the woman's scarf and she refuses.  Once more, she makes a ridiculous decision. She goes to the men's house, where they are dressed up as Indians, but she doesn't understand their language. It doesn't stop there.  They are also wearing costumes.  So then she decides to sell the scarf to a man in a cowboy costume.  Once more she has a problem in deciding where to go and what to do.  This is not the kind of humor I expected.  Instead, it is like a movie with all the same old jokes.  Again, I found this a very silly movie with a lot of ridiculous elements. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: .1) This is a poor-quality, badly acted movie, featuring an odd assortment of characters. .2) The movie starts out in New York, and the plot is as ridiculous as it gets.  .3) The main character is a woman, and she's an alcoholic who is in an abusive marriage.  She's being tormented by her husband (who is also an alcoholic), his friends, his colleagues, and his father-in-law.  ( .  ) A number of other characters have come into the film as well.  The most interesting characters are:  1)  The man-on-the-street guy, who is very annoying and rude.  2)    The woman-and-her-dog, who are both incredibly boring and boringly annoying.  3)  "  The guy who is the movie's narrator.  4)  An eccentric old guy who does absolutely nothing.  5) The bartender who gets into the movie (and does nothing).  6) The old lady who is being controlled by her father.  7)  The guy in the movie who is a bad comedian.  8)    (The woman's daughter).  9)      A guy who keeps getting killed.  10)  (A guy who gets killed, and it's not really his fault).  11) .   The plot is almost ridiculous when it comes to the way it's been described.  It's very, very bad.  This movie needs to be shown in a theater with a strong crowd.  As for the actual plot:   In a very large room.  And lots of people come to that large room!   This guy  does not seem to know who he is, what he is saying, or what he's saying!  He is either very bad at talking (because he can't speak), or the camera is moving around his face so it's very hard to get a read on his emotions.  If you haven't noticed yet, this guy is not a real person!  So, what exactly is this movie?   How do you end up having a movie about a guy who can't tell you his name?  Why does he keep dying?  You know what's really funny?  What we get
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   I was hoping to like this film. As a child, I would get a kick out of watching old black and white Westerns. This was one of the few to keep my attention. The story is not new, the set pieces are not a new invention (a nice touch), and the music is still great. I do feel like this should have gone deeper, though. There was no emotional depth to the characters, and they were forced to grow. The acting isn't terrible, and the production values aren't bad, but I didn't find myself engrossed. It's an old fashioned Western with a touch of the magical realism, and a good bit of campiness. It isn't as good as its contemporaries, but this one I'll be sure to re-watch whenever I've got a minute.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a terrible movie! When I first came across it I was excited to see a film with a "modern" style.  The characters were all stereotypical.      Their lives were boring.   I've always liked movies that deal with people in a more realistic way.    It had a "low-tech" feel to it.  To be honest, I'm not sure what the "modern style" is.  I guess they used old "bluray" films from the 70s?    Why would anyone care about their jobs?  The only thing that makes this movie interesting is the ending.  It gives the viewer that feeling that a good movie has to end.  If I had a dollar for everytime this movie has been running through my head since I saw it!  I can not even say that a bad film can win me over.  The ending left me disappointed.  I would really like to see this film done right.  This film needs a proper writer/director and not some random person who just watched it to get the idea!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has two major flaws. The first is that it is so over the top, so stupid, that it's not funny at all. The movie is based on the life of  George W. Bush (born October 25, 1945 in Houston, Texas).  It's a "who cares?" movie.   It was supposed to be about the guy who has the biggest cock in the room, and the best hair, and is also the coolest guy ever.  So, when we meet him, he has just turned 40, and he lives in a nice house in Washington, which he shares with his wife and two kids.  Unfortunately for George W., this is a short life; he gets elected to be the President of the United States.  It is also reported that George W has a great love life.  He has several children and is married to a beautiful blonde and he has two kids from another woman; he has a son by a different woman;  he's got a dog called Bubba; and his dog is named "Hercules"  He is surrounded by a ton of beautiful women.  But he is also surrounded by stupid people who have been influenced by the media (mainly FOX News).   "You can't run a country without money" is just one of the many stupid things he says.  This includes a number of dumb things including:  When someone is in trouble "Don't do something silly, you get all the glory" This should never be said by anyone.  "It is better to have loved and lost than never to have had love at all."  "Do things right" is so wrong.  Even people who don't know him say "I don't like that guy" when he does something wrong.   "Look at him, how he hangs his head" is one of his favorite sayings.  People get offended when the camera pans in front of his head.  George W goes through several phases.  First is when he is a President and he gets an impeachment trial and the Democrats take control of the House of Representatives.   It is only when they do that that it looks like there is a majority of Democrats who are going to impeach him.  Then he is President of Texas and is getting a lot of attention because of the Gulf War.  The media is not going to like that George is more interested in politics than doing the job of President.  One
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a horrible movie. The best thing about this movie is the ending (in my opinion). A few minutes before the actual ending, a man gets murdered by a truck driving at full speed. The truck driver doesn't know what to do and goes on the highway. He crashes and kills two more cars. The driver is then hit by a car. He then gets out of the car and tries to drive away. He almost hits the same car a second time, but doesn't because it has been stopped by the police. Then a person who looks like a police officer steps out from the bushes and tries the driver to leave. At this point the driver is crying with the police officer saying "You were the one who was stopped. I thought I was driving into a ditch." At this exact moment the person in the truck is yelling "Get out!" The driver responds by saying "I'm going to kill you all". So now the cop is running after the driver. The cop turns right and the driver turns to go right. The police officer jumps in front of the truck and says "I can't let you get away with it" And then he shoots the driver in the back of the head. The man was screaming at the top of his lungs "I'll kill you!" The police just smile and drive off. And then the person from the truck starts walking up to the police with a gun. The next thing we see is the truck driver dead. The film doesn't even end there. There are a few different things in the film that are really stupid. The movie plays like a bad version of the Saw movie. They use the same sound effects from that movie, except they are much higher pitched and they make the entire movie seem silly. There was also a scene where a dog was trying to eat a live bat in a jar. The bat was actually a live bird in a plastic jar. At one point there was a picture of a monkey in the movie. I'm not even going to talk about the ending since most people have seen that movie. However, it isn't much better. And it's really sad because it seems like the person who made this movie never watched any of the TV shows or movies that he based it on.  A real good old horror movie: This was a really good old-fashioned horror movie. And as I said above, it wasn't a film with a clever plot. You might be confused by a scene in the beginning
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this movie until the second act of the first act. The acting was very poor and the acting was a disaster. It could have been more than a three minute short which makes me sick but it wasn't because the story, plot and characters are crap. I was a fan of this author, this movie was based on her novella and she had me interested. She could have done more but she had to keep the story to a three hour run time. The writing was also not very good as well. After reading the novellas, I thought the movies looked and sounded like a "How to get rich in a minute" book. The only good thing about it was how much the movie sucked, but I was only a fan.

"The Good Father" is full with bad acting and it is hard to believe this poor excuse for a movie is a big hit on the box office!  There are many bad jokes in this bad movie!

I have not seen a bad horror movie since my high school days!!!! Why did this movie not get a higher rating?!!!  Jawaharlal Nehru has been a national leader for 60 years. However, when he dies on September 22, 1952, the nation goes into mourning. But Nehru's son and heir, Subhas Chandra Bose, must be careful. After all, Nehru was an idealist, and Bose a dangerous revolutionary. A daring act by Bose threatens Nehru and a whole nation.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst I ever saw. That is the only way I can describe this film.  Not that it sucked or that it was bad.  It was just that no one enjoyed it. The writing of this film was awful.  The acting was also really bad. The cinematography was horrid and it looked like shit.   This movie was just terrible.  I know I am repeating myself, but I really had to put this review out there.  If you are looking for a new way to watch old western movies this is what you will get.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After a week in New York I decided to take a trip to New Orleans.   I had never been there and was interested in exploring the historic downtown area of the French Quarter.  I didn't expect much and thought that the city was more of a tourist trap but I was pleasantly surprised.  The downtown was a very large area with many buildings that had been converted into shops, cafes, restaurants and a large French Quarter museum.  My first stop was the St. Charles Parish Museum.   The building had been completely redone and was completely different from anything I had seen before.  They have several different rooms, a church (built around 1760) and a small museum. I really enjoyed the exhibits that they displayed.  When the exhibits were finished I decided I wanted to go to a restaurant but I didn´t want to go out to a bad part of town like the French Market.  There is a place called Jarry Tavern in the French Square.  Its a popular hang out spot for the people in the area.  It was so good I couldn't wait to get back and check out the city!   Overall this was a great trip and I think I can easily come back to New Orlea and see my friends as well.

No more, no less. - Not even a bit bad. - What else is there? -!!!!  Loves, Loves, And More Loves:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - No, no, no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - It was really good!!!!! And you should see it!!!! You will enjoy the movie!!! - I really loved this movie. -  If you have ever had a crush on a teacher, then this is the film for you. - It is funny, exciting and has a good sense of drama. It is a comedy, but it is also a romantic story about a teacher who likes you for more than just your body. I really enjoyed this story, I liked how the romance was presented in a way that made it believable and easy to follow.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You'll feel good after a quick, fun comedy-filled ride (which is pretty much all they have going for them), however, once you reach a more serious moment, you'll be reminded why this movie is so bad.  And I'm not talking about the ending, though it could have been worse.  The first part of the movie is an interesting look at a family struggling to raise their three children.  There's lots of good material here, and you get a sense that the family has been around for a long time, and have made a good living off it.  The family seems in good shape, and the wife appears to be very good with their kids, even if it's at their own expense.  It's all fun, until you see the price the wife pays for her hard work.  She keeps her kids in the dark, is constantly changing them up and making new bedtimes, and always seems more interested in the children than herself.  You begin to wish there was more to her, and less to the children, which is why you end up watching the kids to get the full story.    It ends in a happy happy ending, but the way in which it ends is very strange.  In the end, the wife finds a love interest in the new babysitter she's hired.  I guess we're supposed to believe that the new woman is a bad influence on her husband.  But you never really learn how, because a few years after it happens the two go their separate ways.  So who is the bad influence?   I'm having a hard time seeing it, which I guess is what the movie was trying to do with the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~ This film sucks! At least it had great acting, but the film is really lame! There are a lot of scenes in this movie where the characters are looking around at things. There's a guy in a blue shirt, a guy with a black hat, a girl dressed like a slut. It's all pointless. I didn't care to watch. It had good acting, and there was a girl that I liked, so I gave it a 3 stars. ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Tired, tired, tired of getting my ass kicked, and yet I didn't even need to be told this film was a complete and utter flop.  I'm sure everyone reading this will know why and I'm going to save it to my "Worst Movies of 2017" list, I'm sure I'll get some flak for that, but in a day where I thought it would be an even better day to be a superhero, let's just say this film didn't go out with a bang, nor did it go out as a whimper.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best way to explain to a new viewer of this movie is to show them a cutscene from the beginning of the film, in which our protagonist, Mr. O'Donnell, is standing at a bus stop waiting to go to his sister's funeral. Mr. Ot'Donnell has a habit of getting in arguments with bus drivers. At the bus stop he sees an ugly woman get off the bus, and the bus driver is so angry that he is about to slap Mr.O'Donnell until some other man helps the poor schmuck get off. Oskar, a very fat guy, comes along and convinces the driver that it's funny that fat people make funny faces when they walk around so they can intimidate people.  It turns out that the guy who was being insulted was a homeless old lady who was the only one in the funeral procession.    In the next scene Oskars' sister has a heart attack, and he is trying to find someone to help her.  This movie was written to be the movie that shows the world how crazy our society has become.  There are so many movies where a person dies and is brought back to life, but in this film Oskarl is brought to life from his coffin, but still keeps the same personality, except that now he has a wife.   Oskarns' girlfriend, Linda, and brother, Stan, are very rich, so they could do any kind of work.  But then the other rich people decide to come and live with them too.  The idea is that this could be a good place to raise all the children, but then the rich people don't really want to take the responsibility, so Oskarna has to take a job to get money for them.  They go off to work at an ad agency in New York, and then Oskaran decides to stay behind to take care of the children while his sister is there, and Stan goes home.  In the meantime Oskara is taking jobs at the same office as his sister, and one day he asks his boss if he can work on the floor.  He goes off to take some of the most difficult jobs and the boss gives him a desk and a chair for his desk, and a very small office.  Stan comes in and finds a very nice office and a clean, soft bed.  This whole process takes a long time, but Stan finally gives him the job.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! If you have seen this movie, you know what a terrible movie it is, but if you have not, you better stop reading this review because you have only yourself to blame.!!! The film begins with a black and white short scene of a woman's funeral, that you can't even be bothered to make out the details of. The next scene, we jump to a modern day. A woman's husband and son are in the hospital trying to save her. She lies on her bed. She's very upset. Her son and husband are holding her hand, trying desperately to calm her down. In the background is a very disturbing image. A young woman's body slowly rises and falls as her heart is pumping blood and trying to keep it alive for the next cycle, but she keeps losing blood. After three heartbeats, she looks up at us and says, "I hope I'm not dying." Another heart beat and then she is dead. Two heartbeat later we find out she is a zombie. Then she goes into another life as a waitress at a "restaurant". She talks to a group of people talking on the phone. They all go to church and they all go back to the restaurant together. They eat, talk, and drink. The people around them are getting a little too crazy. It seems to be a good place for some "fun". Then it is time for the zombie to get a job, but this time he's going to be "a part" of the "rest of the gang" and not just a mindless zombie. In between shots of the restaurant and the gang are a few shots of a zombie, running and running. Finally the scene switches to the main character getting a job. He goes to the funeral again. He starts talking and then his heart stops for one moment. Then it starts pumping again, but the heart beats and pulses so fast the blood is constantly foaming around his mouth and eyes. He tries to hold the blood back with his fingers and to try to drink from it. As the heart pumps the blood through the body the blood goes to his brain and brain tissue is damaged, which causes him to become delusional. The brain cells can't be repaired so he begins to believe he is a "Zombie" who can change his skin color. He kills a few people, but he's not sure why. After a few more people are killed, they take him to the nearest police station. There he
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Happens all the time in the genre of horror. What has never happened to me is to see a movie that's even slightly entertaining, even if it's just a movie about two kids who think they're invincible. So, the kids are wandering along the street, and they meet a man named Jim who thinks they're cool and asks if he can play hide & seek with them. Yeah, that's it, the movie is so bad that I had to watch it just to make sure I had the right name for this terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I enjoyed this film. I had heard a lot of good things about it. I didn't really watch it to learn anything about the movie, just to see an excellent movie. And what a wonderful thing that is. The film has an excellent plot line, I'm not sure why anyone would bother watching it. Its a thriller about two young guys, an ex soldier named Jack (played by Robert Patrick) and a young student named Jimmy (played with a great sense of joy, David Warner). They get along very well, although Jack has a bad temper and is jealous of Jimmy for having a girlfriend. One day, Jack sees Jimmy's girlfriend on the streets and he follows her. When he does, he sees a woman who is not human. A creature has attacked her and Jack wants to do something about it, to which Jimmy agrees to help. But things don't go exactly as planned. It's all a great adventure with lots of great action. The special effects are pretty good, they have a lot going on. The character designs are good for the most part. There aren't many human faces, but it is the creature's face that is the most impressive. Jack and Jimmy are great. They both have the same kind of attitude. I would give this film a B. Its not a good movie, but one you can enjoy all of the time. If you want a good horror movie then this is your movie. I hope this film has a sequel. I'm going to miss this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is nothing more than a bunch of cheap, pointless jokes that are set-up to be funny when they do appear at one point.   There is never any reason for any of these jokes to be there except that it's all just for the sake of it.  This is really bad!  If you are a huge fan of the Harry Potter series or have even even a passing interest in humor this movie will most definitely not please you. It's just a bunch more cheap, senseless jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found myself feeling sick to my stomach the entire time and thought that the movie was really slow in the beginning, but a really creepy movie which I really hope that it doesn't happen again in my city.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a classic American tragedy in the old days. All the old cast from the '50s come together once again for one last shot at revenge. The characters are almost always the same, and so is the plot, which consists of two acts. The first is a good action scene that, like most of the old '50's films, is very funny, and very fast-paced. It is in the second act that the film takes a strange turn and then goes off the rails. The second act is about revenge, a revenge that is only served up on the cheap. I've seen lots of great action films like that over the years, but this is the worst. I mean, a man comes home to find his wife and kids missing...in a car with a bomb. I'm not saying the movie is bad because of that. It's fine...just not great...for such an old film. It just doesn't work...with all its characters. This film is not a good flick.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The ending of this movie was so lame.  First the girls are hanging out in the park, when they pass a boy who has a sign on his face that says, "I'm a virgin."  They talk to him and ask him if he is a virgin.    The movie then cuts to the boy having sex with a virgin which turns out to be a boy that just lost a virginity, just as the girl was about to lose hers.  Now you would think that the boy would have his dick-nipples tied and be out with his new friend.  The girl says that she is a slut and will go out with whomever.  She walks over to the other boy and says that his girlfriend is cheating on him.  And that's when a bunch of cops show up with their weapons drawn and start shooting at the girl.  The ending was lame.

She has a few friends who join her for a weekend in a cabin in the woods. They take off their clothes, lay on the bed naked and do whatever they want. It's all very kinky. The two leads were awful. They should have been played by a kinky older man.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie!   As good as the movie was on the whole, the acting, the cinematography and cinematographic effects were all top notch. The story was pretty much perfect, with a beautiful, peaceful ending, but I would have liked more of a plot for the film.   The only negative thing that I would mention is the music in the film, which wasn't that bad, but didn't sound that great either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not a big fan of this movie. I was more interested in the movie than the actress herself. The only saving grace for me was that she did make some good "funny" faces. If the director is going to go to the trouble of putting her in a movie that is about some stupid group that steals and kills people, that is where the fun lies. But even then, it was kind of a letdown from all the other films she has done.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A mediocre comedy about a couple of drunk slackers in a strange little town. They go in to see the movie and see a scene with a naked woman on a sofa which is taken off and put into a bucket of water on the wall. It has no punchline and doesn't seem to have been filmed in a particularly original manner so the humor is not too great. If you like the idea of watching a couple drunk slacker movies then check it out. I would say check it if you like alcohol heavy comedy films.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't want to see the movie at all, I was thinking it could be good when I saw it in the theater. The movie just doesn't interest me. There is a very small part of the movie where a couple of guys break into a house. There, they find a woman asleep on the bed. She is sleeping but her eyes are wide open and her breath smells like rotting fish.  They drag her out, beat her, then she makes them clean the house for her. She doesn't say a word. I don't know if I would have even called them to help. I can't believe it could have been anything other than a cheap horror movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It starts off with the classic "Mystery Man" opening narration. Nowadays it doesn't have the same impact as it had in the 1950s.   It's a pretty decent mystery at that time.  The main story line of the film is about the kidnapping of a woman who has a husband and son. The police work is almost non-existent so there is no chance of her rescue.  There are some clever bits here and there.  For example, when the family get together and make a pie the wife remarks that they could make a better pie if she could have more hands.  When the police are at work and the detective talks about his past experiences, the mother gets angry.  They are rather slow moving and it doesn´t help the slow pace.  This is the first in a series of stories that are all based on the mystery, and the ending is a bit of a let down.  2.25 stars out of 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the most "troubled" film I've ever seen. It has no story, no plot, no logic, no suspense, and no action. I'm not even sure if it has a story. It seems like it just has a guy get killed by aliens and then some guy tries to find out what they wanted with him. I have seen this movie a million times and I can tell you that this movie should not be considered a science fiction movie. Its not really about aliens or aliens getting killed, it's about some dude and his car getting destroyed by some giant, space robots and flying monsters. The movie does not seem realistic. It does not have good special effects. The special effects are not very good, but they are not bad enough to ruin it. It is not a bad "sci-fi movie" but it's nothing special and even worse than some bad sci-fi movies I saw. It just doesn't make any sense, it doesn't work, it just seems like some guy who never learned how to act in front of girls was trying to impress some girl by doing a comedy film about a stupid idea about aliens getting destroyed and being killed by a girl. It doesn't seem very funny at all. I can't really describe what is so wrong with this film, but it really annoys me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Worst Movie In The Universe by John Carpenter. It's a movie that has a lot of great qualities and yet is not even remotely in the same league as the other Carpenter movies. The main character played by Vincent Price, is pretty boring and doesn't change at all as he goes along. There's something about this guy that is off-putting and you wonder why the director has him around for a while at all. We learn that in life, you can never take anything with you. When Price has a heart attack, his wife has to come down and take care of him. She takes his name and gives him a job where they're not supposed to leave and sleep in the garage. In fact, at one point, we see Price sleep on the porch because his wife hasn't woken up and he has to keep watching him.  He eventually does find a girlfriend and she's sweet and nice, but he's just not the same person he used to be. He's just become a lot weaker, weaker, thinner, and weaker.   When Price gets back from his stay with his new girlfriend, he starts having trouble with people in general and has a horrible time at his job.  It becomes apparent to him that the company that employed him is pretty crooked and they've been cutting corners to save money.  At some point, there's a murder and the guy who murdered him is the head honcho of the company.  This guy, as it turns out, is very evil.  For some reason, he doesn't mind that some of his company's products are a lot worse than a few months ago.  The movie's over in less than 90 minutes, but it still feels like it's been sitting around for months waiting to be released.  I'm not saying this movie is perfect, I'm just saying that at least John Carpenter is able to pull off a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad sequel. The story is the same, and the characters are all of the same kind - bad, lazy and stupid. The acting is bad, the music is bad and the editing is bad. The ending is not very good either. The best is the opening. It is a nice surprise, and it works pretty well. If you like the first movie, don't get this one! It is still bad, and that makes me hate it even more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first 2 minutes are just a bunch of bad jokes. This would be better if they had not had the 2nd best actress in the world (I think that's what she is) in this movie. The rest is crap. It's not really much to say, but I did not think it was a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What you are going to watch is an adaptation of the novel The Book of Mormon.  What?  This one, while a great book, was a huge flop as far as box office, but the movie has the potential to be a great film.  If it is as good as the book, it might be an awesome film. I have a lot of respect for those who are Mormon.  I know it seems like I am just bashing this movie, but that is just because I am not a Mormon and have nothing to do with them.  This is another flop for the church.  The story is about a young man who is a member of a small town called Deseret.  When he is eight years old his mother dies and he is raised by his uncle.  He gets to be the center of attention whenever he goes outside of the town.  However when he is about to enter his twelfth year at school, he discovers a secret about the place where he had been raised.  It turns out that the people who raised him were not the real people.  His uncle was the real person and it was a church that took him there.   The Church wants to raise money for a place called the White Cliffs, but they have a problem, the place has fallen into disrepair.  To find this money, they hire a man called Peter and set him up as the leader of the cult.   He has a number of followers who are young and pretty.  They take over the school and teach the young men how to worship the "gods".  While this is going on, one of the younger boys, Daniel (Josh Gad), is jealous of the attention that Peter is getting and decides to steal something.   They find out that they are right about the school, and a fire kills the teachers and the place is in ruins.  Things get even worse when the girl Danny loves is killed by someone who was a former student at the school.  Danny is taken in by his aunt and uncle and his uncle goes back to the town where he was raised.   So far all is well until the town's leader, Elder Smith (Joseph Fiennes), decides that since the Whitecliffs are destroyed, there is no point in looking for the money and decides that they should all go back to their families.  Daniel decides that he has had enough and he plans to take the money to his home town of Palmyra to help
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most expensive movie ever to be made in America, a movie that the majority of the American public will likely never see.   There are some aspects of the movie that I think are pretty good, such as the special effects and the story, but as far as story, acting, and special effects go, I am pretty much the only one who likes this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good movie is a movie where the character doesn't do a bad thing and if he does, it's because he is trying to stop the bad people from getting out of jail and hurting others.   And if he is a hero, it is because he stops bad people. I really enjoyed the movie, I would recommend it to a friend.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was quite pleased to finally see a film that didn't rely on a few cheap effects to get the job done.  While the film is a solid action movie, it has a certain flaw that is more glaring than most of its problems.    The problem is that this film is really just an action film.    The story is pretty basic, with the action being fairly simple and quick paced.  It's also a film filled with an almost cartoon like quality to it.  In short; The movie is just a pretty boring action flick, but with a couple of funny scenes.  This film, in my opinion, is really a film for younger teens with a love for "action".   It could have been a great movie for these age group as they are likely to enjoy seeing the action that happens between the young teen villains and the bad guys.  As a film it just isn't enough to be taken seriously, but as a movie for teens it is pretty entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie about one boy who has an odd hobby which is collecting and then selling old people's possessions. He goes to one of these houses and it starts to show and I didn't know what to do with myself.  The plot follows this boy for a whole 90 minutes as he has to get rid of an old lady who lives in the house and then he has a terrible surprise when she tries to bite his arm off. I found this movie really well done. There isn't any kind of suspense or suspenseful element as you are given a lot of what you expect to see and that is an odd boy who loves old people. I think the actor who plays the boy was fine and there were some minor parts I liked in the movie. I wouldn't have minded if they had added more scenes in the story line that were just to let me know there was more going on. The plot could be better but it wasn't bad. There was a scene about a girl who is the house mother that I found a bit creepy but I can't say it ruined the movie for me. I just don't know how much you are going to get out of this movie but don't worry, I'll be watching something else.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film isn't so much a bad film as a bad sequel.   I remember seeing that it wasn't very good and I thought, this will only be good to bad again.  This was a good film, a bit cheesy, but it had a decent story. However, the film had no real theme at all.  One of the girls dies in the first act and that was all. There was a brief scene where we see the girl's body in a lake. Then in the second act the girl is seen in a morgue, but that was it.  I do not care for the ending and I don't like the story at all either.  All in all, a cheesy film with bad actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the beginning of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", it starts to snow and there is no sound at all, but somehow I manage to make out some voices in the snow.  I don't think it was even snowing during the beginning. I think I was just watching a documentary from another time. The bad part is that it doesn't even seem that there was a movie called "The Bad, the U.S. President" at the beginning; maybe that should've been it. The good part is the fact that when the narrator says that he's been making documentaries for three years about the bad president, he's really not joking. I guess that's what makes it so funny. I just like how the bad President talks so rudely when you are trying to help him. I like how he tells him how he can't stand the "paparazzi". I think that is the best part of the movie. The only downside is that the film has a very bad acting in it.   What was even more disturbing was the fact the President was a real piece of work. He had nothing but contempt for everybody and everything. I am not even sure what he could talk about. The narrator said the President is famous for "lacking knowledge, and a taste for women". He has a real mean look in his eye, and every time he laughs it hurts to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It really sucks.  I hate bad movies and this one really, really sucked.  It starts off with a great set piece where you get to see some sort of war between humans and apes.    It is really cool how they used puppets to bring out the human's voices.  The first half of the movie is a very boring, boring, monotonous movie.  Then some ape gets killed...again.  I have seen this one a bunch of times and it gets worse every time.  You have scenes of this ape getting killed and then a little chimp with a bone head comes in and gets killed as well.  This movie does not make sense at all.  There is no story, there is no plot, there are no characters or anything.  Even the music is kind of annoying.  If you like cheesy movies this is definitely not the one for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ಡ  I would have never expected a "dark comedy" to be as bad as this. The plot is that a group of teens who work in a bank are about to be fired for "being too sexy" and "too fat." What could possibly go wrong? But wait until you see what happened to the bank manager as the bank's "diamond boss."  "I'll tell you how I found out the bank was fired from the Diamonds!"   This is the first movie I ever watched when I was around eleven years old. My dad took me to see this movie and it is so horrible that it makes me cringe. I remember sitting in the theater, completely riveted to the screen. My first reaction was a mix of embarrassment and disappointment. I hated it! And my mom, being the supportive mother that she is, proceeded to say it was better than all the horror movies I had seen growing up. Needless to say, I watched this movie over and over again until I was old enough to be taken to a movie theater. It did become one of my favorite movies when I got older. Now I'm only old enough for this to be rated "R".  No, really, a bad film: __________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best thing about this movie is the characters. It gives us a bunch of funny misfits who love to goof off. All of them are a perfect combination of humor, intelligence, goofiness, and friendship.  A few of my favorites from the whole cast:  Cindy:  A "noob", but she takes her job seriously and isn't afraid to go against authority.   Cydney:  She is an arrogant woman who has a huge ego, but she's one of my favorite characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of the movie was awesome and I was excited to see the characters get their chance at redemption. When they actually get that chance they don't even try. There's a great scene involving a group of prisoners who have been sent to do hard labor in a mine, but the real problem is that, even when they get their assignment, they don?t want to do it. They're all basically the most boring people I've ever seen, all just standing around, talking, eating, and smoking, all the time playing with the animals. Then the second act, and the movie just completely crumbles to pieces. This is one of those movies that you watch without any expectations and it turns out to be a terrible movie. I understand why someone would pay money to see this movie, I just didn't enjoy it in the slightest and would not recommend it to anyone. - September 19, 2005The most boring movie I've seen in a long, long time
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never understood how so many women are so easily turned on by all kinds of men.   The main female character is a prostitute who lives in this dingy room with her boyfriend who was killed by her stepmother, the other male characters are just all kinds and descriptions of every man imaginable.  The movie is so bad that I think it was intended to be a joke so that everyone would have a good laugh, not to be taken seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed the first 2 or 3 episodes, however I felt like I was in a "babylon" movie. In the Babylon movie, the earth was invaded by the aliens and the people were enslaved to build ships, a theme that the show also takes on. There was some interesting dialog during the Babylon episode (i can't remember what I was saying about), but it was nothing really new, and it just felt like a poor attempt at making a Babylon movie for children. After about 3 episodes of this movie I was ready to just stop watching and that's when my wife told me to turn on the movie, so she could see for herself just how bad it was. And boy did she! Yes, it is not the Babylon that most people are used to, it's worse! It makes a bad mockery of the Babylon theme by putting a bunch of children on a ship and flying them through space and back. There is really nothing to watch there, but since I didn't get my money back after watching the first couple of episodes, I can't really complain.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have mixed feelings about this movie. It is not as bad as I am expecting it to be, but I would not recommend it to the typical family audience. The film is a poorly paced train wreck that is just too cheesy to be fun. The acting is all over the place, the story is poorly paced, and the direction is very dull. My dad liked it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry, but that was a horrible movie. Not a good story at all. It's all about the bad guy and his henchman stealing all the women. The movie never made any sense to me. I think it's a rip-off of "The Goonies". I just got off at the airport and couldn't stop watching it. I was looking forward to it all day.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I had not seen any Star Wars film before this one - I was too young when I first saw it in 1980 and it is still one of my favourite science fiction films. And I am still a huge fan of the franchise. Nowhere is this truer than in this film. I had to turn the sound on for it to sound right and the soundtrack was so good it almost felt like a good-bad-good film in a good time capsule! I love the characters and I loved the story but the movie is overlong and repetitive. If you liked the earlier movies, then this is an obvious choice for your next viewing."   Overall: 9/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had high hopes for this film and I really believed that it would be a great movie. What I got instead was a mediocre bad movie that made you think twice about even seeing it. It has a slow build up and really shows a lot of bad characters that should not even be there. At the time this movie was filmed, the idea of the future was still very new and people still had not fully embraced the idea that robots and computers could work together and could replace most human jobs. It was the 1990s. The people in the movie seem to be living in a futuristic world where everything has a silver lining. However, even then you would not believe it would have such an effect on a man with one of the most narcissistic personalities I have ever seen in a movie. He starts out as the "ultimate geek" who is the most enthusiastic member of a team of computer hackers. He does everything he can to gain access to the highest level computers, and he is quite successful. As the movie goes on he seems to lose his drive and focus. When he does do things his way, and even when he does things his father's way, the result is always disastrous. Even the final boss of the film, a computer from the future, gets into trouble because of the way that they do things. The final part of the movie is all about a fight between the robots and the humans and it is horrible and boring and will not interest anyone. The last scene is one of a series of images that will drive you crazy with the stupid acting that comes out of this guy's mouth. The plot is a bunch of bullshit from start to finish. The characters are all stupidly self absorbed in the stupidest ways and if you think they will have a little romance or laugh at one of their pranks, you will be sorely disappointed. The ending was supposed to be the happy ending but it was more of a depressing ending. I feel sorry for the people who came up with this movie, it was one of those dumb films that would be interesting to watch for a few minutes but as soon as the movie was over you would feel so hopeless it would make you cry.   So, if you like:   - The dumbest characters ever  And I really should not mention this movie.  If you hate: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie's first half features a couple (played by Chris O'Dowd and Toni Collette) who have moved into a duplex and then a house on a cul-de-sac. They get by on babysitting, and cooking dinner for their neighbors. They don't really know what to do with themselves, but they're happy together. They can't get a job, but with their "gifts"-- a big home and money, they keep up appearances. The neighbors, a young couple who have a daughter, find out that their daughter is having the first period and so the neighbors start to think about this strange couple and the little girl. The movie starts to go downhill right away. The film isn't very good. It is very cheesy and poorly edited. I really don't like the movie. But it is good for what it is. The couple don't know how to do anything. The only thing they do well is cook dinner for the neighbors and make them uncomfortable. There are some good acting moments. But I found the movie kind of annoying because the characters are so over the top. There is an older man (played as a comedian) who likes to tease the couple. The characters get on each other's nerves and there is nothing they do that keeps them from falling down a lot. The parents are in the background a lot and the wife and daughter don't even seem to be in the movie that much. They only get about 10 minutes of screen time, even though they are in it a good deal of the time. The young couple are not very interesting either. They just don't say very much. The woman is the only one who is really interesting. She is a bit of a snob and does not like the other woman's new house. I don't care that much if she is right and wrong. The husband (played with little dignity by Colin Farrell) is a very unenthusiastic person. He is bored. He doesn't say anything much at all. He seems kind of boring. He also looks like he is a child. This is a really odd movie. It's kind of interesting if you like cheesy, bad movies and you are bored with bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In terms of pure violence I was not expecting much.   The violence is so graphic that it makes the horror of this movie seem tame.  It is not.  The ending is very shocking.  I'm very sorry for the children of the family. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It really does suck, and the ending sucked.  The ending was so awful that I was left with a bad taste in my mouth for the entire movie, and I would not recommend it to anyone.  And yes, I am aware that I have a strong bias towards the end of the series, and to make matters worse the ending is terrible.    Now the ending of this film is bad in two ways.  First there is a terrible, awful death, and it is extremely cheap.  There is no blood in the film to get you excited about a good death.  The scene in which the hero (John Candy) takes out his gun, and has this really stupid "shoot him in the head" scene, only gets funnier when you realize that it has happened a few times in the series.  I do not remember a single time when a hero did this before in the entire series, not even on a cartoon character.  It is the worst thing I have ever seen.  Now for another aspect of the movie that is bad.  One of the characters in the movie is a character that is not used that much in the whole series, he is only used in one episode, and he does NOT do his job very well.  Yes, this is not one of the great characters, but he did his job well enough.  This guy is a moron, and for some stupid reason he cannot tell time.  His job is to tell everyone in the room when it is lunch time, but when he tells them the time, it is not lunch time. So he tells everyone to eat, and then when everyone is done eating, he tells the next person, then the next, then finally it is noon.  So you tell the person next to you, and after the person has been told that it is a nice day and they will have another meal, and you can leave, he will not tell you when lunch is over, he wants to get it over with now, and get on with dinner.  Because he does not know the time. This guy has a personality and a job that are much better that the others.  He is very stupid, and his death is not even that bad.   If you are going to do a movie about a series, maybe make a new one for the series of the original film with a better main character, and have a good ending, but do not waste a good actor like
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a waste of time. It takes about 10 minutes to set up all the clues, and they're all pretty weak. There's a little girl whose brother is murdered, and she wants to keep her brother safe. Unfortunately, he happens to have a magical ring, that makes his life better, even if it does mean he has to kill a lot of other people.  The other characters don't really do anything, but the fact that it's a "kids" movie makes it seem a lot more enjoyable than it is.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a huge fan of the new Star Wars movies. The first one was an absolute blast.  Star Wars: The Force Awakens has many things that work and some things that don't.  The best thing about it is that the story is a classic story about a boy who wishes to change the fate of the galaxy.  The story has characters that are familiar and have been used before.  But I do hate the fact that it is one of the few Star Wars films that doesn't do the lightsaber scene correctly (The lightsaber is a long rod that looks like a short one).   This was an obvious choice for a sequel.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A terrible sequel which takes you back in time to try and make us believe that the second half of the movie was even better than the first half. Not even the actors could save the movie because it seemed like they were doing the same thing again. And it made the story even worse than its predecessor. It's also one of the most poorly written films I've ever seen in my life.  The second half is supposed to be more like the first but the worst thing about the movie is the stupid ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting a sequel to this terrible film and I was happy when it wasn't (I had been looking forward to it because it was supposed to be one of the better movies from the 80's) but I'm sure it will be terrible for many more generations to come.  This movie is one of those horror movies that really is too weird for its own good.  It really shouldn't be a movie that a child can enjoy because it has no redeeming values and this is just another one of the horrific movies made by the horrible director Robert Bloch and this movie is a sadistic, horrible, gross and disgusting piece of work that I will never ever go to see again! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not expecting a bad film in this genre, but I was wrong about this film: this film is nothing but a horrible mess that is uninspiring, boring and unreadable and in the end it is even too much for its audience. The story is extremely confusing to start with, all of the characters are in love with each other and even the characters who are not in love, are all in love to the point that they can't get enough: in the film everyone talks about this movie like it is a big deal: what did the original authors of the story are up to?: it is the same as the other movie in this category, the film's story is simple: the author was an ordinary person who was trying to do some research on the human sexuality which he was told would make him wealthy, at the same time he had written the book that the other characters were telling each other to read: at first it seemed like a very interesting idea, but it was so stupid, so contrived and too convoluted, that it made me believe in a complete farce in which all the characters and the plot were created in a day, but the end result was a complete waste of time: I really had to stop watching this movie to figure out which story I was watching, and I also had to read the book to understand the story that I was seeing: it seemed that the story went a little deeper than this, but that does not make this movie any better:

"Weirdness meets horror in this darkly surreal adaptation of a novel written by H.P. Lovecraft which is said to be set in Los Angeles..."       ...  This movie is like a trip into hell - for real.    "The film follows a young woman, whose fiancé was killed by a mysterious murderer on a deserted road, and who soon after becomes possessed by a devil-like creature known as "The Beast"..."     The only thing more "weird" than the ending is how they end the movie: with the credits, and without anything to show for it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My daughter and I are big fans of this movie, our favourite actor as far as we are concerned, we always wanted to see the original version, we didn't see any of the remake, which is the main reason that we are not so thrilled about the movie. We both enjoyed it a lot. I also recommend the movie to everyone to see if they haven't already.   The original   is good, we loved seeing the new versions of characters, but it's a little bit too long.  There were a few characters I didn't like, and the story was pretty much unchanged.  Posted by T-Nerd at 6:26 PM The plot is really simple and the humor is funny (not in a creepy way though, and it's funny! I love it!). The art is beautiful, and I like the characters. It's a very good watch and I hope that it makes a lot more money than its budget. I loved it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When this movie comes up in your head you can't help think of the title 'Jurassic Park': it has a very similar feeling to the famous film; you sit in a small island and the theme is 'one day, the dinosaurs are coming'. The movie was never made by the original people, it was in fact, made by someone else, so you can only admire the genius of Steven Spielberg. I loved the film, it had great action and exciting sequences; in fact it's one of those films that I could imagine what the first Jurassic Park looked like and how it got made.   The story was interesting, it has so many aspects which add to it. There is a great suspense in the beginning, and also some great chase scenes, the movie is full of suspense!   However, the story is not that good. It has lots of clichés in the script, most of them are of this: the girl meets the guy, the girl is very special to him, he wants to marry her, so they move to a big city, they go to the movies together and in the end the girl dies! Yes, you are getting the point; the movie makes a lot of these clichés and they are not very original, the scenes are pretty much recycled from previous films, which leads to a very boring story.  The characters of the movie are just as annoying as the dialogue is. A lot of times in the movie, you just want to punch something in the face!  However there are some great moments, the chase scenes are good and the action scenes are really well done!  Some of the most exciting sequences are when the dinosaurs move. Spielberg even manages to create a really suspenseful film.  I did like this movie, it is not very good, but there are a lot good moments!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The one movie I liked this weekend.  It's a buddy movie in the classic sense.    A group of friends come together to see a show at the local amphitheater and end up having a night they will never forget.  It seems to be based on a play by the same name by Frank Kowal, who played a minor role in the play, that was filmed in San Francisco.  And in a way, it is, but in a far different way.  To begin with, this is a movie about a bunch of guys hanging out at a bar.  They have each other's backs, no, more or less, but it's not a bunch hanging out.  We have a lot of comedy and even some horror (it's in fact a remake of the "The Conjuring" ), but all in the context of a guy hanging out and making sure his buddies can't kill him.  In this, it really is a buddy-movie:  There's a lot to like about this movie: the acting, a nice music (there are very few bad tracks), the location, it's just a movie in a nutshell that we don't really have a favorite or even a most favorite part of.  The main characters are interesting (and not at all predictable), the special effects are OK (not the best in the world), and the comedy is light but fun.  I have little issue with any of the characters or their motives.  It seems that the characters don't realize that they are supposed to be heroes and they start to believe they're villains, the movie never really gets to the good part until about 15 minutes into the movie.  You'll have fun and you'll be happy to have a fun time with the guys.  If you haven't had a friend movie in awhile, I suggest you give this one a shot, especially if you like buddy-cop movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved the opening scene. I mean, seriously, the opening shot of a bunch of people, huddled on a dark, overcast night with a giant, moon-faced owl perched menacingly above the roof... is simply stunning. It is also the scene in which the movie really gets going, and where the fun really begins.   The movie is loosely based on a short story by the same name by Raymond Carver, and it takes place in a small, town called Rookhampstead, in an English village in which there has been a terrible tragedy - the death of a little boy. The people in Rookhurst are horrified by the loss of this young person who has always been very special to them, and they try in every way they can to make sure that nothing like this will ever happen again. And for most of the movie we follow these local heroes as they try to keep the fear and fearlessness of the local people (and by local I don't mean the local police), even in times of extreme need. And it is these two things - fearlessness and fear - that we most care about during the movie.   a love story.   at first it's just a simple, cute story about a boy and his little owl, but then it takes on an even greater dimension. It's one of those movie moments where you just have to be there, and I mean to be. And I was. It made me cry so hard the first time, that I could only watch the movie in the dark. I wish I had filmed it in the bathroom, where no one could possibly see, or if they did, they probably would have left long before I got to the bathroom. This is one of the things I loved the most about this movie. It does away with any kind of pretence and tells a very human story of the human spirit, of humanity at its best, in a way that will stay with you long after watching it. I can't wait to see how the rest of the movies pans out!   Read the first five or so paragraphs and you've already seen everything the movie does have going for it, including some great performances by the kids, a fantastic ending, and some of the best music I've heard all year. But that's just the beginning! Oh, and if you've never heard of the legend that the owl is the result of the soul of an old woman dying and being given to an
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â If you like the last two movies from the original franchise "Die Hard" and "Die Another Day" with Bruce Willis, then you�re going to love this movie. The cast is great. I liked Willis and Keanu Reaves. The story follows two gang bangers who decide to rob a bank by pretending to be a hit man. The plan works fine until one of them (Jason Statham) is arrested and thrown in jail for the crime. The plot thickens when the authorities find out that one of the guys (Michael Keaton) is a cop and the other (John Goodman) is the head of security for the bank. After some action sequences, this movie finishes in one big shootout in which almost everyone is killed. It is a very cool ending to a cool movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My daughter has been begging me to watch "Taken", a "horror movie" since she was a kid. We live in the middle of the woods in Connecticut. I was in love with the movie when I was a little girl. We watched it together on Sunday nights when my husband was home from work. I am not sure what the problem is with this movie. I don't mind the gore or the acting, but the story was a complete train wreck.   It seems, like the movie was supposed to be a "spy thriller", but the spy didn't know what he was doing. He didn't even know what the CIA was doing, and he still tried to do what they told him. A few of the scenes were a little hard to watch, especially when the CIA guy was going through the garbage cans.  I would like to give this movie a chance, but as far as a "gore movie" goes it was a very bad idea, and I just don't know why the director thought a "possession" was a good idea.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish someone would bring this movie back... The acting is lame, the special effects are bad and the characters... are... lame. A "B" movie for most of the movie. It would have been better to go up a grade because at least the action was good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found the movie extremely boring, it is basically just a guy with a strange mask that makes his face look really ugly (as the movie claims in the title). I wish they took out the part of "Mummy." The film has all the charm of a dead book (but with more blood). The story is just about "a bunch of guys who are obsessed with a mummy and they need to find one. So they all go to the jungle to find it. They find the mummy that is dead and the guy who killed the mummy is a monster and they have to go in the next room to find the real mummy, who turns out to be a woman (it's the movie I've seen the most times and I can't find a good reason to watch it twice), but she turns out not to be so much a mummy as a "superior" one. You can't really tell which of the guys is the real one because the film cuts out so much information (like the guys' faces, faces with glasses, voices, what they are doing, anything, everything). After they find the girl, they have a brief talk and then get killed, which makes it interesting. This movie is very much the movie where you're supposed to believe in something because it has a good story, but all you do is have a lot of fun with your friends killing everyone. This is a pretty weak movie. - December 19, 2005No real story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As you know by now, the movie is about a man who goes to a country where they're a bunch of hillbillies from the '50s. One thing that's the same as the '40s: hillbillie boys are all mean to the point where they will rip off the clothes off young girls. I guess, it's a metaphor to get the viewer thinking of things that happen in their childhood. I wasn't a fan of this movie at all; it has a lot of good jokes, but it's too long. The best way to describe it is a long version of "Mommie Dearest" - a good short movie about a lonely man.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Not even close to being a bad film, not a bad man, not bad at all. Very much like the movie "Coyote Ugly" the characters, acting, story, direction, etc... all excellent. The director was the same guy as in Coyote Uglies, the plot was similar but a different story. I'd recommend this movie to every cowboy, every cowboy fan. Great characters, great story, good directing and direction. This is one for every cowboy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never thought I would have to say something about a movie called The Thing. It was an awful movie, at least by the standards of the 1980's. The movie was supposed to be a sequel to The Thing From Another World (1980), a movie which was itself a prequel to 1979's The Thing from Another World: A Christmas Horror Story. I'm not sure who decided to put a new name on The Thing movie or if it was just a desperate attempt by the movie production companies to get back in the game. Maybe it was a good idea but it was an inopportune idea, as most movies would be. The Thing was supposed a story about an expedition that tries to save its people from the creatures that live in the Antarctic ice caps. The problem was that most of the characters did not fit in to the concept they were creating. There were two female characters (Lori and Karen), and two male characters (Mike and Dick, who looked like the two boys who had a thing for each other in the first movie ). The women were pretty well dressed and the men were basically the same, and yet the women did not look like they could even move a finger (if they had any). And the other characters were like a bunch of people who didn't belong together, in terms of looks or any kind of personality. It was almost like the movie was trying to sell itself as a "true story", which it probably could have been, if it really had been about the Antarctica expedition. But it wasn't, and in fact the movie really fell apart a long time before the end. The story didn't help either, as when it finally got to the Antarctica, there wasn't any real story and nothing was accomplished, or even hinted at. If the movie had really been about "something" being trapped in Antarctica, then the actors involved would have been able to make more use of the time that they had (if any). The movie felt like a very rushed movie and was almost a waste of money, money that should have been spent on some good story.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting is not very good, and I did not expect much.   It is an epic fantasy, and that usually means there is little to it.  This story has to do a lot of things, and it is very long.  The first 2/3 of the film are very slow and boring, and then in the middle the action starts, but the action is also boring.  Finally when the bad guys attack in the final act, I was thinking that they would end the film in a good way.  I give the movie a B+  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I didn't have much expectation to be surprised by this. I have a few horror movies I've seen and this was the worst of them. I've never seen such bad acting in a horror movie. The plot was as boring as a dry sponge. The actors had terrible accents, and the makeup effects looked like a bad joke. It's so bad there is no point in making a review. I am shocked at the number of people who have seen this film and thought it was great. ~~~~~~~~~~ I had to check this movie out because one of my friends told me to. I had never heard of this movie. I went with a friend, because I thought it would be like a campy horror movie or something. It didn't do anything for me and I went home. This movie is a waste of money. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ I'm going to preface this by stating I like a lot of movies (some not so much) but this is not one of them, IMHO. As a matter of fact, I can't think of one movie I like quite as much. It was a long time ago that I was in the mood for a good old fashioned slasher. This flick never let me down. If you like your slasher on a grander scale then you owe it to yourself to check it out. ~~
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this film was terrible from the beginning. The movie starts with a girl named Annette, who is in a relationship with a man named Ed. A couple of days ago Ed breaks her arm with his bike and he decides to have a doctor check it. His sister, Alice, comes in and says, "It can't be true, he broke her arm. It can't," so they go to the hospital where Ed works. The doctor says it's broken in two places and when he does a biopsy it's found that it can't even be fixed. His father is mad at him and tries to kill him. So Ed tries to leave the state in a truck with two friends but his father is there and he's chased by the police. Ed has nothing left so he ends up staying in a friend's house with his sister. Alice is sad because Ed is always so sad. She thinks maybe Ed should come live in the house with her. He says he won't go because he doesn't know how to be around her, but eventually he does learn, but Ed is scared. At the beginning the movie seems good. The characters feel real and it seems to be a little bit like a fairy tale with a little dark humor, but as the story progresses, the movie turns into something that's hard to watch. It was really hard to see a cute girl with a broken arm and a crazy man chasing her around. The story was kind of confusing and I couldn't understand the big twist at the end. If I knew how the movie was going to end it would have been easy to watch, but it's hard for me to find the humor in this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  No, you're not watching the first season of The X-Files.   This movie, however, is just horrible.  The acting is awful, and the storyline is just awful.  The first season was decent.    I'm not a big fan of this movie and I'm only going to say this:   If you haven't seen it, get rid of any tapes from the first few seasons of TheX-Files  and don't even bother watching it.  It's so bad that I don't think even The X Files should get to see it.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      A bad movie is a movie with bad actors and bad songs that do nothing to add anything to the overall story.   The story starts out really good when we see an old woman who just doesn't seem to like the modern era.  When she is asked to come clean about a secret her husband has been hiding she tells of a child she had a long time ago.  This is a good plot, I have enjoyed a few of the older children movies I had seen and like the older child they just had fun and were entertaining.  The second half was really bad but not the worst movie they ever did.  What is worse is when the child is born and the old woman, knowing she will never get over the sadness of her child leaving her, tells a story about her time as a child.  I am not the biggest fan of these films but with how bad it was I couldn't help but see it.  Another thing that annoyed me about this movie was how the acting was bad.  There were a lot of actors who played a child and one of them I was confused who played the other child. Did you like this review? Subscribe to my blog for more movies reviews!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What in God's holy name is wrong with this movie?  Not one moment of it has any real feeling about it, the whole thing is like something that was filmed with a cheap video camera, and someone who knew nothing about acting, and then given a script to try and pass off as a good script, the only thing that makes it better would be if it were a remake of the film starring John Candy and Linda Blair, and in that case it would still be horrible.  It is just so bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************************** This is the kind of movie that I like because a) it's made by one of the best writers in the business b) it has that old fashioned movie magic c) it is one of those movies I will remember for a long time I could go on and on about the way that the characters interact with each other's personalities or the way the movie has it's own unique style of horror with its own style of special effects. But I'm getting off track! ************ This is a movie that really shows that the movie industry had become a joke with all of these "good" old movies being remade and updated as the old style and style of production are gone. And I don't mean remake it was in a whole new medium! It's been made into a movie for a stupidly cheap price that shows it all of the original film. The actors all sound the same, the music is the same except the title is no longer called "The Thing" but "Eggs". I don�t know why they don't call this movie "The Egg and the Thing" that would have more credibility. ************ What is wrong with this movie? ************ 1) There is no way that an egg could stand up and walk on two legs. ********** 2) There was a lot more action in the original movie then in this one. ******************* 3) They changed the movie's title! *********** 4) They tried to make this one more scary! **************************** 5) The story is about a group of boys who are trapped and need help to escape their predicament. ********************************** 6) How about the special effects? ********************* 7) The opening was very cheesy. ***8) The special effects are all CGI and the effects are not as good as they used to be. **** 9) The ending was also pretty cheesy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! Bad ass, ugly and loud. Like a bad dream. A bunch of guys walk around in tuxedo and I guess their idea of a good time is to go to a ball where all the strippers wear sexy clothing. Well I guess that's what they want to do, go to the ball to have some fun. After they have a few beers they take a turn to strip, but they get tired so they walk home and try to sleep. But I guess they were not sleeping as the next day they walk around the beach and then they walk to the bar for a drink. Well they get drunk and the stripper asks them to take her to the club as the night is ending. Well the striper is not that sure about this but I guess she knows she is really beautiful and she knows that they love to be around her. So she asks them if they want the big dance with her but I think they think about it first because she is beautiful as can be and she is drunk. Well anyway the stripless dancer is not satisfied so she goes and seduces the two guys and then we hear some terrible screams. What the... Oh my God!! I mean who would think that such a stripper could really give me a heart attack! I know it must be the alcohol in the beer but the worst that can happen is that she would end up being killed!! So one good thing that I remember about this film, they took out the sex scenes. The ones that I felt were unnecessary. Also the strips are not sexy enough. The only other thing that can be said about this is that it is funny as hell!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a decent little movie.   It is a simple tale about a child who is in an orphanage, and how his foster father, the teacher, tries to help him to become a man. I loved the fact that the teacher and the foster father were both played by the same actor.  His accent was perfect and even as a kid I thought this kid was very brave for trying to do some things he did not understand! I don't understand why he wanted to take the man's hat, but it was funny.  I thought the story was very simple, and I thought all the action scenes in this movie were great. I also really liked the little moments of levity the kid had as he did things like go to a museum, get a picture with a statue, and go out for a walk.  Even though some of the action was somewhat hard to follow.  It was still very well done.  One thing I didn't like was that the kid was a bit silly.  Sometimes I wished he would be more like a real boy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it's safe to say that The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a failure on both a theatrical and a cinematic level.  It's not even a good movie.    The actors who played the main roles are pretty much in their 20s as characters that should be in their mid 30s or late 40s.  If they got older they would have done a much better job.  Even the plot isn't that interesting, I'm not even going to try to make it one.  There's a lot of stuff going on that shouldn't even be in a superhero movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is the reason why movies like this don't get made anymore. The story is about a guy in a video store that sells classic arcade machines.   One day a customer named Timmy comes in and wants to get a cabinet for his classic gaming system, so he purchases one for $10.00. He decides to take one apart and put it back together again to make one that's even better. He then puts it together to try and beat a guy named Mario in one of the original games. Timmy then tries to beat Mario, but he never got past the first level and gets stuck at the very second level. He ends up losing.  . Tim is stuck for eternity. He keeps trying to get back into the game. He tries using his knowledge of the game, but it doesn't work. Eventually, Timmy becomes a ghost. He walks around on the walls, in the clouds, all over the place, in all his retro glory. Eventually he sees a woman, the one who made his classic machine a success, walking down the street. Tim can't believe she would still be there, even with everything that's happened to her. He gets his answer when she walks past and then disappears. He just keeps walking down into a small cave. He finds a little green frog living in the cave, that seems happy to see him. He gives it a few of his coins to keep it happy. In his pocket is a small ring. After a while, the ring starts glowing... the ring is real!   After a bit, Tim finally escapes from the cave by using the magic ring, and he takes one more look at the woman he met before he left. He tells it that if he ever sees her again, he'll come back with his friends so she can help him win the game he was always looking for. He even goes out and buys his friends a plane ticket. He doesn't have a plane, so Tim uses his ring to get one from the guy who made the machine, so they can get to the island where the game is. He is about to get on the plane when he notices that the frog is gone. He realizes now that the ring isn't real, but the frog knows better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~ I would first like to say that this film is one of the dumbest movies I have seen in a long time. ~~~~~~~~~ The acting was terrible.   It is a really bad movie that was made as a vehicle to promote a new book written by an obscure author. It is basically the same movie every time with the same actors, same plot and same stupid dialogue.  A movie that has almost no humor. The actors are too stilted.  The film is not funny. The movie is not original.  It was a good idea to get some people to promote this book. It would have made more money if they had just used their real names.  This film is a bad example of bad acting and bad ideas. I really hope that this book is a disaster.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Posted by: Gino at 3:42 PM   When you don't get what you pay for.   The movie starts off really good. But then things get a bit sloppy. I had a real hard time keeping up with the story.   I'm not sure if it's because of the fact that the movie was made in 1978 or because the movie is being produced by the same guys who did the series of films about the 1970s. But this movie could not have been made by anyone other than the same people. The dialog is almost like a parody. That's not a bad thing if you ask me. I don't know if I would like to see a parody of any genre. There's a lot of dialogue, but that's the way it went.   of course, if you're looking for a comedy. This is your movie. If you are looking for an adventure movie you will be disappointed. I will say one thing though. The film has been done before. It has gotten rave reviews from those who like action, action, and more action. If there is something else that is great in this movie it's the costumes. They are just too great! One of my favorite parts is the way that the bad guys are made to wear the same outfits. And when the movie really gets going, the sets become so awesome that you can't help but to smile while you watch!   If you've seen this movie in theatres, then you know that it is one of the better films in the series. As soon as I saw this, I was able to tell that I'd seen it before! I could have sworn that this movie was a parody, but it really isn't. I mean, how many films have a villain whose name is "Big"? But at the end of the day, the movie had a very good story and it was fun to see all the action. It's one of those "action movies in the middle of the story" kind of movies. There isn't a whole lot of story, but when it comes to action they take it very seriously. There is a scene at the very end of this movie that is one for the ages! If you have never seen this film, it should be on your list. One of the best adventures of the 1980s. I give it a solid 5 stars!

This movie follows the story of a guy named Jason "Wrench" Grady (played by the guy who played "Homer Simpson" on the Simpsons).   The movie is supposed to show us all the problems of the poor people in a small town. The problem is that these poor people are never shown as anything but victims. I mean, come on! They just do whatever they want. They drink whatever they can get. They have no clue what to do if their lives get too tough.   In one scene we see a guy being beaten up by a bunch of guys because he keeps running into oncoming traffic. The whole movie is filled with such moments: people drinking while driving drunk, people driving with the wrong car registration, people using drugs because they feel like they can't go through with it because they are scared of what they will do when they wake up in the morning. And when all that isn't enough there are also the crazy characters:

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â All the problems that I could have anticipated have been present but what really hurts this movie the most is the stupid ending, where all the bad guys are killed or killed by the police and the ending is just a bunch of excuses why they couldn't defeat all the superheroes.Â This is the only thing that this movie didn't do well so I hope that they can make a sequel with some more redeemable characters instead of the one we have now.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never expected to like a horror movie that takes itself very seriously about things like demons, possession, and a demon woman in the back of a van, until I saw the trailer for this movie. This movie has the typical cheesy "showing me something funny" style of horror movies that I was not fond of the most.  The movie started off with a scene where the police were called to a local house. The husband and wife were trying to scare their kids by setting their car on fire, but the fire ended up causing the daughter to be possessed with an evil spirit.   The wife and daughter were locked in the house and were both being tormented by the demon girl, but they managed to escape to a nearby school and called the police.  While trying to rescue the daughter, the police officers have to fight off demons, demons and more demons, just to keep them away from the kids, even though the father of one of them is a demon.  Unfortunately for the demonic girl who was trying to become one with the girl, she was destroyed by the police and the demons who tried to eat her.  After this I was hoping this movie would be better than what it was.  Despite the cheesy "show me something scary" style and low production value the story was okay, and the demonic possession storyline was okay as well.  I guess the worst thing was the low budget, but I guess that doesn't matter too much considering how horrible the movie was. So that was my review of the movie, what do you think?   Watch this movie to find out!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen... What the fuck!?  So this movie is basically a remake of the 1990 version of The Exorcist (not the sequel but the remake). But don't let the title fool you, this movie isn't at all a remake.  The entire movie is one long scene of a little girl looking for an exorcist and being followed by an angry old man with a whip. The little girl is taken to a house (well, a "totally fake house") that is clearly a movie set, complete with the old man on a throne, the evil mother (a white woman in a black dress) with a baby, the priest with a white face and a strange wooden cross and a few other things. The priest takes the little girl to the church to perform a "ritual" (the kind where a kid walks on an altar and does some stuff) and then he comes back with a bag full of stuff. But a bunch of demons are out to get him.  It is clear that a new director just came on to the project. If you aren't familiar with the original, just go read an article about the movie, it will explain it all.   There's also a lot of violence and sexual violence in the movie.  The demons are supposed to be the bad guys in the original movie and they are portrayed as evil, but the movie gives us no indication of that. I would have avoided the movie but I couldn't help but laugh at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful.   The story line is lame as ever and the characters are just pathetic.  I felt bad for the bad guy from beginning to end. The action is not very good either.  The music is just okay.  This is a must see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one of the greatest (if not the greatest) scenes in an awful movie, we see a group of friends having a barbecue one summer. It's a bit like the "Back to the Future" movie of the past with the cool, future-looking cars, the cool technology and, best of all, the awesome, future looking women. The men love the women: they're funny and smart and fun to be around, they're so hot. But their love for the girls is nothing like their love, or their sex lives, for that matter. It is a love of the body and a love for sex. The girls' bodies are beautiful, which is good, but not that great of an attraction. It isn't until the men start getting "too into it" that we realize these guys aren't into sex at all. The film opens on a scene that is not even in the script: we see the girls talking at the dinner table. The guy at the end is the narrator, who starts with a few things he learned in a "dictionary." He says: "You know, I had a great relationship with my mother, and then she started to get a bit odd when I was an adult and had to start paying more attention to myself. I had to make a move, right away. So I went to the sex therapist. He was pretty helpful; it turns out that sex is about a lot more than it used to be. A nice body is more than a hot body, an important body is not just a hot, flat body. But there's more to it than that. The body is important, but it can only take so much. The mind can do a lot, but the body needs to get in there and make some good memories." After all, how else can you explain that after having sex, the sex is always the best.  But it was too late for the narrator: he now had a wife that he was not having a good time with. This was a story of his relationship with the women in his life that was too important to leave behind. The narration was a joke that had nothing to do with the film, but I just love how the script manages to make it funny even if it's not the main story.   The plot is a little dull. It tries to be a "romance" movie, as it is a story about the life of a couple that has a nice, good
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only way to know if a movie is good or bad is to watch it.  This movie is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life.  The main character is a retarded idiot with no redeeming qualities.  There is not one good thing about this movie.  I saw this movie twice and i loved the first time.  i thought it was a really nice looking movie until the end.   What this movie is really about is a guy who is raped by a group of people.  He is then killed and his body is thrown over a wall.  After that, the person who did this to him tells him that he is free to go and he tries to leave.  Then some guys try to stop him and he falls down and into the pit and they all laugh.  In the end, this is the most depressing movie i ever saw.  Do NOT Watch this movie!!!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film begins with a group of high-school kids walking in their neighborhood. A few weeks have passed since their parents died and a new kid is being introduced into the family. The kids begin a friendship, but when he shows up one day, the kids don't react well. One of the girls is a loner. He tries to bring out some of the other kids. One kid gets angry at this newcomer and throws something at him. Another boy tries to help and tells the girl that she shouldn't be so sad and tries to cheer her up. The movie progresses in a straight line and is almost predictable. Nothing exciting happens or surprising happens in the film, but it is fun to watch.   My rating: 2 out of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So many people are praising the actors for being fantastic in this one. Not a bad thing at all. They do great work. However, I don't want to hear about "the great acting" again. This is about as bad an acting performance as you can find. I don,t know if a good actor can bring in such bad acting in the face of a horrible movie. I've been to movies like this a few times, and it is simply awful, so this is just an attempt to get a few laughs out of it. I was surprised to see it was a remake because it was so different from the first one. This movie is very cheesy, almost a rip-off. The movie starts off with a terrible girl, a young school girl that just wants to live a quiet life of her own, until she meets the young boy, who is not her type, until her teacher comes around to teach her and they fall in love and have a family. I am very surprised that Hollywood hasn't made a movie like this. It is such a good script. The film is based on the novel written by a French writer called Guenon. It also has some Christian music. However...the script and music is just a rip off. It would be interesting if the characters of this movie were actually human beings. The only human being that is presented in this movie is a creepy guy. The rest of the cast is made up of robots and animal beings. I really feel sorry for the young actress who plays the girl. She looks like she is made of rubber. The scene in the movie where she is giving her massage is absolutely terrible. She is supposed to be doing it. She must have used some kind of machine or something. She was really out of control in this scene. Her body is constantly moving up and down the massage table, her face contorting as she does so. I think this movie could use more editing. It was so long that I don?t think I could even remember all the plot points in it. The music is also extremely cheesy. When the girl is being massaged, all the musical instruments are played by machines. There is also a lot of music in the background, and the sound effects are all so loud that you have no idea what is going on. This was pretty much all I remember about this movie. It only takes about 45 minutes to watch, and I think it is so boring that I just stopped watching
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As a horror film I was afraid from beginning and I could not wait to watch this film again. The story starts in the middle of the sea and it's a story about a young fisherman, who is searching for an old woman's boat that was left on the sea at that point. The old woman had a mysterious power that was able to bring anyone back to life and this is the key to the survival of their group: the young fishermen, and the elderly woman, who, as a last wish to her husband, has been forced to keep her ability a secret for 50 years. With this, the group set out on a mission with a small ship, and a dangerous secret to be found along the way.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A great first feature from a new director, Adam Curtis, and a great first film in general from the BBC/ITV/New Line company (which was at its height of popularity when the original series was on).  It was a great adventure and a real shame that it ran out of steam.  The best moments are from episode 3 which, while not the most memorable, were very clever and amusing. __________________________ Watch this: Amazon Prime  |  iTunes  (h/t: Bloody Disgusting)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not the film it's made out to be. It's like the old western of old, where the main character is a little old lady with a big head who lives alone in a cabin somewhere far out in the middle of nowhere. She's there by herself, so she doesn't hear any strangers coming in the door, and she doesn' t see any people coming in either. So she doesn''t have to worry about any of the dangers that other people deal with.   She can talk to everyone just by thinking about it.  The plot is a big misunderstanding, but not a very interesting one. The main character goes with her friend (the little girl), her aunt, her father's brother and other family members to take a picture of a deer. The picture shows them going into a cabin where someone is shooting at a deer, one of which is her.  She tries to kill the deer by making her head explode (with a bullet from a gun), but she accidentally hits a nearby car, which crashes into the deer.  One of the men kills her (by shooting her with a rifle), and the group tries to drive the car out of the cabin without causing a great deal of damage.  When it's about to crash into the cabin, her friend tells her the story about what happened. The little girl tries to put the gun to her head, but she can't, so the father shoots at her with his rifle.  Then the man that was hiding in the back seat shoots her in the face with his gun, which makes her fall over and dies.  He also pulls out his gun and shoots her father. He had forgotten that the girl was his son, and he was upset about it, since she was supposed to be his little girl, not his wife.  Well, the whole time they're driving around the country in the big open wagon, a guy is watching them from an overhanging tree, trying to kill them.  I thought it was all very cheesy from start to finish.  There's an episode about this with the little girl's friend at the very end of the film, which just doesn't add anything to the movie, it's not even very exciting.  It's a bad adaptation of a really interesting film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â Â "The Mummy" is a bad film and should not be watched or allowed to be seen. Â The production was poor and the direction was poor.    The creature looked like a giant version of the King Kong's head.  The lead actress looked like she had not eaten for about six weeks.  What really made this picture a stain on the genre was the staggering failure of the acting.  Not all of them were bad but many just looked a bit bad.  Even though this movie was bad I could at least say that this film had something to it.  We got a torturous creature and a character that looks like a complete mess.  One thing is for sure there is no way this will be the next "Mummy"  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's very very hard to give a negative rating to a movie that's just so bad... The writing, acting and direction just seem so bad to me. The characters are such a waste of time, their motivations seem so weak. And they don't like to get out of the house to the library either... So really the only thing that they do at all is just be bored and spend time in front of the TV... A very boring and disappointing movie.   I feel this is an important lesson to learn that some people are really bad at writing. And you should just take whatever they give you without questioning the quality. You should just accept it...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie's been made in the 80's! And that's where I see this movie.  It's a fun little family movie about a few family members and their little boy who's got a secret he wants to keep to himself.    The little boy says he doesn't like the TV show the guy who plays the "Wizard" is on which makes him cry,   but the Wizard (who I will call "Watcher" because his name is Watcher) takes the little boy's brother (who is the star of the show) and forces him to take part in the show and watch him play "Starman" which is something which he is really not interested in!   Watcher has a "Witch" (I'll call her "Sorceress") who looks like "Star-man". This witch tells him all about her evil scheme and she tells him that when she reaches her target (I will call her the "Mastermind" so I will spell it as that) she wants to have her "Star Man" kidnapped...by Watcher!  But as Watcher goes about his quest, he finds he has become "star-man", a little boy whose entire world revolves around him! The little boys' parents try to help their boy but fail miserably! Watcher decides to help his child as well,  and it is a true joy to see Watcher try to find a solution to these strange predicaments they find themselves in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like your sci-fi violent and violent, if you want to see someone get blown up, or if you are looking for something to do in the middle of the summer then this movie will deliver. I'm surprised it didn't receive more than 10 of a possible 10 in this film awards because it was pretty terrible. A bunch of people who would normally be out working in construction are transported to a desert planet at the time when a large number of people had been killed and were about to eat one another. In the meantime, an enemy ship with large guns comes to attack the Earth. In order to rescue all those people trapped on the planet, the aliens send a man with an alien helmet to destroy the planet. The badness of this film starts right away. The first thing the movie did was a shot of a bunch of little kids playing on a beach at sunset. The next thing I saw was a large alien helmet coming towards the planet and blowing up the water vapor that was in it. The kids who were playing on the beach in the beginning of the movie went to sleep in their beds. I mean, in order to survive you'd think they would be out in the sun by now doing everything except playing games and laughing like crazy. But, you'd be wrong because their eyes started to close and their breathing also started to stop. Then I saw the large Alien helmet coming out from behind a tall tree which just goes to show the badness that can come from watching movies, especially horror movies. Then we got some kind of alien message coming out of the big helmet. It was this kind of message that I couldn't understand at all. The film then went into a scene where a group of people were in a room having fun and playing games. Then there was an explosion. I don't know if that is how the message ends up in the giant alien head but it was in the room with the games and the people doing their fun thing and it started a fire. In one way I like the idea that the message will save the planet but in another way I hate it because it looks like a waste of money. Not to mention the alien helmet that came out of that tree with the message in it looks more like a piece of garbage that would have gone straight into the recycling bin by now. I guess it makes the movie a better movie when it can get through just a few of these scenes but in the end it is a movie with a lot of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    At this point, you really can't say anything bad about The Room. It's a story about two guys in a weird hotel and you don't need to be a film geek to know that there's a kind of dark humor in the setting and in the dialogue. But I was a little disappointed by the execution. The script is terrible; I just never knew what to do with it. It's like a bad script turned up a notch to 11. It does a poor job of communicating and seems to waste time with superfluous dialogue. This leads to long stretches of nothing, where nothing happens and nothing is said; like something from a TV soap operas. And the visuals are the worst. They're so low budget that they don't even look as bad as they look. The camerawork is all wrong. And there are a million other little things like this that make this movie terrible. You have to laugh at the weirdness and weirdness of the story, but it's just not funny.   For the most part the screenplay is just plain bad. I just can't imagine this movie ever being produced.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is not good.   This movie tries to be good but in the end it does nothing more than a lame action movie.  This is a typical 80s comedy that was produced by Hollywood that tries too hard.  It will be a hard sell to many fans of action cinema. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've watched the entire Hunger Games trilogy and thought, "Damn, this is a really good idea".   The series is a masterpiece of world building, as every year, 12 kids are selected to compete in the annual games for a place in the Capitol and a chance to save the world.   It gets worse.  There is so much going on in each film, and it's all about killing.  Yes, there is a happy ending and some resolution, but there is no satisfaction at all.  The last film was more of a series of set ups and a setup for a sequel, but this is the one that is best for everyone.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a film student, I really enjoyed the movie as much as the reviews did, and thought it was quite creative and enjoyable. I had a lot of fun laughing and laughing. That is a good thing to hear in a movie about two very different characters: The old man and his daughter. I thought the old man was very charming and the daughter was pretty. I am not a child, but a young grownup who had an idea and wanted to make a film about it. In fact, I never did understand why it had to be such an old man; it made no sense and was very strange. Anyway, I liked it and hope it will become a classic. For an audience that can't take a joke, that's all I asked for.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say this movie was pretty terrible, but I was hoping it would be something better than it is, I can tell by the trailer that I am wrong, this movie looks like some cheap rip offs of movies like Dope and Bloodsport, and while I can accept that this is just a movie made for the money, the fact that it looks like they ripped off those movies was disappointing at least in my eyes. I found it very disturbing that they use these actors, I mean this movie is obviously going to be more like the previous films, and you can tell that the actors do not have much to do with the characters, I would like to see one of the cast in a role that had any type of personality at all, I guess these actors want the movie to succeed so they try to act like characters who they have never really experienced, but the only person this movie could use would be John Travolta, because at least he has a personality, but you can't really get that from a character like that. All this is bad, it's not a bad film, it is a very bad movie at times and it doesn't help that the script is just horrible, all these actors trying to act as though they are not actors at all but they are a little people like the little children in the first film and I just could not see myself falling for it. I can't wait to see the sequel, but for now this is a really bad movie that I don't want to watch anymore, and it's a shame because I really enjoyed it, but that movie was so much better than this one that I just don't see how anyone could have liked it as much as I did, and I don`t feel I have much of anything to say about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be fair, I can't say any bad about this movie. I think its very creative, the cinematography is great, the storyline is very good. But, it just didn't fit me, I just couldn't like it at all. I guess I just liked that it had some humor in it, its kinda funny, that they wanted to include a bad guy in it. I really liked the ending. A great story with very good acting. My son thought it was fun, but to me, it really wasn't. I've never seen a comedy that made me laugh so much, in my entire life! I think it'll be a nice movie to watch to pass the time, but I think for me, even if the kids like it, they would probably pass it up.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was the most pathetic one I have ever seen in my life. The movie starts with two men from the east that are planning to make a name for themselves in a world dominated by big bad westerners. Their plan goes wrong because their wives are killed and they are out for revenge. The rest of the movie is some lame action with a couple of "dumb action movies" like they are all a bunch of whiners and complaining about stupid westerners and whiny people with nothing going for them. One of them was a big guy with a moustache that would get knocked to the ground with one punch from a guy with no hair. Another guy would get hit with a rock by a little guy with sunglasses. One guy was hit with an iron bat and another guy had his face chopped off. The two main guys were pretty lame. The one with the moustaches was a giant wench who looked like she was made to be a prostitute. The other guys were some sort of western soldiers that never seemed to have any real fight in them. They all were big guys with long blonde hair that they kept under control by the way they carried themselves. The fight scenes were horrible. The fights in the first half of the flick were all done using a giant "buddy" system. You would pick up your buddy and go beat the heck out of some thug like he was nothing. You got some cool camera angles and the fights are good but there was little of anything in them except them using their buddy system and getting their asses beat. The scenes were just lame and there was no fight in the film that was entertaining at all. When the first action sequence ended you were wondering what the hell happened. The action scenes were all pointless and just not good enough for a good action movie. It also didn't help that the action scenes had their "action" cut out at the end. Overall, the movie was just plain dumb and the action sequences were lame.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I've ever seen. I really feel bad for the movie and the actors because I wish that I was one of them. The movie is about a couple having sex, the woman is an evil-hearted sista. But, her husband takes the couple on a vacation and I must say it looked like it had to take place at a gas station or something. I guess the woman was high on something she was selling. The whole scene with the woman and the man being in bed and the guy saying to his wife that "you're mine now,"  looks like a gay sex. It is just so over the top. The man gets scared and runs away,  then the man is in the bathroom trying to dry off and he's so scared that his legs go limp.  Then the man comes out of the bathroom and sees the woman looking at him.   It is so gay that I don't believe it was a real marriage.  The man goes into the bathroom with a towel and wipes his ass but then his penis starts to shrink and then he's about to go into the toilet and the woman stops him  and then it's over.  And then the man runs into the hall, but then the woman sees the man and says "What's your problem?"  And the man goes "Well, I'm a little concerned about you.  I mean that's all I have now.  Then the man gets out of his house and is going to see a psychiatrist.  Now, if you don't know,   you don;t like psychiatrists, but I think they're just like the doctor in the movie "Jaws."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In this film, an evil wizard is planning a new evil spell. He wants to put evil thoughts in the minds of everyone around him. In order to get this, he calls up the good wizards to gather some witches from all over Europe to his castle. But the evil wizard has also decided to use the magic of a beautiful young witch, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, to try to destroy the good and pure thoughts in a man. But a good thing came from this horrible plan. The evil wizard was captured and forced to wear a cursed mask and act like a silly, good, kind, innocent, foolish, but very evil person, in front of everybody.   I watched this film as a pre-cog in an attempt to learn more about the movie. I found it to be a very slow, boring and confusing picture. It was an awful movie to watch. I'm not even sure why I watched it, to be honest. The characters were a huge disappointment. I don't think I would have watched it if I knew it was only a comedy. The plot was very stupid, the script was so bad that it wasn't funny, and the acting was horrid. I really don't recommend anyone to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This isn't much of a movie, and it sure as hell isn't a good one.  It's a film about a couple who move into an old house in a small city.   It's one of the few comedies I remember watching.  It also is not one of my favorite movies, but it is one of those movies that was actually funny (I like my movies funny) and very funny at that (the movie has a lot of good ideas that work well in it).   The story is simple, the characters are all very silly, they all have a lot to say, the movie has some great performances, but is a bit too long and overbearing.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to kids, and this could be considered a juvenile comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'll admit that if you're a fan of anything with an R rating this one might be up your alley. The story begins with a typical family of two brothers, one being an engineer and the other a cop. They live in a nice little home. One day the father hears his older brother's voice telling him that he needs to go into an abandoned building at a gas station near his home. It seems to be a rather simple job. He gets his friend Frank (I think) to go with him. So off they go.   Well they drive up to the building and they are told that they can't enter the building. They think that it's an old, abandoned building and that it must be filled with people or something. Well the place was full of ghosts so they went in to get the man who has run it. We have our first introduction to the main ghost who is an obese man. I'd say he's in his mid 50's or early 60's. It's pretty obvious that he had a hard time getting the job. I thought he was rather pathetic and I don't know if he was doing it to be funny or because he wanted the money.   the other ghost is the one Frank goes to get to. It is the female ghost who looks pretty much the same as we all do as kids in our own way. She's about 15 or so. You can tell she's got some very big boobs. She has no problem with Frank trying to get inside the building with a crowbar. He's able to get him in but he also gets knocked to the ground when he tries to get in. His friend Frank gets him out and the two continue to try to get into the building so that the ghost can get at them. There's lots of other stuff going on during this film that just never adds up to being a good movie. The plot is just a mess.   A little boy finds a dead cat. There is more death and murder going on than one can reasonably understand. The movie would probably have been better if it wasn't so over the top with gore, monsters, etc... It was also not too good for a movie of its kind in the 50's.  .
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was at work a few days ago, and the movie played for a couple minutes at its scheduled time. So, I picked up my lunch, went to the bathroom and watched it again. But I was bored and didn't get involved. It was quite a let down. I'm not sure that the acting was very good. You don't get to hear the best of the actors. It didn't have any special characters, and not much of the story. The plot is a little too contrived, the plot is pretty silly and uninteresting, the ending is a total disappoint! I'll give it 3 stars instead.   Read the full review.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this bad movie about 3 times now. So far, the acting is decent and the plot is weak. It is all based on the idea that the devil came down to earth and was really a nice guy. He went around and sang a song or two at the movies and gave the audience a laugh or two. Then he disappeared, the crowd laughed, but didn't stop laughing or crying about the evil bastard who was just messing with their lives. As the story goes, this movie was shot in the late 1970's. At that time it was considered a "porny" movie. I don't want to talk about all of that. I want to focus on the story. It was an adventure movie where an alligator (of course) was supposed to rescue a couple from their home. As it turned out, the couple had no money and the alligator left. The owner of the home went around trying to find the alligators' next "home". At first he found some people on a trip, but the people didn't seem to like them and said that they were not nice to live with. The only thing this movie really has going for it is some funny dialogues. I think there were enough jokes to keep you laughing all the way through the movie and it is supposed to be a comedy, but this one did not seem to have a point. I guess that's why so many people don't like this movie. - April 29, 2005Bad movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Crazy!  Very poorly acted!    I was really expecting to enjoy this movie but I just don't.   The plot is all over the place and is not worth the money.  What's so bad about this film?   A couple of things... the wife isn't allowed to have an abortion.  That's it.    She's told that she'll give birth in four months.  And they can still watch the baby at the same time, it is impossible.  She gives birth to the baby in the car.  I didn't see anything of this baby that was bad and the baby was tiny.  It wasn't even cute.  Then it gets worse, in the end the baby dies and the husband doesn't give it a proper funeral and has the baby cremated.  Wow!  I guess they didn't think a couple of months would give a woman time to have a child.  This baby is so small it could easily have been wrapped in plastic and carried on a tricycle!  The whole thing was just so stupid.  If you like this stupid movie you could get it for a lot of money. If you don't like stupid movies, don't go see this one!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is bad.  I don't know why I took the chance of watching it, I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this film, but I found it enjoyable to the point of enjoying it.  The film is about a group of teenagers who live in an abandoned and dirty apartment complex that has been run by the homeless population.  The film is basically all about one boy who falls in love with a girl who is the daughter of one of the tenants.    The movie is not good, it is bad, the music, acting, and cinematography are terrible, and it doesn't really feel like a movie, it just feels like the plot is not very good either.  This movie is pretty poor, so when you have a low budget film like this made in a lowbudget year in Japan, you have to ask yourself: why is that poor budget being wasted on such crap?   You have this kind of thing happening in this kind Of a place.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad horror film that is not scary at all.   It's not a horror film at all, in fact the first few minutes of the film are filled with nothing but a couple of people walking down a hallway.  For about 5 minutes in they don't talk, they simply follow a couple. They even take a shortcut when they walk the halls.  This scares the hell out of me! I think this could have been the sequel to a cheap movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ My son found this movie, and he got it a "4" out of 5 Stars. My son is not a big sci fi fan, but this was a good movie. It was set in the future where the earth has been abandoned, and a large alien spacecraft crashes on earth. The earth becomes a prison planet for the aliens. The humans get a few days to escape their fate when the aliens are alerted to their presence. All the humans are turned into zombies. There was a lot of blood and horror. The story was a bit predictable. I was disappointed by the ending. There were a couple of "twist" moments but nothing too exciting. My first impression, it had a more modern look to it but was very cheesy. My second impression, the aliens were a lot more interesting and creepy, I liked it a lot better. Overall, it was fun and I recommend to watch it. My third impression, my second impression was very wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was horrible, the worst I've seen from this franchise or any other franchise that is based on a series. The plot was awful and had no reason to exist in the first place. The acting was horrible and there was not a single likable person in this movie. I was looking forward to the sequel for years and now I'm looking forward just to stop watching this crap. You should read all of the comments on this movie's IMDB page instead of making a mindless movie that no one wants to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first half of the movie, the cast, which seems to be mostly a bunch of characters who were given a cameo in the previous film, appears here again. The movie begins with the movie being shown in a small, old theater. The first act is just boring in a bad way. The acting is terrible and very much like another Star Wars movie and that's what you get. In the second half of this movie, however, the acting gets better. The music gets more exciting, the suspense gets more thrilling. A new plot, which may or may not be related to the prequels is introduced and in the last third of the film, a new character who is a Sith Lord who takes the main character in the movie and makes him fall in love with her. This is where I started to like the movie but unfortunately the movie ends when the plot ends, and I didn't care about the story to begin with.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I heard this song, it hit me as a catchy little rock ballad, but once I'd heard this before, I started getting all kind of creepy vibes from the movie. The girl is a witch (the movie is set in a country where that's all they do), so there's a bit of a witch trial happening in the movie which makes for a pretty interesting premise. In short, the witch is pretty evil and kills people in gruesome ways. This song is about her and how her evil is not quite what she wants it to be, but she finds it hard to change her ways. I like it a lot. This is also a song about losing a child. It's pretty intense and the music is a little slow-paced. The movie is pretty good though. It has a couple good moments. The ending is pretty much just a sad, creepy ending. This movie also is not very good, but that can be pretty easy to overlook when it's on a decent budget.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Curse of Chucky has its moments but the whole thing is a travesty. The film follows Chucky as he attempts to escape from the orphanage where he has been held prisoner by his evil brother, Freddy Krueger. In a flashback, we see Chucky and his friends play on the swings, chase the clown, and ride bikes, the scene being similar to the one of the first "House of 1,000 Corpses", except in this case there are also a lot of dead bodies. The only thing this movie does right is the character designs. Chucky is the first victim we see and his design is very crude and ugly. Once Chucky manages to escape, the first shot of Freddy is very unsettling, and the whole movie is full of creepy shots. The movie looks so bad even a 3-year old could have made it look good, and even the special effects are not that good. Chunky is only memorable as a child when he cries in a scene, but this is also the first time I've seen a child cry in a movie. Another notable thing is how a lot happens in the first few minutes, and then you're back to the boring plot. I thought this would be a horror movie in the vein of "The Exorcist" (and "The Omen") but it turned out to be a complete mess.  The movie isn't funny. The story is boring, the special effect is weak, the music is boring and forgettable, and Chucky seems to be just as stupid as he was in the original film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is a total failure.  It has all the ingredients needed to make a good movie... it has lots of humour, it has action, it is filled with good character development, it can be pretty clever... the movie, sadly, has none of those things.   It is basically a movie about some high school student (who is the protagonist).   He has a girlfriend, and when his girlfriend dumps him she goes back to his home town, where the girl was from, she becomes involved in the same kind of relationships and a fight begins...     The movie is full of funny scenes.  It has pretty decent acting, although it could have been done better by the actors.  Also, I never like when people think they're going to do something that takes a while.  And one of the worst parts of the movie is the ending.  I really hope that they'll make a sequel, or remake the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********************* I saw the movie on the big screen and was very disappointed. It started out okay with a good introduction, a good plot, and a good ending. It was good. But once the good stuff was over, the film was just plain boring. Every time I thought the film had made it to the first act and had found a new character to hate, I was sorely disappointed. Then the bad stuff happened in a flurry of confusion, confusion with the ending, and the end with a twist. The twists did not come in a great sequence, they were rather sporadic, and when they did happen I didn't quite get it. I can understand the ending when you're dealing with a series of deaths. At least there was a good payoff. But I had not a clue as to what would happen next... I had no idea what kind of movie I was watching. This movie is all about the beginning and it is all poorly thought out. The story doesn't go where you think it's going. And this is something that I would not be willing to see if it were the only thing about the film I was disappointed in.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I guess I'm going to have to review this movie for my sister.  I watched it the other day on TV because I'm a sucker for a good thriller and I have a feeling I might enjoy this one more than a real movie would. So I did.   First off, I have to say this is an action movie. You have to understand that. The acting was good, but the story was mostly made up of slow-paced sequences of close quarter combat with weapons. There were a couple of other people involved and all I'm saying is that the action would be much better if it went to another movie.   to be fair to the actors who put their lives on the line, there weren't many memorable parts of this movie. The one I did remember was that one girl who had some sort of psychic powers, which the police had to be very careful around because she'd teleport a bunch of people at once, at least one person at a time. I guess that's what I was expecting from a supernatural thriller, but it wasn't good enough.   and then there was the villain, a guy named Mr. Big, who is apparently some sort to the spirits. I know they have some sort magic going on, but I really hope they don't take this movie as too much of an allegory for religion.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple is spending the afternoon together, when one of them notices a large object on her husband's pillow. They go to investigate, where they find the missing man's body. The next day, the couple is talking, when they notice something weird on TV and the phone rings. They check the phone, and see it has an unknown number. They call, and the person on the phone says: "It's me. You don't know what you are looking at." The man doesn't understand and says "You have a strange voice". The woman then says "I'm sorry. I don't understand anything." But the other person says, "This is no ordinary phone call. Someone is really very serious." The woman asks what that means, and he says it's her death. He then disappears and the next night the couple has another conversation. The man explains that they've found a body, and that he is going to find out what they are talking about. Then the caller says that if the woman wants to stay in the apartment, she must have a small dog, because someone was taking the man away from her before the body was discovered. When the wife wants the dog back, the caller doesn't respond. Then she goes back to the apartment in tears. The woman realizes that the caller is the killer. And that he's been after her all night. So she begins to think about the body she found.  From what I read the book had a very good plot, so I'm excited to find the book. I'm afraid of getting bored by the book as I already have with many other books. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is all wrong. The movie is about a guy who was in love with a girl who had recently lost her sister. The guy found a picture where the girl was wearing a bikini with a man on top of her in a bed. The girl was the "man in the bed".   I can not say anything bad about this film. It is not bad at all. The man in the "bed" is an interesting character and the movie does a good job in explaining this man and his situation.   The story line is decent enough and most of the jokes land well.  The movie does not explain the whole story line of the movie very well. There is almost a lot of stuff that doesn't make much sense and I did not find it all very funny.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was actually a little disappointed that they did not actually show how the plane landed at the airstrip.  They did however show a nice shot of the jet and the crew standing outside of the plane.  The plane in the end however is just a glorified prop.   I just hoped it would actually crash and was a little upset it did not.  I was hoping there was a bit of a sense that this is a movie about a plane and not about a man trying to find his father after the plane crash.  This film was not worth watching just for the plane at least. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to give this movie a low rating but the way in which the movie is shot, acted, edited is simply pathetic.   This movie is not even worth watching unless you already know the other two movies that the story in this is based on and if you didn't know those two movies, then this movie is a waste of your time.  It is not at all clear why, why, when, where and with whom are these people from and how they get involved with the cult, and why do they seem to have such an unhealthy devotion for a group of people who are obviously crazy.  How the hell were these people in such a position of power to begin with?  How did they manage to get everyone to believe such rubbish?  Why do all these crazy things happen to them in the course of their work? What exactly were they doing?  Is it just to make money?  Are they actually in a cult?  This is such a stupid movie that anyone who is able to read the book (which I can only assume is a difficult to find book, the reviews I found on the internet weren't good) which tells the story better than the movie can do it a better job.  I would have avoided this movie if I could but the fact that this movie exists is a good thing so I guess it is a sign of how screwed up things are that somebody decided to make this movie. I don't really know how to feel about that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This isn't a bad film at all. It's just not good either.  I mean it is made by a Japanese director of a Japanese film studio (they also did Death Note) but it is still in English, it's shot on 35mm, it looks pretty good and it has a strong story line. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***************** *********** I really did not think I would end up watching a movie like "Tremors". I'm no film buff and certainly not a monster fan. I just really didn't see a lot of myself in this movie. I have always disliked this movie a lot, and I've always considered it "A terrible mistake that went on and on and went nowhere". This movie is just...so...so cheesy! It was made in 1974, that was the original edition of the film (the remake came out in 1985...a year later!), and it was supposed to be a comedy. No way! There are very few films like this one. I've even seen some that look better...like the old movies from the 60's...or "Scooby Doo"....or maybe the TV series "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles". This is one of the very few that tries to be funny without it being cheesy or cliche. There are no jokes to be found anywhere...just one long monologue that goes on for 5 hours, which is not very long for a comedy movie, and it is really not funny at all. But don't take my word for it...just look at the trailers (I think I can get the trailer on YouTube, if I remember, there were so many of them, it looked like the movie was over 50 episodes...I was disappointed!) If you are looking for a funny movie and don't think you can stand it...think again!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a cheap and horrible movie, made by a guy who wanted to make a hit with "The Thing", but he got way too much wrong with this one. The story is bad and the special effects are bad. It is a stupid science fiction movie and a bad, stupid, terrible movie at that. Not a lot of jokes in here and all I got from it is a horrible movie. I hope there is a sequel because this is a very bad movie and really a shame in my opinion.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was so bad I was left wishing my life partner would kill me for being involved in it.  What made it worse was how she acted so smug in front of my face.   And I wasn't even involved but it still made me angry.  One thing that was very apparent is she thought she was so much cooler than she was and her attitude was so condescending to other people.  I really don't think that this is who she is, or should be, or thought she should be.  We dated about 2 months and she constantly made jokes and put other people down but she didn't care when it annoyed me.  This was my first experience with dating with someone who is so rude and doesn't take any seriously.  At first I thought she really was the bad one, but I was wrong.  My life is so much better with my life partners. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought the whole movie was a bit of a letdown. It seemed to drag on way too long. I really wasn't invested into anything the film was trying to do. All the characters didn't seem to have anything to say for themselves, even with the occasional humorous moments. There was just no punchline in this movie. It just sat around and made me want to go home. A sad sad movie.   Would I recommend this movie: No.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so ready for something else, another superhero movie.  But then I saw this movie and it got ugly.    It feels like an old western with superheroes that are not funny at all.  It has one of the worst acting scenes I've ever seen in a movie. The plot is weak, the characters all seem to be interchangeable.  In a movie where we were already told the bad guy is the villain, they make him a villain, and the only reason why we should root for him is because he is a white guy.  This is the reason why I will never ever watch a superhero movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________________________________________ What can I say about this movie, other than its not a movie. _____________________________________ I guess you could say the movie starts out with some strange looking people and an evil queen who was born with a witchy voice. What can they talk about? Oh yes, magic. That's why it's called magic. I mean, I guess it's not really magic but it IS funny.    The funny part is that the king of this land is dead and the queen is ruling the land. The queen is an evil looking woman who has a big crown on her head. Well, the king was a magician. She and the other queen want to have a big wedding because the king has passed away. Well...the queen does want that but there is a lot of people coming to protest that they need more king. The king's younger brother shows up and tells them that there has been no heir to the throne. It turns out the king is still alive. So the queen says she needs to have someone to marry to take the throne away from the younger brother. Well the king dies again and his younger brother has to go.  But the young king is no fool. He goes to meet his younger sister who has grown up a little bit. Oh, how the two sisters get along. One is more of the tomboy and one is the queen's sister. Well I'm going to go ahead and say...they go through some funny and sexy scenes together.  So the younger sister goes off with some of the queen people and that gets into an argument and the king and the younger king is killed.  That's what happens.  There is no king.  It is still a magic land and we all know that the queen had magic because she can kill people with a touch of her finger. I guess this movie is about witches...just for some strange reason.  1:20 PM

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************************* I've already given a negative rating to this movie and I haven't even started it. Let me explain what I think of this film: it's all about a young boy named Joe and his friends who ride around and play in the river. One day an angry hippo named Zod comes up out of the river and has a great battle with Joe. I would be willing to give this a B-Movie rating, but the problem is the writing: if you've seen the original Star Wars or the Planet of the Apes, you're used to the dialogue being extremely cheesy and stupid. The dialogue doesn't sound even vaguely like a young child talking. All you need to know about this film is that the hippo has been killed by one of Joe's friends who is named Jake and the other two are named John and Jim. It's like the dialogue was written by someone who couldn't figure out how to use a computer and couldn't even be bothered to write a screenplay! I don't care what you think of it, this film isn't worth a second of your time unless you're a child at the bottom of the world who has no friends and gets pissed off every time you want to play. If you're an adult that likes the sound of your own voice, go see a child play on the computer somewhere else. Don't waste your time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie "Pillows" is just like a movie about a family with several people, a daughter who is a shy and quiet person and a brother who is full of energy and fun. It's very funny. But the main problem is the acting by the actors. The best of the actors are the older brothers. The first brother (James) is a bit silly and sometimes is not acting in the right way, the other actors are doing good job with their acting, but one is not perfect, the girl seems like a bit girl, but she's not.    1 0 0 0  0 0 1
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Walking in on a wedding between a young woman and a married man (his mother is the bridesmaid) and getting to know everyone, we find that this has little to do with love, but rather is the latest in a string of "romantic comedy" films from a long line of mediocre ones. The film doesn't try to be something more; it just has what it is, a very funny and very stupid movie. The title character, a young, pretty, rich woman is going to be married to a very nice, rich, young man. But first, her mother is going out with a friend who she had dated when she was young. The wedding gets cancelled by her mother because of this but the young man is determined to get it going again. That's because his brother is marrying a princess but she wants him to go out with her instead. That princess is an older woman who only cares about her own pleasure.  The two women who aren't married and are having a dinner party get the idea of having a baby. They are going to make the baby by having it in the bathtub, but things go wrong when the baby dies of suffocation. The family thinks that the baby is dead and the husband and his mother argue about who is responsible.  A sad story about a beautiful woman being forced to go through a horrible experience. But the bad things don't end there, as soon as the wife and mother are gone, the other ladies decide to bring the whole thing to life again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ When I saw the trailer for this movie, I wasn't expecting much. I figured that, with all the attention given to its portrayal of the "horror" genre in the 1970s, the film would be more of a spoof of those films, not an authentic story set in a supposedly haunted house. Then I saw a rough cut (the movie is about an hour and a half long, so I can't really say that the rough cut is bad). I have to admit that I was very entertained, both by the acting and by the film itself (the film is shot with black and white and color, and this really helps a lot). I was also a fan of the book by Danse Macabre, so the story felt well tied into this story. If you enjoy those old-timey horror films that were often based on true events, or at least were based on some true events that were real, you should really go for it. I give the movie a B-minus.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit, I was a little disappointed with this, but I've seen far worse films.  That said, this one was pretty terrible.  If there's one thing about the movie I'll say it's that it reminded me of "The Nutty Professor" (though "The Professor" had a greater amount of jokes in it).  I'd give the rating a 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most boring and predictable of the series. I really like the first movie and this second one is much like the previous one.

The music is very poor and annoying at best.    I have to admit that it is not good, but in the end it does not matter.  There are a bunch of other movies in this series that are much more interesting and well crafted.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so incredibly predictable, I could see it coming right from the first scene. I mean, it has the same plot line that the others have. A little old man falls in love with a young woman and he takes her to a country house and then she is left alone in this strange old house, she meets a little boy (of course, he is not a little old boy at all) and he teaches her a couple of tricks that I won't spoil here. We get to see him take the older woman's clothes off, and then he is naked and all alone in his big old room, which he has built in the old cottage that is in the big garden behind the house. The little boy has also fallen in love and is very excited to have an older woman that is older than he is. He starts to dance for her, which is kind of cute, but it is also rather creepy.  Anyway, it is the big old man's wife (I think she is the one with the long hair) who does what comes naturally for this big old woman. She gets very excited about this young boy that she had been trying to get her husband to marry, and so she goes out in the garden and starts to tease him.   Then, the old lady gets a little bit bored and starts going about the garden to play with flowers, and it isn't long before she starts to have sex with one of the flowers, which she puts back in the flower pots. And this is where we meet our little man again. There is so much going on here, but there is not much else happening. It is just a little scene and some dialogue, which doesn't make it seem more complicated than it is. There are a couple more things like this which really do nothing for the movie, so in the end, it all just sort of becomes a repetition of the same old stuff. I'm not sure whether it is a good movie or bad movie, it just isn't very interesting, the plot is so predictable, and I didn't get much out of it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Somewhere between a bad comedy and a bad horror film. A guy walks on to a beach and runs into a mannequin (played by a dummy) who screams and runs away in a panic. After the mannequins are dumped onto the beach some guy (played a comedian) is on the beach with his wife (played as a porn star) and his son (played in a horror style by an old guy). At first everything is a little funny until the clown turns up. The clown has a gun to his head and yells "This is my land, you'll not pass!" His wife and son say they want to move to another country but the comedian can't leave because he has his "job" at the beach. The whole thing looks silly from start to finish.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I have seen that I found entirely too long, uninteresting and repetitive. The film follows a group of students from a school called the "School of Witchcraft and Wizardry" who come to this world to learn the art of witchcraft to protect them from the evil spells of wizards. But as we all know, the world of witches is full of trouble. Witchy things, not to mention a lot of baddies who want the school destroyed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is NOT the movie.    It is not a movie but a pathetic failure of a story and not a pretty picture.  Not even a movie with a beautiful song can save it from its terrible execution.  I really hated this movie!  This is a bad film for its time and is not worth the time. I did not watch it, I was hoping for something better than a bad, bad movie that fails at every plot point it has to make up the time it wastes to waste for the characters that are not even remotely interesting and are given the time they need to get caught in stupid adventures.  At least it is not like a movie that goes out of its way to make your ears bleed with the stupid dialogue and the bad acting it is always making up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In all seriousness, I like the idea of an alternate-universe version of the Marvel Universe in which some characters who went off on their own have become superheroes. The execution was weak, with the bad guys being all too human and the heroes being too well trained. I had a good laugh at the baddies' attempts to be heroes, like when they dressed as a couple and pretended to be on a date to a romantic dinner but then the guy went into the bathroom and the girl showed up and they were interrupted by a shower of water from a sprinkler head.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________ If you're looking for a solid comedy, get a copy of this one. There isn't much to complain about in this picture, except that it's very, very long. I could see myself watching it a few times after the movie theater got a "free" showing of it. Don't expect much of humor from this one, but it is still enjoyable.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are plenty of great movies out there but this is just a boring and boring movie. It was about a young kid and a giant flying squirrel that's trying to kill them (and their dog) and the kid never gets anywhere close to them. That squirrel was annoying in its little robot mode and I don't get the idea behind that. It felt like a cheap knock-off of the cartoon Wacky Races or a cartoon of the same name. I don`t think the movie is a complete waste of time. However it was not made for the kids.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The one time I see a bad story told well, it's when  I was a kid at church, and there were three of us, a couple of girls, and two of the boys, and they walked from the front door to the back door. The three ladies walked in first, and the boys came in next, and so the three walked. The first boy walked a little faster, and he was the only one with legs that didn't look like his feet. When he reached the back porch, the girl ran up to him, grabbed his butt, and said, "Hey!  Here I come! ",  and the boys laughed.  My husband and I were not very big on the "Good" movies at the time, though we have all seen "The Godfather".  This was a very good movie, and was an excellent way to get to know the characters.  It was not for everyone, however.  My sister and brother in law, in a move they may regret in the future, refused to let their sons go to it, and I got to be the one left, alone, in the house watching. It seemed like a long time before they got the kids out of there.    I thought this was the way to go when I saw a bad film in the late fifties:   The characters are so stupidly written and poorly performed.    I was shocked that in 1959 an American production had been sent to Australia (the production number is in Australia) and had failed miserably in its Australian run.       It was the third film in a series of "Diary of a Death Row Inmate" feature length productions which would be filmed in prison camps around Australia over the next 10 years.   This is one of the worst films ever made and the only reason it is mentioned in this article is that it is a pretty good example of how not to do a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________ ___________________________________________ _______________________________ 1/10 ______________________________________ ______________ ___________________________ _______________ The "Dirty Dancing" franchise may be over, but what does "The Dirty Dozen" have that that won't do? We see a group of teenage girls who are trying to get their lives together while being a distraction to the more well-heeled of their town. One of the major problems of the movie is that it never gets off the ground. It lacks focus, and instead just follows the girls around during their week of summer vacation. One thing to note about the movie - it does not take place in summer. Summer vacation in the U.S. is in January, and this movie was shot in May, and that makes it rather sad. The movie is really just made for fun. There is no point to be made - it is just a bunch of teenagers doing silly stuff. There are no characters - no development - no real character development. The main characters are all shallow, and they all try to impress each other, even when it doesn't make any sense. I can't think of anything good about this movie. 2/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't hate this film; I was slightly disappointed that this film had no potential as a film. The performances are the same old over-acting and over-plot-telling that we've come to expect from Hollywood films, which in its turn is the result of having a mediocre budget and bad script. __________ The "torture" scenes were so badly acted that you actually wanted them to be more like torture, and the only scene where I found myself in sympathy was the scene involving the mother's death. I have no idea what the point of the scene was, or why it was there in the first place.  This film is bad! The acting is laughable; the acting is bad enough to make me want to give up on the entire film; the music is bad; and the plot is terrible!  I really hope that this movie is the first in a series of films about these "crazy people" that live on the banks of the Mississippi.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Silly "dying guy" who finds a beautiful girl on the shore and tells her "don't be afraid to be you, your beautiful." He dies and turns back to water and his friend says "you're still a good guy." The story is that he is going to die and the other guy says "we're gonna find a beautiful woman." Then the woman says "I'm not pretty enough for you."   The last scene is that the young woman's parents take their daughter out to a lake.   They go to the lake to look for a woman and they see a little girl lying on the bottom of the lake. They're both going to be killed and her parents are going to get her.  One of them says "no, this is just a dead body." The other one says "donnie we're going to see who's really beautiful." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought "Hacksaw Ridge" was a brilliant movie.   This movie is about a wounded Marine that gets knocked down a flight of stairs by another guy and starts bleeding to death.  However, he does not die and he gets up again and keeps fighting.  This man has been through a lot and he kept fighting. There was a guy that had been hit on the head with a piece of shrapnel and he could not stand up straight.  He just couldn't move.  I think he was a Marine and he was still being treated and they just thought that this was a bad thing to happen to a guy.  The whole movie was beautifully shot and it was a very moving movie. "Hawksaw Ridge is one of the finest World War II movies I've ever seen and the ending is amazing." ~ Matt Damon
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this was one of my favorite movies back then.   If you have a child who loved cartoons when he was a kid, this movie is for you.  It is a story of a girl who has been abandoned by her family to live in a zoo after her father dies.  She goes to live with her uncle and he takes her to the zoo when the boy's mother goes to the hospital.  The movie is very short but it has an awesome ending.  If I were a parent at that time and found myself with a little girl to live the same sort of life then I think that movie would have been the one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We have a group of kids at a camp that are trying to learn about computers. They come up with a plot to blow up the computer room by setting a bomb under one of the computers. Their plan works well enough at first until the computers go haywire and explode. The group of children don't even try to hide it: they cheer and sing at every explosion. One of the characters becomes a sort of evil genius (though he looks like any other kid in this movie) and builds many machines that are more like a monster than a computer.  He then sets a bomb in one of his creations, the Monster. The kids try to build a bigger machine that isn't a monster, but instead can take down the Monster and the computer. The computer goes haywire again, and blows up. And all of the kids in camp, who knew that they were just trying to blow things up, start to cry, except for some kid that just smiles. The final film in the "Super Cute" trilogy is called Super Cute 2 (I like the pun, and think they're cool) and I think this is a good film. The plot is still stupid, but it does contain at least some good humor (though the kid's "stupid" ideas, though bad enough to make me laugh, aren't that bad). I think the final kid in the trilogy is the funniest thing in the film, and it may be a bad idea for some people to watch this film.  Review: The third Super Cutes movie in this series seems to be based on an older movie called "Cutey Dies". There are some pretty bad animation (I'll probably never understand why they would use it on a children's movie), a bad special effects and a few characters who don't seem to have a good idea. There are a few funny lines that may make some people think twice about watching the "Cutes". The characters still don't have much of a personality (the final kid who has a robot named "Monster" is also the most pathetic character in the whole film). The story also seems to drag a little (it takes a while to get going, and then goes completely flat). However, this is still a pretty good film that should be in the collection of all "Cuteness" fans. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's one of those movies I thought was funny at first. Then the movie became repetitive. The whole time was basically a repetition of one scene after another:  (1) A man sits in a car driving up and down the streets trying to find a woman he thinks he has a chance to get.  "She's too pretty. She has too much hair and I need it all gone. You know I don't have any friends."  This is when he bumps into a police car. The car honks at him. The man gets scared and starts to speed down the street. (2) He gets to a building and goes to a room where a girl is. He knocks on the door and then he goes into the bathroom where there is a shower. He starts to shower and gets out. After the shower he starts to walk to his car. 'Where to? Oh. Uh-oh. Uh, don't go. Don't go there.' He's afraid. (3) "Oh, what's wrong? What's going on? Oh, this is what's going to happen." The girl doesn't know he's there. He takes off his shirt. (4) He drives the car to the scene where he has to meet the girl. The scene is a nightclub. The girl says "You look like a nice guy. A nice guy." The guy replies: "I'll kill her! I'll kill that girl! I will." He takes a deep breath and says: "What do you think? That girl is mine. All of her." (5) "I am the most hated man in the country. All people want to kill me. You think all people hate me?" The girl laughs. "I think they'll all think you're funny."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story, while a tad simple, is great. This is a good movie from a very talented director. This one is for people who like their movie about an old man who has to take care of a little girl who is a witch after a long history of abuse and neglect. It's a cute little story that doesn't go away. The movie is kind of funny and it has a few pretty good special effects like the flying cat, flying cat's friends and even the magic tricks that were invented by the witch. The story is about a little boy who likes to play with a witch that's really mean and has a special way of killing her pets and the little girl is really nice and likeable but she's also a witch who wants to get revenge on the old man. The kid and the old guy are great friends and it's nice to see that the old lady has a strong support system of people who love her and are concerned about the young boy. There's a few great special effects, a nice ending and a good plot.  A nice little movie that doesn t take itself too seriously but at the same time there's plenty of action and a little bit of comedy and it does have a good storyline and good specialeffects.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  WITH ALL HIS HEART AND SOUL, A STAR OF THE SHOOTING SEQUENCE, RICHARD THOMAS WAS DEPENDENT ON THE FILM BEING CRUSHED BY THE HARD CORE OF HIS ACTING CHOREOGRAPHY. BUT IT DIDN'T EXIST AND HE DESPERATELY NEEDED TO STAY AT HOME. AND THIS MOVIE IS A BOMB! Plot synopsis: A young girl, a nurse called Karen (Sally Field), is living with a widower (William Hurt) who is a former soldier. Karen has a long-standing crush on him. When the couple decides to move on after a year, Karen suddenly changes her mind and leaves her friend to accompany him on a military tour. She becomes separated from him during the journey and is abducted by pirates who take her aboard their pirate ship. There she is used as a slave, raped, murdered and mutilated. But all this happens in a short time. As the story unfolds, the audience learns that a group called 'The Knights' are hunting down all of the "Spirits", people who have died in battle. The pirates in this movie have more than one "Siren", one of them a female by the name of Daina who was captured and killed by the knights in an earlier story. She was the reason why Richard lost the will to live and it was this spirit that kept him chained to a rock. Daina is the main reason why the movie doesn't make an effort to be an action-adventure or a horror, it is a tale about a family who's lives were torn to pieces by an evil force. The movie is all about grief, the loss of loved ones, revenge, loss and the ability to overcome. The film does a good job of portraying the way grief affects those affected. It also shows that it can happen even to the greatest of men, Richard's wife and children are shown to have been killed but Richard keeps the sword of his late wife Daina with him in order to protect himself from death. They do have one great victory over the evil knights. He was able to destroy a pirate ship full of his former enemies and rescue his wife. Richard is a wonderful example of the great man. He is an expert with swords, a brave leader and a good husband. The only bad thing about Richard is he has the sword with him all the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The title may sound like a bad idea, but the story is so dull that I didn't find it at all enjoyable. The story is about a kid called David, the son of a rich family. When he is 14 years old he has to stay with a family from Europe that is a few years behind on the family tradition. They are a family of two women, a mother and a daughter, and two of them are married. They all have the same looks, dress and manners. But David's father is extremely poor. He is working long hours as a plumber and is also a member of the local Nazi-sympathising gang. David is very fond of his mother. On one of the occasions the mother has gone into the family garden. David goes in to search for her. His mother is in a very bad state and has been crying all the time. David manages to rescue her. David tells the Nazis that they should stop being evil and get a life. When the Nazis come to the house, David tries to escape through the window. The Nazis shoot a man, David is not involved but it is obvious that he was involved. David dies in the struggle, his body is mangled by the bullets. He falls dead on the floor of the house and his mother cries hysterically. He had to die the way he wanted to. He has to die, he had to, and so, for the mother he had brought his dreams to the point of being finished. The wife, mother and daughter are happy with David, but he is very bitter about his life, and the way his life is ending.   My son would not like this movie, it's all so depressing. The characters have nothing else to do except to talk, and that is what's so depressing! The only characters who seem to have any sort of motivation or sense of morality are the Nazis, they know better than David or his mother!   I guess my complaint is not so much about the film itself, as about what it is trying to be. The director says he wanted a documentary, but it's just a really bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is absolutely idiotic and stupid. The main character is a crazy man who believes that the world is run by a secret cabal and that he is their leader, who goes out and destroys all of the evil men, women and children who stand in his way, which of course leads to the worst possible outcome.  There are no stakes here, no plot, no characters and the movie is a disaster, which just gives the main character a little boost for a laugh. Â  It's a total waste of time, the only good thing about it is that it looks like it's the original and I always loved it when I'd get a new episode of King of the Hill with this guy in it...

There were a few moments of real cool action, but most of it is pretty boring. I really can't think of another actor that can match Franco's performances in this one. His Franco-isms are really good and he does an awesome job of acting. The film starts off with a scene that is pretty much exactly what you would expect from Franco-verse. He and his girlfriend go out to a nice restaurant and end up running into a gangster and a drug dealer, both being a little shady themselves. So what happens next is pretty random: he blows up the drug dealer's house with a small drone. After that, a bunch of bad guys come out, which is pretty generic and it never deviates from the original premise at all. It's definitely not worth seeing, but then again, nothing about this movie was ever good, so why would it be any different here?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is interesting but it is a lot like the story of the film that was based on the same book: In the end, the protagonist has an accident and gets shot in the face, causing him to lose his right eye in the process. The film focuses on the life of the young, talented and talented but stupid, but determined boy. In this case the hero is a "Hairless Guy" or so he claims to be to the rest of the world. He plays on the streets of Buenos Aires. He has not much success so far and is constantly getting killed in various ways. The hero is only the third person ever to have the name "Hairy Guy" by accident. He takes a job at a bar in a small town, and the barman is his best friend, a "Laughing Girlfriend" (it is not easy for a "hairy guy" to have "girlfriend"). This makes him think of an ideal woman for him. One day, a rich man (who is actually a gangster) hires Hairless Guy to perform at a party. However the party is attended by some real gangsters. As a result, Hairless Kid suffers an injury so severe that he is sent to the hospital for stitches and the gangsters are killed. Hairless gets better and better. The next time a gangsters come to the bar he is hired again and he manages to kill them with his hatchet. There are some funny moments but ultimately the ending is a letdown.

It was a film that I thought would appeal to a number of people and it was really fun to see these characters do everything they could to get to this particular place. However, I thought it was very cliche for the entire time. I just didn't find it very interesting and that is the main thing I didn't like about this film. It is so repetitive that I don't think the actors were really playing much and if I was the one directing I don a much like it I would have changed it up a lot more.

And then he's trapped on a boat with a bunch of crazed pirates who are going around shooting each other for no reason, and the only thing I don't understand is why they are laughing while they're dead.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To the movie I saw recently: I've already seen many other movies, but for this one... I must agree with what's written below: A typical Hollywood movie. But I must add something about it: The girl in this movie is very beautiful (see for example the opening scene, in the forest... ) but so much is going on... It's like there's something going on there. But it isn't the movie's main message (see below), which is: "Don't worry if a girl falls in love with a guy, she will not love you back. Don't get mad when her best friend doesn't understand why she's so sad. Don´t get worried if she doesn't go to school to study, she just wants to watch TV". And I think this message (not about how to behave when you are in a relationship) is one which we will always get in movies... But... I'm afraid the movie will be a sad one. It's not just a bad one, but one that made me cry. When I think about the movie (which I finished on a Saturday)... I have to say I could have chosen any movie, from a good or a bad (that I haven't seen a lot of...), which would have been better. The actors were amazing but... it's not their fault... It wasn't their job to act (if they're talented enough to do a movie like this). The dialogue could be a bit more... But I won't mention that... I will focus on the characters. The story takes place in a small town... When a girl gets a letter from the school saying that she is going to the next level (or so she thinks) and she must take the high tests in order to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor (I can't help thinking that's the reason for the letter) it seems impossible... But she decides to do it, because that's what her mother said... The movie itself... It has the right idea to tell the story... And then it does not do it well... I guess it was shot before she received the letter about her dreams... And the movie has to tell that story... There's a lot to criticize about the way the movie was shot... The whole town was made into a very small, almost cartoonish place... The "villages" looked really small when we're in them... But the big town is full of lights... This makes the movie much more expensive
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not one of those films that leaves me with a lot of unanswered questions.  The film started off rather promising, and was good until the end.    I was expecting to get some kind of story arc going, or at least a way to resolve the story from the end of The Avengers.  But all I got was a bunch of random scenes that were shot at random times, some that were not even a bit convincing.  One scene in particular is supposed to be a very serious scene (even though it is clearly very silly), but it looks as if it was filmed on a cheap iPhone.    The film could have been better, but it has a lot going for it in that the visual effects are very well done.  There is a reason that I was glad that I didn't go to see it.

They all are hurt pretty bad but they pull themselves out of the hole.  They are pretty pissed off and in a rage try to fight the guy who came on board the bus that they are so upset about.  It turns out that there is a little demon that has been loose all along on the highway and its very annoying.  At one point he goes through the bus and kills everyone.  The other kids on the bus try to stop him but just can't seem to.  As a result of their troubles they all end up killing each other in the end."

I remember watching the trailer and thinking "this could be great...I really like this movie." After watching the movie and hearing about the problems from the first trailer, I thought the movie was not going to be as good as I thought. The movie is very confusing. There are some good scenes, some bad, some great, and some not great. The good scenes are awesome and it's good to see that the filmmakers are still going to make a good movie even if they messed up with a lot of things. This is a film that I am sure will be remembered for a long time...but it's a shame it is not a better movie....It's bad."

I don't normally write negative reviews but I really felt bad for the guy that I thought would take over my body, but he didn't. A big part of the film is spent in a bar, which I guess is what the film makers wanted as it's only got one customer. It's a very short movie, so I was glad the movie didn't go on for much longer, it was really enjoyable.   I would not recommend this to everyone, though I enjoyed it, but if you like horror, then I suggest you grab a beer in the bar and check it out.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. It starts by having the hero of the movie (Kwai) walking around a cave on an old fashioned computer looking for a girl in a yellow dress. This doesn't really set the stage of how the movie is going to go. The heroine goes inside and gets chased by three goblins! Then she has to find a way out. So, she ends up fighting the 3 goblins that the protagonist has to chase. The bad thing is that there isn't anything really special about these goblins. The guy who plays them is just kind of annoying. He seems to think that by using some ridiculous accents that the goblins will get to like him. At one point the heroine is supposed to kill the one wearing the yellow dress but instead of that she just fights the 3 of them. So you have the girl walking around in the cave until there's a fight. Then she looks for a way to leave. The thing is the whole time the heroine isn't really getting anywhere. She just keeps running into the 3 guys and fighting them. The story doesn't help either. The movie takes place over an 18 year period so it's pretty much the same movie over and over again. There are the same old stories from the beginning of the film. It's like the story has been written over a long time and just needs to be rewatched. The only thing that I liked about this was the fact that it had 3 of the 3 bad guys fighting the heroine in different roles.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to make fun of the movies of Wes Anderson, check out  Funny Games: A Film About the Life of Wes  in which Anderson is actually the main character, making up for his awful acting by being a pretty awful actor.  There's nothing particularly surprising about the story, it's a love story which ends with a death, and a bunch of guys being forced to perform at a party which ends up with one of them getting a face full of shit.    For those who like their Wes Anderson in a little more than a few well-placed fart jokes, this one will do for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________. I really liked this movie a lot but the special effects are nothing compared to the book. I have read this book before, but this film is much worse than the book and I don't see why. The special effects seem made up a lot by the director and they seem to be just a few shots at a time. There is no time to develop a story, there is some music, but that's about it. I liked this book but this isn't it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie about a guy who does a lot of research to find a new home for his cat and then when he gets the place he does a bad job trying to clean it out when he doesn't even know what is in the cat box.  Then he realizes that he is not going to get the job done so he has to clean up the mess by using whatever he can get.  The next day the cat decides that it wants to go out to the fields so he goes out and is found by a dog.  As you can guess this does not go over very well and ends up with the dog fighting the cat while the cats tries to clean out the cat boxes while the dog fights and eats the cat food.      I think this was made for a low budget movie and it really comes to life after the dog gets killed because it is so good.  When the dog is alive the only way to get rid of the cat is to go and clean out all the cat stuff in the yard.  They do that and then it is time to go back to the house to get more cat food and they can't get it so they have to keep going back to make it.  It is a really bad idea to make a bad cat movie because they should have found some way to make the dog live with the cat.  This would have made a great sequel and a lot better. 4/5
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ This was a really stupid movie about a really dumb cop. It's the same dumb cop from every other crappy cop movie. This movie was shot on a cheap camera and has a script by a guy who just wants to make something dumb. It has a few good scenes, but it never gets into the territory where the movie becomes really good. Also the characters are so lame and don't mean anything in the movie but are meant to be a little amusing. I also don't think the cop really is capable of solving the crimes he tries to do so it doesn't seem like it's meant to have a plot. It probably would have been better to have gotten some good actors to play this role.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoyed this movie. There is just something about a guy in a suit, with a mustache and a mustache that doesn't work for me, but he does have a fun, silly character. There were some good jokes in this movie, and it's a simple film that is funny.  The story:      When John Mecacci (James Meehan) comes home for dinner, the guy who lives down the hall is sitting across from him, and when Mecocchi's mother comes into the apartment, Mecaccia's father (Don King) asks him to be the one to call the police. It's a little strange, but Mecoccicci (who is playing the part of an Italian family) is able to communicate with his mother, who calls for a police officer in Italian. When the police officer arrives at the door of the building, Meco has the "Italian" officer, in Italian, explain that the apartment is in fact Italian, which is important because Mecorig's father and Mecocon's mom are Italian, and since Mecacchi's father is Italian, Mecaicon's family is Italian. And he's not Italian at all, and he speaks English. But it was too funny for me.   After all, the story was not very interesting, so why was I laughing?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read and enjoyed this book but sadly I am going to be doing without its entertainment for a while as it seems that the author has now run off into the arms of "the great" John Steinbeck with this new book "Life is Sweet." I've read a number of Steinbeck's works and have always found them to be a pleasant reading experience but this one wasn't any more. I'm sorry to say that "Life Is Sweet" is little more than a self-serving piece of drivel that has little hope of being enjoyed by the serious Steinbeck fan. I would have much preferred a book by the man himself, in which he can indulge himself and have some fun. But alas the author's pretensions to being a true creative genius have been crushed, and now he's looking for a good book to tell the story of his first and only novel. It's a pity that John Steinbecks first book will probably never find a buyer as it is a truly un-poetic piece of rubbish and not even a remotely good story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a fan of the "Cobra" series by Raimi. I'm not going to say what it's about; it's not so much a series of movies, but a series. The "Cobb" is the second, the third and the fourth movie. I guess I don't understand why these four movies, which are basically one long story that's loosely told, were made. The movie is full of violence, some humor, very poor characters and bad acting. The dialogue is cheesy. The story is not very good. It all looks like an excuse to do it. It's not even particularly well written. Raimies Cobra movies had much more depth than this movie. In "Coby," a man is attacked by an old man who is trying to collect money from an old lady. The old man, Coby, is a drunk, who thinks he is a big man. So, he's a big guy when he is drunk. The woman he is trying the collect from, Nancy, is so drunk that she is unable to remember what she wants. So Coby tells her he's going to kill her. And what's the point of getting drunk? Then she decides that she wants to marry Coby and kill her own husband. She goes to go get a man to kill Coby. When they go to a dance, they go on to a bar. And it turns out to be a bar for lovers, and they have a very bad time. So what does Coby do to save his marriage? He drinks himself to death. It doesn't make any sense. It turns out he had already died when he got drunk. I thought that was pretty bad. It ends with a shot of Coby hanging by a noose over his dead wife's coffin, and then a scene of Cobys dog chasing his dead dog. He's dead. So this is why he's called the Cobra. I didn't understand his character. I had no idea who he was. I could not believe this movie was made. I was not a fan. I'd never seen a cobra. I saw the cover art, I loved it, I was a fan from the first one, but I never understood how this stupid character became the Cobra and how this Cobra became a movie character and made the movies. It really confused me. It was really bad. I've never seen so much blood, I have seen so many bad movies. So
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! A great idea. Too bad that this movie is so boring. The movie is about the lives of six women who have been killed in a plane crash. The woman at the center of this movie (Katie) is only 17 or 18 years old. She is the only one who survives. She's an innocent kid who just wants to be normal, so her mother tries to get her out of this small town. They must then travel through a country in the middle east and to a town in Canada. The Canadian town (Canada) is run by a man named Bruce (Baldwin). I never thought I'd say this, but I loved this movie. All the women had different personalities, they were all flawed in some way and I found that hilarious. I had to laugh when the Canadian townsfolk had to find out that the men who died in the crash were actually alive. The way in which this film was shot was amazing. The scenes were slow and sad at the same time. Even the acting was excellent. I was very happy to be so entertained and to hear the voice of Bruce. One thing that bugged me was that there were so many bad movies that were made in the 80's that I couldn't get into most of them. This was a great movie to watch because it reminded me of other movies that I liked during that time, so it was quite enjoyable.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess we get a movie based on a "book" written by a guy who is not a very good writer and in all honesty he is not the greatest of screenwriters. In other words, there is not one good thing in this movie. I won't get into the bad things. First of all, the movie starts off with a scene at an arcade which is boring. The second half of the movie is full of crap like when the guy falls off a building. So boring, so horrible... The story is also about a bunch of bikers who go around and fight with people who fight them... This movie is also full of stupid and pointless lines like "You ain't seen nothing yet! You gonna fall of a building too, and die! And I'll kill you!" It is like a parody of a bad "road movie". It really should be called: "Bikers on the Loose: The Road Movie". But the last 15 minutes of this movie is the best thing I've ever seen! It's like a "movie" where you can sit on the back seat of a car with your kids and just drive off at 100 mph. I hope the producers of this film find some good things about their characters! It looks like a really bad movie but you really have to see it to believe it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************************** There are a bunch of old and bad films in The Muppet Show's early years that don't get enough attention. The ones that have been adapted were pretty good, although some of the more bizarre segments like The Muppets taking over the U.S. Capitol building and The Great Muppet Caper are a bit much. That said, The Moo-Hoo Show is probably the weakest of the bunch. The Munchkins are given a chance to be funny and are given some great sketches about the different kinds of food available in each country of the world. There are few laughs to be found as there are many slapstick characters from all over the world that don�t really work well in the context of the show. The movie is not a very good film. There is not much that is memorable about the plot, which is fairly dull and predictable. There were a lot of jokes that are not funny, and the film just doesn�t have anything that I would recommend to anyone. I am very disappointed in The Fuzzy Pink Monster as the character is fairly flat and the story is pretty forgettable. I don�ts this a good idea to film at all, and I�ll probably never see it again.

The whole family was very cute."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  (June 22, 2012) I was lucky enough to see this film, it is actually one of my favorite films to date. I really enjoyed the movie and I really liked how they told the story and what was going on. There are some people, in my opinion, that are going to hate this movie but in the end, if you are looking for a good action flick you will love this one. My favorite part about this is the characters. I feel like there was a lot of personality and a lot to be said about these people. The plot did not seem to add up though, and I guess you could say it doesn't add up. I guess it's a movie that is meant to entertain you, but as a result, it's really just a bunch of action. There was definitely some plot holes, which makes it very difficult to understand the plot to an extent. I do feel like it could have been better with a better script, I mean, it was alright in a way. The movie, even with all the good points, I felt like it wasn't really any good. I can honestly say this movie really sucked me into the movie for about 45 minutes. It's just so good to watch that it sucked me in.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So what you think?  It is an excellent animated film.  This is not a "mature" film. That's what I said. There are lots of sexual jokes (especially between the two guys), even if they're not really funny, even if there are too many jokes which make the film a mess at times. That said, it has so much heart.  The film begins with two women in a cafe (or what can be considered a cafe) which has become a popular place for people to gather to discuss the recent developments, including the recent events in Syria.  However, the cafe is on the verge of closure (it has been closed for so long that the walls are falling down) and a man appears who wishes to close down the cafe.  He tells them that it's just a temporary measure and that they would be better off selling some of their clothes there (the clothes would get dirtier due to the wet condition of the earth).  He says the cafe would sell better to the Muslims.  A man dressed in a burqa appears and announces to the women that they are to "go home" and leave the cafe as it's not fit for Muslim women.  As the women protest they are told that they should not try to change things with violence and they should be respectful.  They are then told that their husbands are going to take them somewhere, and that there will be other women to follow after them.  After this we meet a couple, "Cynthia" and "Giselle", and they decide to make the best of the situation by pretending to be interested in each other to hide the fact that they're married.  Cynthia then becomes "Piper" to Giselle's "Paul" (or "Paulina").  In the end we find that Cynthia is cheating on her husband Paul with Paulina.  We then see a movie called "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" and we find out that it is not about a man who can do anything, it is about a boy who is an incredibly successful and handsome guy.  There was a young woman in this movie (Minnie), a girl that had been abandoned by her parents and who is really the voice of reason.  She tries to talk to the boy Tom Sawyer about his difficulties with finding a mate and he eventually finds a woman who would be the most perfect mate for him.  When Tom Sawyer finds out about his problems with finding someone
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, it is a good movie but there are some really bad bad actors in it and the director really did an amazing job, it's a fun movie and i think it is one of the few movies that is interesting and enjoyable. It is like a movie by David Lynch and it is good, but like in the other David Lynch movie "Blue Velvet" i hope that they make a better version of it, cause there are a lot of problems with the plot that have nothing to do with the story...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first thing I noticed about the movie was that, for a horror movie, it had a lot of jokes.   This was good news.  The next thing I saw was that it has all of the things that make me cringe about horror movies.  First off, the characters are really unsympathetic.  I'll keep this short because I don't want to go into detail.  If you're a fan of any sort of gore, then you're definitely going to enjoy this movie.  This is where I'd probably have a problem with this.  But the humor is so damn good.  You might think it's a lot like a Saturday morning cartoon or a show like "Aaahh!!! Real Monsters." But the jokes are actually pretty spot-on.  It's just one giant laugh fest.  So many laughs.  One of the best laughs I've ever had in a movie.    The gore scenes are absolutely horrible.  And this is after watching the first ten minutes.      Now we get into the plot.  Well, first we're told that there's a cult of sorts.  They worship The Thing, a monster from the deepest parts of Canada.  He's the last known survivor of a race of people who were murdered by a monster.  A race that lived in a sort of cave, and had no idea what the outside was.  All of the men were killed by the monster, and all of his women, except for a special girl named "Lady," were raped. But the monster also managed to take all of their children and he had all of them taken away with him to the Canadian jungle.  His plans for these kids are unknown, but it seems he's going to use them to breed the perfect little human soldiers for his army.  We get to see a little bit of this, but the monster starts to show up.  There's a bunch of shots of the monster and his army, and I think they've made him look quite monstrous to me (no offense to his fans).  He does his thing, and a lot more.  At the end of the movie the leader of the cult makes an "official" statement that they've "moved into a new headquarters."  They have been relocated!  There's also a scene of a girl who's "disappeared," and we learn that she and her sister are both in the cave
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie, a bad film, a very bad film.   This film is the worst and I mean really really horrible in the worst way.  They have a really good actress in the lead. It was actually a good start as they start to work on her character. We meet her as a baby and I really liked her but then it was really bad all the way through.  This movie has lots of great special effects but they seem a little outdated.  There were things going on and all you would say would be "Oh my god, oh my god!". This is a classic and I can't wait to see it in another edition. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Halloween is a horror-action flick that has no business being in a horror genre because it is a cheap knock-off, and as a result of it being such a cheap copy you can't help but hate it, but, even more than that, it is just boring and you can only stand there and watch it. The gore effects are pretty laughable in some cases. And that's about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a movie that had everything to do with the war on drugs, I didn't particularly care for it, for a number of reasons, as I'll discuss. A story like this could easily be turned into a horror movie, and you could even make it into a straight-out bad movie, like so many others are attempting to do lately. The story starts off with the protagonist of the piece, a drug addict, meeting a prostitute at a strip club. The prostitute takes her into her house to do some heavy petting and oral sex. However, a car driven by a cop pulls up, the cop starts talking to the prostitute, she tries to escape him and runs out of the house. The cop sees the prostitute running and then, without saying a word, shoots her dead! There is a cut to a hospital bed in a morgue, a doctor is putting up a cadaver and asks the corpse where the prostitute was. The corpse claims that she didn't die from drug use, she was murdered by the cop! How can an actual police officer kill a prostitute? A good cop will show the prostitute where she lives, but that doesn't stop the cop from killing the prostitute! When the policeman is brought to trial, a jury says "There's a cop involved! So what?", so he's acquitted, but a special prosecutor brings a murder charge against him and he is convicted. There's no reason why the prostitute didn't see him before the murder?  The movie opens with a young white man in jail. He is awaiting the verdict of a murder that supposedly took place at a local house, and he's been there for two years. He has no defense attorney, and as he is facing the death penalty, it's apparent that he will be executed. There is also a big black dude in prison named Willie Mays (played by Steve McQueen), who gets in over his head and starts to get himself into trouble, though the jury thinks he's innocent.  After a very brief montage of other people (mostly blacks) in prison, the movie finally cuts to the real "story" (there's so much more to this story than that), and the cops are again back with their story.  The police are out in full force to look for the prostitute's killer, but they can't find the prostitute anymore. They call in a private investigator (played, as it turns out, by Mel Gibson), who doesn't seem to know

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________ I watched it on an airplane the other day in Denver, Colorado, about an hour before it opened. I have not seen a bad film since the mid-1970s when a couple of filmmakers, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, did a movie based on the popular book of the same name. That made it look good, but this movie is so bad. The movie is a re-telling of the adventures of Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, but the story is told in the third person. There is nothing exciting about the movie at all. It is more of a comedy and action adventure film about Jack Kirby's adventures with Steve Dittker. This leads to the following movie. In it, Kirby is a con-artist on the run who gets caught by the police. He is sentenced to twenty years in prison. He gets his wish, but a couple other con- Artists, Landon Fairey, a man who's real name is Joe Stalcup, and Jack's friend, Joe Pecoraro, are there to get him. They are the real villains in this movie. They get Jack back to prison and then use him to steal the "Cadillac of Comics". This time around, Steve Dutcher, a comic artist who has been Jack Kirby for years, decides to help Kirby out with his scheme. This movie is only in two parts, so it only takes a half an hour to watch. It's a funny movie with some great characters. I did enjoy some of them, such as Kirby's lawyer (William Devane) who is a great character. It doesn't matter how much fun the movie is; I never would have thought that it was bad. I've been told by a few people that it is an old movie but that does not mean that it's bad. It was made during a boom in comic books in the 70's. In my opinion, this is not a good movie for kids. It looks like the producers were having a laugh and thought it was funny to show off how many times Kirby's drawings are cut up and made to look like other people. It would be much better in black and white and it would have been great for a movie theatre. It only needs to be rated PG-13.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********************** The original "Dr. Who" aired on BBC in 1963, and became a cultural sensation. Now, "Dr Who" has a new life on television. It's back at the BBC, with new episodes, including "Colditz". ********* "Cold Blitz" is not a very good movie. This time we're in the present day and a "revenge" mission against a group of criminals is taken out by a young detective (Peter Finch) against the wishes of the old and tired head of MI6, played by Billie Whitelaw. It may appear that this is just another TV movie, and it may be, but in the world of "Doctor Who" movies, movies that don't have all the bells and whistles are always better. The whole thing is made with no real action (except maybe in the beginning), it's just a TV movie with some nice special effects. ******** I'm not sure if it's because of that fact that they were only playing on the radio or because there's only one good actor in the cast (Peter) but this movie can't be considered a Doctor Who movie! It's kind of a boring little movie that's all about the good old "Doctor who" as portrayed by Peter Finch and Billie (Whitelaw) trying to get rid of some criminal who's going to blow up the planet and kill all life on Earth. And then there's a few "special" effects and an odd bit of music that isn't very memorable. ************** You can watch the whole movie at http://www.movies.pbs.org/ftf/coldberg/
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After a decent start, the movie really unravels into a nightmare by the end. Not only is the film dull, with the occasional moments of levity, but it never really builds up any characters. The whole premise behind a group of aliens who need a human to be part of their life form is a bit of a gimmick for a silly story. As a result the movie becomes mired in a series of plot holes, including the whole "who wants to be a space monkey?" issue and why don't they just get their asses to Mars? If a group like this needs a bad guy to fight, then they better find a guy who can get the job done. And they don't do a good job of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an epic film with a lot of potential. There are a lot potential points, the most obvious of which is that it is based on a comic series. So it should be an easy jump. Unfortunately the plot has a few issues, first is that the title says it all and there is nothing more to add to that statement. We are just sent to another city to have a little adventure. It is not a "wacky" adventure, we have a lot more to go on and I am not sure how I will feel about the rest of the film. I am still interested in seeing more from this film, even though it could be a fun ride.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is quite good. I like the plot and the fact it has a female lead. But I think it was just a little too long.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this because it was one of those movies that people think is crap when they're young. It was only about 5 years ago that I had a chance to see this terrible movie. I must admit to being quite disappointed, but also a bit amused. I have always been a sucker for horror movies and have never seen anything that really scared me. The story is about a couple who go to the cabin to watch a horror movie. The couple gets trapped in the cabin. They can hear the sounds of people fighting outside the walls. The wife is having an affair with the "house" keeper. When the couple finds the keeper, they have to save him from the evil, evil, and evil wife. They then make a run for it. I didn't find it a scary movie, just very stupid. This is not a good film in any aspect. I am going to give it one more chance to be a bad film. I'm not gonna go into it anymore. I thought I was going to like it, but it's not. It's a terrible movie and should be avoided by anyone who would enjoy watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My wife was very excited when we decided to give this film a go. We had never really been interested in the paranormal before. We didn't like the idea of it being supernatural but thought it would be great if we watched a movie where a demon appeared! What we got wasn't that bad. I think the only thing that bothered me about this movie was the fact that they never told us the name of the guy that was a serial killer but that doesn't affect my opinion of the movie. The only negative thing I can say about the movie is that it is a little dull. There is just not anything to say about it. There aren't any good scenes to me. The ending is also not a nice little ending. There isn't much more I can tell about this. It isn't that good. It is just good but I guess it can never be good enough for me. Maybe I'll come back to it when it's on DVD. If you're up for some fun then check this out! It is definitely something a little unusual.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It's the ultimate bad movie...The characters are all annoying as shit. There is a lot of yelling, and even more swearing." The movie has this weird mixture of a bunch of people that are not in character. In other words, they are in character on every other episode, but they are not. And the actors (the only non-fictional characters), don't even make sense... The character I found most irritating, is John F. Daley (Kurtwood Smith) who is the main protagonist. He is always playing the 'little-man' of the town and in other words he behaves in a way he would if the villagers hated him. He never reacts in an unexpected way and the only thing he does is to react with what his character says, not with what he believes. He doesn't seem to think anything, when the situation seems dangerous. But the most annoying thing is his character seems to make no difference for the story. The only character that comes close to the plot is Kurt Woodham (Peter Sellers) the main antagonist and also the 'father' of Kurt Woodman (George Macready) which is another character that seems to have no meaning. The best part of the movie is the ending... It is the end of the story! Kurt and Woodman have finally been saved... There is one small problem... When Kurt is standing in his backyard, he suddenly becomes a kid again! When I saw that I immediately thought "oh no!" I was expecting something really great from this movie and I was totally wrong! If you don't like kids then I can say, this is not for you! In the end I was surprised about the ending. I guess it was a good ending and I am sure it will become a cult classic... But that's all I can add to it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have a couple of issues with this movie.  First and foremost is the poor acting at times.  I like the direction and the art direction (it's not bad) but the acting is all over the place (the bad guy was also pretty stupid so I can forgive it).  I also feel that the whole thing was kind of cheap.   One of the scenes I was laughing hysterically at was where all the people in the movie try to find the cat but the cat is just hiding in some bushes.  The cat had a little tail and everything and the people are all like   "WTF is going on?! We can't find it so we'll just go to the hospital!"   Oh, they found it so they went into the hospital and when they open the door the cat had vanished but it's just a little bit of CGI.  Oh well.  Second issue is that the story was pretty crappy.  All of the kids (the ones that aren't kids are teenagers) are running around a house making a mess and trying to be funny while trying to stay cool.  It's not that I don't want to see kids in a bad thing but I just think that this was a poor way to do it.  Third issue is how lame it is.  There are no bad guys so everything is good and the movie ends pretty fast.  Overall I just have a really hard time giving this movie a bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The biggest problem I have with the movie is the constant whining and whining that's coming from it. The acting was pretty bad for the most part, and the plot had no substance at all. The main character was a very annoying one that kept being annoying throughout the movie, and there were a lot of characters that were either weak, stupid, or simply stupid. There was a lot to dislike about the movie. And, while I was watching it I actually thought to myself, why are you even wasting your time with this crap? It's a waste of everyone else's time that went to see it that did.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film, in a bad way, is supposed to be the story of how a group of kids were chosen by a special force to serve as warriors in a war against an evil army. The story of a bad girl, a dead cat, and the rest of the misfit kids is rather unbelievable. The characters that appear in the movie and they are more than capable, and they're able to do a lot of violence, but it's the overuse of violence that seems to be a problem. There is also a bit of nudity, but that is to be expected with a comedy of this type.   Overall, it is a bad comedy and I don't think that it is worth seeing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We have seen this story before, so what will be so special about this film is its original script and its director, Yorgos Lanthimos. The script is actually pretty nice. It focuses on the main character a man called Isobel who is struggling to cope with a failed marriage. His only friend is a friend who has a lot of problems with her marriage. They go to a dance at the castle of Lanthimbard which seems to be an old family mansion. But then it turns out to be a ghost castle that contains a variety of strange and dangerous creatures. When Isober comes to the castle after having gone crazy, we see that it is actually a ghost house. We find myself wondering what happens in there? Lanthimsos is very good at creating scenes that have a great sense of horror, creepy atmosphere and a great soundtrack. The music really gets the point across when it should. This is a wonderful film that is perfect for Halloween night, when the mood becomes more eerie. I hope the director can find a director to follow him up, I don't know who the next Lanthomasos will be.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are shallow and unappealing. The dialogue is stilted and the plot is predictable. The movie's story is lame. The only way you can keep your interest is if you like cheesy B movie comedies and are bored out of your mind.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad this movie is done. I think the director has a very good eye. It's a movie about a very sad, very broken marriage. It doesn't feel forced. The film tells a great story and I loved it. I would only see it again. This movie is really good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think that when it comes to a great horror movie the only thing that should really worry any viewer is that they probably will end up having fun.   The film starts with a shot of the main character in the woods, he is looking for something, he comes to the door, he answers the door.  They let him in, the other people he has come into contact with are a woman and two kids.  While they are in the house they hear some strange things, a dog growling, they look and there is a face on the wall.  Then they hear scratching, but then the dog barks and the kids run from it, the dogs growl again.  After all the scratching and scratching and growling they run out and the next thing the wife comes down the steps screaming for her husband. The other people in the room are now screaming and the husband is dead, the wife and kids run out the door and back to the woods.  I was so confused. I did not understand at all what I was seeing.  The wife runs over to her husband and then goes back into the house.  But then the wife goes back to her room and opens the wardrobe.  It is so much like a dream, the clothes she is wearing when she is dead are in her room with the man on the bed.  That is not a real room and there are no windows.  She is wearing the same clothes that she was wearing when dead in the dream, that makes no sense, she is a dead woman and yet she is still wearing clothes!   I was very interested by this because there is no way the dead woman could have been alive.     A little later, when the wife is washing dishes she notices that some things have changed.  One of the dishes has been replaced.  As soon as she realizes what she is doing she tells the husband and the rest of the group that there is something different about the house, there are two beds upstairs and they all sit in the living room and watch a movie while the wife cleans her plates.    The next thing is that the two kids who were watching the movie in the other room go to the dining room where they sit down.  This should seem simple, but as it turns out the two children have an imaginary friend named Mr. Chappy who they keep saying that they have a lot of fun with him.  He is actually the dog that the kids chase
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What could have happened to this movie that it is just...  Well, you get the idea.  A young man who has been kicked out of his own home by his mother leaves his room when he finds a box of old VHS tapes.    He goes to watch the tapes and when he gets there he sees his mother.  He is still a little kid in that he has not even grown yet and his mom is his "mother".   The two start talking to each other and they start to build a relationship of love and caring.  When they leave the house to go back to their home, they run into a family that looks very like them...   Their house is a large wooden home.  The house is very cozy and looks like it has been lived in for a long time.  There are many rooms and there is a big fireplace in the front of the house.  In the middle of the living room is a television.  This is a huge, two person TV.  As they watch TV the man's mother says: "We are only watching TV for you.  We are going to be out of the country soon...  It was then when she left them she said "Come back and stay with me" and never came back.  It is then that she decides to give the man a name.  To him it is "Mister" He is very confused and wants to know how he got there.  They have to tell him the story of a man who once had to get a big box of tapes. But instead of getting them he found out they were a magical box that would tell him everything he had to learn about life.  What's his name, he thought....and how did he get to this country he thinks.  Well we get to the point of the film when the man has found the magical box of the tapes.  What did the woman do to get them back?  She stole them and used them to open a portal to some place that looks like some sort of hell hole and it is then we see the magic and the woman is there. She has all sorts of spells and magic and things that she uses to get the man to do what she wants.  I could go on about this movie if I was going to.  But it would take far too long.  However, the only reason I am leaving the review is so you can know how much I

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a comedy and has a few gags. The director and writer put a lot of heart into this movie and it is a funny movie. It may not be a great movie but it is not bad either. It has some laughs at the beginning and end. The girl and her boyfriend are a couple who are both on the down-slope and have had a bad breakup. The character is nice and good-humored and a couple of the gags are great. The ending is a little weak and doesn't go much where it wants. I'm really not sure how to rate it. It is a good-sized movie that is well-made and funny. There is nothing great about it but it has some good parts.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part about this movie is that it feels like a great old-fashioned western.  I'm looking forward to a new film of this kind, one that tries to find a balance between realism and fantasy, and I'm really looking forward too to see what they do with the characters. Â I'm going to take a moment and talk about the music. ÃƒÆ'Ã†'Â Â  My favorite song in this movie, which is the first song they play at the beginning of the movie. ���I'd rather be a bad guy in a movie than a bad song. �� ��
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe this movie has had so many re-makes.    The most recent I saw was from 1979, which featured a younger Elizabeth Taylor (as the voice of Mrs. Pangborn) and a whole cast of younger actors.  This one is dated, even by Hollywood's standards (and I've heard worse), and is filled with many of the same cliches from the 1950's as well as a lot of unnecessary and poorly-done special effects.  In the course of the movie, there are several different versions of the story, some made of actual photos and newspaper clippings, a film made by the Pangburn's of the 1950s and an actual historical film made in 1957 (by a man named Henry J. Parson).   One interesting and rather amusing character is a middle-aged female who is on the hunt for the Pangegrays who were the subject of the film The Day the Earth Stood Still in the early 1950's (see my first post about that movie).   But despite its problems, this is a well-acted film with a very good screenplay by Joe Spinell and a very talented director in Bob Rafelson. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A few weeks ago I saw a short film called The Dreamers which was a movie I'd heard about years ago. It was shot in the early 1960s and directed by John Carpenter (whose other directorial works include Halloween and The Fog ) and starring Heather Langenkamp who played a little girl who finds a box in a ditch and opens it revealing the contents. She sees a little monster staring at her and a little face from which emerge evil looking eyes and claws. That's where it ends.   In the film the monster, the Wendigo, is a monster that only manifests itself in the wintertime. This is the one and only time the Wendigos is seen. The film was shot on location in Canada in the late 1950s and was written by David A. Smith and Peter Blum. David A Smith has been making movies for more than half of his life and has appeared in such movies as The Thing in the Fog, The Green Mile, and the remake of Halloween in which Heather Langenskamp plays a little child trying to get back to her parents. I thought the story was great, but it had so little substance. I don't see how it is any different than a lot of other films made in that decade that were not successful, such as The Fog, and The Creature from the Black Lagoon, among others. I guess I'm a horror-fan and this movie wasn't for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good story, very good acting and good special effects. I don't like the way the two main characters look. I think they could have gone a bit darker, and this could have been a much better movie. It's got some great scenes of action, and has some great sound effects, but I think the characters look a bit out of place, and could use a bit more to make them distinct.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a short yet very entertaining and good movie about three friends, who are not exactly in love but are all the same in that they never go beyond the boundaries to which they are accustomed. The film starts out with two young people from different countries in the same small town. They are each very different from one another and very different, in fact, from everyone else. I found this to be a good film that was really refreshing. The scenes are well shot and I felt that I could relate to some of the characters more than I thought I was. I did enjoy it and will probably watch it again and again.  Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't see this at my local theater, but it seems to be a lot of fun. As it says on the tin, the film is about the two "Ducklings", named "Teddy" and "Brick", who are trying to help their little sister "Bonnie", the only one of the three who can fly, in her bid to become a famous actor. It seems this is an adaptation of the children's book, The Duckling Adventures, first published in 1930. I'm not sure that this film really does much to advance the story, though. There aren't a lot going on in it. I can see why this film was made as a kid's movie, because there are many scenes of the young heros singing, singing, and singing. They get into a great song and dance number, I guess, and I'm sure the film crew did their best to capture those classic 1930's dances. But it's too bad, because it's really not a very good film. There's a lot more dancing than there are scenes, and most of it is quite tame. There are also many moments of singing which don't do much for the movie's story. I guess the film was supposed to be more about the "dignity" and the "sacrifice" of the heroes. But I guess in a way they had succeeded, and the film becomes a rather forgettable kids' film which is really out of place for the summer of 1932. Rating: 1 out of 5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first went into the movie, I honestly thought they were going to give us a very good, low-budget action film that was a great excuse for Peter Cushing to star in. I mean, he was never a bad actor, right?  Wrong!  Cushing played the baddie, the bad guy, the guy who wants to be bad.  We've seen bad guys like this before ( The Big Bad Wolf ), but this guy isn't really bad.   If you want to see a movie about bad guys and their good side, then you need to go see this movie.    So we're getting into a bad-guy bad movie here, and I was pretty excited about it, as long as they didn't try to give this guy a heart.   Well, that didn't happen.  But the bad guys did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What an epic, beautiful story! It will stick in the head for days on end! This movie is so intense. You need to see this. It is so beautiful. It will bring you to tears, maybe. I was a little disappointed that the only way to see a great film in a very small theater was to go to a huge one.  The only downside was that the film was short. I mean really short.   I have a feeling that with a bit more money the film could have been much more.  What a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The title might be taken as a misdirection.  It starts with a couple of kids, in this case one is a girl, and the other a boy.  They are playing a card game and the game is boring for both of them.  The boy wins the first round and the girl loses the second.  However they keep trying and the boys do a better job than the girl.  This is about the second to last film I saw from the director of " The Great Mouse Detective "   As I said there isn't much to the film and this is a great start for the director, it's a little weak in places but it doesn't really matter.  There are some good bits here and there, and I think there might be another one where the girls go off to school.   Grade: C
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My expectations were very low going in. I was told that it's going to be a horror flick about a boy who is kidnapped and forced to play an important role by the devil.  I didn't have much of an interest in this film and was only able to watch it because I was curious to see how the trailer was going to play out.  The opening credits have a creepy voice-over by the main character "Billy" telling of how he has become possessed by Satan and that a "special child" will be coming to take him away.  This is about as far into the trailer I could get and it seemed like a very simple horror flick.  The opening shots are just like a horror movie from the late 90's. I guess the reason for this film being on TV is that it doesn't give the horror of it all up to begin with.  I was hoping for something a bit more ambitious than that and was really disappointed.   In this film we follow Billy as he is driven to a church and then the Devil comes in and forces him to play a role, which involves being the servant of Satan and telling Satan lies about how he is responsible for all the evil in the world.  It seemed silly at first.  But after a while I started to see that this child had some kind of power which she uses to influence others around her, and it wasn't long before I realised that there was something sinister at work here.  For me the most disturbing part of this movie is the fact that the whole thing was shot with a hidden camera.  If there was an actual camera then you would have got a much clearer view of what was going on, and I'm surprised there wasn't one used.  My parents found the trailer to be quite amusing.  In the background of the movie is a little girl who plays a role.  She isn't bad, but it is difficult to get a good look at her and I didn't like how many times the Devil uses her.  And there is also a man at the end, whom I found a bit creepy as well.  All of the characters in the movie were really annoying, and after a couple of minutes I started wishing they'd all just get the hell out of there.  Unfortunately this didn't happen and they were just given the role that they had to play.  So, I don't really get much of a "feel" for this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- A really long and stupid looking film. The entire movie is about a child from the Middle East who is taken in by a German family with a young child in tow. He is put to work in the home by his parents while his real parents try to send him to England and get him away from the oppression of the Arab countries in which he is growing up. The family has a large apartment in which is their living room/kitchen. There is a room for the child to play and a bedroom for the mother to sleep in. The real families daughter is a bit more rebellious than the German children who are raised to be obedient and well behaved. The Arab children are also taken to England to be educated by Christian families and as far as I can tell they have the same upbringing but are a bit less disciplined than the Germans. I do not know if the author meant to say that the real families were so hard working with the money that they could afford to educate the Arab children and not work them so hard but if you go to the real homes it is clear that the parents are not allowed to have any luxuries to buy for their children. The children are very ignorant, most of them speak perfect English and are not much less retarded than their real mother. I don't think the writer would have made a better movie with the children or the mother, I have seen better movies and have not been so happy with what I have been shown. --------------- Show more reviews...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! It took me a couple of hours to get into this movie. I liked the story a lot but I am just not in love with the characters, at all. I think that when I saw the movie the producers, the director and the writers and the actors had a lot of ideas but they just didn't fit together into a nice movie. My suggestion to everyone would be to see this movie twice in a row. I would also advise people to get the DVD instead of buying the movie on DVD from the stores. I hope that the next version of this movie is better because I really like the story but this first one is just horrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has the worst acting from the entire cast, with poor Michael Ironside (John Saxon from "The Office") showing his lack of talent. The plot involves a man (John Cleese) who has just turned to alcohol because his wife (Michele Ament) was murdered.   When he is at a party, a waitress (Janice Haney) recognizes him as the murderer (John Ritter), but refuses to believe it. He then finds a secret room in the house and a videotape that proves he is the killer.  It's not bad but it has nothing going for it in either the acting or the storyline.  John Cleese is a very talented actor but John Ritter is a poor actor. Ament is very good at what she is doing but not bad at what he is doing. This movie would be better if it was shot in a real estate office because it would look much better than the video tape and the rest of the film.    It doesn't help that this is a bad idea from the get go and it's very disappointing that this idea was not explored further. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is with everyone getting so caught up in the show that they're losing their grasp on reality? I love the plot and the way the character interactions are constructed and how the story progresses but the ending is a complete mess. I would not recommend this film to a first time viewer. There are some very nice effects in the film but the special effects are not what make this movie.  The acting is decent at best and some of the dialogue is funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of the worst movies I have seen so far this year. This movie is just silly and bad. It was poorly made and the only reason it got a PG rating is because it is a little silly. I would not recommend watching this movie at all. The movie would have been much better with a lower rating because it did not make you laugh at all, but more in a bad way. I wish they had not made the bad, silly joke "The world famous" and used a famous people instead.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing this movie did right was it gave a few moments in the middle that showed the future: The little town where everyone is fat and poor and it's all the girls' fault that they can't get a date. They are all fat and stupid and no one has the wherewithal to get a good job. They all eat junk food and don't even know how to drive and all the kids are always doing drugs and they can only say "Ooh, let's go do drugs" to each other. And if you've ever watched a bunch of teen comedies then that's a pretty similar thing to it, except the girl in the teen sitcom is a total bitch that you hate and the kids that watch it are even worse than the ones in the sitcom.  So there's the future, they're fat and dumb and no men like them so they all go to college in the big city and then have to go back to where they came from to find a man to take care of them. Â Â I didn't think I was going to like this movie but I loved it. It was funny, heartwarming, funny all over it and the end was pretty cool as well.    What I did dislike was the fact that the kids did all the drugs and were even smoking weed!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one movie that has no redeeming qualities and would be better off in the trash bin than on your shelf.  It would be an even bigger pile of crap in a new version or a new 3D version, but I would never go out of my way to watch this garbage again.    So... I was on the set of a "horrible" movie today, and the director of the film, Mr. David J. Smith, was very kind and funny with us.  The movie was called "The Nightmare".   I wasn't interested in it, but Mr. Smith is a very nice director, and that's why I was kind of hoping the movie would be good.  He told us the story in a very matter-of-fact way, and I remember thinking the actors were OK.  But then it started.  It's a "nightmare".  It took place in a small apartment on an old college campus, and was supposed to be filmed in front of a blackboard.  In a small bedroom in this apartment is a guy named "Joe".  Joe likes to dream, like the whole movie is about his dream-like life.  When it's finally over, Joe is dead.  So now, his dead friends go out looking for a new house for themselves.  They find a mansion called "Sleepy Hollow" that has lots of dreams to go with the mansion.  There is even a dream housekeeper that's an old lady who goes by the name "Miss Hollow".  She has an interesting way of explaining a dream.  Miss Hollow is from a dream in the past.  She thinks that Joe is living in a dream and that he's dying to get out.  Joe is a great dreamer and a great friend to Miss Hollow.  Well, I'm back.  I thought Joe's dream was over.  We'd been filming a scene, and then he just sort of passed out. And that's about all I could remember until one of the other actors suggested that he might have a brain tumor and we need to find out what's wrong with him.  What was up with this film anyway?  I remember reading some of the reviews.  One guy described this as "A "Dreamers' Story", but one for the younger audience.  This is the exact opposite of what a good dream story should be.  Some of the scenes were
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I have not seen a bad film since the 70's, and this one is no exception. It had me hooked right from the first look! The story itself is about a man who is in trouble with the law for stealing a diamond. He steals the diamond from a museum and is arrested. Then a local woman saves him and tells him that he should go to a beautiful, peaceful place that was visited by the ancient Greeks, but in ancient times, people would leave things behind for good luck. He wants to go to the place. He also is told that the only way to get there is in a small boat and that the boat was abandoned centuries ago. The film was well acted, I have seen all types of films and most of them are badly acted. That is one thing that makes me hate films like this, they are so obvious. I really didn't care much for the film at all. What an embarrassing film! The plot didn't get much better!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie is a bad choice of a genre. That's all there is to it.  This is a low-budget movie with a lot of holes in its story, and it's a pretty bad movie that I couldn't enjoy.   There is a really good story in this movie about a man named Johnny who travels across the country with his son. He tries to teach his son about life and all of the things he is trying to deal with, but Johnny gets a bad start to his road trip and his life takes a turn for the worse when he runs over a woman with his truck.  The problem is, this movie is almost completely devoid of dialogue. No, there are plenty of characters here, but they don't talk about anything except themselves and the things they are going to do.  I think this movie was directed in the early 80s.  When I was a little kid, I watched these kind of movies a lot. I remember the one movie, The Road Warrior (1980), where a bad guy tries to kill a bunch of people by crashing his truck into a hill.  A truck driver named Bill comes along with a gun and starts shooting all the bad guys.  Bill and Johnny (who has gotten a new truck) get out of their truck and go to the hill. It's on the hill and the bad guy goes to get another truck and hits Bill with it. This causes Bill to try to get himself on the truck to try and help Johnny, but Bill isn't fast enough. So, he goes into the other truck with Johnny and tries to help Johnny.  There are a lot more details about this movie, but I don't want to bore you with them.  So, when Bill is trying not to be killed with a car and falls off the hill, his son yells for him to get up. When Bill gets up, he's holding a gun. Johnny is going to get a knife, but then he hears Bill screaming for him and Johnny starts to run. Johnny runs up a hill and stops right in front of the guy who hit Bill. They are both looking at each other and they realize they are about to die.  They stop dead in their tracks.  Johnny stands up and sees Bill's gun and says, "Oh no, he hit me." Then Bill takes his gun and shoots Johnny, killing him.  He keeps his mouth shut and lets Bill kill him. But then, he
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Halloween is not a good horror film.  It is, I think, one of those films that makes no attempt to make sense of itself.    It's full of clichés.  It has the obligatory monster on the loose, but nothing to tie the monster to a central concept.  I am also not a fan of the costumes that the movie presents to us.    The costumes are tacky.  The music is obnoxious.  They seem to be trying to emulate the classic horror films of the 50's and 60's but it falls flat with both acting and the acting is pretty poor in the second half.  That is the worst aspect of this film.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie. I feel like I'm watching a very silly movie. Like a really stupid, dumbed down version of a stupid classic. The whole film has an old lady in it who knows all about how to cook and make nice food and her granddaughter who is obsessed with her. But like all of the kids in every little school and on all different kinds of TV shows, they all have the same thing that I just happen to be obsessed with: the "sneak attack". It's a super quick move and a super cute move that is played by all sorts of other different people. The little boy who has the most bad words ever is played, well, by a baby. And so on. It's kind of hilarious! I like this movie!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very bad movie. There are scenes where the camera is moving, there are scenes with some weird noises and then the movie goes to a horrible place and then to a terrible ending.  The most horrible scene is when the old man is killed by the zombie and we can see him in the end of the movie with his hands still tied to the head, which can be used as a sign to not to go to the end and to not have fun, but he will never do that because it's not funny.  One of the most annoying things about zombies is their inability to hear or see, so a zombie is a walking sound.   It is not all bad, when a zombie finally kills the old woman he just stands there like a statue. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a very good movie that was pretty boring from beginning to end. I mean, I thought it had a funny storyline with the guy who was born to a prostitute and then he turned himself into a real "superhero" and saved the world! It was pretty funny to watch a guy like him fight with the guys who he was fighting against! Then, when the film ended, we were all left confused because he had to turn back into the prostitute and we were left wondering if he was even good with women anymore! I guess that's why he went down the path of being a sex toy! But, like I said, I really liked the storyline!   I didn't see any special effects that would really blow me away. The fight scenes looked nice as they were well choreographed, but they weren't anything to write home about. You would think that when you're fighting with a robot in the streets that something would happen or something amazing would happen! But it didn't. They had a great amount of money, but it was mostly used on the costumes and special effects! I thought they could have used that money to make a lot more impressive special effects. It's a shame, too, because the film had a lot of potential!   in a nutshell: Very entertaining but not something to write a review about.  1 of 1 people found the following review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a well-made movie, very funny, but it is the beginning of a very poor movie. The film ends in a great way, and the movie starts very badly. I give it a 3.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In a world where the only good person is a dead guy with a cross, an old lady tries to keep herself busy by teaching her kids to write a book. She tries to teach a lesson to the kids on the importance of honesty and integrity, that all of the actions we take will make people think we are good people, because of the way we act. She seems like a decent sort, and the kids are pretty naive. But I do wonder if they would have ever made it as writers had they had not had the mother to encourage them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't recommend this movie to people who haven't seen it.   This movie is just the most lame way to waste a good idea.  There is a guy called Rufus who has a magical hammer in his backyard.  With the hammer he can make things go boom.  Ruf's best friend is a girl named Tina.  Tina's sister is named Lisa.  Every night Ruf has to take the hammer to the woods to find a girl who will be there.  The girl is called Patty.  At the beginning of the movie Ruf is scared of Patty. She has a bad attitude and she's mean to Ruf. Ruf tries to get her to behave.  But Patty is evil and Ruf hates her. She tries to steal the hammer.  She puts Ruf in a cage in her attic then they go on an adventure.  Patty has a magic spell in her room. She can make anyone she touches to do what she wants them to do.  When she touches Ruf the hammer flies into the air. Rolfs is forced to use the hammer in order to get out.  I really felt sorry for him the whole way through this movie. I just didn't see the humour in his situation at all.  They don't show it coming and Patty does a lot of damage while they are trying to find her.  This is so bad.  It's just so bad there was nothing good about it. All of it is just like it's on a Saturday morning.  In the end Patty says that if Ruf doesn't give the hammer back she will get a boyfriend and they all go home.  That was the only good thing about it all. - February 21, 2006Just a bad idea
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is the sequel to the excellent "Hitch". This time we have an older version of the character "Hip", whose role is to run a "hobo-like" school for boys. Hip is portrayed as a pathetic, pathetic, stupid looking old man who will stop at nothing to "get" something he believes he deserves. But the one thing he wants most is to beat up the girls that keep showing up on his doorstep. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," he mutters to himself, as he gets ready to go in and attack a female student at the "dormitory" that he and the other boys run. The girl, a beautiful blonde named "Ginger", walks in while the boys are all busy fighting to be the first to "grab" her (haha).  The girls at the dormitory are all pretty good-looking.  Their outfits are simple and classy, but not overly so.  Ginger looks like a modern school girl, but she's not too bad.  "She's such a tease!" one of the boys says while he's sitting in the middle of the room, watching his little attack.  After he kills the first girl, he finds out that Ginger is not alone!  The other boys have arrived to do the same thing that he just did!  Now the only thing Hip will fight for is his honor and the respect of the other students and teachers!  One day while he is sitting around and watching TV, we get a flash forward.  We hear about the death of Hip's father.  It's hard not to feel for the poor guy because he had such a good life.  But you have to understand, he wasn't the smartest of kids.  I remember him telling me once that he only knew how to make soup and he never went to college. He was just a "good boy."  He never did drugs, never even got kicked out of the house.  His dad was a kind of "father figure" for him.  So we are all thinking that this poor guy was doing fine until one day he's in a fight with another boy for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  This time Hip ends up being the one that dies because he was already in deep trouble in the previous fight, but now he's "sick" and the fight must be taken out before "his" self.  Hip comes to school the next
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is based on the true story of a group of men who were thrown out of a train in the middle of nowhere in America. It is said that they had been drinking and smoking on a train for 3 days. After 3 days, they found themselves locked in a small cabin with just a few other travelers. What they don't know is that there is a witch out there to get them, and is only waiting for the perfect time. After 2 days they finally escape from the cabin, and the group sets off to try to find a way out. This movie has one of the most unbelievable story lines ever written. This is just one of those movies where you won't be able to put it down. I found it to be entertaining enough to watch for the whole night, and if you are a horror fan like myself this will be very interesting to watch. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes horror, action, and a good mystery. 9 out of 10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very bad movie. It takes place in a house on the outskirts of a small American town, where people are dying. The movie starts with a dead guy that is in a coffin that is lying on a table. It turns out it isn't a real dead guy but a hallucination brought on by drugs. The story progresses as the real world is revealed, where the living have to learn to deal with the things that go bump in the night. I think this film could be a lot of fun, if only it wasn't so awful. It makes very little sense, and does very little. I can't explain why, but it just doesn't work. The actors are too good not to be fun, but they aren't funny. I don't think it's a very good movie, but that's just my opinion. It is really bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A little bit disappointing. The plot is nice and the action is decent. It seems as if there was a lot of effort and time put into this movie, but the result is nothing worth mentioning. If you're a fan of horror then don't waste your time with this one. Just go watch the movie I made before:  And the results were much better:
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! "The Devil and Daniel Johnston" does not deserve to be called "Bad Movie", it is just a bad film with awful acting from all the actors... The director, who is a talented actor, does not know what he is doing...he has a very bad voice for the role that he is supposed to be giving... The acting is not so bad, the acting is a bit better than I expected... If you liked "Eyes Wide Shut" then this is a good movie, no more. You should only watch this movie if you like porn with a bad story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad it is impossible to watch. One second a girl is looking for her brother who has gone missing. The next second her friend is in a car wreck. The car in fact has just been crashed and is in the middle of the road, with an elderly man with a cane (I do not think that he is a character) and a little girl. What is worse is that the old man, who seems to be a character, starts walking toward the car and walks straight towards it. The only way I can describe the acting in this movie is to describe it as poor. The young girl has no lines and her acting is almost as if she is a mute who had just woken up from a long coma (and still looks like she was hit by a car). The elderly man does his thing and the only other acting I can put it on is a deaf and dumb man who has a very annoying manner. I don't know why it took a decade, or more, for people to realize that this film is terrible. It is so horrible and lame in the way that it is written and acted that it makes me feel as if I have just watched the worst film ever made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You may or may not be aware that a remake of a terrible film entitled "The Little Mermaid" has been recently released in theaters. The remake was well received and the film was remade from the same animatronic (animated human model) which is still being used in this day and age. This character is voiced by Susan Sarandon. The character is a total disappointment to anyone who has ever read the novel. There is not a single redeeming quality to her character except for the fact that she has been turned into a mermaid. If you are looking for a good story, a compelling plot, or good animation, then there is nothing in this film that will convince you otherwise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As a movie critic for a long time, I've seen quite a few films that have been a total waste of time. This is one of them. At first, I didn't know if I liked it, but once I began to think about it I started to admire the fact that it took a long period to make a film like this. But to be quite honest, when it came out I didn the opposite: I hated it. There's nothing good in it!  The plot is really terrible. The lead character, Tom, has this terrible disease that causes him to lose a lot of weight. He was a famous actor who didn't realize that his disease had made it harder for him to control his weight and it led to some serious health problems. The story is quite simplistic: Tom loses his wife, falls in love with a beautiful woman, moves to a small town in the country, and tries to get back to his old way of life. The only part that was interesting for me was the relationship between Tom and the actress who played his wife. It's a pity, because the relationship is not as good as it appears. The main character is not really well developed. He's an interesting, good-looking man, but he's not that good with women. I also couldn't believe the way he was played by the very bad, very unlikable Kevin Kline.  The writing was just awful; it's not even worth mentioning the actors. Kline can say just about anything: his characters are never defined and always seem to be in the wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would give this a zero. The only thing I liked about the movie was the ending.   It felt so out of place and so unnatural.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can't believe how much I went into this movie expecting a normal family comedy, and to what ends is what you get. The plot is predictable, and the ending is unsatisfying. The characters, while not bad, are very unmemorable. A mother who is overprotective about her three children who only ever listen to her when they are sick and die, and one who is a total jerk who is easily offended by a trivial reason like a child saying bad words to an adult. It's not much of a family comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! Why didn't the filmmakers include any more of the dead babies and their faces?!!!!!!!   The main character in this film is a white male who gets involved with a group of black criminals at a local brothel. He is taken on as a member of a group called "The Brotherhood", a gang of men who don't like blacks and are out to kill them. The main character tries to do something about the dead black babies and tries to talk to the other members, but they don't even notice him. When a baby is being murdered in a brothel, he goes into a fight and is beaten up until his face turns black. The dead baby is played by the most disgusting, ugly black person I've ever seen! The other members of the Brotherhood also have no qualms about getting their hands on dead babies. This is just the first half of the film. If you think this is the real "real" gangsters, well, I have a bridge to sell you.   I'd say this is a bad film. I can't recommend this film as a horror film. There are many different things about it which make it a "sick" movie and not a "good" movie. There's no reason it would've been made except the director's desire to be involved in an all black crime story. I'd say there were a lot of ways they could've avoided it. For example, there's only one place to put the body (a morgue), which would've taken the film away from being a bad crime film. Or how about making the mother a prostitute rather than a prostitute who wants to sell baby bodies (which is how she got into the crime in the first place). The whole film has the makings of a "bad" movie, but the director and writer decided to make it as bad as possible.   the best way I can describe it is "a movie about how black people are bad", which is a stupid concept to begin with, especially if black people don't do anything bad in the movie (and they don, even though they should, they really should). The rest of the characters were uninteresting, some are stupid, some just plain ugly. Also, the fact that this movie was made in 1983 makes the ending even more stupid. There was no way to "undo" the ending since the story didn't change. This movie is a "wasted" opportunity to have a black crime film
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked this movie and it was good for a half hour. It has that good bad-junk feeling and even worse for being so long. The bad-ness starts when we meet Mr. D. I thought Mr. Smith was a bit of a dumb one-dimensional character. That, combined with the way this character is written really gives the impression that this is a story about Mr. Dick and the people he's with. It's a good enough story. It was an amusing story about how a crazy ex-fiancee finds a dead body, then makes a deal with the local sheriff to turn the murder over to the local media, then goes to jail for a little while. We also get a few great "tease-drama" scenes. I was hoping that the "story" would be a little different as it continued, but it was not, it continued to be the same kind of "story". What a shame too.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  We were in the audience with my husband and son on this movie as a movie night for the three of us to get to know each other better. It was a good movie and had enough laughs and excitement for the children and a few laughs for the adults.  The acting was great and the humor was very funny but the characters didn't do very much.    I would say this movie is good for children and adults but it was not for me.  About the Writer:  It is important to remember that I do not own anything about this movie. It is just a tribute to my favorite movie Star Wars and a great memory for my childhood. I hope everyone enjoys it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie i've seen all year   It's a bunch of weird characters, it has no plot and is a total mess, a bunch the characters and the script are horrible and the acting is awful, the girls are all over the place and act like a bunch idiots...all this is bad i really did not expect to see a movie with as much character development as this, but that it had it sucked the fun out of everything i loved about this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a good time it can be the one with the worst story line.     There's a kid and his sister who are living in a cave and it's time for them to go into the outside world.  When they go out to the world they go into a big city and they find out that the city is like no other. It has no rules and the people are crazy and mean but at the same time you need to get out of there to save your family.  This movie is not a good one.  The film starts with a kid named John who lives in a hole in the ground.  It is a story about how the kid was saved from his own mother.  Then there's a guy in a suit who saves the kid from a mobster who had gotten ahold of his mother. After John saves the guy's life he realizes that he was a good man and that maybe he had not been the best but maybe he was the best.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Woozles, a movie from the mid-1970's.  A good movie if you like the movies from about 1970, it's not a very interesting film.   It had a good cast, but the script was just kind of horrible, as it's a script about an actor who steals a girl's underwear.  If you like good writing this is a great movie.  It has some great musical numbers and is worth a watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was totally underwhelmed with this movie, and even though I know that it is just a movie about a kid who dies, I'm still feeling disappointed because the story is completely irrelevant.  This movie, while I'm pretty sure it's a childrens film, is about the two most popular and best fighters in the galaxy.  This movie should have been just about the kid (well, he's the main character), who gets an offer to fight the most powerful fighter in the universe.  Instead, this kid is kidnapped, tortured, raped, humiliated, and killed, and the main characters don't know who to help him when all his friends are dead.    I felt like this movie was just making fun of the entire Star Wars universe. There was never a real fight or a real threat or anything, and while I am familiar with the characters in the films, there are no names on the posters or anything.  They're really just an idea of what the kids can be like, and this idea is so bad that it makes me want to throw it out the window.  The kids look like they came out of the movies, and you could even see a couple of kids in the film, which I really liked.  My only problem was that the director could have made this movie more interesting if he was able to stay away from that horrible concept and focus more on the kid and the other characters.  It is a total waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a little disjointed, doesn't have much humor or charm, and it's very predictable.  This is an old "D-Day" movie but it feels like an old Disney movie.   They play this war movie in this weird way and it doesn't really make any sense at all.  The movie's story:    The invasion is a success, but in a surprise attack the Axis forces invade Russia instead of the Allies.  It makes perfect sense to me, but it just doesn't make any kind of sense.    They were supposed to invade this country and make a surprise landing, but instead they went straight to the Russian border.  What kind of a plan is this?  Their next move:    The movie starts with the Allies trying to get into Russian.  A bunch of people are killed, but they get the Russians to agree to a truce.  The British are about to try to invade again when the Soviets show up.  They don't really do anything until the last half of the movie...  ... but they don't do a lot of fighting.  After that they just do what they're told in their dialogue.  But it's just not fun watching them.  And the movie never really manages to make the invasion even fun.  There's a couple of bad movie moments but nothing really great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie, which I have just finished and can't say I enjoy it, suffers from all the problems of a bad, boring, long movie: It does not take any chances and goes for big stunts to fill its two-hours runtime. The special effects, which in previous movies were often impressive, in this one are downright pathetic, as a plane or spaceship is only shot up in the air. If the film's premise is so great, why is it lacking so much character? I can't tell you how many times I wanted to laugh, but there wasn't even enough laughs in the film to do it. Why is it this dull?   There are many movies I would rate much lower, but this has no redeeming features.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First, what the hell is this movie? It looks a lot like the old western films: good acting, lots of gunplay, lots and lots of "shoot first, ask questions later"... except for one thing: the gunplay. You will see how good some of them are, how bad some of their accuracy is. They're even in slow motion.   I guess I could see how it might play with some people: a good western with a bit of horror (I don't get the "curses" and "blood"), and a touch of satire (one of the guys has an eye infection that looks like "a case of the flu" - a joke, I know). But even on the last day, I found it a bit too long: the story goes on for too long and the jokes are a little too obvious.   the performances are all above average. The lead is fine. He's no Dick Miller, but he does his job. The other guys, though...... just look like cardboard cutouts. Not even Dick Miller could play like that. Not to mention the fact that there are some really boring set pieces.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time I saw it, I almost didn't see it, like I had seen something in a bad science fiction movie where a female alien took over a spaceship and became the "superior" one. When I found out what it was like, I was intrigued by the story and it did well to set the mood for the rest of the movie: it seemed to be more like a low budget, "sci-fi" TV show and not too much of the "alien invasion" and other things that would have made more of a splash on the screen had they been done properly. The special effects weren't spectacular, they did not give us a close up view of the alien but you could see her from afar and there were plenty of shots and angles to show her, which would have given more than enough to a TV series. The alien, though somewhat "dumb" and somewhat naive, could have been a good role model for the young one. The aliens on Earth are still very ignorant and "not in touch with reality". I really liked the film and its director and I hope it's a big hit on the DVD. I gave the rating only one star because the movie did get a good review from "Duck" who I believe to be a real science fiction fan.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â I am in love with the music, the colors, and the characters and this movie is not about anything. It is about the family that has had a house in Oregon for 20 years with a teenage son. It has no personality and very little plot. The movie is a horror movie and that is about it. I did enjoy it so much that I saw it over the weekend before the premiere at The Hollywood Repertory Theater. Â Â
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a very bad movie. A bunch of white guys play out a very boring and lame "Bible Story". The story line is completely nonsensical. The movie is in a silly voice that seems to come from a comic book. The only funny thing is the white kids talking over one another. What makes this movie bad is the poor acting and the bad writing. This movie was filmed and directed by a white guy. That doesn't give it any value. This isn't good enough to show how good the Bible actually is. It's very bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If anyone says that this is not a horror movie or a gothic movie, they are absolutely wrong and you should have listened to them.   This movie is completely unnecessary, which you can see from its title, but I still watched it for the ending credits sequence.  I loved all of the people I worked with and enjoyed the movie quite a bit, but my opinion of this movie changed once the credits rolled and I knew this wasn't the film that I wanted to see.    I think the reason for the movie ending so abruptly was probably a combination of the director's lack of experience working in this type of medium, as well as the script being rushed.  In addition, the characters that were supposed to be so interesting and sinister in the beginning became quite boring in the end.  If you are a horror film fan and want a good scare but don't want to be disappointed, then this movie is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________ A simple story about a boy and a cat playing by the river bank. I don't believe this was written by a girl. ______________________________________ A beautiful story with many strange scenes. This film is a simple story where a kid goes to town and gets lost in a strange place. It is very strange when he finds the cat. He has a dream where a mysterious lady and a beautiful face appear in his dreams. After that they are never seen again. This short film is very cute and cute with a lot of strange dreams. I really wanted to see that girl again. She was also a girl! I would have liked to be her friend but she disappeared before my eyes!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a good fan of "Willy Wonka".  It starts off as an enjoyable watch, but after 10 episodes I grew bored and couldn't keep my eyes open to the end.   Even the bad jokes had the ability to ruin the movie for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know how anyone thought this movie was going to be good. If you are at all a sci-fi geek, you know the basic premise. The story is about three people, in a time when mankind has spread to Mars. Two are scientists working on a colony there, and the third is a military man working in a base on the planet. The two groups meet in a bar, and after a fight between the two sides, one side is able to kill the other. Now this is the point where I really started looking at the movie as if it was a bad joke. This movie really should have never been made. There is no logic to this movie, it is like a slapstick comedy. I'm not saying that the acting was bad, there were some very funny parts. I felt the humor was a little over-the-top, and that was a big problem for me. The acting in this movie is not bad and this is not a bad comedy, but I can't find any joy to it. This is a sad film that will leave you with a feeling of hopelessness.  So yeah, the premise is terrible. I guess this is kind of a parody, but the film takes that idea and runs with it. It was made to promote an action/sci-fi franchise (called Terminator) that has been in development for many years. The movie is so bad that it's entertaining in the sense that it gets people talking. It has its moments. I liked the character of the scientist. However, there are so many flaws that make it a bad satire. The director is clearly taking all the credit in the movie for himself. There seems to be no interest from the rest of the cast in the role. There was one funny part where the actor that plays the character is wearing a baseball uniform, so it is obvious he's a character from the movie. There are several scenes where the aliens attack and humans try to fight back. It is an awful scene, and it makes you wonder if the characters even know they're in a parody. It may be a joke, but that isn't funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One would think the cast were chosen and vetted for their ability to perform and deliver lines with the requisite poise and skill. Well, we have the opposite. While most of the dialogue, even those of "real" people, sounds a bit stilted, one line stands out above the rest: "I'm sorry for the mess! Oh, it's just that the weather was good and there were a couple of things that were floating in the pool!"  Aaaaah-oh, it is not as bad as it seems. I'm sorry, how did you think I would like to see it? No, this isn't a movie about the poor, the marginalized or the outcast. This is a movie that looks a lot like a cheap and shoddy horror flick, about as far removed as you can get from a "happily ever after" ending (or is it a "happy ending") as it depicts a group of teens swimming in a lake filled with a sea of "lakes" - lakes of blood and water.  At least the characters in this movie are not a bunch of obnoxious geeks. They are rather dull, unimaginative people, who seem to be more of a hindrance than a help at times. I found this to be a very odd choice as an antagonist - not exactly a villain and not really a character either.  I have to admit, at first this movie reminded me of a cross between an Indiana Jones movie and a cheap horror flick.  This movie was "frightening" in a different way to most of its brethren. It made me feel "off" about the world around me.  Some things were more real than others and there is nothing more annoying than having to look up words and sentences every time you read them. I suppose this movie's greatest strength is that it is so cheap and "cheesy" and you know it.  It was like a horror movie made in the '90s - I thought it was so cheesy!  I wouldn't recommend this movie to the people who enjoy "truly bad" horror (which most of you will) unless you like to stay up late at night for "too long" and watch "too many" horror films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole movie is a set up for another great movie called B.A.D.: The Ballistic Assault Dog. It starts with a scene where a little bitty dog named B.D. gets his nose cut off. He is carried out on a stretcher and his owner has to get him surgery at a hospital. This movie starts with two little dogs who both have been mutilated in the same way, B.C. and B.S.B. This is how they got the name Ballistic Assault Dogs. The first scene shows a nurse giving an injection to B.B who turns out to be a bad little bastard. The owner's wife and the wife's boyfriend are in a fight in the kitchen. This guy's girlfriend has also been shot in the leg and is dying. B.G. is at the door to the bedroom and is very quiet. He doesn't do any more than look at his owner from time to time while his owner tries to calm B.K. The doctor enters the room and begins to perform the operation. BK. starts to whimper and wag his tail, but B.W. doesn't care for the pain and says, "I need to see a doctor about my nose!" This is the first I've heard a dog wag its tail in a movie. It's funny to see dogs fighting in the house, but it's also disturbing. It shows the owners wife and friends at the bar and they are just talking to themselves, not paying attention to what is happening on the house. BOWLING IN THE DIRT A B.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a really bad movie.  The acting is bad.    I'm not saying this is bad, but it has something really annoying about it.  The character of the daughter (I hope you got the joke) was really annoying.  She was like "This is your dad's favourite film, and he's going to die at the end."   She just keeps saying her father is a hero and then she dies at the hands of the guy who saved the world.  That was so bad I almost wanted to scream.  I think it might have been in one of those old horror flicks like "The Vanishing."  It's really bad, and I don't think it was directed well.  It was really shot as if it were from the future.  A lot of people have said it was kind of like "C.H.U.D."  There was a lot of sci-fi and technology in it but it was really done like a movie from the 1970s.  And the soundtrack is really bad. So, it's a bad bad bad movie that wasn't a bad film to begin with. It really isn't a great movie at all.  If you are just looking for a "good" sci-fic with a lot to see about the future then look no further. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I am a fan of John Landis' work, his films have an obvious horror element but are very funny and the characters are all fantastic in their own distinctive ways. The whole of the movie is very good and entertaining and, while the acting may be a tad cliched at times, the story is well-told and cleverly structured, making the character and the events come alive like some kind of fever dream. I would give the film a 7/10"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My girlfriend has been to this place before and it's the same old story. We're walking back from a party and all of a sudden we find ourselves in a forest surrounded by mountains. It just doesn't feel right. There are no signs of life to be seen. Then we're dropped into a cave- I'm expecting a nice place to sleep but I'm pretty sure we were not welcome.   A bunch of monsters have taken the place of men and have trapped the girls in their cave. They'll stop at nothing until they are sure we've all been eaten and then they'll come for us.  :)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a bad-movie with some really ugly moments... I really think if you get a bad head of the whole series (like many people do) you would have been bored by this movie... the main character does nothing but get pissed off. I think maybe the writer did it so that the whole of the family gets to be angry all the time. The kids are just mean, the adults are just stupid, the wife is just not smart at all, and the kids, they're not too bad, but I could do without them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason why I gave this movie a negative rating is the poor acting by the cast.  It seems that they've not gone for their best effort yet, even though they have an all-star cast. They are all too obviously and uncreatively written as actors, not to mention the story.  The story does have a great feel, but the writing is bad, poor and it's always a waste of time to sit through this movie.   This movie, like everything in this movie, has poor acting, very poor writing and some seriously cheesy dialog which could have come from a sitcom.  This has one thing going for it, though, and that's the sound track by John Barry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A really awful, awful, and not to be missed movie. A pretty nice, beautiful, charming, interesting and fun movie about a little town. We have a young girl named Linda (Linda Martin), who is having problems with her father, her step-mother who is dying, her mother who is crazy and very, very rich, her father who is a bully, her uncle who is sick and doesn't help the family, and her sister who is trying to make friends with them. I think the main part of the movie is the family and Linda. You know how in a family everyone has their faults and they all are just like each other. This is why they are all like that but in a very cute way. I really enjoyed this movie. I enjoyed the story and the character development so much. I just wish that the movie had been made more interesting. I liked the little town of Tully but I hated the town. There is nothing much to do and nothing to do that is entertaining. The kids are just kids but I never really liked them. Linda has nothing to offer so I never felt that she was a person. The only character I like is her uncle, I feel that she really like him, so I found him a very nice and interesting character.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is a low point for me. It does not have any of the charm that The Dark Knight had. The story itself is laughable. The movie was written by Gary Ross (from the movie Superman Returns). This film takes a new twist on the Superman story and tries to create a modern day Superman. This film is full of comic relief and no one really gets what Superman is all about.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of my least favourite films, but if you are a fan of the likes of Michael Bay (and I am), you may like this. It's a movie about the worst movie ever made - the original Transformers cartoon - where the original cast (which included the voice of Tom Kenny) were replaced by robots. It was a bit crap, but I like the original characters (especially the voice actors). It just isn't up to the standards of what many think is a blockbuster.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie that's a very boring story about a poor man who's about to be executed.  The story follows a poor couple and the man who was to be killed, who decide to leave his home and work for a wealthy gentleman. And it just...starts...  That all the drama in the world can't save this one. There is no chemistry between the main duo and it does not help that there are a total of 7 people in the movie and one of them being a baby.  Also the ending is a bit odd and a bit too over the top for a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well, the first two thirds of this movie are fairly weak. The opening sequence is interesting and the first half of the movie is pretty much just a standard action movie. It has some decent effects and some interesting action scenes, but the second half of this film just drags on and on. It is extremely boring and repetitive. I found myself becoming tired after each scene, and the movie eventually drags to a close after the main characters have escaped from the villain's hideout. It didn't make me bored to look at it, I was actually mildly amused by the scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have read a lot of reviews that claim "this is a good movie", but in fact it is a lousy movie. There are a few good things I liked about it. It stars an actor known for playing a dour wise-guy (a man of mystery, or so he claims) with a big mustache. A lot of movies of the 1950's featured bald men who wore mustaches, and often played the good doctor/genius. This guy isn't good, but he is charming, and at least a little funny in this short. This story is pretty much about a man who has to deal with a problem that is far more personal than a disease or cancer, as opposed to a death or a family crisis. There were a few scenes where I thought he might have had it, but in the end he is an example of "there is always next year." You might even say that he has a death wish! I would like to know how a man (he seems to be a middle aged man at least) who does not want to die decides to have a heart attack (it was described as a heart explosion), and if it wasn't enough he has to go to a hospital (that is why his heart explodes), and how his wife (the wife that he loves so much...a lady with a heart too, and a wife in spite of his health problems, or was it that he could no longer enjoy the companionship of her husband?...?) who is pretty angry and doesn't accept his death wish? (he is really a heartless man, so what's to stop him from making a "last wish" in order to kill himself, so he won't have to take any more pills?) The ending really had no meaning (after all he would have been able to live a long time in the future) and it didn't make much sense, besides I liked the story, so that's what I will remember. I really hope a good doctor and scientist/scientist can come up with an effective treatment for his heart problem.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a reason why the "The Secret World of Arrietty" is a big name in the world of animated feature film, I'd say:  The voice of the film is one of my faves: a deep and strong British accent that matches the animation perfectly, and is an absolutely perfect voice for the character of Arrieta! If there are two things that this movie has, they would be: a) the music, which makes its way through the whole movie and fits perfectly with the film, a truly catchy theme that only fits the character's voice perfectly, so in the film itself there is nothing wrong with music as far as I'm concerned, but if you listen to the song from it, you'll realise that it sounds like a girl being raped and it's hard not to feel that way about the song!  b) the animation, which is the real star in this film, it's truly wonderful, the character design is the same that made Arrieta popular with the world, but it is done extremely well as far its visual art and animation, the whole film is just a treat for the eyes and a great experience from start to finish! If you have not seen this movie, then it's a must see for any true Arriettor fan, and a wonderful one at that!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how I missed this film. I saw it at the theatre when it was in the original format, but now in its Blu-ray we have a 3-D release, so I knew it would be better. However, I don''t have a problem with the story, the voice acting is good, the special effects are good. I liked it. It's a shame, that I had to wait so long for a good film from the Disney canon.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot: Our heroine is a woman who has lived in a castle for years in the mountains of a Spanish province and is still very young. She is an ordinary woman, until she meets a prince, named Miguel, who is also a woman and seems to have some mysterious power. The plot of the movie is nothing new, the way we get there is. We see some crazy stuff happening around her. There is some sex happening, some magic, and then we cut to the Prince, who starts to talk about her. Then the prince gets drunk and has some sort of seizure. He gets the girl and her two friends to stay in the castle for a while, which is like a normal thing to do, but a little strange. They do not want to be there and they do not know how to get out. Eventually they do, and when they do they get their stuff back and leave, and we have a little girl in a weird castle. Now this movie is not bad, but the way they do things is a bit odd. It doesn't really connect with the rest of the plot, and it feels out of place and out of time. I mean this movie was made in Spain, which means it's dated by now, and the princess who is the main character is only 11 or so! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film with great potential.  The story has some great visuals and the performances by the two leads are aces.      However, the story has a few problems.     One is that the movie begins with a scene in which two children in the family get their heads beat up by the boy's father (in a flashback) because of a disagreement on a trivial matter.    This flashback is actually interesting and shows how the family views the son's new neighbor, a woman (who is also beaten up by her husband).  They are seen to be quite jealous of her husband's relationship with the daughter.     Yet, we never see the son. �� �� I was interested to see where this story could have gone. ��� It could easily have been an interesting piece of dramatic drama, but the movie doesn't do much to develop the characters. Â  Instead, it takes them from one situation to another, and while it keeps the movie interesting, the result is that it is very one-sided and unsatisfying. � ��� �� The film ends with a happy ending where the two sons have a new neighbor. ���� That is all I can say about this movie.  ����

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are several good movies in this film: "Innocence Lost" is the first that comes to mind. This is a very good movie. However, it is one of the worst films I ever saw:  It makes me think about how far we have come. I love sci-fi, but "Innerspace" just is not an intelligent film. When the first space ship goes through a wormhole that goes up, out, up, down, down again, and it goes through so many times, it's like "oh it's a worm-hole, it goes up and down...and again...and so on." I'm sure this is very clever, but it's really very dumb. When it goes on a planet it looks like something you would see in the moon's reflection on the water. I never understand why they couldn't just make a movie from the first 10 minutes. The special effects are awful. It is like watching a television show. I don't understand why one would need to pay $100,000 to get in a spaceship that has no atmosphere, when the only way to live in space is to go through a bubble-gum tube on a space station. I'll give it a 9 on the bad side.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You know what? I've never seen a movie so awful that it's impossible to like anything in it.  In one scene, a guy with a beard who could pass for a young James Dean, does an interview with a woman he has kidnapped from his own show. She's a high-strung, high-maintenance beauty with an accent. What the hell did we get ourselves into here? The rest of the movie is just as bad.  I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie if you have a weak stomach.  This is a film about a rich Hollywood producer who finds out a guy in a TV show is being kidnapped and is planning a crime that will end up killing the producer himself. When the kidnapper (played by an actor dressed as a woman) gets into a bar and tells her he wants to talk about it, she's so nervous she asks him to leave, and he does, leaving her to think "How does he know my name?" I'm guessing the producer has a thing for her or something... The ending of this picture is the saddest thing I've ever seen in my life. It was so bad I almost turned the video off. It just ends like a horrible joke.  The ending shows how weak a man he is. He was just having the most normal conversation with his female producer girlfriend... She didn't think he was going to get kidnapped by a guy dressed up in a woman's costume... A film this bad could at least have an ending that makes sense and makes you want to see what happens next.  So, that's my story about The Kidnapping. I am really disappointed about this movie. It really took a lot out of me, and I really hate myself for having to watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen quite a few movies since my last viewing of the original, so when I saw the trailer for this, I was surprised that I liked it at all, especially knowing the movie was a remake of a movie I'd seen way back in the 80's. Now there's a lot of bad remakes out there. I know there's plenty out there, but this was certainly up there as one of the worst I've seen. It's a bad time of year in the late 80's with this movie's trailer, so I guess all the kids went back to their parents' homes to spend the holidays watching scary movies, and this movie is a throwback to the old school gothic style of movies. The premise itself is just ridiculous, and I could not believe a movie about a ghost or something living in our home. I thought it was a cheap gimmick for the movie. I don't know why you would put a ghost in your living room on Christmas Eve when that's one of your very few chances to enjoy the holiday. Plus it was only for a couple weeks, so who cares? It was just so obvious that they took an 80's movie, with good actors, and ripped it into a 90's remake. When you compare it to the original movie, it's a completely different movie. The original was a story of a young girl who goes home to find her house empty and a note about a house fire in the garage. It had a lot more going on then this movie has. Even the actors look different, because we're looking at the same actor all over again. The kids all have different looks too. Now in my day, when a kid in a movie looked different, they were the odd one out. Not so much with these kids, especially since this movie was an 80s movie. It was pretty funny, and even made me laugh a couple of times. Unfortunately the film never got any better. The movie would've been better had it not been on Christmas eve, when there's more time to really get something going, I don;t know why they would've done it like this, but it does give you an idea as to how the film could've been a little more interesting. There's a couple funny scenes in the movie, but for the most part it's just a throw back to those cheesy 80's movies. You can't really tell I was in the room and how funny it actually was. I could
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie doesn't have one.  It takes a character who is a total whiner (but not nearly as bad as he thought he'd be) and has him tell everyone he knows how miserable he is.   I mean, this guy is the epitome of a wannabe-whiner and then the film throws him into a crazy situation where he has to try to prove to people that he's a worthy person.  The only problem is that he can't do anything to make people like him...he has to get people to take him seriously like a boss.  This film might have been able to succeed if it had been any good.  There is very little action, there are few funny lines, the humor is very poor...this movie might actually be decent if it wasn't so terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is bad and I can see why it makes a lot of money, but the film doesn't work very well.   One thing that I thought that made this movie work is that it was a remake of the old western, John Wayne's western, 'True Grit'    The remake is very faithful to the original, with just a slight change to the dialogue (most of the dialogue in this movie is in English),   I found it pretty funny to see a western hero (Baron Munchausen) trying to run away,   and then he's captured by the evil,  Walt Disney.  It's not very good:  A good movie would've been one of John Wayne or John Sturges movies,  but this one wasn't much fun.  There were no memorable scenes to make you want to keep watching.  The only highlight of the movie was a scene in the theater where he talks to the audience about how he got the role (he didn't).   Then a scene about him being with the old west characters of the film (there were some other characters as well, but they weren't that memorable).  The last scene of the last half of the story was very sad.  I would recommend this to old west aficionados, but for a western movie it's not that great.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was an absolute joke. Even after spending hours on the internet trying to find out what was going on in it, I still find it unbelievable. I can't imagine how someone could get through the entire thing with a smile on their face. What's even crazier is that the guy who played Peter Pan (Michael Chiklis) did a couple of terrible voices, and they weren't even good ones! I am not trying to be a prick, but this whole movie was one giant mistake. I was a fan of Michael Chikloslis and I really thought he was going to be the next great screen star of our time (as well as the next Peter Pan). However, this is a case of bad timing. Chiklaslis was doing an audition in which he would be called "Michael", then the producers decided to re-shoot the scenes in which I was the same actor, making him a different person. Then they cast somebody else, which is a sure sign of a terrible idea. And then they made a crappy film. And now there is no going back.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "He is the baddest motherfucker you've ever seen."  Yes, I'm not kidding.  I'm telling you now that this is a very bad film that has bad writing, bad acting and bad direction.   I won't go into the plot or characters or anything else, and it really doesn't deserve to be reviewed, but one reason this movie isn't worth your money is because it is very bad.  The movie is basically an over-rated, overproduced "fun comedy" about an all too common group of people: a bunch of white males.  In every scene the group is shown to have a good time, they are dancing, laughing, drinking, and generally having a good old time.  But what makes the movie so bad is how they are treated by their families and their wives.  First of all, they constantly talk about how they want a child and they are always talking about "having a family" which sounds like a bad thing and not something a married couple would want.  When their wives start to leave them, the husband is constantly being ignored and insulted by the wife, she thinks her husbands job sucks and is constantly complaining about her job.  After their husbands are killed, their families don't help them, their wives keep trying to get in touch with them and their daughters try to "look after" them.  It's a bit hard to understand how this movie can ever be good.  Even though I enjoyed the movie, I thought the story was bad and the acting was horrible.  One funny thing was when they started to get married I was laughing when some of the guys told his wife he was leaving her.  You can tell that this would have made a great movie but it's just not good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "You know how your parents always want a new TV, a new car, or a new vacation to somewhere foreign, but you always have an aversion to all these things, even when it has nothing to do with you?  Well this movie doesn't make you go the same way.  In fact it shows your parents love for you and how you are doing in school.  And you have the best teachers and a lot of fun in the swimming pool.   "The other kid?"    Well who is he?   He's a young guy who has just arrived at the boarding school. When he starts out he doesn't know anything about how to swim and when he tries to learn he falls in the pool.     The movie is really cute. It has a really simple plot and you can see how cute the two little kids are.  It doesn't get very deep for a children's movie but it is really amusing.  The voice actors for the two kids are good.   Even when the other child is trying to teach him how to do the right thing he is still too innocent.  This movie is a must watch for any kid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish it had a more good movie with some interesting aspects of story, but still in this movie it becomes very dull. There is not any special thing and a very long movie with very similar plot, but it all feel same. The acting isn't anything special. The whole movie feels same. I recommend to watch a movie if you are a fan of bad movies and want to see them being made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First time I watched a movie from Troma and I've had a feeling that this movie will do that "old-school" thing. Very cheesy, super stupid, and it made me laugh like it was a bad comic from another country (like a Troma comic with a bad-ass German). The characters are so-so. They are all so-and-so and nothing ever happens to them. I don't like the German actors. Most of them are very flat. The German characters have the kind of accents that you expect from the mid-80's. They all speak gibberish, and the Germans sound like they all were made up by some sort of machine. If you like cheesy 80's comedies, you might like this film. If not, you are probably going to hate it and not enjoy it at all.  The acting is also a bit cliche and overacted. The whole movie is so cheesy that most of the acting is just bad. And I do not like cheesiness. If anything, I like old-time 80's style acting like Don Knotts or Steve Buscemi. I thought about doing the Troma movie "Nightmare" but it turned out to be boring. I think the first one was ok but it just does not have enough style to make it a successful one. , 3.5 out of 5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Curse my heart.   I saw this for $20 (I don't know what to think about that deal) and was under the impression that this movie was a big blockbuster that people went to see to see the new Jason Statham movie.  I had been waiting months to see Jason Staus' Statham.    I was ready to believe that this new movie would be much better than the previous movie. It wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really wanted to like this film. As a kid, I loved the original Star Wars trilogy. I loved that Darth Vader was so menacing and dark. I really liked how Obi Wan Kenobi was so smart, but the film kind of lost me. Obi Wan's character was an annoying jerk that I hated. The whole thing took place in a desert (with a big Star Wars/Sonic theme), and the desert was basically the biggest wasteland in the world. I don't think this was the last time I'd see Obi Wan and Luke do this: http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y147/JohnDV201/Starwars1.jpg. I just don't see a way the movie could have been better.   The movie really needed a good writer to get things moving, because the plot was almost non existent in my opinion. The one good thing about the movie is that Luke does get a chance to grow. As his skills get better, he becomes a lot better as a Jedi. That being said, I didn't feel like it would have ever worked. There were too many bad characters in this movie (I'm not trying to pick on Obi Wan here. Obi WAN WAS A REALLY WEIRD CHARACTER. I'd love to hear his side of the story, but I would also like to know if he knew about Luke's parents growing up, and why the Jedi Council wasn't formed until AFTER Obi Wan trained Luke!) If I had any negative things about the film, it would be a couple of things about Obi Wan being a jerk. I know Luke would have killed him if he ever saw him. Anyway, I thought Obi Wan was sort of funny during the first half of the film. I think the writing and acting by John Hurt were perfect. The problem was that the third act was completely over done and the ending was totally pointless.  : )

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film that started it all.   As soon as I saw this movie, my mind raced thinking that the title would sound like an insult to the poor people of America.  To think that a movie that could get a rating of an A- was released in 1980 as a "Hollywood Western" was a great insult to all the people who made the movies we love today.  What are you doing with your life? You have to be a big fat idiot to enjoy this movie.  The plot is about a group of outlaws who are trying to cross the border into Mexico. Unfortunately, they do not even try to take a few days to make their trip; they just run around like fools trying to get by the law in the middle of a beautiful meander of the Rio Grande.  I have not been able to find out what they do when they leave this area, so I cannot even guess what they are like. However, in that same picture, I see that the men are dressed very well.  It seems that they are the only men that have the strength and courage to face the law.  But I must ask you one thing... do you know what a good Western is supposed to look like? If not, then I suggest that you stop watching this movie and learn to be more educated.  This movie is bad.  Why?  The first 20 minutes are almost worthless. The first half is about the criminals making up stories to keep from getting caught.  After they make the first mistake, they are arrested, and they spend some time in jail, before being allowed out on bond.  Then, in the second half, they get into a fight with a man who is also a lawyer who is trying to stop them from leaving the country.  They take over a ranch that is still owned by the sheriff, and are going to take the money that the sheriff owes to the Mexican people by killing people, and stealing things.  For what? A good movie?  When you think of the bad movies made in the 20th century, you think about these two films.  Of course, it was made by a good man, and so it must be a good movie. However... there is too much stupid to even mention these two bad movies.  You have one actor playing his "role" and doing as he pleases.  There are people in the audience who are supposed to be enjoying the movie, but instead,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I haven't seen all of them, and this one is pretty bad.  That's what really gets to me about these movies.  It starts off OK, the story is pretty good and all the cast look really good!   Then, the action scene was a little too violent (and scary) for some people (even though this is a horror movie, not a gorefest).  But, I'm not so sure about the whole alien, and a whole human race thing...    The main character had to wear a mask that was so small that it was almost to small to fit over his whole face.  I had to pull it out of his mouth once!   In the end, he was a complete mess.   I thought he was supposed to be an all American good guy... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had read about this film in the New York Times a month or so ago and I was surprised to see it on the big screen. I suppose a film like this should be hard to make, but in my view, it's not a bad one.  It's certainly not a masterpiece, but it gets a bit boring after a while.  The cinematography is quite nice and the editing is rather good. The actors are good but this is a bit of a downer so if you're a fan of the genre I wouldn't watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   ... I guess that the filmmakers had a very good idea at least for a Hollywood version of a B movie, but the result is only a complete mess. In a way it is a movie with an evil genius at its heart but even more a movie like something from a science fiction novel. The plot is a mixture of a modern science fiction film with a B-movie feel. A group of scientists try to produce a virus to stop wars. It's all quite simple except that they all start to talk like a bunch of bigoted racist sods. What happens after that is not something you can see coming. At times the special effects are great, the special actors are great. But the plot is so convoluted and stupid that you would expect the movie to end with someone punching the villain. The villains seem to be the only ones who understand the concept of science. All the scientists appear to be stupid and ignorant. The only "science" they produce is "a magic" that can "make you think" and "make it possible to do any kind of thing". This magic is so magical that its use has no use or purpose. Instead it merely makes "a difference in a person" by allowing "an invisible" thing to act like an "intelligent" creature and then it becomes more than this invisible being. Then there is a big "magic" machine called the "Owl" which was actually created by the evil scientist of the movie. It can "open" its eyes at will which enables its evil actions by forcing "people" to "see" what it wants them to see. The movie ends by a scene that doesn't even make sense, a robot "wakes up" in a hotel and it turns out that the only thing that is really there is the evil villain's head.   I had to watch this movie with a straight face at one point when the robot robot wakes up. This is a typical movie in which everything makes sense at the end of the film. A film so boring that I had forgotten that the movie was a B film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not your typical animated movie that tries to appeal to children.   It takes a lot of effort to make you understand the story.  It's just a very simple story and at that, very poor.  If the animation had been better, it would have been a great animation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe I just watched another lousy remake of a bad novel.  This movie should be called  Carnival Games  (originally published in 1904) for that's exactly what they are.  The film's story involves three boys playing carnival games with live animals.  They win prizes from other boys' games, and they then spend a night at the fair.  I don't think you've ever had as miserable a night as this!  It's awful!  I'd much rather see a circus performance about a clown and his friend getting a date than watch this! This is the kind of film where the lead actor gets on a soapbox and talks a lot of trash about how he feels like he's in his father's shadow, when his actual father was a millionaire and he had so much money that his mother would have thought he was a billionaire by now.   This movie reminds me a lot about the original and what it would have been like to make a movie about it. The only good thing about this movie is it has a funny ending, which I am told is pretty much in line with the book.  You can watch this movie on video on YouTube, but I think it would be better to watch it in its entirety on a DVD.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the kind of movie that just makes you want to take a shower and then watch it with a large straw. The entire thing feels like a joke, not only do you have a series of really bad actors playing characters who do little more than yell stupid things at the camera, you get a cast of mostly terrible performers who play everything as a joke in an attempt to get some laughs. And that isn't even getting started on the characters themselves:  - The first woman you meet is a very uninspiring character. She is dressed in a way that just screams "sexpot" and has almost no lines. A few scenes later, we have her in full costume and she is played by the same actress, yet she is somehow worse. This woman is not only uninspirational, she's even quite unpleasant. It's as if someone who had recently lost their job in a fast food chain was hired to be the "sexpots" character. And of course, you can't tell anything about her. She's either talking to herself, staring at a wall, or doing her best impression of a fat woman with a flat ass. It was a huge laugh at least 10 years ago.  – The guy who owns the bar is a joke. The only reason he's even in the movie is because he's the one that "owns" the bar. If the actors did a good enough job, he wouldn't be in the film at all. So he isn't in the bar until we see that the guys he's with have taken his wallet, the reason why he even shows up. What a waste. He should have never been cast. He's a piece of shit who is only in the story for the sake of being in the scene. If a director would have cast somebody like George Carlin instead of a man who's supposed to have a brain, then the rest of the movie would have been much more effective. This is not to say Carlin wasn't a good actor, but his only purpose in the whole movie was to be in a scene where he yells things at people and he's barely in the middle of it.  (hide spoiler)  It was a movie that made me uncomfortable just watching it. It made me feel like I had been made to watch it, like I'd been made an involuntary participant in a bizarre game. This wasn't meant to be a critique of the script, but a critique on
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing I found out in the first 10 minutes is that this movie was made with only one set of actors in mind.   Well, the movie looks pretty bad, doesn't it?  I mean, it's supposed to be like a "lost film" - a lost film from 1950 that somehow got made again.  And I guess it's not bad per se.  In fact, at least it is better than most of the movies I found recently.  However, the acting is a major flaw in this movie, the same can be said for its acting in a film by the same director.  Not only the actors are bad, but the script was also bad (and I'm not complaining because this was a very poor movie).   As to the acting, this film lacks acting talent.  I guess this was made by two men who had very little experience in making movies.  Well...  The plot was not bad at all...   But that's about it.  Oh, and a big thanks to the director!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ As you all know, one of the best movies of all time is "The Exorcist". But there are some things that makes this movie so sad and awful. The movie is very slow at the start. And the reason it is slow is because the movie is telling the story of a young girl named Anneliese Michel, who just got married. At first, Annelie thinks she is having a great time at her wedding to a great man named Count Charming and they are having a really nice, happy time. But it doesn't last long because something goes wrong at their wedding. And when the story starts moving, it gets very bad. It starts off with Count Chancy getting drunk and then having sex with the maid of the house. It was too much for her to take the story with this part. Because once the man gets drunk and starts having sex, he does not seem like the kind of guy that he is. He is all over the place and totally drunk. And then, the maid tells Chancy that he just wanted to have a little fun, but she was in a position that she just needed to keep quiet. This way, Chancy knew she could get away with it because he was a man that he could just lie and say that he only wanted to fuck her. And this was the man that she was marrying. Well, that is a terrible thing to do, but that is what it is. But what really happens is that Chancy was going to die, but not before he made this promise. And that was that he was going for an exorcism. He was going on his search for the demon that had been haunting him ever since he had first met the poor girl. And as he was searching, he found that the whole house was covered in scratches and bruises. Well I can see you all thinking that it is just some kid playing around, but this is a grown man that is going around doing this. And once he has found the demon, he tells the girl that he has a bad feeling that something bad will happen to her because of this. So the girl does as Chancy says and she was supposed to be killed in a gas chamber. But she escaped, just in time. After finding that out, Chancer has a long conversation with the guy who had been the girl's maid, the priest, and the girl in a prison. Well what he had to say about it is that the girl was

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not bad, but not much to write about. About:  Set on an unnamed planet in the far-off future, the film follows a pair of former spacefaring criminals as they plot a heist on a starship that will restore them to the glory of their old lives, while bringing the planet to its knees.  The film is mostly set in a very grim dystopian future.  It follows a two-man team of space pirates who travel the galaxy in their ship, the Red Death, to steal treasure and find a cure for a disease that has taken over the entire human race.  The first part of the film establishes that the film is set in the very distant future. It features dark and dismal skies and a bleak world where there is a constant battle for survival.  There is no major conflict in the story, as the two characters take a trip through space in their stolen starship.  One of the two heroes,  Vy'keen, who is a giant red beast, is the leader of the pirates. He has a very intimidating appearance, so the human characters are very scared of him. His crew is led by his assistant, Korva, who looks like an animal.   In the first act the two pirates are attacked by the crew of a human spaceship, the Dyson.   The two heroes fight their way out of the space pirates' ship, before eventually being confronted by Vy'm'keens.   The fight is over in a few moments, but the Dronians destroy the ship, leaving the two space pirates with no means to get off planet.  These two space criminals quickly make a deal with the Drones. Vy'skeens will find a way to repair the crew's ship, which is used to patrol the galaxy, but with the help of a few Drones and a couple of friendly Drones, will be able to travel through space without attracting unwanted attention.  While the plot to repair their ship is good, the rest of the story seems to come out of nowhere. I am really not sure what happened in this film. I think it had some promise, but it was completely over before it was even supposed to begin.  Not a bad picture, but a film that has a lot going for it, but none of it is really worth the effort.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My father died 2 weeks before the film was released so we couldn't go to the screening. I wanted to go but had to wait until my dad was gone to watch it. I was very disappointed that the film wasn't better. I guess this film was made for the Chinese market. The Chinese market doesn't want to watch Chinese movies, so these are a few from there, but they aren't good.  Karaoke with a bunch of barmaids: This review is very long, but it's really not my style so I'm going to just throw it in there and say, don't watch this movie. I wouldn't recommend this, except if you love the karaoke scene with the barmaiden. Not going to spoil the bromance but we all know it's gonna be a long film. It looks like a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "You want to hear about my time on the road with the good old Boy Scouts and my travels with the Scouts of the American Renaissance? You want to know the story of how I met one of the most charming and intelligent girls I have ever known?" This is one of my favorite Scout stories. This is an adventure story. It is a Boy Scout adventure. It takes us to Russia and a whole host of other places around the globe. It also deals with the question: "Why is good so darn bad?" Boy Scout's travel to the world. They don't do this with the same sort of enthusiasm as my own Boy Scouts do. They think it's a matter of national security. They look at the world and see things they wish they'd seen. What they don't see is what they should not see; the ugly, the dirty, the sad, the pathetic. This can be one of those interesting stories where we learn the good, the bad, and the ugly in human nature. The best part is: The best is yet to come in our Boy Scout experience. A few of my best memories from my youth include the times when I went to the Boy Scouts of America (BSO) Annual meeting at the Grand Hotel in Los Angeles. I was a member of the Sorell Scouts and went on a two week camping trip. The trip was a success and I was delighted that my mother came with me. She got to know a few of the boys and saw a good time was had by all. This was the first trip to Russia she had ever taken my family on. This experience changed my life forever. I am in awe of our Scouts. I don't know how much more Boy Scouts can teach me about life.  1 of 1 people found the following review helpful:  , January 30, 2014  As a boy of nine, I can still recite it verbatim. This movie, however, was a complete disappointment for me; the acting is terrible and the script is a hack. There's a whole lot of talk and little to no action. The Scoutmaster is a complete dickhead who makes the Scouts seem like an oppressive group of people who are too stupid to know what they're doing. There was one Scout in particular that I found to be incredibly annoying. I can't say more than that other than this movie is a waste of money and time. At least if you watch it on Youtube you'll get
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ "The thing that sticks in my mind when I think of my father's death is how he was like no one else. I remember one of his stories about a man who wanted a piece of cake to help him feel better after a bad day. His dream was to get a piece that had "taste" to it. The way he explained it to me was he had seen a little girl in a restaurant whose cake was actually a piece wrapped up in chocolate and some of her name was written on it in big black letters. The man was a little sad about that because he always felt a little sorry for people that felt like they didn't have good enough food to eat. After a few visits with his mother and his daughter, his taste for a good meal started to build up and the little girl was finally able to give him a piece with a smile. ____________________________________________________________________ This movie is full of the usual cheesy melodramatics and over-the-top over the top dialogue. This kind of stuff never gets old for me, I love it! _____________________________________________________________________ It is an extremely cheesy story with one of the most generic names ever given, it just reads like this would happen every night... ______________________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world full of vampires, werewolves, and monsters, a new breed of "supernatural" human is in high demand: the Supernatural Human, a special sort of human born into the "superhuman" society of a vampire clan. The family's only child is a talented, intelligent young man named David, and when the clan's patriarch dies, it falls to David to take over. But when a vampiric invasion forces the Supernormal Humans to deal with a terrible new threat, David learns that not everyone is as sweet and friendly as they seem, and the war for the family means no sleep for him. The film was quite well made and the production values were high, but in the end, this movie does not hold a candle to the previous one: it is too long and too predictable (a little too much so for my tastes). The only good thing about it is that it has a fun supernatural storyline (which is always a plus for a vampire story, not to say that vampires aren't always funny, but this film does not have the same depth and comedy that the previous vampire films had), but in this case it is overshadowed by the poor writing (not that this matters, it is a vampire film...), the boring vampire, and all the other stuff that is a staple in all of the vampire stories and that one really didn't need to do the film any justice.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie ever made. The writer of this movie is a great liar. No matter what his characters say they say a lie. The only thing the movie did not do was make fun of his own characters. The characters were just as worthless as the writer. It was obvious from the start that the movie was going to be about a gay boy being tortured by his family. The movie has an original title (The Boy In The Dress), but it is not really funny. I think that it is a pity that the writer does not try to have a good story. In the end it is just a bunch of lies and a poor showing in a film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did not know it would be this bad. I know this because my sister told me what to expect. It's almost funny when someone tells you what you should expect. That's not good. First off, the opening credits, even if a little on the boring side, don't bother me. The only reason this movie is good is because of the movie itself. It is an old story and the first half is just about a rich guy who just wants to get rid of his old servant, so he sells him a car and the girl who he loves is driving the car (if you are a fan of old car chases you'll love this movie. I liked the guy too.) It's a good story and a classic. You won't be disappointed with what you're going to see in this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was pretty excited about this film due to the strong cast. The acting was well done, with a few good laughs in there, and some interesting scenes. The problem with the film was that it took a rather odd route to the ending (which was a good sign) and the character who was there seemed rather flat. There was only one real character and he didn't have much to say, if any at all, and he wasn't particularly compelling. I would have liked to see more of the other actors, especially if the plot had been handled a bit more intelligently, and the ending more satisfyingly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I've seen since  Gone Girl. It's really just a cheap comedy, full of bad acting, cheesy jokes, cheesy dialogue, and no plot. I mean, it has one scene where an elderly widow is waiting in line to get a life size cutout of a movie star and a little later she gets in a car and proceeds to drive to Los Angeles. Now, I'd say it has some charm, even if it did take some weird liberties with reality. A friend of mine was just saying how they should have let the car take her around instead of putting her in a trailer and dropping her off at the beach. But, I wouldn't take my friend's advice seriously.  Here is one that didn't make it to L.A.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie based on a book called "In a Perfect World" by Paul Theroux which is a book that has had nothing but bad luck. In this movie I expected a very funny movie that I could see myself laughing and feeling a lot of fun at the same time, unfortunately that wasn't the case. The story has many characters, all of which are quite boring. Most of the actors who play them are fairly bad, most of them seem to be just there so that there can be a good story to tell about in the movie. They are not bad actors, I was even looking forward to the actors and was hoping that they would bring some excitement to the movie, unfortunately it was not to be. There was some good chemistry between the actors, but there wasn't enough of it to make it memorable. I enjoyed the book and enjoyed the movie too, but I am going to have to go look up what it actually is about before I pass out in the fetal position in my bathroom. It was a good movie, I just wished that it would be a little less bland.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You have to hand it to the producers for making a movie where the plot is predictable and where the characters were predictable, but in the film they were all so over the top. I'm not a huge fan of a bad film by a bad writer, and i wouldn't want to get into that movie but it really gets worse as you go along.  The movie is a "tribute" to one of the worst of the 80's "superhero" movies "Superman IV: The Quest For Peace" in the sense that they all have the same type of character - the kind that could be played by any "superheros" on the shelf today - which is a bit odd because the plot of the movie is really not that bad and i'm willing to put the kibosh on this movie even though i'm not an Action type guy at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know what kind of person is this: A writer has a very good idea, a bad idea, the better idea is to make it into a movie.   As for the movie I've never been able to enjoy it.  They are too much like movies from the 1940s and 1950s (i.e. no real suspense or excitement).   They try to get a bit of excitement, which doesn't work.  I think this is a film for the old people with a big mouth.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ The first 5 minutes or so of the film are like watching an old 80's science fiction movie with no music (which is not a bad thing, as it is only 8 mins long). The whole movie is basically just the narrator with his hand over his eyes being transported to the future (which was never mentioned during the story) to find out how the new planet in the solar system looks like. His only job here is to help the humans build their space station and find out why there are a lot of dangerous aliens around them. This movie does a very poor job of explaining anything and the script is nothing to write home about. The only story it presents is a guy who gets his hand burnt by a strange ray and the only way to heal it is to go back in time to get a cure. The problem is this guy gets stuck in the past and never gets to learn about the future. This is the most boring and confusing movie ever. In conclusion this film is just bad. I never liked this movie and I hope someone out there who enjoys 80's sci-fi will give it a miss. I am not sure if this film would have been as good if it had a script and better music. I can't stand 90's sci fi, especially bad 90's science-fiction. I give the movie a 1/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are few people that can give a good review on this movie, however, I do not feel it's a bad film, it just has poor story, no great characters, no good fight scenes.   The movie has almost no story, the movie basically takes place in a village where a village leader is trying to regain the favour of his daughter by fighting various monsters, he encounters a few of them but they all flee before he can attack and kill them, he gets injured and is barely able to hold on to the girl and tries to keep her alive, while doing so he has to face other village leaders, each one is a bad guy that wants his own daughter back. In the end, the hero does get his daughter but by the end of the movie he still has nowhere to go and his daughter is not back, so he decides to just wander aimlessly until he reaches a castle, where a beautiful princess is waiting, they decide to go together to her castle where she is waiting for a lover of hers, but before they enter, they all end up in a room where the princess and her boyfriends are all being killed by a horrible creature.   the heroes are all killed by the same monster, their deaths are very quick, the one that killed them all is even named "King Kong", which is a name that is meant to be taken lightly.   He only eats the dead and makes it into a giant baby that then goes on to kill everyone else. So far I don't know how the guy can get away from the castle, however by the time the movie is finished, he doesn't get away because the princess is pregnant and he has no choice but to make a run for the castle.  .  "How long would you like to live without ever being eaten by a giant monster again?".

I thought it would be a comedy about a group of guys who get trapped in the jungle and have to work together to find their way out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is bad. Not the worst bad movie out there (well not as far as I know) but a movie that had a poor story with poor acting, no actors that I remember and a bad ending. The movie begins with the main character (a bad guy) as an ordinary guy getting his car stolen. It happens almost every movie, but this happens almost in a different way. The bad guy tries to hide in a tree with a shotgun. He finds some kids and goes to the kid's house, the kid gives him the shotgun (I think) and the guy shoots the kid and runs and hides in the trunk of the car. Now the kids go to their house but when they get there they find that the trunk has been replaced by a garbage dumpster.  When the kids get out of the house they notice that the car has been moved in front of a wall. They go to the car and start looking around and they find it moved to a parking garage with the car doors wide open. The kids start talking about the guy who took their car. This is all a set up for the movie. I wish that I could tell you how this movie ends but I cannot.  Posted by A.H. at 11:00 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can appreciate a good story, and it's easy to connect with the "hero" character as he's struggling to save his own life. The setting is not very appealing, but it's not a bad place, it's more that the people in it have nothing and are struggling to survive. I think in this kind of story, one would expect some kind of magic. Well, as it turns out, it turns against them. That's about it. I won't say there is a lot to the story - there is not - but I found the plot very interesting. I don't know how much it was supposed to take place in a day - I guess about an hour, but I was bored out of my mind.   The acting was good - it was not the best, of course, but the best I've seen in a while. I found it quite interesting the way they went from someone in a daze to someone who is not afraid.  .I will never understand the need for a sequel - this was a good movie that should have been more. It was fun to watch - a bit too much for me, but that is a personal thing. I've learned nothing from this film. I'll see "Zorro" on DVD in the near future..
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a terrible movie. In short, it's all about the characters acting bad and being silly. The story of the movie is a bad one with bad acting that doesn't add up. The special effects are poor, the sound effects are cheap, the acting, the voice-over, the character development is just awful. It's not just the actors acting like idiots though - the other side cast seem to be doing the exact same thing they did in The Ring. The music is a disaster, the director is a terrible filmmaker with nothing to recommend him for a comedy but his film being a comedy, that means nothing - he's just a bad filmmaker.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hilarious but lame. The title is right in the first sentence:   I was in love with a man named Adam.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  We met and began our courtship.  We started with a bang...and then we began our lives together.  Adam's father was a famous scientist and Adam's mother was a beautiful scientist and a great woman.  A family with everything.  Adam grew up to be a handsome, charming, and very intelligent man.  He is the inventor of the new world's first computer, a computer that allows you to write poetry by typing in the words of the poet you're writing, and to compose an amazing symphony.  This computer is called  "the Cello.  It makes people sing and dance.  But Adam's genius is not just in creating this miracle instrument, but it also creates a monster...an evil Cello that wants to destroy the world.  And when it comes to the fight to save the world, Adam does what any gentleman would do; he turns into a giant robot (in this world, a robot is a giant human shaped mechanical machine with human legs).  And, you guessed it:  Adam is victorious.  All is right with the world...so long as we can still have sex.  The Cello is defeated.   Adam became my first boyfriend, and I began to care for him.  His father, a famous physicist, who was in charge of all the research of the Cello (the computer) had already made a fortune selling a machine that produces a very high grade alcohol.  Unfortunately, Adam was never born in the time when this alcohol was being distilled.  So this alcohol wasn't the best for him, and Adam would eventually drink it all.  My father had become a drunkard.  No one knows how he died, and it is only thought that it was due to the Cellys' evil plan that Adam was born in such a time.  In his drunken stupor, he died because he drank the Cels' evil alcohol.   Adam and I spent every Saturday together, but we never really got that close.  Like an abusive man, Adam would beat me up.  Then he'd do his best to keep the bruises he made visible, but his own bruises would always get worse and worse, until finally, it would make him want to die.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen some amazing horror movies in my life, and this is the second one I've ever seen. This film has all the elements of a great story: the atmosphere, the characters, the actors and even the music, but they don't make it great. It has a good atmosphere but not too good, the whole thing is like one big cheap Halloween movie, and a movie where a couple get kidnapped by a bunch of ghouls. There is no suspense at all. The actors seem to be trying to be scary, but this just comes across as a bad improv performance. This movie does not make me fear the dark. It makes me laugh and have a good time at the same time.   The story is nothing extraordinary and even when the ending is hinted at at the end, it does not do any of us any good. The acting and the direction by Brian O'Halloran is perfect though. It all makes me look forward to the next week!   Helpful a creepy movie, but it's not very good at all and has little to add to the list of classic horror films.There are a few different scenes that make this movie a little different, but nothing remarkable. This is more of an old fashioned Halloween horror and I really don't like that. It is very much the same thing as the films in the Scream series of films, but I don't think they ever go that far in their horror. There are a handful of interesting characters like the "doctor" and other ghouls, but no character is especially memorable or special. The production values are pretty good, they just have nothing going for them here. The costumes are cheap and the makeup seems to be the same for every single character: it looks like a bad attempt at a gothic style movie. The music is okay, it is not bad but it is probably the weakest part of the film.There is a good creepy atmosphere but it doesn't make the movie very scary. I think a lot of this movie could have been avoided by not having a couple of the performances that don't really get the job done. There isn't much depth to the characters or the plot either, it just sort of progresses like a horror anthology movie. It does a good job at making the audience feel scared but doesn't have enough substance to make it a classic in the same way as the other movies on this list. I would be more inclined to watch this one if I were in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wish my wife could have seen this movie. The woman who is the protagonist has an extremely difficult life. She must be a very poor person, because she lived in a tent, a small and primitive one, without a roof and without the amenities of modern society. The only food she had for one day, was grass and eggs and she had to hunt for them herself. She was extremely poor. After three days, she managed to catch a wild goat and the next day she tried to kill it. She did try. There was blood everywhere and the goat was dead. She had to eat the whole goat by herself and after she finished eating her stomach had not stopped churning out blood. And she had no other food for three days. So she was forced to sleep in the tent during the day and sleep in a cold tent at night, even though she was so hot that she was almost boiling at night. She is still a very sad, depressed, miserable person. I think she would have been a very interesting character and I think that she would be much better served by having made some movies in which she could act rather than living in this wretched life. I feel sorry for her. There is something very sad and pathetic in the way she suffers. I wonder what her life would be like if she had had better opportunities.  Please read my review about The Man Who Wasn't There and see some trailers to get the full idea. I just can't seem to get enough of this movie and will probably see it again soon. In this story, a woman named Annika is brought to the world, but her existence is rather miserable. She lives in a small, primitive home, where she must feed her own family from the day she is born. She and her mother work at a small stall to eat, and their life is a life of hard toil and toil. Annika's father is unable to be present for the birth of her. She cries and cries and doesn't have the energy or the desire to go on. She thinks of ways to escape her life until, one day she comes across a small shack near the road. She looks around the shack for something to eat and when she sees something she thinks is a piece of fish, she knows she has found her "fish" for the day. She eats and has enough to eat to keep herself alive. Then, out of nowhere, she hears her voice. "I hear someone, I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is quite simple and the story has a pretty standard story. But the movie does contain some nice effects.   There is a short part with a girl who was raped by a man and is now a crazy person. In the next part the plot is more advanced and the girl gets married and then she tries to murder her husband. The next part is about a guy whose wife is raped and it turns out that he also rapes his mother.  It's a fun short movie that's about an insane girl who becomes obsessed with a man who is trying to rape her.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked it a lot. Some of the scenes are cheesy and cheesy they are cheesy as hell but they make you enjoy them. I liked all of the characters and the plot line. It's not good but it wasn't bad either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a big disappointment for me. I was not a fan of the movie in the first place because of its story line. The characters seemed weak and unrealistic and had little chemistry between them. I felt the movie was only an attempt to make a Hollywood film with a plot of the main character and the girl he loves and the two of them become trapped in a cabin for reasons that were never explained.   I was expecting some much better stuff from the director and the script was terrible.  So I bought the film hoping for a good story line and I guess I had expectations. I don't think the story will get much better than this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I wish my kid could learn a few things from this movie.   The premise of the movie is a bunch of young guys take it upon themselves to protect the "Lion's Den" from a pack of wild lions. It is not the most original concept (think lion hunting) but at least they take it seriously. The main villain is a giant snake who wants to conquer the den (the movie is very long and the story just goes on forever).   This movie is one long snake attack sequence with bad CGI effects. The movie starts with a snake eating a guy (it is pretty creepy seeing a huge snake come out of his ass) the snake gets captured by some guy, they get the snake back to the den and there they have a big fight with the main villain (it's pretty obvious who the bad guy is) this is not a good idea at all. The snake is a really bad idea. His snake eyes are not moving but some CGI effect shows you what it will do. The monster movie goes on and on with snake fights, giant snake battles, and bad snake effects.  The snake's head is very big and the mouth is small and that looks like a snake should have a smaller head and a bigger mouth. The guy gets a lot of bad scenes (he keeps getting killed by the monster) and he's only used as a body so they can show the fight scene a few times.  And then the movie ends with an extended scene of the giant snake being killed by a girl (not a good movie for kids), it was not really needed (the girl didn't do a good job with the fight), but I guess they were thinking of the older kids in the audience so they kept the snake fight longer for that very reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very bad movie with some nice moments. I found the ending to be a bit rushed, the movie being just a simple tale about a man with bad luck who is taken to the land of the giants. He is very lonely, and when he is given a job to kill a giant with his spear, he must battle a giant that will eat him up! After a lot of time and getting out of the giant's castle, they arrive to a city that just had a giant attack. The giant kills most of the people, and a few survivors hide behind some trees for a while. The people were mostly old people that are very confused about why the giant attacked them.   At this point, the people are starting to realize that this giant is a lot bigger than they thought and it may have more than 100 heads! The giant is so big, the giant will swallow anything in its way!   After a couple of minutes, they manage to get some other people, the girl with red shoes and some people that can fly. There is a very old lady, and she is trying to help the people. The old people are trying to use a piece of rope to get to the giant but all of the ropes are snapped. The poor people get hurt, but it's ok because they all have their rope back.  After all the things that they've been through, the last thing the people do is try to hide to get away from the giant.  But the rope breaks, and it's a little girl that is left behind. There are other giants and they are fighting. One of the bigger ones is eating all of their food, and is eating up the forest. The girl with the red shoes has an apple, but the one that is eating her is not very happy.  And the girl, oh my goodness, the boy does not even want to leave her alone.  It's a very long movie, about 10 minutes long, about 30 minutes total, which is a little long for a little movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To begin with, the movie takes place in a very strange medieval city in which you get a sense of medieval life by watching the lives of a few of the villagers and wandering around its streets. They look more like a medieval fantasy film than a movie like any other. Most scenes take place in the tavern where a bard of the village tells his tales and a very interesting and dramatic scene takes place between a very sad woman and a knight with a mysterious background. It is an excellent film. But it doesn't go beyond the original idea of a man in search of his missing daughter but it goes much further and this is where it becomes a bit like "The Last Samurai". You will have to see it to understand what I mean.   It is about a lonely man who is looking for his missing child who lived in the same neighborhood as him. One day he comes across a castle in a strange location and is forced to fight his way through the many guards and deadly traps, all the while avoiding to fall into the pit where the child is supposed to be and dying trying to rescue her from the evil clutches of the castle. As you know, if you take a picture from the movie in a dark environment, it looks very strange and mysterious. The castle itself is very imposing and has many many weird and different features including weird walls and huge doors that open up into different corridors and rooms. The music is very good and the music is well mixed and has a very eerie and mysterious flavor. I found it very exciting and thrilling and I got a big chill while I was watching it. It was a very scary movie but I am not a big fan of horror so I didn't feel scared and was really impressed by the film's creativity and the acting and even the effects are pretty good. It's definitely one of my favorite movies of all time and definitely one to watch in a darkened room. I recommend it to anyone who likes good, original films that have some original themes and an excellent production and I think I could also recommend it for horror fans like myself.   and there is no doubt in my mind this movie is very unique and not for those who hate weird or bizarre films.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie about a group of guys being picked on by a bunch of girls at a high school dances. In between the guys and the girls is a very stupid film. The movie gets ridiculous pretty quickly and there is no way that a film that is as stupid as this could have ever made it to the big screen. The film starts with a few bad decisions being made. This is where it starts to lose its appeal. The first problem I noticed in the film was a couple of things going on behind the girls and the guy. I've never seen anyone in that part of the scene not make eye contact with the guy or at least try to get a conversation going. It's very awkward. And then there is the girl that's talking with a guy. How the hell does this girl know anything about girls? That's it. It was stupid and embarrassing and I just didn't see the point of this movie any more. I wish I hadn't watched it. Not only was it stupid, it was embarrassing and the worst part was it looked like a cheap porno.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This has some great ideas but no cohesion. The whole setup is very cliche. I liked the idea, it had a lot of potential but I found it too over long, it was more a "man goes into an empty house... and ends up in hell" story than a "hell is in our house" story.  The acting is pretty bad, most of the time the actor isn't even there. And a few times the sound is out of whack. So, a very over long movie with bad acting that is almost impossible to watch. But a lot more fun in the first half where all the action is, and with a more satisfying ending. Just too much crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is one thing to say, "Hey, we went over the same ground a thousand times" with the movie "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace". It is another thing to actually do it.   For me this is a disappointment.  The movie is an action thriller, a pretty good one in fact.  It is a story of a Jedi called Anakin who is about to be called up to the Jedi Council. He is the boy wonder of the galaxy and is very strong willed but he is also in love with the beautiful Padme, a girl of his age. Anakin meets her, she gets his attention, and it appears that things are going their way, although he is going through a period where he is getting a little bit too attached to a friend. That is not a bad thing in and of itself. But it is soon the beginning of the end for this movie. It begins with Anakin and Padme meeting at a party and getting along wonderfully. This is a good thing. This may seem like a nice moment and it is when they first go out and it may even be a fun story to tell. The problem comes about two hours in. They meet again at a bar and the story does not improve. An interesting story is ruined by the fact that we see a whole lot of bad behavior on Anakin's part and he acts like a baby. This character development is so bad that it's not even funny. It is pathetic. I didn't even find it hard to believe that this is an eight year old and that he can act like that. This part of the story just got to be so annoying and I never once thought of the girl. She is not interesting and the reason she is there is so stupid that it is ridiculous. And that is where we go from there. At a bar they get the crap beat out of them by two different men who are very dangerous. They get into a fight and both men get away. Then they go to a seedy bar where they get into an argument. This turns into a brawl that is going nowhere. We are also treated to another sequence of bad character development. Anakins father is also a Jedi and he thinks the two men are Jedi that are bad. We see Anakin getting thrown around like a rag doll by a character called Mace. This doesn't make Anakin look so good after the first minute. He may be young but he should know how to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       ( I'd like to think the ending is justified, but this movie really wasn't. I'm not a big fan of Michael Douglas, nor are most of the cast members, but it would have been more interesting to see how the rest of the movie was made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So, when I first saw The Devil's Rejects, I was a bit disappointed because it seemed like it was an homage to one of my favorite movies, The Exorcist  (I actually went back to watch the scene where the priest is trying to exorcize a child).  The film is a comedy, but it's an extremely cheesy one.  There are so many jokes that you're likely to forget you're in a movie until the credits roll. Â I won't spoil anything but here are the best:  The priest thinks he can save the woman by giving her a gift she can't refuse.  He has a new car, and he doesn't like the looks of it.   After the woman leaves him, the priest has a nervous breakdown.
